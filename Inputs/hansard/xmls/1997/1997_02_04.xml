         That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 31 January 1997, of Senator John Horace Panizza, a Senator for the state of Western Australia since 1987, Opposition Whip in the Senate from 1995 to 1996; and Government Whip in the Senate since 1996, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

         There is, I suppose, a special poignancy when one of our serving colleagues dies and when he goes from our midst on public service, as was the case with John Panizza, who died whilst participating at a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges in Cairns on 31 January.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         John Panizza was born on 24 March 1931 at Southern Cross in Western Australia. He was a farmer and property developer in Western Australia before entering federal politics. He came to the Senate with a very
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          solid background in local government. He had been a councillor of the Yilgarn Shire Council from 1975 to 1987, during which he was Shire President for five years from 1982 to 1987.

         He was a very successful wheat grower. It was often the object of very friendly remark by many colleagues who regularly travelled the distance to Western Australia that, if you fell asleep at the beginning of John's property, you could still have a decent respite, wake up and still be travelling across it. He was very much a man of the soil. He was a person who fought tenaciously for the interests of his state and for the interests of the wheat growers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         John was of very direct and blunt manner. His interventions in the party room were always to the point. They were always prefaced by his saying, `Prime Minister, you ought to understand that they are saying this.' And you were left in no doubt about what they were saying. He always managed to cut through in his contributions in the party room and to push aside a lot of the humbug.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In his maiden speech to the Senate, he referred to his election as a realisation of an ambition that he had had since he was 20 years old. He spoke on the many issues primary industries faced in Western Australia, and he displayed a wide knowledge of these industries, ranging from wheat growing and
         <break page="2" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          meat production to mining, including the gold and diamond industries, to fishing. Above all, he declared his commitment to the needs and concerns of rural Western Australia, to its people and to its industries. He touched on important rural issues such as access to all levels of education by country children and adequate water supply.

         Significantly, John concluded his maiden speech by referring to his Italian parentage and paid special tribute to the hardships, the achievements and the contributions that migrants have made to the building of modern Australia. He was, as I understand, the first person of Italian parentage to be elected to the Australian Senate. His vision of a tolerant united Australian community was not tied up with the obsessions of professional lobbies but, rather, with the down-to&amp;hyphen;earth determination to ensure that all Australians, irrespective of their background, were treated equally.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Throughout his parliamentary career, he never ceased to champion the interests that he entered the Senate to represent. He was a staunch member and active participant in the affairs of the Liberal Party over a long period of time. Along with all the other members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, he played a major role in the resurgence of the Western Australian division at the time of the state election before last and played a major role in the success of the division in the last federal election.

         His efforts on Senate committees were acknowledged on all sides of politics. In his 9&amp;half; years in the Senate he served on numerous committees. At the time of his death, he was a serving member of the Senate Economics References Committee, the House Committee, the Privileges Committee and the Standing Committee for the Selection of Bills as well as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. As I mentioned at the commencement of my remarks, he was in Cairns working on the Privileges Committee at the time of his death.

He threw his heart into what he did in his life. He was a devoted family man. He was a devoted farmer. He was a devoted servant of the Liberal Party. He was proud of his Italian heritage, but he was a 100 per cent lover of the Australian nation, which he served so very well.

          —I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this very sad occasion. I guess most members of this House, particularly Western Australians, can scarcely believe that this has happened, because Senator Panizza, if you knew the man, seemed so indestructible. He seemed so much part of the soil which he tilled; he was as solid and as timeless as the Australian earth itself. That he should die in office is an occasion of very great sadness for us all and

         He was an effective senator representing the interests of many Western Australians. He was an authentic Australian success story of the postwar era. If you look at his background and the sorts of things he did, you begin to understand that there was one unfortunate feature of his life: because he had to struggle so hard, because he had to do so much, he probably arrived at each stage of his public service a little later than would otherwise have been the case; hence we find him in office, at the age of 65, having had a fairly short period of service in the parliament.

         He preceded that with a most extraordinary record of establishing himself in an area of Western Australia which is not easy to establish yourself in. Life out there is always a struggle. The rewards are great if you get it right, but it is always a struggle. He had interests that were broad, not just in the agricultural sector. He developed empathy with his area in the mining industry as well. So his success in business and in farming life was matched by his contribution to public life—long service in local government and then service in this place.

John, it has been said, was a staunch advocate of things Western Australian, things relating to the primary industries of Western Australia and indeed of Australia and matters relating to rural and regional Australia. He was arguably the largest single wheat producer ever to sit in the federal parliament and he took not just an interest in that industry but also an interest in a wide range of primary industries in a dedicated and determined way.

         As the Prime Minister has mentioned, John Panizza, before entering the Senate, gave great service to the local government area around Southern Cross, from which he came, serving as shire president and performing a range of other community activities. His contributions in the Senate were consistent since he entered that place in 1987. He always put forward a very strongly held view and put effort into his comments whether it was in the Senate, in committee meetings or in the joint party room of the Liberal and National parties.

         I have to say to the House that I think Western Australian members of this parliament—be they members of the House of Representatives or be they members of the Senate—carry a particular burden created by the time zone difference and the extra hours spent on aircraft as they travel to and from Canberra and many other places. For instance, Senator Panizza was in Far North Queensland

          with the Privileges Committee when the tragic event occurred. It is a burden; it is one which must tell on their health by degrees.

I am very conscious of that extra burden carried by Western Australian members of this parliament and I really do express my sympathy and that of my wife, Judy, to the Panizza family.

         I make one other point. John Panizza's maiden speech highlighted the fact that he travelled enormous distance in the contest of the Western Australian Senate elections both in 1985, the time he lost by 115 votes, and in 1987. It does take a particular determination to bounce back from a lost campaign in which you just miss out, yet he did that and went forward to take up a seat in the Senate as the son of Italian parents, creating yet another first. In his maiden speech, which the Prime Minister briefly referred to, he said:

         That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 17 January 1997, of the Honourable Charles Robert (Bert) Kelly CMG, a Member of this House for the Division of Wakefield from 1958 to 1977, Deputy Government Whip from 1964 to 1967, Minister for Works from 1967 to 1968, and Minister for the Navy from 1968 to 1969, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

         Bert Kelly, as he was affectionately known by his colleagues and many others, was born on 22 June 1912 at Riverton in South Australia. He was a farmer in South Australia before entering federal politics. He was a member of the South Australian Soil Conservation Committee from 1940 to 1958 and also served on the South Australian Advisory Board of Agriculture.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1951 Bert was awarded a Nuffield Fellowship to study farming in Britain. This was the first time farming fellowships had been awarded in Australia. Although his interest in primary production and in related issues such as soil conservation was to remain with him throughout his subsequent parliamentary career, his overwhelming concern and the single issue which he championed fearlessly and tirelessly in his political life was tariff reduction and free trade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said in the news release that I issued marking his death, no person in the postwar parliamentary period or earlier than that period championed the cause of lower tariffs and free trade ahead of Bert Kelly. Whatever people's views may have been of Bert Kelly's views, he was, in a parliamentary sense, the trailblazer of lower tariffs. The significant thing about Bert Kelly's contribution was that, at the time he began to argue the cause of lower tariffs, it was not a particularly popular line to be taken. The conventional wisdom all round, indeed substantially on both sides of politics, was that it was a good idea to protect Australian industry from outside competition and that, if that imposed some burden on the export industries of Australia, then you compensated for that burden by some direct subsidies to those export industries. Bert

        <para first-indent="16">
         I always found Bert Kelly's speeches entertaining. They were always full of humour. He developed to the full that great Australian art—and it is an art when it is developed effectively to the full—of self-deprecation. He could argue a case with winning humour. His speeches, I found in my experience after I entered parliament, always attracted a good attendance, particularly from government and some of the then opposition backbenchers.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Bert was one of the serving members of parliament who made me, as a member of the contingent of parliamentarians who came in in 1974, particularly welcome. I can remember spending many happy times with Bert and one of his South Australian colleagues Jim Forbes in the bar of Old Parliament House in the months that immediately followed my election. One of the other people who was always there listening to Bert's speeches—and I noticed a bit of rapport developing between him and Bert Kelly—was the then only recently elected member for Moore, John Hyde, who had entered parliament in the same year I had.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Bert was a trailblazer. He wrote a very lively column under the title `Modest Member'. A society was formed in his honour: the Society of Modest Members. Therefore, he did make quite a contribution towards the development of the line of argument that is variously paraded under the description of economic rationalism, dry economics, free trade or whatever description you want to give it.

         This is not an occasion for trying to demonstrate who is right or who is wrong but rather an occasion to honour the fact that ahead of others Bert was prepared to courageously put points of view that a lot of people much senior to him in the government of which he was a backbench member and briefly a frontbench member would have heavily deprecated.

         Bert Kelly was a very earthy man in the best sense of that word. He was awake to anybody who was a humbug. He had a tremendous sense of humour. He concealed from most the deep hurt and disappointments that he felt in relation to his ministerial career. What was remarkable about Bert Kelly, in my experience of members of parliament, was that he spent only a very brief period on the front bench and most of his time on the back bench over quite a long period from 1958 until 1977, when, as a result of a redistribution, he was knocked out of the ring in a preselection contest, if my memory serves me correctly by his fellow South Australian Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles. These things sometimes happen in the best of managed circles. They had a bit of a clash and Bert came out second best. I think he had been spending more time arguing the causes in which he believed than attending to his branches.

         Be that as it may, he continued to argue the cause. He continued to gather followers and devotees. There were many of my friends and acquaintances in the parliamentary Liberal Party in the 1980s who regarded Bert Kelly as some kind of antipodean Adam Smith when it came to the causes that they believed in and the causes that they were arguing.

         He was one of those people who had a capacity to be remembered for the ideas that he championed rather than the particular policies that he implemented. He played a role in not only shifting thinking inside the Liberal Party, which he certainly did—and any member of the Liberal Party who pretends that Bert Kelly did not make a contribution to shifting the thinking inside the party on issues relating to industry protection and to more deregulation and freeing of the economy do not understand the history of debates inside our party—but also in arguing for deregulation and those other policies in the Australian press.

         The Prime Minister referred to his ministerial service—and I know, as a former Minister for Defence, that he was well regarded in the period he was Minister for the Navy. But I do not think he was ever meant to be a minister. If you look at his career, it was obvious that he was one of those people who would come into this place and make the rest of us feel proud to be a member of parliament, because he dealt with our inadequacies. He used the parliament as it was probably meant to be used by private members of parliament at the time of the creation of its mother in the British House of Commons hundreds of years ago. His character, which does not often appear in the Australian parliament, is more akin to those sorts of 19th century figures that we know never did ministerial service—people like Cobden and Bright. Ironically, it was their sorts of issues that in this century he essentially ran on.

         In his first speech to parliament in 1959 Bert Kelly laid down from the very outset what his philosophy was about and took a particular interest in the trade policy area. He recognised the importance of building access to markets for our exporters. In what may be an unusual but accurate picture when viewed from an historical perspective, Bert Kelly, in his first speech, actually praised John McEwen, trade minister, for the work he had completed in developing trade treaties at the time with Japan and Malaya. They were steps in the right direction, and Bert Kelly said:

         Australia would be a much poorer nation if it had not been for the gradual rising influence of the ideas espoused by Bert Kelly and his ability to put them forward in a way which cut through.

         We must not forget his contribution in other areas, however. They extended beyond the area of tariff and trade policy, in which it is not quite correct to say that he was absolutely one way on the issue. Indeed, a letter to the

          offered some further comment on that aspect. He reached out from that to also take up a range of other issues, including rail standardisation across Australia. He joined such people as the former members for Farrer, David Fairbairn and Wal Fife, William Charles Wentworth and, indeed, the Right Hon. Ian Sinclair, the member for New England, in his previous portfolio roles, in helping to facilitate the decisions in tough budgetary circumstance to provide a standard gauge rail connection, particularly between Sydney and Melbourne, subsequently between Sydney and Perth and Sydney and Adelaide, via Broken Hill and Crystal Brook. That was a very good basis which led to the final completion of the standardisation direct between Melbourne and Adelaide.

Don't you come in here and try to assert there is some kind of moral equivalence between you and us! This is the government that is putting in place legislation to ensure the level of deceit practised by you personally will never again occur in Australia.

          —I say in response to the member for Macquarie that it is appropriate at the beginning of a parliamentary year to briefly state the government's priorities. Those priorities include continuing to regard the welfare of families at the centre of economic and social policy making. We intend to build on family tax and private health initiatives already announced, and on parenting education. Of course, we also announced towards the end of last year the launch of the pilot homeless projects, which are of particular relevance to many young Australians.

         As I indicated during the election campaign and through all of last year, providing greater incentive and greater encouragement to small business lies very much at the heart of the government's economic plans. It remains the very strong view of the government that the area of greatest job generation, particularly for the young, is the small business sector. It is the small business sector which is the hope of the side so far as future employment is concerned. It is the small business sector that needs more incentive. It is the small business sector that will begin to feel the benefit of the recent reductions in interest rates. It is the small business sector that will benefit from the abolition from 1 January of the unfair dismissal law that was visited on the small business community by the former government.

         From 1 July this year it will be possible for any man or woman in Australia running a small business who sells that business with proceeds of less than $5 million to invest those proceeds in another business, not necessarily a business of a like nature, without there being any capital gains tax liability. I remind the parliament of what was said by the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Business Review Weekly

We are now at a time when the standard variable mortgage rate is the lowest since June 1974, since the Labor Party in a previous incarnation got to wrecking the economy in the Whitlam government phase.

I have already expressed to the House my own view that banks ought to be passing on to home buyers reductions in official interest rates with the same alacrity that they pass on the rises in official rates. The benefits of some of those reductions were only passed on in the last week, but that benefit of $188 per month over future months puts back disposable income into the hands of Australian families, together with the family policy that the Prime Minister has already indicated, providing through the years strong and solid growth as forecast in the mid-year review.

When interest rates are raised those banks that extend the term of the mortgage generally bring the term of the mortgage back when they are lowered. So the advantage in relation to the people who had their mortgages extended when, under Labor, interest rates were rising is that they have a shorter life than they would have had, had your high monetary policy stayed in place.

          says that the underlying rate of inflation is going to be one per cent—it is actually going to be lower than what was forecast at the time of the budget—when you have the same mid&amp;hyphen;year review that has revised upward the business investment figures rather than revising them down; when you have seen an improvement, albeit not as dramatic as we would like, in the balance of payments situation; when you have the passage through the parliament of legislation that will provide much needed freedom to the labour market; when you have a government that is committed to a charter of budget honesty that will bring a new level of transparency to the public accounts of this country; when you have a Reserve Bank which is operating with its proper commitments not only to keeping inflation down but also to generating an appropriate climate for the generation of jobs in this country; when you have a government that is committed to a real future for rural and regional Australia, is it any wonder against that background, that I should credibly argue, as I did last Friday, and I do again today, recognising that the present level of unemployment is too high, knowing that it is a level of unemployment we inherited from you?

This constitutional convention will be held in November or December of this year. As promised during the election campaign, half of the delegates to the convention will be appointed by the government, which will include an appropriate proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and young people between the ages of 18 and 24.

         It is the intention of the government that the convention be held in Canberra. It will probably be held in the old Parliament House. The agenda will include issues other than the head of state, but, as I indicated before the election as part of our policy, it will be our intention to ensure that the head of state issue is dealt with separately and first and is not allowed to be sidetracked or held back by considerations of other issues.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It will also be the intention of the government before the ballot for the delegates takes place to initiate and conduct a balanced public information campaign. The information that will be disseminated by the government will be compiled in part in consultation with different groups in the community who hold varying points of view. That material will include arguments for and against the existing constitutional arrangements for a head of state as well as arguments discussing the various republican alternatives.

         As members of the parliament will know, I am certainly not Australia's leading republican. It is something that I have never sought to disguise from the Australian people. I was elected Prime Minister of Australia by the Australian people in their full knowledge of my views on that subject and on the full basis of a commitment I made, which I am happy to say today is going to be honoured in full. Like all of the other great commitments that were made by me before the election, this one is going to be honoured in full. I know that will be a source of enormous disappointment to those who sit opposite, but it is going to be honoured in full.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are three quite serious points I would like to make to the parliament before I resume my seat. The first of those is that it does remain very much my view and the view of many in the Australian community that the existing constitution that Australia has has worked very effectively and has played a very significant role in delivering stable government to this country. It has played a significant role in the fact that Australia is one of only eight nations to remain continuously democratic through the whole of the 20th century. I do not believe that any republican system of government can deliver more stable or more effective government than can the present constitution. In other words, I do not believe that the present system of government is flawed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Rather, it remains the case that a significant number of Australians, which I recognise includes not only many people in the Australian Labor Party but also a significant number of people in the Liberal Party and in the National Party—in other words, it is a view which has considerable currency in the Australian community—hold the view that there are aspects of the symbols associated with the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          present system which are no longer as relevant as they used to be.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first of the other two observations I would make is that it is very important that this issue not be allowed to create unnecessary division in the Australian community. I would encourage all of those who will no doubt engage themselves in this debate not to form a monopoly of Australian nationalism on one or other side of the argument. There will be passionate Australians arguing all points of view.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the convention is the right vehicle to discuss this matter. It will not be an issue that is going to consume our side of politics to the exclusion of other issues. I say once again that I am very proud of the fact that the commitment we made on this issue is being honoured.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When all the other details related to the election of the delegates to the convention and many of the other things associated with the convention have been decided by the government, I will make a more formal and lengthy statement to the parliament. There will be plenty of opportunity for all members of the parliament to debate that, but I felt the parliament was owed advice from me as to the state of the government's thinking.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I confirm without qualification that the promise we made on this will be honoured in full. As I said before the election, the Australian people, whose decision alone it ultimately is as to whether or not we change our system of government will, as I promised—to the opposition's great disappointment—be involved at the beginning, at the middle and at the end of this deliberative process.

         I do want to concentrate on one of the other benefits of low inflation. Low inflation protects people who live off savings. Many people who live off savings will be saying that in a low interest rate climate, they are not getting the kind of interest rate returns which they are used to and which they require in relation to living requirements. But low inflation does ultimately and directly help savers. It helps them in two ways: one, prices don't move against savers. That means they don't have to try and get those types of rates of return. Secondly, it preserves the value of their savings. On a 10 per cent inflation rate, the capital value of a person's savings would halve within six or seven years. On a one per cent inflation rate, that person can be assured that the value of their savings will hold up over their lifetime.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So this is a climate which is right for saving. The government wants to encourage people to save. The government has put in place, and intends to keep in place, a low inflation climate which is conducive towards that and its savings which will be so important to investment and growth and job&amp;hyphen;creating opportunities in the future.

The way in which you achieve that is you give people the opportunity to sit down at work and say, `As the employer, as an employee, how can we, at our business, run our business or change our organisation so that we run more efficiently; so that we can provide the productivity that can assure people that when they get a pay rise, it is backed up with a productivity gain so it is a sustainable, real increase in wages?'

         The interesting thing behind this question is that it betrays your real view about labour market reform. Your real view about labour market reform is—for all your talk about reform—that you want to return to a centralised system where wage increases bear no relationship whatsoever to the productivity of the enterprises concerned. The consequence of that is there for us all to see over the last 13 years. And I will tell you who cops it the most: those that you claim to be most concerned about. Those who are disadvantaged, those who are low income earners and, on top of that, those who are unemployed.

         Our policy is better pay for better work. The way you achieve that is to encourage people at work to sit down and do deals to suit their businesses. I will tell you what has happened in the transport industry. There are some major employers who are supporting this wage increase. Not only are they supporting this wage increase, but they are paying this wage increase already. Their intention is to go down with the union to the commission

          and seek a general, across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board wage increase so as to impose the costs which they are now paying onto other businesses, many of whom are small businesses, regardless of whether or not those businesses can afford it. And rather than those businesses being then able to employ more people or to provide their services with greater productivity and more jobs, the reality is that you actually threaten the jobs of the very people you claim to be concerned about. Not only do you deny people the opportunity of wage increases based on real productivity, you also set up—through a centralised arrangement—inflationary price pressures which will have an impact right across the economy.

         In fact, your question again demonstrates for all to see that you want to return to the bad old days.

You are backing some of those bigger employers who have done deals which they  have been able to pass on in price increases. But they now want to impose their cost structures on their competitors. There are two things that this government stands for—two things that are very clear as we go to the commission on this particular case.

         The percentage of employees belonging to unions dropped by almost two percentage points in the 12 months between August 1995 and August 1996.

If you look over the last 10 years, the percentage of employees belonging to unions has dropped from 46 per cent to 31 per cent.

A relevant fact in this is that, as from 1 January, under the government's new Workplace Relations Act, the circumstances and the choice facing Australian employees are now much freer than they ever faced under Labor. In fact, if you are—and many Australians have been—compelled to join a union, you now have a new choice, a new opportunity, and that is that if you do not want to be in a union you do not have to be in a union.

It might have been early in the morning in Perth, but if you are going to get your information from the member for Werriwa you are bound to mislead. In his case it is knowing; in yours it is unintentional. Just make sure that you do not try it again.

         We have said that we will be deregulating petrol prices after the oil industry has given the undertakings; that we are negotiating those undertakings at the moment; and that, in accordance with the ACCC recommendation, developments in the market in relation to imports have to continue. We saw during the silly season the silly spokesman out making a silly fool of himself. That is the answer, Mr Speaker.

          <break page="21" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           economy. In fact, these industries combined—very important for a trading nation like Australia—represent over 60 per cent of our total export wealth. Agriculture, of which some 77 per cent of production is exported today, accounts for about 23 per cent of our total export income. It is a timely point at which to consider the important role of the wheat industry in that scenario.

         The Australian wheat industry is a major exporter and indeed we are a major player on grain markets globally. In fact last year, in the drought recovery year, we saw production rise very substantially to 17.2 million tonnes, worth about $4&amp;half; billion to the national economy. But this year we have seen a record production of 23 million tonnes for Australia. That is a remarkable performance, particularly when you think of the damage that has been done to the industry in recent years by drought, by extraordinary volatility in world grain prices and by the economic pressures that resulted from the sort of mismanagement that you people opposite were responsible for during the 1980s and the early 1990s.

         Despite those problems, the nation's grain farmers have boosted production to record levels, particularly in relation to wheat, and they have increased their average individual turnover by 1.5 per cent per annum in recent years—a testimony to their resilience, to their innovation, to the value of research and development, and to their capacity to keep going under conditions that most Australians would just walk away from. They have made a great contribution to the benefit not just of themselves but of the nation at large.

         Those of you who had a look at last week's very significant turnaround in the figures for the trade balance between November and December last year will have seen that the greatest contributor by far was in fact the wheat industry, with a very heavy shipping program. That shipping program has continued through January with record figures—an outstanding result—and that promises more good figures for us in terms of our balance of trade.

I reject totally the claim by those on the other side of the House and some of their fellow travellers that the government is taking money from government schools to expand new schools in the non-government sector. It is this kind of dishonest statement which helps to undermine confidence in government schools when in fact under the government's policies government schools have the best opportunity they have had for a very long time—

          Remember before the federal election seeing our local member Noel Hicks standing beside a petrol bowser promising to reduce petrol prices by 5 cents per litre as soon as his government came to power? These statements were endorsed by his leader, Tim Fischer. Since these commitments, petrol prices have increased by at least 8 cents per litre in our area.

          They promised to bring the prices down by 5c a litre and they have gone up by eight. So the coalition is out by 13c a litre. That adds up to tens of thousands of dollars for businesses in the bush, it adds up to tens of thousands of dollars for tourism operators, it adds up to tens of thousands of dollars for farmers and it adds up to thousands of dollars in the working family budget around regional Australia—all because of the betrayal of the coalition on this core election promise.

          You hear some interesting stories throughout the month of January. One of the most amusing items to come out of the coalition ranks was the concept of truth in election advertising legislation. They were actually advancing the proposition of fining people who did not tell the truth at election time. I do not know if they were talking about core and non-core fines for core and non-core promises, but there is no doubt that government MPs would be paying their fines hand over fist as Australians pay more for their petrol.

          What is the record of the coalition on petrol prices? What is the record on the key promise that they gave to the people of regional Australia? There was a 2.7 per cent increase in the December quarter CPI in petrol prices—a low inflation quarter except for petrol and the people in regional Australia paying the higher petrol prices. And just yesterday we were told that that CPI increase flows through into the Commonwealth excise. So here they are collecting another $20 million when they promised to bring prices down.

          They are putting the $20 million revenue from the petrol excise into their coffers. We know they need revenue to fill their Costello crater, but it should not be revenue at the expense of election promises; it should not be revenue at the expense of regional Australia. The record was particularly damning throughout the holiday period. The prices went up just before Christmas. The petrol companies knew that Australians would be travelling more, so they decided to take advantage of the holiday habits of Australian families and put their prices up by between 2c and 5c per litre.

In Cairns it was 8c more expensive, in Townsville it was 6c more expensive and in the mining town of Middlemount near Rockhampton it was a massive 13c more expensive. So that is narrowing Peter McGauran style—a 13c differential between the petrol prices in Brisbane and Central Queensland. Now the Minister for Science and Technology is actually starting to say that the prices did not go up that much over the Christmas period. That is not what he was saying on 7 January.

          Of course, this large differential was repeated later in the month. Let us have a look at the figures for New South Wales. In Western Sydney on 23 January, unleaded petrol was as low as 73.9c. If you write the figures down, Minister, you will calculate that there was a 7c differential for Bathurst and Orange, and for Broken Hill it was as high as 10c per litre. If that is narrowing coalition style, no wonder the people in regional Australia are complaining about it.

People all over the country have been complaining about the price exploitation that you owned up to, waving the white flag, and have done absolutely nothing to stop. Not only that, I see that the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), the self&amp;hyphen;styled head of the backbench committee on petrol prices, the hardest job in the government, was complaining about the price hikes

He said that if the petrol companies did not come into line the government would be passing special amendments to the Trade Practices Act—maybe the sort of thing I have got before the House by way of a private member's bill. Of course, he could not get too far with it because Mr McGauran refused to support Mr Lieberman's warning on the Trade Practices Act, saying that it was a long way from that. So poor old Jaffa, waving the white flag, saw the reinforcements coming over the hill and he waved them back because he thought the prices were narrowing. The Farmers Association, the member for Indi, government backbenchers, consumers and farmers all over Australia were saying those things.

          A funny thing happened to the National Party on the way to the forum, on the way to their ministerial offices: they stopped listening to regional Australia. We all know, particularly in the Gippsland region, what it means when you stop listening. You do not need to take the word of ALP price watch on these things; the figures are very clear. The minister was saying it—until he was caught out badly and under pressure from the media—the member for Indi, the New South Wales Farmers Association, and on it went. What happened to the member for Gippsland—the minister—is that he went from being the gamekeeper to being the poacher. A few weeks later he actually joined the petrol companies; he actually became their hand puppet. Peter the Puppet McGauran is what the big petrol companies called him in Collins Street circles in Melbourne. They have got him dancing there like the Howdy Doody doll, dancing their tune. He is now saying in his press releases that he wants the big petrol companies to work with the coalition.

The National Party needs to make a very important choice on petrol: do you take on the petrol companies and break up the integrated control of this industry? Do you try to get vertical separation and an active wholesale market to give farmers and people in the bush their chance to access cheaper wholesale petrol or do you cave in to the interests of the big petrol companies in Collins Street and do nothing about it? The National Party needs to work out pretty quickly on this matter whether they are simply Liberals in sheep's clothing or fair dinkum representatives of people in regional Australia.

          So why don't you do what the member for Indi was supporting: changes to the Trade Practices Act to declare an access regime, more regulation on the petrol industry, not less, and break up the vertical integration so that you have an active wholesale market? You can actually do something constructive to bring down the prices. That is the measure that I have brought before the House in a private member's bill. The service station association has estimated that it has the potential to lower the price of petrol by 6c a litre. That estimate is supported by APADA—the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association.

You need to do a lot more than just write letters away to the petrol companies saying, `Can you do the right thing on access?' knowing full well that the petrol companies regard access as physical access only. They do not want to see any access that means competitive wholesale pricing. They are willing to adopt the status quo, all to placate a government that made a big promise and cannot do anything about it.

         Tasmania has long suffered a disadvantage compared to mainland Australia in relation to the inability of its petrol stations to compete for lower prices. This Howard government keeps preaching that competition should be a natural occurrence in a healthy enterprise system. Competition should generate where profit is taken and, in the petrol industry, it is at the wholesale level, the distributor level and the retail level.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The extent of competition is dependent on the financial capacity of operators to compete at each level and on their desire or need to compete. But that does not happen in Tasmania, especially in regard to their desire to compete. There is no ability to compete because the wholesalers are not interested in competition. They are quite happy with their market share in our small market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So how can this government say that they are going to bring down petrol prices unless they put in place some sort of regulations to allow the retail level to pick and choose their wholesaler—the big oil companies: Shell, BP, Ampol, Caltex and Mobil? Unless they do that, unless they allow retailers and distributors, in Tasmania's case, to actually choose from which terminal they buy, you will not get competition into the system.

         Furthermore, based on the Industry Commission's calculations, the cost of that should be about 3.2 cents per litre to the oil companies. (This included administration, marketing, transport, storage.)

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Yet under the PSA, 7.4 cents per litre (this was changed in 1994 to 7.1 cents per litre) is allowed which includes 0.5 cents per litre profit. According to the Industry Commission this leaves the oil companies a 3.7 cents per litre margin. Three cents per litre of this was used in Melbourne in 1993 and 1994 to discount to other wholesalers or rebate to retailers to support retail price discounting.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         The financial capacity of oil companies to compete in Hobart is not in question. The fact is they have no desire to compete—being content with existing market share, . . .

         If the government were serious about bringing the price of petrol down across Australia, then the only real answer is to give Australia's service station operators the legal right to shop around for the best wholesale price and pass those benefits onto consumers. When the Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced his deregulation plan, he talked of unleashing new competitive forces. From my earlier points, you will see that this will not work in Tasmania or in regional areas of Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Deregulation does nothing to help competition, particularly in Tasmania where the oil companies could not care less about competition. If anything, deregulation will allow the petrol companies to put prices up rather than down as there is nothing to stop them now—and you should know that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Treasurer did not attack the central issue—that is, legally force the big petrol companies to open their terminals to price competition. He could do this through federal legislation and by encouraging the states to bring in their own legislation. We have to ensure that there is an incentive for competition to exist among the big players. If retailers and distributors could shop around, there would be more reason for them to do something. Retailers are saying, `If we cannot shop around, we cannot compete.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The few price watches that have come in show that the only competition able to be pursued at the moment is where those retailers sell a high enough volume to be able to discount. Those stations are on the major routes, such as the Midlands Highway in Tasmania. Other stations on minor roads around the state can be some 6c higher.

         So country people are always going to have to pay higher prices.

          Let me remind the minister of what he said on 7 January. He criticised the petrol price rises during the holiday by saying that in some cases it was `blatant exploitation'. It is blatant exploitation not to open up those terminals to competition. The oil companies can swap their petrol from one terminal to another; therefore, it does not make any difference not to allow competition at the distribution level. Unless you can do that, you will not be doing anything about the price of petrol in Australia.

         When the pressure got too great and when they were unable to grapple with the problem themselves, what they did do was set up another inquiry. We do know that state and federal governments over more than 40 years have had so many inquiries into the petrol industry that we almost despair. The storage space is probably inadequate now to cope with the number of reports lying around on this issue.

         So let us get it into perspective. We have a new reformist government which, in the first nine months of its office, has been dealing with the deficit and the other massive problems it inherited as a result of the mismanagement of the previous government. We have also had the courage and the fortitude and the determination to tackle at the core the reforms that are needed in the fuel industry, and there are many more needed. There will be further action with the oil code, with the code of conduct, and with refining the monitoring system that we have foreshadowed.

All of them are under AAA. They will be assisted by many people in the community and by farming organisations.

Where else would you find that the RACV, the motoring organisations, the farming organisations of Australia, the umbrella organisations—AAA—have come out publicly and said, `That is what we have been fighting for.' What this coalition government has done in nine months is put in place the framework of reform for which they have been fighting for many years. What a tragedy it is that the former government did not do it. They could have. They would have had our support had they brought it in when we were in opposition. It could have been through the House within five minutes. They did not do it.

Nothing was done by the former government at all, to their everlasting shame. I would have thought that a new government would have been supported by them and they would be saying privately, `Thank God these fellas had the courage to tackle the unions. Thank God they got the IR law through. Thank God the framework is there for reform.' To their credit that is what they should have done. But, no, they go

         Let me also call on the opposition to support the oil industry—the distributors and the retailers—in their discussions to develop an oil code, which is the second phase of our reform and which has to be developed over the next few months. That oil code, if the member for Werriwa will step back and listen, will also be an opportunity for the retailers and the distributors and the wholesalers and the majors to get together and put in place a code of practice with integrity which is fair to all sides. If that is coupled with the reforms we have already introduced, it will be a further dynamic in the fuel industry distribution system in Australia.

If you think about it, the best inventions in the world are like a wheel: simple. Our reforms—if you look at them fairly and do not try to spoil and them and do not undermine them—are the beginning of the most logical and sensible reform. They will give transparency, they will give access, they will give supervision and accountability and they will have teeth, because of very substantial penalties under the Trade Practices Act for proven offences.

          —I would just like to say a few short words in this debate because I saw and heard a lot of John Panizza in the Senate during the 10 years we overlapped there. I was personally very saddened indeed by the news of his sudden death. John was one of those people of whom you can say absolutely unequivocally that he was a thoroughly decent human being. Of course, we had our differences across the political divide, but even on an issue as highly charged as Mabo, where I remember very well that John was a very strong and persistent advocate of his own rural and business constituency, I always had the sense throughout that debate,  throughout that advocacy and throughout that fierce persistence with which he advanced the cause that he was aware of the human and the emotional and psychological dimensions of the issue for the Aboriginal people.

         The human dimension of issues was always very much present in the way in which he approached them, in the way in which he articulated his personal response inside or outside the chamber. We heard in the chamber over the years a lot of good, plain, direct, blunt speech from John Panizza of the kind that, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), you also heard a lot of in the party room over those same years. But that good, plain, blunt and direct speech was just about always, as I recall it, tempered with great good humour. Certainly, I can never ever remember him saying anything that was coloured by malice or mean&amp;hyphen;spiritedness. That is not something that we can all claim in this place or anywhere else. So, very shortly and very simply, I want to say this: John Panizza was a very decent bloke, transparent, warm, honest and very human. Obviously, his family is going to miss him like hell. My heart goes out to them, but we will all miss him.

One of the fortunes of my life and that of my mother, father and two sisters was to spend a number of years in the 1960s living in Southern Cross.

         Southern Cross was founded in 1888, from memory. It was founded as a result of the discovery of gold, and the first great influx to Southern Cross was that of gold prospectors. In the first half of this century, there was a second great influx to Southern Cross and that was of wheat farmers. One thing that was significant about that second influx was that these farmers were, in the main, migrants—particularly from Italy and particularly from that area we once used to know as the former republic of Yugoslavia. Names such as Dellabosca, Granich and Panizza were famous then and abound in Southern Cross now and in its history. For example, in my case, a Dellabosca was my closest primary school friend, a Granich remains one of my closest friends today, and I had the honour and the privilege to serve in the national parliament as a member from Western Australia with Senator John Panizza.

         My first recollection of meeting John Panizza was on a plane from Perth to Canberra, shortly after I became the member for Perth in 1993. I was beginning to experience the arduousness of travel from Western Australia, which the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) referred to in his contribution. John came up to me and made the point that he knew my father. We then had one of those lengthy conversations on the plane that Western Australian members will be so familiar with. What struck me about John then were so many of the attributes that people have attributed to him since his death. He was a good bloke, he was a decent man, he was kind, he was compassionate and caring, and he was imbued with a generosity of spirit. What struck me about him at the time was that there were a number of things that were clearly important to him. Southern Cross and the Yilgarn were important to him. His local government service as a councillor and as president of the Shire of Yilgarn were important to him. His Italian heritage was important to him. From my observation, perhaps the two things most important to him were his farm, of which he was entitled to be proud, and his family.

         In September 1996, at John's urging, I attended the centenary of the local Catholic church; the church that my family attended when we lived in Southern Cross—a church known as Our Lady of Montserrat, which is nestled at the top of the rise in Altair Street. I went to those centenary celebrations with my mother and father, my sister and my young son, who was then four. In the course of those weekend celebrations, my mother and father renewed their acquaintance with John Panizza. He and I joked that, although we had not checked the record, we were probably the only two members of the national parliament since Federation who had attended St Joseph's

         There were a number of things that I observed about John Panizza in the course of that weekend.

In the prayers of intercession for the centenary mass, the prayers for government service and the prayers for the farming community were delivered  respectively by Councillor Charmaine Panizza and Mr Frank Panizza. That shows the contribution that John's family generally has made to those areas of activity in the Yilgarn.

         The centenary celebrations concluded on a Sunday. John and I had to get from Southern Cross to Perth to continue the arduous journey back to Canberra, so we did so in a light plane—John, myself and my four&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old son. John spent most of the time on the plane doing two things: firstly, lecturing me in the nicest possible way about the importance of family and, secondly, ensuring in the course of the short light plane trip from Southern Cross to Perth that others were taken care of before him. Those memories that I have of that weekend will be the memories that I will have of John Panizza: a good bloke, and a kind and decent man, imbued with a generosity of spirit, who was often, if not always, thinking about others ahead of himself.

John was preselected and elected in 1987 as a senator for Western Australia. He was elected in the double dissolution election in that year. He was preselected at the time by a coalition of people who wanted to have a strong represen

         Ever since his election to the Senate, I believe that John Panizza has forthrightly represented regional Australian interests. It takes a fair amount of moral courage as well as strength of character to stand up in the party room of the coalition and represent those interests when sometimes they are unpopular or at times when perhaps they do not fit in with the prevailing philosophical view. Nonetheless, John Panizza always represented those views strongly—at times he went against the general flow within the coalition parties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that John rose to the position of Government Whip in the Senate reflects the standing in which he was held by his colleagues not only in the party but also generally in the parliament. He took on the job as the Government Whip in the Senate under circumstances of enormous difficulty. He had to ensure that in every single division every single senator was present. No doubt that required a tremendous amount of vigilance and attention to detail. Having served in the whips office in this place for the coalition, I can well understand the enormous amount of work that was required of him and his staff to ensure that the senators were present for all divisions.

I commend the member for Stirling for that obituary. It encapsulated what John Panizza represented not only to his own party but also to the people who viewed him as their champion. At times, when the interests of regional Australians are being forgotten or overlooked by the interests of the east coast cities, the memory of John Panizza's contribution to this parliament will shine through.

         Although by no means a close acquaintance of the senator, I had the benefit of his friendship and advice in the course of the last 10 months. In this time, I found him a man of great principle, warm and intelligent. He was the type of person who was not easily shocked, the kind of man who, I can remember thinking, must have seen a lot in his 65 years of life. Between us, there was first and foremost a recognition of a common Italian heritage, a heritage of which Senator Panizza was extremely proud. Yet it was a type of ethnic pride which is common amongst Italian Australians from rural areas. He was a country Australian through and through, passionate about rural issues while maintaining the good-natured scepticism with which most rural MPs view their city dwelling colleagues.

         He would tell us that Australia's wealth came from the country, and of course he meant it. He had come to parliament to remind us that Australia's prosperity was linked to the prosperity of rural communities. I am sure that others will talk about Senator Panizza's achievements in his nine years as a federal member of parliament. He was an excellent, hardworking spokesperson for the people of Western Australia and that is a fact which has been recognised today by all members.

         My obligation and privilege today is simply to record what we had in common: our ancestry. John Panizza, as a trailblazer in Liberal politics, indirectly influenced the changing face of Australian politics and made the path that I, and I am sure the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro), have had to take that much easier. Senator Panizza's parents came from northern Italy, a stone's throw away from the Swiss border. People from these parts can be tough. They are determined people, resilient and extremely hardworking.

         Robert Panizza, upon his arrival in the new land in 1921, worked as a miner in Broken Hill, Mount Isa and eventually Western Australia, where he settled in the town of Southern Cross to build a life for his new family. I once heard a radio interview with Senator Panizza in which he was asked why, as someone who had experienced racial hatred as a child, he opposed racial vilification legislation. `Because the best way of dealing with people like that is with a bunch of fives,' was his answer.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This was typical of Senator Panizza. He would never shirk an issue. In fact in his maiden speech he invited senators on the other side of the chamber to feel free to interject if they disagreed with his comments. Where we, the city folk, would seek therapy, Senator Panizza was busy getting on with the task at hand. He became a better Australian than those who taunted him. He was a true son of his parents, a true son of his parent's land and a true son of this country of ours—Australia.

         John Panizza was influenced to become a senator in part due to his fascination of the Roman senate. He studied it.

It was clear that they were very dissatisfied with what had happened in wool marketing and they were rather keen to find someone to blame for the collapse of the floor price of wool. John had heard about this through the media and duly flew to Hamilton. When I said to him, `This is a welcome surprise to see you here today.' He said, `I just thought you might have needed a little bit of help so I thought I'd come along.' That was typical of John Panizza, that was the sort of effort he would make for colleagues and that is one of many examples of what a very fine man he was and what a very fine Australian he was.

          —John Panizza was a member of the Senate who was probably the first example of a recognition within the Liberal Party in Western Australia that within its rural constituency, which is very substantial in terms of its membership, were people of the qualities of John Panizza who could bring both the experience of a rural background, the experience of doing it pretty hard in their youth, along with all the other skills of able business management that one might find in St Georges Terrace and a great understanding many Australians who had come to Australia post the Second World War have. But his preselection was particularly a move towards recognising the rural constituency of Western

         John was given a task. He was followed by Winston Crane and Alan Eggleston—similar people who bring a very broad experience to the parliament but, added to that, an understanding of the problems related to the rural and remote area constituency. In preselecting John, I do not think the Liberal Party could have made a better choice from a large number of candidates who had that sort of background, because he was outstanding in terms of his personal abilities and his personal understanding.

         I would like to emphasise that point because in many discussions with John I came to understand how well he understood what life was like on a farm such as Southern Cross in those early years. John would have lived there around the time of the Depression. Southern Cross, which has been very bountiful in terms of its agricultural productivity in recent years, is pretty tough country. You have to have a great deal of courage, irrespective of your wealth, to go out, as the Panizzas do, and put in 25,000 to 30,000 acres of crop in an area where sometimes it just does not rain. It is, by anybody's standards, marginal country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That the Panizzas have made a success of it is further evidence of just how committed and dedicated they are. On my last visit to their property, which was some time ago, they were harvesting and it was the brothers, the family, who were out there on the machines notwithstanding that over time they had become extremely successful and no doubt could have afforded to pay someone else to do that job. But that is the type of people the Panizzas are: committed to their own farm. It is no secret that John's wife, Coral, still preferred living on the farm to the luxuries of Canberra or even the city where John had established his office as a senator for Western Australia. They are great people—greatly committed to their area.

         John and I had an interesting political career. It is a pity the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has left the chamber, because he still talks about the time when he, Jim Short, John and I went to Merredin, which is the heart of grain growing country within my electorate and not far from Southern Cross. We went to discuss John Kerin's proposal to deregulate the domestic wheat market. John Panizza and I were on opposite sides of the fence on the issue. John was an extremely conservative wheat grower in wheat grower political terms. John did not want anything to change. I felt the issue was a bit different. The audience was giving me a particularly hard time. It was interesting for David to see the way those sorts of meetings could be conducted.

         But that did not alter John's and my friendship.

We both put our views, with varying degrees of support. I think John had more supporters than I did, but we did it as friends. The member for Wannon has just returned. I am sure by the smile on his face that he remembers the day. Jim Short went out of their staggering. He had never seen the likes of it.

He was a man who knew and always remembered where he came from. In his maiden speech he said:

He also acknowledged not only the hard work of his father and those who came around the time of his father to this country but also the women who followed the men into the harsh conditions. I suppose I have some understanding of some of those conditions Senator Panizza's family had to deal with because my uncle had a farm in the same farming region that John Panizza's father farmed in and that he no doubt spent a great deal of time in as a child. I used to spend holidays there and I know how tough it was on my aunty and on the other women in that region. I also recognised the hard work done by the men.

         His humility was always demonstrated in his compassion, his sympathy and his understanding for his fellow man. Clearly, as a migrant he had from time to time encountered discrimination.

In his maiden speech he made a point of saying `if the Aboriginal people feel that they are still discriminated against—I know they are—they have my sympathy, because I know what it is like'. So he was also a man of great compassion and, as I said, a man of humility. I think the thing that touched me the most in his first speech to the Senate was that he said:

I admire John Panizza for his hard work, for what he achieved, for being an astute businessman both as a farmer and a property investor. But he was always a very grassroots person. My colleagues have said that his success, driven by that hard work and the hard work of his family, never changed John Panizza. That is what I liked about John. He was a straight shooter and very much down to earth.

As I mentioned, he will be sadly missed. He was a straight shooter. You always knew where John was coming from. Success, even his success as a senator, never changed John. We all in the Liberal Party admire John for that.

I had my closest association with him, I think as many others did, on aeroplanes.

          —I would like to add a few words to those of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) made early this afternoon. I have known Bert Kelly for nearly 30 years and his wife and some of his children for some of that time. I do not really remember him in the parliament, but I do remember him for most of those years at rural meetings of one sort or another.

         I knew, as most of us did, that the first man on his feet at the end of a speech that he did not like would be Bert Kelly, that he would
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          have a biting, short, succinct question but that that question would come at the end of a long, disarming, smiling, preamble which would go on for just as long as the chairman allowed—and I have known it to have gone on for 15 or more minutes. But I think one of the great attributes of Bert Kelly in putting his view—and it was always about protection, which he did not like at all, and, I might say, about protection in the agricultural industries, which he was very fond of as well, so he was not just taking on the manufacturers or his conventional enemies—was always that he did it so pleasantly, so smilingly and so disarmingly.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I happened to agree with the general thrust of his argument but, whatever you thought, you could not escape the smile and you could not escape the dedication to the subject and his mischievous way of getting the point over, sometimes to the discomfort of his friends. I think it is a well&amp;hyphen;known story that, in 1975, Bert Kelly called a quorum while he was speaking, as the Melbourne Cup was in the process of being run. The Labor government was forced to attend while the opposition watched the completion of the race. I am told that Fred Daly, who was known for his occasional flutter on the horses, never forgave Bert for that and was heard to say so on many occasions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, in the following year, when the Melbourne Cup had been won by a New Zealand horse, Bert asked a question without notice in the House. He did not have time to forewarn the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, who is now the Prime Minister. The question was:

         I did not disagree with Bert Kelly very often, but I disagree in part with that view because really it was the very entertaining, delightful but very strong way that he put his argument that got him invited to many of those meetings.

There are very few in the parliament who can retire with the recognition that they have influenced significantly the outcome of one of the very big policy debates that this country has faced. It has been said several times in this condolence motion that Bert,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           through his impact on the debate over tariffs and the liberalisation of trade, was one of the very rare people able to do this.

         I was honoured last year to be asked by the Centre for Independent Studies to deliver the Bert Kelly Lecture. Bert was already too ill to be able to attend, but I had had the privilege of talking with him over many years as a parliamentary staff member and as a member of parliament. When I organised a seminar of the Modest Members in 1995 in Sydney, he was there even though it was then evident that his health was failing. If he could come, he would come. That was one of the great things about Bert, that even when he left parliament he never lost that determination to support the causes that he believed in.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is probably a mistake to attribute too much influence to one man, even someone as persuasive as Bert Kelly. There were, after all, very powerful forces pushing Australia towards trade liberalisation internationally, and other influential players on the Australian scene. But, when all is said and done, Bert Kelly's influence in the parliament and the inspiration that he gave to other contributors to the policy debate was very large. The strength and character of purpose that enabled him to do this was exceptional. Perhaps it can be traced to his Methodist upbringing in South Australia, perhaps to the fact that his father, W.S. `Stan' Kelly OBE, had been a full&amp;hyphen;time member of the Commonwealth Tariff Board from 1929 to 1940. The board, after all, had been established to protect the public from the pressures of special interests—that was the purpose of the Tariff Board, not to hand out tariffs indiscriminately—and I am quite sure that Bert imbibed a lot of perspectives and principles from his father at the family dinner table over the years. Doubtless it was this sort of background that made him alert to the moral problems that arise when politicians start making decisions to advantage one section of the community at the expense of all the other sections of the community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that Bert's great achievement was to demonstrate the commonsense of lower tariffs and freer trade. This was an extraordinary achievement because, as the Prime
         <break page="50" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Minister (Mr Howard) said earlier, this was directly contrary to the conventional wisdom at the time when he began to pursue these issues. He did not pursue lower tariffs and freer trade as a theoretical position. He left that to Eccles in his columns. He always took the very practical position that lower tariffs would deliver real and very obvious benefits in the form of lower costs and expanded demand for the products of his farming constituents and others.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mavis, the long suffering politician's wife—and we all have our Mavises, I suppose, one way or another—Fred, his farmer friend, and Eccles, his academic adviser who championed cool analysis over emotion: these characters really charmed the many thousands of readers of his column `Modest member of parliament'. In that column, time after time he assailed the fantasy that high tariffs can create sustainable jobs. He showed again and again that tariffs just forced consumers and families to give more of their money to some fortunate beneficiaries at the expense of jobs in other businesses and that those who suffered most from the inflated prices produced by tariffs were the lower income sections of the community—many in the farming community, those on benefits, pensioners and retired people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now, after several decades of Bert's influence, we recognise that there are very few jobs in the Australian economy still dependent upon tariffs. The jobs that are coming into existence at the moment are jobs which can stand on their own in the global economy. Australia is stronger and more secure as a result. We have Bert Kelly to thank for that. I think we all owe a great debt of gratitude to him for his persistence and his strength over those years. I extend my sympathy to Lorna and to Bert's three sons—Anthony, Roger and Kim—on their loss.

          Firstly, I think it needs to be remembered that for a long period in the Menzies government the debates in the party room were at least as significant as in the parliament. As our own Prime Minister (Mr Howard) commented this morning in our own joint party room, Sir Robert—certainly as Mr Menzies—with his eyebrows rather dominated the proceedings. There was quite a marked gulf between those who had been senior ministers over the years and people like Bert Kelly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another facet of that period was that the Tariff Board was constituted as a dispassionate and independent body, designed to allow the consideration of the level of tariffs and to do it on a basis which took account not only of economics but also of employment and, supposedly, the economic consequences of any tariff that might have been proposed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Bert Kelly—certainly from his father but also through his association with Alf Rattigan, Dick Boyer and others on the Tariff Board—inevitably, in the party room as in the parliament, presented a case that was not emotional. It was not just presented on the bare facts of the theory of whether or not there should be a tariff. Probably to greater degree that I suspect many in this House these days do, he picked out the detail, analysed the figures and analysed the product of any recommendation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I noticed John Stone mentioned in his column the other day Bert's contribution to the debate on many occasions was at least as good and often better than the Tariff Board recommendation. Bert had the advantage of having read the tariff report. Having picked up those people who made contributions to the board, he would contact them and go through the issue. By the time the debate was presented, either in the party room or in the parliament, it was always just slightly better than the report itself.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I noticed the Prime Minister in his observations talked about Bert and his wry humour in his contributions. Quite often when there was a Tariff Board debate there was very little humour because, as a result of Bert's analysis, it would be strictly a numerical presentation and one that was not always easy to follow. The conclusions and the way in which he reached those decisions certainly
          <break page="51" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           demonstrated a very soft mannered but determined and persuasive person.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is little doubt that Bert was very much the parliamentary voice of those who felt that the time had come for a fundamental revision of Australian tariffs. I think all of us who worked with him admired and respected the way he pursued, both in the party room where there were significant political heavyweights against him and in the parliament, a cause which was not always popular.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, I want to briefly mention that Bert was always very deprecating in the way in which he presented himself. Several have mentioned his humour, and his Modest Member column was there was for us all to see. I can remember quite well some occasions when we had some quite strong debates in the party room about naval acquisitions. I remember one of the members had made a fairly profound argument about the case for bigger ships for the Australian navy. Bert said, `I do not know. I suppose an admiral needs a decent cabin, but I did think there were other reasons why we bought battleships and warships.' He also commented, `I suppose even admirals need something to play with in the bath.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The way in which he approached what could be a fundamental decision—in this case, it was looking at future acquisitions for the Royal Australian Navy—was by deprecating himself by his understanding of the subject and then suddenly showing not only did he know all about it but also he was on top of the numbers and on top of the argument. As a result, his case was always very persuasive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While I note the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his observations suggested that Bert should never have been a minister, I think one of the advantages that Bert had as a minister was that he was actually able to put in place that very significant analytical capability that characterised so much of his performance. In his contribution the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, mentioned Bert's interest in the standard gauge railway. One of the things Bert did was not only look at the employment and at the tariffs but also look at the infrastructure.
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           Bert was one of those who very forcefully advocated a total analysis of the costs of production and delivery. As a farmer, of course, he was only too well aware of the cost of delivering grain and other produce in South Australia, but he certainly was a very forceful advocate to have on side as I had at the time of the completion of the Indian Pacific and the Trans&amp;hyphen;Australia standard gauge railway. Bert was one of those who also helped in the development of the standard gauge railway to Alice Springs where, again, we badly needed to look at the cost of providing a service which at that stage was grossly inefficient and, in parts, was subject to flooding which delayed the service to an inordinate degree.

           I regarded Bert Kelly as a great Australian. He certainly made a contribution in parliament. He made a contribution in the party room. As a journalist, as several have said, I think his memory will live long because he wrote precisely, concisely and to the point. I would also like to extend my own personal sympathy to Lorna and his family. As I did not speak to the John Panizza motion, I would also like my personal sympathy to go to Coral and her family.

          —I was honoured to represent the Speaker at the funeral service for Charles Robert Kelly, which was held in Wesley Uniting Church, Kent Town, on 24 January. Bert Kelly was a former member for Wakefield, as everyone knows. I suspect he was one of those South Australian federal members of whom the whole state is proud.

         Bert Kelly was unique, and he was unique for one reason: he entered this parliament, the national parliament, with a national perspective. I suspect most of us tend to come here having to acquire a national perspective, but Bert came knowing what the nation needed. He was determined to pursue what he felt was in the nation's best interests ahead of what may have been an immediate parochial interest. His objective was national. He entered the parliament with a national view of Australia, and that in many ways made him quite unique.

          He always claimed to have been a reluctant politician. Any who have read his books will know that he said he was drafted into Wakefield and that, in fact, he did not even know whether he was a member of the Liberal Party or not when he was first invited to stand. I suspect there may be just a little editorial licence in all of that. I also suspect that, while he may claim to have been a reluctant politician, the truth is he loved this place and he loved his role as the member for Wakefield. What happened, remarkably, was that he never ceased to be a farmer. Whether he was a minister of the Crown or a well-known columnist and journalist, he was first and foremost a farmer representing the farmers of Wakefield and identifying with the family property Merrindie, which is near Tarlee in South Australia's mid&amp;hyphen;north.

          I would call Bert Kelly my mentor. He came into this parliament, however, with a mentor of his own—Charles Hawker, who had been a former member for Wakefield between 1929 and 1938 when he was tragically killed in an aircraft disaster over Melbourne. Charles Hawker was a courageous and unselfish politician who had been severely wounded during World War I and who represented Wakefield vigorously in spite of his severe war wounds. He had a reputation in the parliament for his courage and for his preparedness to speak up on any issue, whether popular or unpopular. He was recognised as a man certainly headed to the ministry and possibly to the prime ministership prior to his untimely death.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          He had, as everyone who has read Bert Kelly's books will know, a profound influence on the then young Bert Kelly and on what he saw as Bert Kelly's role if he were to be a responsible South Australian. I was very pleased that the member for Wannon, David Hawker, who I think is a great nephew of Sir Charles Hawker, was able to be present at Bert Kelly's funeral.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Bert entered the parliament, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, in 1958 as the member for Wakefield to succeed the retiring Sir Philip McBride. He came in with a particular view of tariffs and of the Tariff Board—largely as a result of a lifetime of
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           exposure to the views of his father, the late Stan Kelly, and, as other members have mentioned, Stan Kelly's involvement on the Commonwealth Tariff Board.

          As others have said, particularly the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), my predecessor had this great capacity to illustrate fundamental truths in a way that people wanted to read and discover more about. He used the characters of his column to bring all of what Bert believed alive and to bring it alive in a way that really meant something to those who were reading it. So all sorts of fundamental truths about tariffs and the impact of tariffs were widely read not only across South Australia and through the farming journals but also through the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          What had been an unpopular cause, the cause of lowering tariffs around Australia, became increasingly the cause picked up by farmers as they recognised what the real cost of tariff barriers had been. Let no-one underestimate the fortitude and determination needed by Bert Kelly to pursue this course when it was not a popular course and was largely resisted by most in the parliament.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Bert served the parliament as the deputy whip, as the chairman of the public works committee, as the Minister for Works and as the Minister for the Navy. It is true that he was defeated by my immediate predecessor, Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, at a preselection battle in 1977. However, if I might be so bold to suggest, the Prime Minister was just a little wrong when he created the impression that Bert may have lost preselection because of the responsibilities that he had as a minister and the time that he had spent focusing on the tariff battle which, in the Prime Minister's words, meant that he may have neglected his branches.

           As someone who was living close to the seat of Wakefield at that time, I don't think anyone could ever accuse Bert of having neglected his branches, because he simply loved to be out among the farming community. What happened in 1977 was that there was a redistribution and the seat of Angas, which included the Riverland area, ceased to exist and became amalgamated into the seat of Wakefield. Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, who had been the member for Angus, chose, not surprisingly, to preselect for the seat of Wakefield. Mr Giles brought with him a number of people who had a particularly protected view of society. I know it well—and so, by the way, does the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). Having brought those votes with him, he raised the threshold to a point which it was more difficult for the then member for Wakefield, Mr Kelly, to clear.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I was at that preselection—I remember it well. And I remember, after the result had been announced, Mr Kelly saying that he felt like a slave set free. I think he was very sorry to lose the battle, because there were a number of issues that he felt had still been unresolved. But what he had underestimated was the degree to which the work he had already done had laid the ground rules for the tariff battle to be won.

           It was in retirement from parliament—as he pursued his column as the then Modest Farmer—that he saw the fruition of all that he had sought to achieve during the 19 years that he had spent in the federal parliament and in the years leading up to it. He kept alive his columns; he kept alive his advocacy for free trade and for the lowering of protection. He gained a great deal of self&amp;hyphen;satisfaction, I am pleased to say, out of the result that he saw as the popular economic view turned to advocate that which he had long stood for.

           I want to say just a couple of things because I believe one of the areas that has been neglected in the tributes so sincerely paid to this former member for Wakefield is that too little has been made of the role of Lorna, his wife, in what was Bert Kelly's success.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Bert married Lorna in 1936. It is said that she was sent to the little Giles Corner School
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            near Tarlee effectively to help her brother, who had just been appointed as the school principal and probably the only member of the school staff. The Kelly farm, so Bert tells us, ran down to Giles Corner and a triangular paddock adjoined the school. Bert would have us all believe that that triangular paddock was worked more thoroughly than any other paddock on the entire farm as he went about courting Lorna during school hours and, of course, after school hours. Whatever the real reason, the facts are that he married Lorna and they raised three sons of whom they are intensely proud—Tony, Kim and Roger—and their children and grandchildren are very much a part of the Kelly family. We would do Bert's memory a disservice if we didn't acknowledge the importance to Bert of the family and the importance to Bert of Lorna, who both kept his feet on the ground and kept the objective of tariff reductions clearly in his sights.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           With great respect, may I say that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did Lorna something of an unintentional disservice when he mentioned that Mavis may have in some way resembled Lorna. There is no similarity at all between the character Mavis in Bert's column and Lorna, the lady I know as a courageous partner to Bert who, as I said, kept his feet on the ground and kept advancing the cause in which they both so passionately believed. Much of what they did is so well portrayed in the final book that Bert wrote, entitled
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Merrindie: A Family's Farm

           .
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is significant, when I talk about Bert as the family man, that all three sons paid a tribute to their father at the funeral service; that they all referred to their father not so much as the man who had been so successful in the advocacy of lower tariffs, but as the man who had been their father and had kept the tradition of family life alive and well. I think it was Kim who read a poem that Lorna had written for Bert on the occasion of his 80th birthday, which touched us all and reminded us of how much she had been involved with his columns, as well as with his object of lowering protection.

            up—that Bert wasn't an orator but he was a very effective communicator. He was in demand as a guest speaker across my electorate, certainly up until the last five years when failing health made it more difficult for him to travel. He was in demand not because he was a fluent speaker but because he was a speaker who concisely and effectively got his message across and got it across in a humorous way that everyone remembered.

           He expected all of us to be aware of what he believed in and, whether we agreed with it or not, to be consistent in our arguments either in support of his line or opposed to his line. It was consistency that was the hallmark of much of  Bert's success. I note that John Hyde, in his tribute to Bert in the
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Australian
           </emphasis>
           , said that one of his first memories of Bert had been of him chastening John Hyde because he had used a particular speech on interest rates to take a rather lackadaisical view of what the government ought to be doing. Bert said to John, `Did you really believe that?' and John said, `No, I didn't.' Bert said, `Then why did you say it?' Because from Bert's point of view, if there was something to be advocated, then one ought to be entirely consistent about it and not be concerned about what the short&amp;hyphen;term gains or failures would be of that particular course.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I am sorry to be extended about this, but I do want to make a couple of other points. I must pay a tribute to Bert Kelly, not only as the man who stood for free trade and not only as the family man, but as Bert Kelly the farmer. Bert Kelly became a member of the South Australian Soil Conservation Board when it came into being, because he was concerned about the movement of soil and soil erosion on his mid&amp;hyphen;north farm. His father had found in Melbourne, as a member of the Tariff Board, a publication that alluded to ways in which soil conservation could be enhanced by contour banking. He mentioned the booklet to his son, who then went searching for it, found it, and introduced contour banks. He used the agricultural bureau movement in South Australia to spread this form of soil conservation, which has now become the norm. His were the first contour banks and on that farm, Merrindie, many field days were
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            held to see what could be done to minimise soil erosion through contour banking.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           He was, as a result of his association with the advisory board and his direct interest in agriculture, a member of the South Australian Advisory Board of Agriculture. He was also selected in 1951 as the first Nuffield scholar to spend six months overseas looking at agricultural practice in the UK. If I may introduce a personal note here, it is something of an amusement to me to report to the parliament that, while Bert was the first Nuffield scholar, my predecessor, Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, was also a Nuffield scholar, and so was I. So you can imagine I look askance at any of the other Nuffield scholars currently resident in Wakefield.

          <para first-indent="16">
           He successfully served this parliament as the minister for both works and navy. He will, as others have said, be well remembered for his self&amp;hyphen;effacing and self&amp;hyphen;deprecating manner. Wherever Bert went in the electorate he was welcome. Today he is remembered as one of the most colourful and effective members for Wakefield. The great message for us all is that, although his time in parliament was largely spent on the backbench, he so effectively changed a nation's view of what had been a particular philosophy for economics.

           Let me conclude by picking up the point made by the Leader of the Opposition when he read from the letter that former Prime Minister the Hon. Gough Whitlam had sent to him. It referred to Bert's humour, in that Bert had selected as one of the hymns for his funeral service the hymn entitled

         Much has been said about Bert Kelly's contribution to the parliament. I would like to briefly go through a few things about the way he did, indeed, take what at the time was a non&amp;hyphen;conventional view for many—an unpopular view, in many eyes—and worked on changing the attitude of the decision makers of this nation. I think it was an amazing achievement not only because of the fact that he did so but also because of the perseverance that it took. The changes had to occur over many decades, and yet Bert persevered all the way and never lost sight of what he was trying to achieve. I think in latter years it was probably with quite a lot of satisfaction that he saw what had been achieved. I know from some conversations I had with him that he really felt that many of the things that he had said had finally been vindicated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He was always highly respected, as others have said. He was always highly regarded. Another great achievement, as has been alluded to, is the fact that he contributed a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          total of 898 columns to various newspapers and other journals during his time. He ran Modest Member, Modest Farmer, Dave's Diary and other articles. It shows that he did have a huge commitment. Those who have read those articles always noted two things, amongst others. First, they were always easy to read and easy to understand. Secondly, they always had a strong message in them. As he said himself, he had to be sure of his facts because he knew there were plenty of others around ready to tear him apart. I think that the fact that the columns continued to be popular for so long and were read by such a wide audience shows that Bert really did have quite a gift in the way he could express himself, particularly in those columns.

         As has been mentioned by the current member for Wakefield, I do have a personal association with, firstly, the seat of Wakefield and, secondly, with Bert Kelly, because of the late Charles Hawker. Bert often cited Charles Hawker as being someone who inspired him to undertake not only his role in public life but also to adopt many of the views that he held. I would have to say that I am very proud of that association. One of the things that always encouraged me was the fact that Bert often spoke so highly of the late Charles Hawker and of his achievements during the time when he was in parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also like to say how encouraging I found Bert. I first got to know Bert when I came into parliament. I can remember not long afterwards joining the Liberal Party's federal rural committee, an organisational committee. One of the things that I think was quite unique about that committee—amongst many others—is that if you look through the minutes of that period you will see that under `attendance' there are three lines. Members of the committee are listed on the first line and parliamentary observers on the second line. Then there is a third line which just says `Bert Kelly'. It was always like that. That was the regard that Bert was held in. He was a life member, if you like, of the federal rural committee from that time until he was no longer able to  attend. It was assumed that Bert would always be there. He would come as often as he could. He would not try to impose
         <break page="56" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          his views but, nonetheless, he was always there to offer some advice. Occasionally he would make sure that the committee kept on the straight and narrow, as he saw it. I think his views were always greatly appreciated.

         The member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) alluded to the time in 1975 when Bert was speaking on his lonesome in the parliament during the running of the Melbourne Cup, so I will not repeat that story. The member for Barker went on to talk about Bert's role at public meetings and at Outlook conferences. I can well recall going to Outlook conferences—the local one is on today—where Bert would be sitting not at the front but right up the back. Those who have been to Outlook conferences will know that the lights are reasonably good at the front, but up the back it is not that easy to see anyone. And yet the chairman would be sitting, looking up there, waiting for the end of the speech, to see Bert. Generally Bert got the first call. Of course, that was an experienced chairman. He would let Bert have his three or four minutes, and then he would say, `Okay, now, Mr Kelly. You had a question, didn't you?' It was always put in such a polite way and it was always taken in such a polite way. I think it shows the sort of standing Bert had that, at those conferences, he was always recognised and always given the chance to put his point of view. It was welcomed there because of the incisive and yet very polite way he could put that point of view.

         Australia has lost a very fine man—someone who made a tremendous contribution to public life over a very long period of time, someone who also set very high standards and very high ideals for himself in the way he cared for his family. As the current member for Wakefield has pointed out, when his family spoke of him at his funeral they showed that the thing that they admired the most was the way he thought of his family first and foremost. I, like others, would like to extend to Lorna, his sons, Tony, Kim and Roger, and their children my deepest sympathy. We have lost a great person, but we have very great memories.

I eventually decided that, as a hotel keeper in that town, my education needed to be expanded a little bit beyond that place which many of us did not leave from year to year because it was so difficult to get anywhere else, having no sealed roads for quite a period of the time that I lived there. So I went to the local newsagent and ordered the

         To me, in those days, reading a newspaper was absolute luxury. In fact, I still have twinges of remorse when I sit down of a morning to read the newspaper as part of my duties, because in those days it was a great luxury. I get a feeling of guilt, so I wait till probably Sunday to catch up with half a dozen issues of the

         I am sure that those words had a great effect on my thinking when I came to this place. Bert Kelly not only addressed the tariff issue but also seemed to be able to put down that commentary on the politics of the day in a way, as others have mentioned, that was very easy to read and understand for a backwoods boy like me. The realities were that the views of Eccles, Mavis and Fred were all put succinctly. There was balance within the argument because each had a different point of view. I tended to find myself siding with Eccles and of course what Bert was saying in the background.

          It was a great time for me when I arrived in the parliament in October 1980. As others have reported, Bert had by then retired due to his lost preselection. I came up very promptly and found myself amongst his disciples. Some people have mentioned that he had some influence over John Hyde. I think it was more a fixation. Hyde, Peter Shack, Jim Carlton and a few of the others were quite clearly Bert Kelly disciples and carried on his message in a very vigorous way after his departure.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I think, in contrast to John Panizza, we can say of Bert that, having died in his eighties, he had a fortunate life. To last that long and, until the very later years, to enjoy an active and intellectual life, as he always did to the end, I think made Bert himself a fortunate man, particularly because, having had a long life, he actually lived long enough to see the fruits of his endeavours.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is quite remarkable that, notwithstanding the fact that he left the parliament and could no longer contribute directly in that fashion, he carried on. His disciples formed the Modest Members Society, of which I am a proud member. Bert was a regular visitor to some of our functions and kept our interests fired up. Not many of us in the federal scene have had a task of such magnitude to shift public opinion that far and to see the success of our efforts prior to our demise. Bert was very fortunate in all of that.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In saying those things, I recognise, as I do with John Panizza's family, that the loss of a loved one, such as Bert or John, is always a great shock even when it occurs in later years. We send to the families of John and Bert our sincerest regrets. None of us really like to think that they will ever lose loved ones, but we do.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I think Bert did have a fortunate life. He was a great contributor to Australia. He was an opinion maker and somebody who, in my view, did something that I aspire to—and that was to tell the king he is not wearing any clothes, and Bert without doubt did that. He explained and proved to Australians, to members of parliament, that there was no substance to the views they held in those days. They were commonly held and they
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           were probably believed by most. But, of course, the effect that tariffs and other things were supposed to have did not really materialise—they just taught us to be lazy—and Bert was the advocate of all that.

          I would like to close by recording my great support for a great man. The parliament has had others, but Bert's contribution was outstanding in a very significant area. What comes after disciples? There is a lesser row of people. I am afraid I am probably one of them. But I was glad to be amongst the Peter Shacks, the Jim Carltons, the John Hydes and others who so actively carried on. I might add that at the time our present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) might have been in my category—a bit more of a fellow traveller—but we were certainly all there arguing those particular issues and recognising the need for change.

          —I would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, in your excellent contribution on the life of Bert Kelly. Bert Kelly, as other members have said, made a magnificent contribution in the field of ideas both to this parliament and to Australia. He was always cheerful and he had great courage at a time when conventional ideas were very much against the arguments that he was putting forward in terms of tariffs and market economies.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Before I came to the parliament I used to have long discussions with Tony Street, the former member for Corangamite, about the ideas of Bert Kelly, his influence on the party room and the way in which he put those simple ideas to convince the prime ministers and the cabinet that maybe their ideas and their policies were incorrect. I well recall the story of Bert Kelly advocating in the party room that under the hen act in South Australia you were a professional hen operator if you had more than 25 hens. So he demonstrated in the party room that when you had 24 hens you were still a private operator and were not
         <break page="58" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          part of the regulation, but if you had 26 hens you were then part of the South Australian government's regulatory regime and you had to pay all the levies associated with the poultry act.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After, in the party room he demonstrated with a piece of wire catching the last hen around the header. In his usual humorous way he had clearly identified the argument that the regulation of the poultry act in South Australia would not work, and there were many farmers in the seat of Wakefield who obviously were not conforming with that particular regulation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Tony Street and I used to argue quite strongly and agree on the merits of those very powerful debates in those years when it was contrary to the wisdom of the day, with Black Jack McEwen advocating the higher and higher tariff barrier and, in my view, selling out country people. It was a lonely existence for Bert Kelly because—as other speakers have said, and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) demonstrated it quite ably—Bert Kelly in the party room was generally against the whole conventional wisdom of the Liberal Party, and the National Party in particular at that time, yet he pursued the argument itself and the ideas of lower protection and a more efficient market economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The major argument of the farmers and the miners was that they were the producers of real wealth in Australia, yet the tariff redistributed that wealth to the manufacturers, who thought they were being protected from other so-called predators on the international market. That was of course linked in with the centralised wage fixing system, which said that people in the manufacturing sector were entitled to be paid the basic wage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As other people have said, the Modest Member articles that appeared in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         and other publications around Australia had a major influence in the way in which they were put in such a humorous manner. Some 898 articles I think were produced. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said he read them in the back blocks of Australia and was influenced by the erudite economic wisdom that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          those articles portrayed, influencing both country people and I think the bureaucrats in Canberra. The freer trade and the clarity of his views I think are the key features that he leaves with Australia and the parliament. He pursued those arguments because he felt—and he had researched the points of view and the statistics that gave very conclusive proof—that tariffs did no good for average Australians.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As other members have mentioned, the Society of Modest Members was formed in 1981 by Jim Carlton, John Hyde and others who wanted to develop the general concept that there should be a freer market economy and that tariffs were not conducive to a better economic Australia. It was on that basis that the Society of Modest Members was formed. It was a group that developed in Canberra and comprised like&amp;hyphen;minded souls within the coalition. It now has like&amp;hyphen;minded souls in every state around Australia and has a very strong membership which debates these matters, even though Bert Kelly is no longer with us.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the deputy chairman of that society, I regard it as a great honour to be part of that ongoing legacy of Bert Kelly. The arguments range over issues such as the market economy, privatisation, deregulation and the ongoing tariff debate which is with us here in 1997. Under the diligent and excellent chairmanship of Len Bosman, the member for St George from 1963 to 1969, the society continues to provide an open forum for people who wish to look at the various ideas that might help and shape government policy on both sides of the parliament. So the legacy of Bert Kelly will continue through the Society of Modest Members, where people will openly and honestly debate the issues of the day with an orientation towards a market economy, lower tariffs and an opening up of trade throughout the world.

         It was a sad day in many ways when a number of us attended the funeral in Adelaide just 10 days ago as a mark of respect to a great life and a great contribution to the debate of ideas both in the parliament and in rural Australia. I acknowledge the fact that former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was
         <break page="59" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          present at the funeral. He, by his mere presence there and in the conversation I had with him, also recognised the contribution of Bert Kelly to the debate on both sides of the parliament and I think he—in reducing the tariff barrier by 25 per cent in one hit, in 1973, I think—recognised the very inadequate nature of the tariff barrier and the troubles it had caused in Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, we will all miss Bert Kelly—his famous case with `CRK' written on the side of it, as the honourable member for Wakefield will recall, his cheerful disposition, the way in which he presented a very compelling case to any meeting he attended and just that cheerful, humorous approach to a number of the arguments that persuaded the academics, the farmers and many of the political writers around Australia of the truthfulness of his proposition. So, on behalf of the Society of Modest Members, I express our deepest sympathy to his wife, Lorna, who had been his lifelong friend, supporter and adviser, and family who were there at that very moving service in Adelaide. Australia and the parliament have lost a very distinguished Australian who in many ways has made a lasting contribution to the changing climate of ideas and policies that have been developed in this parliament and throughout Australia.

          Perhaps my next memory of Bert was when he was a guest speaker at the Kimba Liberal Party branch. I was charged with the duty of going to Whyalla to pick up Bert. The hour that I travelled over a dirt road with Bert I guess fundamentally changed my life. We called into home on what was a pretty hot day. A cup of water was about all Bert needed to keep him going, and then he went into the meeting. His speaking style always gave messages in a very clear manner. When he got a hostile question from the crowd, he would simply say, `Well, how would you like to be a politician fronting up to all the various issues that politicians face up to?' He was that blunt and said things straight off the chest. You could not help but feel the integrity and the directness of the man.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I have a whole range of experiences of Bert in public meetings and all the rest of it. I will not dwell on them too long because, if he were here, he would talk about me giving tongue too long. But I have a couple of other memories that will stay with me forever. He had a wonderful saying that the trouble with the milk of human kindness is too much of it ends up on the cowshed floor. Bert was always able to bring that mixture of head and heart to the debate.

         <para first-indent="16">
          About three or four years ago, after Bert had left the parliament but I had entered it, I was going around the Wayville showgrounds and there was Bert. I did not think he would recognise me, a mere humble backbencher, but of course he did. He said g'day and asked how it was going. We had just lost the 1993 election, and he asked how this fella was going and that fella was going and about one thing or another. I said in relation to a particular individual who will remain nameless that I did not think he was enjoying it that much after the loss. Bert said to me, as quick as a flash, `You're not supposed to enjoy it, boy. What do you think this is?' That spirit of `you are here to do a job, not have fun' will stay with me, and that job involved tariffs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another part of my life which touched Bert's involved the Northern Territory and his interests in the north. As a young man I worked at Tipperary Station, and Bert paid it

          My final comment tonight is that Bert leaves us with a fine spirit of bipartisanship on this issue. The fact that Mr Gough Whitlam was at his funeral service and that Labor Prime Minister Mr Chifley visited the farm at Tarlee to be with Bert Kelly's father after the war showed the ability of Bert Kelly and his family to cross over the partisan boundaries in the national interest. In a book by Rattigan there are some fine words about the Tariff Board and about the integrity needed in this economic debate and which Bert Kelly gave Australia.

Others, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, have made significant contributions. I would like to speak briefly tonight and think it is appropriate to do so because the sacred sites that were the Kelly family sites were also my own family sites. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spoke earlier today, he referred to Bert Kelly having being born at Riverton. My father was born at Riverton and so was I.

          years ago, perhaps slightly more than that, I sat next to him on a plane and he gave me a book about the family farm to take home to Vin.

I mention that because there would not be all that many people who had been members of this place still being invited by the younger members of their party to speak at meetings.

Molly Byrne went on to win that election. Having disturbed a shift worker in the day and noting the size and the ferocious way in which the shift worker had answered the door, Bert very quickly said that he was calling on behalf of Molly Byrne and left quickly.

While we, tonight and this afternoon, express our sympathy to his family and friends and to his extended family, his children and grandchildren, I think we also should be celebrating a great life. I think that is the way Bert would like to be remembered.

          —It is the intention of the opposition to allow the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) through the House of Representatives. But we indicate that we are concerned about the detail that may be contained in what is proposed here and we believe that the implementation of these proposed measures and the way they are to operate will require some closer attention. We know we will not get that attention in this chamber, because we never get a decent response from the government—in particular, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). We saw yet again another appalling performance in question time today by the minister in attempting to say what he was going to do for small business. In this debate we will be foreshadowing action in the Senate to address the detail and the intent of this bill and to satisfy ourselves that it will achieve only its stated aim. I do not believe this approach would have been necessary if the processes of consultation that took place were not the sham we believe they were.

         The bill deals with changes to the diesel fuel rebate. As many members of this chamber would be aware, the diesel fuel rebate is a very sensitive issue. It is sensitive because of the cost that is involved and the concentration—and this issue no doubt will be raised by members on the other side of the House; that is, how so few in the mining industry account for the bulk of the spend that is associated with it. But to argue that point misunderstands the size and scale that is necessary in large mining ventures. Underneath all of this it should never be forgotten that what the diesel fuel rebate seeks to do is to correct a distortion in the marketplace brought about by the levying of a fuel excise and the impact it has, as an input to the cost of production, on our primary producing sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a benefit—a correction if you like—that  impacts both in the bush and in mining communities. It is something that was constantly trotted up to us in our 13 years in office by Treasury and Finance for abolition. When they failed on every occasion to secure
         <break page="62" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the abolition, there were always attempts to whittle it away. We are now at that again.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We on this side of the House believe that this is but the first wave in terms of the government's approach to trying to dismantle the diesel fuel rebate. We know it was a sensitive issue on the occasion of the preparation of the last budget because it went to the very credibility of the leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) as Leader of the National Party. We know, for example, because the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) admitted it, that the cut in the research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent was the trade&amp;hyphen;off for retaining the diesel fuel rebate. In other words, it was the price of retaining Tim Fischer's leadership as Deputy Prime Minister in this chamber.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you look at the amount of research and development that it has now been indicated will go offshore because of the cuts to research and development, one would have to argue that it was hardly a clever investment. Nevertheless, it again demonstrates the sensitivity of this issue—so sensitive that it was something that the Leader of the National Party, as the most senior member of the junior coalition party, was concerned about in that he saw it as a fundamental test of his leadership and his capacity to deliver.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the extent of the sensitivity of this issue is also borne out by the recent indication by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that it will not be up for cuts again in the coming budget. Within 24 hours of identification in the budget honesty document of the Costello crater—the government's own black hole—and the indication the Treasurer used to suggest that there would be further significant cuts in the forthcoming budget, the diesel fuel rebate was yet again singled out for particular treatment, to be cut, because Treasury had tried it last time and failed. The Treasurer is, as we know, persistent if nothing else, and it is clearly his intention to try and bring these things back. But it is something that the Prime Minister ruled out within 24 hours of the suggestion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is interesting to look at the statement that the Prime Minister made. He told
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          reporters in Ballarat that the scheme had already been examined for savings in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to last year's budget and he ruled out further cuts to the diesel fuel rebate. He reminded reporters at that particular gathering that changes were made and savings are coming from those changes and that, because they had already been subjected to cuts, they would be exempt from cuts in the forthcoming budget.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very interesting, because in question time today we sought to find out the extent to which this standard would be applied to other measures that clearly are in prospect for cuts in the forthcoming budget. If we take the figure of $440 million that is sought to be saved by this measure, that represents over the four&amp;hyphen;year period something like a 6.9 per cent cut to the expenditure on the diesel fuel rebate. We asked today whether, since 6.9 per cent is a significant cut vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis the diesel fuel rebate and it is therefore exempted from further cuts, the Prime Minister would rule out further cuts to research and development, which copped a 19 per cent cut in the last budget; would he rule out cuts to the labour market programs; would he rule out further cuts to the ABC—you could go through the list, because all of these areas were the subject of massive cuts in the last budget. But the only thing the Prime Minister so far has indicated a preparedness to rule out is the diesel fuel rebate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We will persist with this line of questioning because, quite frankly, the Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot rule one out and not the others. If in fact the test is that significant savings were achieved on the last occasion, it is a test that has got to be applied consistently, if the Treasurer's statement has any meaning and if the justification used by the Prime Minister in relation to the diesel fuel rebate late last week also has any meaning. Again I mention that point to indicate the sensitivity of this issue and why it deserves scrutiny, why we cannot simply assert that what we are doing here is simply tightening up to ensure that people who shouldn't be entitled to it don't get it. We on the opposition side don't quibble with that notion, but we want to ensure that it is being
         <break page="63" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          applied correctly and that it is not a backdoor method to dishonour yet another election promise.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other area where this has some sensitivity goes to the minister responsible for administering the Customs Act, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I notice that he is not in the chamber tonight, and little wonder, because we have pursued him on a number of occasions on the issue of conflict of interest. Remember that the minister for customs and excise is a director of and controls Prosser Automotive Engineers, a company in Western Australia that deals in diesel fuel. Here is the man responsible for administering the act that determines the retention, extension and application of the diesel fuel rebate, and yet he is personally a dealer in diesel fuel.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He argues—and I accept his word on this point—that he does not get the diesel fuel rebate himself. That is true, because he is not a user of diesel fuel. But because he supplies diesel fuel to a whole community around the south&amp;hyphen;west corner of Western Australia and beyond, clearly it is of significance to his business in supplying that fuel whether or not the diesel fuel rebate is retained and the extent to which it applies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are not alleging that Minister Prosser has been a direct beneficiary of the rebate, but rather argue that the indirect benefit he gains at least raises the potential for conflict of interest and that he should have declared that interest when this issue was raised in the cabinet. That is one point at which we argue the minister is against not only normal practice in this place about declaring interests and declaring involvement in the area but also the Prime Minister's code, this new code that the Prime Minister beat his chest about. That was the first statement in this parliament a little under 12 months ago. He came into this place and said, `I'm a different politician. I'm going to raise the standards of parliament. I'm going to insist on a new standard of accountability from my front bench and, therefore, I'm going to produce a code of conduct by which I require them to operate.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of those requirements in the code of conduct is that no minister shall retain
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          directorship in a private company. Here is a complete and blatant breach of the code of conduct by the minister concerned because he is still director and holds the controlling interest in Prosser Automotive Engineers. He does not deny that. The code of conduct is explicit—it says that you cannot retain it—yet the Prime Minister has refused to require him to divest himself of it. That is the first breach of the code of conduct.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second breach, in my view, is the one that I have already alluded to. Here is the appearance of conflict of interest—a minister that stands to gain indirectly from the extent to which the diesel fuel rebate continues to apply, a minister that has an active interest in understanding who can qualify for it and who can obtain benefit from it because he supplies the product that they are claiming the rebate on. Yet he does not declare that interest.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Contemptuously, we have the minister in this House, time and time again, when we have asked him to explain the conflict and to divest himself of it as the code requires, refusing to do so and the Prime Minister—leaderless, rudderless, without commitment to his code—refusing to act upon it. I think it is another demonstration of just how ineffective and weak a leader our Prime Minister is. This is his code. He has made great play of its importance, yet he refuses to act upon it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As to the code of conduct itself, I would also like to make the point that we exposed the sham that this code of conduct was back in October of last year, not only in relation to the minister for customs but also in relation to the
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)—the one who invented the Wright family, the family that did not exist—and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who was dealing in shares in venture capital when he had responsibility for that area.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We had the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who continues to make a galah of himself overseas, clearly against the national interest in relation to the DIFF scheme when he said that not one foreign government had raised the concern with him. We were

          —I understand why you might be, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am making the point that here we have a minister in breach of the Prime Minister's guidelines and a Prime Minister refusing to act. Again we have seen it, even in the last day or so, with the report that came from Mr Max Moore-Wilton. He was given the task of looking into the affairs of Mr Prosser, the minister for customs, and advising the Prime Minister on what should be done. That report was in the Prime Minister's hands back on 15 November and the Prime Minister did not release it until last night. For almost three months he has been sitting on a report which should have required him to act in a way that addressed the concerns we have raised about Minister Prosser and his particular involvement in administering the act that covers the diesel fuel rebate.

         In fact, this report says that it is appropriate for the Prime Minister to set out a code and that it is appropriate for ministers to report to the Prime Minister, but it sets out no requirement by which the Prime Minister is expected to take action. We believe this issue needs to be addressed further. The reason we argue it is that we have a litany of examples, only one of which involves the minister for customs and the administration of the diesel fuel rebate.

         Let me just come to the question, first of all, of the figure that, it is argued, will be saved. I know the minister is not here, but there are advisers for him and I would hope he would address this in his reply. We are advised by public statements that over four years these measures will yield something like $440 million in savings. That is the figure that we have relied upon in terms of the 6.9 per cent cut to the overall scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But if you look at the explanatory memorandum to this bill, there are calculations in that that can lead one to the view that the savings could be as high as $640 million. I would ask for clarification as to what the true figure is. I mean, $200 million is not an insignificant amount. In particular, given it is a 50 per cent jump in terms of that which is alluded to by way of savings, I would have thought it was an important issue to clarify.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I turn now to the concerns of the industry in relation to this bill and why we in the Labor Party believe that further responses are required, why further monitoring is needed and why further ability through Senate processes hopefully will get us to a clearer answer. I note that in the minister's statement, and indeed in his second reading speech, he said that these changes are the consequence of wide&amp;hyphen;ranging consultations with the industry.

         On the question of consultations, when the actual changes contained in the legislation were finally announced jointly by Ministers Parer and Prosser on 31 October, much was made of these close consultations. But following the introduction of the bill when the detail became apparent, the Minerals Council of Australia issued a press release expressing disappointment with the legislation as tabled and accusing the government of going beyond their agreement with them. I refer to the media release by the Minerals Council of Australia, which reads:

          Turning to the constituency that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, raised by way of a comment from the chair—the impact on the mining industry alone: concern has also been expressed by the National Farmers Federation. I refer to a report in the Melbourne

          What we have, Mr Deputy Speaker—and this point is important for you to understand—is that when this legislation is passed there will be a glaring anomaly between guidelines applying to the mining industry and those applying to the farming industry. We see that excluded from mining operations in this legislation and therefore from the eligibility to claim the rebate will be all vehicles with a gross weight of more than 3&amp;half; tonnes. The concern is that a substantial quantity of diesel is quite legitimately used on farms in such vehicles. I mention four&amp;hyphen;wheel drives, utes, light trucks, self&amp;hyphen;propelled boom sprays, et cetera. What will happen when this legislation is passed is that we will have a glaring anomaly in relation to the use of four&amp;hyphen;wheel drives and utilities. The mining industry cannot claim with respect to them but it is alleged that the farming sector can. That is the agreement. But do you think Treasury is going to leave it there? Do you think Finance is going to leave it there?

          The Expenditure Review Committee will trot out the argument that says, `Let's abolish the diesel fuel rebate because there are huge savings and we have to get the deficit down.' We will have all that drama again. We will have the Prime Minister riding in on the white horse, saving the day. We will have Tim Fischer going around on his two-minute stops saying that he will fight to the end to retain

           the diesel fuel rebate. But having fought out that little charade, the fall&amp;hyphen;back position for Treasury will be: if we have cut out the exemption, if we have cut out the entitlement, for these sorts of vehicles in mining operations, why should they be retained on farms?

They should not be, because what we have here is an attempt to restrict eligibility for access to the rebate for certain sorts of vehicles in the mining sector and the argument will become one that says: if it applies to the mining sector, if we can get savings out of them—and they are not insubstantial savings—why should we not go after the farm sector? Of course what the government will say is: `We have retained the diesel fuel rebate. It is just that we are cutting off a whole range of options as to who can claim it.' In name we will have a diesel fuel rebate; in fact we will have a significant reduction in those seeking to claim it.

I quote from a letter from the Acting Executive Director of APPEA, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, of 6 November. The letter states:

          Here we have assertions by the government that they have consulted industry on matters affecting them contained in this legislation. But we have got doubts raised by the farmers as to whether there will be an attempt to encroach on them in the future. We have got the petroleum and production exploration industry saying that the legislation does not reflect any agreement that was had with them.

But don't pretend that you have got agreement when you haven't and don't pretend that you are retaining the diesel fuel rebate when you are finding a backdoor method to emasculate it.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, I must say that I am a little disappointed, due to no fault of your own, that I have not been given the opportunity to follow a government member in this debate. I would have been particularly keen to hear how government backbenchers are responding to the bill that is currently before the House. However, I have to say that during my first speech in this place I made reference to the significance of the mining and agriculture sectors in my electorate. Indeed, I suggested that my electorate forms the engine room of New South Wales, supplying most of the coal that powers its power stations, the lion's share of its export coal and, of course, a great deal of its agricultural product. I think members will understand why I would take the opportunity to speak to any bill which has

         Of course, the bill seeks to enact changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme in order to restrict eligibility in the mining operations category to close loopholes and also to address recent Federal Court and AAT decisions that have had the effect of widening the definition of mining operations as it relates to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and to improve the accountability of the scheme and reduce the expenditure under the scheme from misuse.

         I hope that by now members on both sides of this House recognise and accept that the rebate is not a subsidy but indeed is a legitimate recognition that those who enjoy the benefits of the scheme do operate off&amp;hyphen;road and its retention is absolutely essential. Of course, it ensures that the mining and rural sectors are not hit or whacked with tax on their business imports. It is worth almost $800 million to the mining industry and almost that much again to the agricultural sector.

         Of course, it is a well&amp;hyphen;known fact that, in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to its first budget last year during its budget deliberations, the now government did consider the total abolition of the scheme.

So the Minister for Science and Technology came into this place to speak to a bill not all that dissimilar to the one before us tonight and to complain about how the government of the day, having announced the retention of the scheme, was somehow coming in the back door and reducing the benefits of the scheme to the industry.

         The legislation we are dealing with tonight is legislation that amends the scheme to improve its delivery and to minimise the number of potential rorts that may occur.

His endorsement, however, was much more fulsome than that of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean).

         The member for Hotham chose this debate to run a whole lot of red herrings that had nothing to do with the legislation before the House. The member for Hotham said, `We've had the Prime Minister stand up and reassure the mining industry and reassure the agricultural industry that there will not be further changes to the scheme in this budget.' Then the member for Hotham went on about a matter that I thought was totally unrelated and said, `I'm going to pursue the Prime Minister and pursue the Treasurer and seek the same sort of reassurance about the labour market, about the ABC and about every other area of government expenditure to see that it too will be quarantined from any changes in the coming budget.'

         Of all people in the opposition, the member for Hotham knows that no government runs into a budget quarantining various areas from expenditure cuts. If it does, there is no end to the list. The diesel fuel rebate scheme is such a sensitive area. It is an area that running into the last budget—as the member for Hunter was generous enough to acknowledge—caused the government some angst.

But, had the scheme been at risk, the member for Hunter might care to identify the number of people not only in rural Liberal seats, of which there is a multiple number, but also in National Party seats who would not have tolerated any such change, as he well knows. So prior to the announcement of the budget there was a reassurance that this was nothing more than nonsense, and precisely the same reassurance has preceded this budget.

The diesel fuel rebate scheme, whether it is in the mining industry or in rural industry, is frequently misunderstood because it is all too easily seen as some sort of gift to those who are the beneficiaries of the scheme. The reality, put by the member for Hunter and endorsed by me, is that this is not a case of the government giving something to those who are the beneficiaries of this scheme. Instead, it is a case of the government recognising the difference between primary industry and secondary industry and saying, `This tax which we the government levy on a number of industries and levy on all on&amp;hyphen;road users, no matter whether they are in primary or secondary industry, is not appropriate to be applied to primary industries.' That is the point made by the member for Hunter and he is absolutely right. This is not a case of revenue being handed out. This is a case of tax being deliberately forgone in recognition of the primary role of those industries.

         I would remind the House that that sort of approach to primary industry and to export income generating industries has always highlighted the tax attitude of the present government. It is true that a proposal that we had in 1993 is not now being considered, but this reinforces our long&amp;hyphen;term attitude to tax on export industries—that we do not believe it is appropriate to burden them with the tax. In that context we have maintained the policy of the previous government, a policy which we had when we were last in government, which says that this inappropriate application of a
         <break page="71" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          tax should have a refund mechanism. That is what the diesel fuel rebate scheme is all about.

         Only this week I received from an organisation called NatRoad an appeal on behalf of road transport operators to have the diesel fuel rebate scheme changed so that only what they referred to as the `road user charge' should, in fact, be rebatable. They had calculated the road user charge at 18c per litre.

        <para first-indent="16">
         They, too, misunderstood the nature of the scheme. The nature of the scheme is not a technique for effectively handing money back to anybody but to avoid the government collecting tax from an industry or an industry sector that should not have to pay it. We have agreed that that sort of requirement should apply in the mining industry. That is what this legislation is about. We have also recognised, as has the member for Hunter, that within the mining industry there has been the potential for rorting that is now being addressed in this legislation. Because the legislation does nothing but reinforce the integrity of the scheme, it deserves the unqualified support of both sides of the House.

          —The timing of this is all quite exquisite. After spending nine months talking about Labor's black hole, the opposition folk suddenly find they have got what we are choosing to call the Costello crater. I might say that, when you have got a novice in the chair, as you will come to understand, Treasury never gives up. I remember not very long ago, when this legislation was introduced and discussed in its first form, that there were announcements between the government and the mining industry and much was made of the consultations that had taken place and of the agreement that had been reached that this legislation was going to be simply tightening up loopholes within the industry. But of course what we find, now that the amendments have come back, is that it has gone considerably further.

         When the government announced the tightening up of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, it costed the savings to budget at $441 million over four years. But the explanatory memorandum now proposes a financial impact of $60 million per annum—that is, $240 million over four years—and, in addition, it refers to an extra $100 million saving of additional outlays relating to the AAT and Federal Court decisions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If all this is added in, the saving is $640 million over four years. That is considerably greater than the assurances given to the industry last year. If those figures are correct—they come from the government's own estimates—then I wonder whether the government have any idea at all what the savings really are. If they do, then they have slipped this through the very people who have been quite close to them. This is a case of good friends being ratted on. They are taking it pretty hard, too, I might say. They have not only slipped it through but also added another 30 million bucks worth via some redefinitions in these new proposals.

         I said that I think there is a deeper motive at work here. In January, during what they call the silly season—maybe it was a silly statement—the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) let out a press comment which gave us some focus on the direction of this government towards the priorities in commodities and primary industry. His comments were that Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials than on developing processing industries. For that, read `downstream processing, value adding, extra jobs'. Minister Anderson said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding.

         Where, in this little piece of legislation, is the extra bit of revenue being dug out? It is in the changes to a process, which they have dreamed up, called `beneficiation'. Put in layman's terms, it is where you use diesel

         Some examples in the mining process which are closer to the mined and extracted end than the final marketable commodity, such as a slab of processed steel, for instance, are processes such as roasting, sintering, smelting, calcining and leaching. It applies right across the mineral sands, gold and coal industries. They have these integrated processes that are part of taking the raw extracted product—you understand this well, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, because of the work that takes place in your electorate—and preparing it for the phase of refining and downstream processing. Admittedly, it is further than the stage where you dig it up, stick it in a boat and sell it as a raw product. It actually involves the part of the process that starts to create a few extra jobs. I go back to the minister's comment. He said:

This is where they will find out whether they

Nobody in either agriculture or farming expected that the diesel fuel rebate would turn up on the budget table again. They had been through many years of seeing it examined. Successive Labor governments had maintained the diesel fuel rebate, in the face of considerable pressure from Treasury, as an obvious cost saving measure.

         The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) touched on the issue of farmers not needing to have any concern. For heaven's sake, the miners were told last October: `This is as far as we intend to go.' Now, by January, which is just a quiet three months later, we have already slipped another $30 million worth in, including the vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Farmers of course can do little else but stare at the media about the Costello crater. They know that there are going to be more budget cuts from this government because they got it so wrong and, no matter what assurances they get, they are going to have to seriously expect that the case for 3.5&amp;hyphen;tonne or less vehicles out on remote mine sites is absolutely no different from the use of vehicles in that weight category, whether they are spraying equipment or four&amp;hyphen;wheel&amp;hyphen;drives driving around the farm, when it comes to farming or mining.

         There is one other aspect of this that I want to touch upon. Some figures released yesterday from the Bureau of Statistics show that the mining and exploration industry has increased its investment in offshore exploration—I do not mean off the Australian coast; I mean exploration in other countries vis-a-vis exploration in Australia—by 13 per cent in the last 12 months. When you ask the industry why they have taken that investment offshore, they tell you that a number of factors taking place in Australia are causing them to be less certain than they were when they were investing their heads off in exploration and development under Labor.

It is absolutely clear that, once Senator Walsh left the Finance portfolio, the so-called Treasury boffins had it very much their own way.

          Treasury. I go back to the gold tax days, back to 1986, when there was a strong move to bring in a gold tax. I argued against it very strongly. I remember having a meeting with Hawke and Keating. I said, `If you leave gold alone, it will go through a billion dollars.' In those days I think it was something like $300 million a year. `What rubbish,' said Keating. He said, `I talked to the mining industry,' by which he meant Western Mining. He said, `My experts in Treasury tell me it will peak at $800 million.' It went to $4 billion. I was wrong at a billion dollars, but I was a damn sight closer than Treasury. That is the intellect you are dealing with here. If they see a ready source of income, they will grab it no matter what the consequence is.

         The tax on diesel was originally supposed to be for funding infrastructure. The mining companies and the farmers do not use that infrastructure; they create their own. They therefore should not be paying for it. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) said that this is still on the agenda. Actually I do not think it is. The government would not be game to do it again because the mining companies showed how angry they were. Farmers are powerless. There are so few of them. They have no lobbying power. They have become political eunuchs. But the mining industry would not cop it. They have been dudded, because in my estimation it is another $100 million they have been hit for, not $30 million. The government is clamping down in all sorts of ways. There is the absurdity that there is no diesel rebate for mine water pumped off a mine site. You cannot legislate for where the water occurs, you actually have to get it where it is, and in some cases it is off the mine site.

They are doing a great job for Australia. It is good for the country that they are employing people and tax is being paid on their income. But they are working on very fine margins because gold is at a very low price in Australia today, and it is a great tribute to the industry that we have become so efficient in the mining of it.

         We ought to have a look at what is really happening. If these people who advise governments thought about it, they could do the country some good. There is no reason in most cases why the mining industry cannot use light crude oil for a lot of its energy sources. Certainly in powerhouses it is a sensible option. It is much cheaper. What is happening now is that we are pumping out the light crude, we are exporting it to Singapore and then reimporting the refined diesel. I am sure there is an absolute net loss to us in that transaction. Also, we are importing a lot of high&amp;hyphen;speed diesel engines. Because of the high wear on them, we give them a tax write&amp;hyphen;off over five years whereas the big, slow revving engines that use light fuel oil get a tax write&amp;hyphen;off over 25 years.

It does not have enough contained carbon. It does not give off enough black smoke. It burns too clean.

In the 1996-97 budgetary year, the outlays of the scheme for the mining category were in the order of $793.7 million. Why the scheme had grown beyond its original intent was in some part due to successful claims to the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The legislation seeks to contain that growth and to correct that movement of the scheme into areas it was not previously intended for.

That audit report, as I recall, was Audit Report No. 20. It made reference to overclaiming and the need for tighter compliance with and administration of the scheme. The bill picks up that tighter compliance and better administration and better accountability referred to by the Auditor-General's report.

          —The Labor opposition does not oppose the passage of the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996 or the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1996. These two bills are fundamentally linked to the large package of legislation concerning the regulation of the telecommunications industry post-July 1997. The policy principles on which this package of legislation was based were drafted by the former minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee).
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The post-July 1997 legislation is currently the subject of a public inquiry being conducted by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. Public hearings of the committee commenced on 29 January and continue on 7 and 14 February. The committee is due to report to the Senate on 25 February.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the Senate did not formally refer these two bills to the telecommunications bills inquiry, the bills have been the subject of extensive debate by witnesses appearing before the Senate committee and by members of that committee. This is the situation in the Senate. I am not always so fulsome in my recognition of events in the other place, but both the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the shadow minister for communications dealing with this matter are senators. I understand they have had some discussion as to whether these bills should be before the House tonight, because they have obviously been trying to progress some of these matters with the witnesses and the evidence that has been placed before the Senate committee—of which Senator Schacht is a member.
        </para>
        <break page="78" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Given the obvious interrelationship between the post-July 1997 legislation and these two bills, no members of the Senate committee, which is chaired by Senator Short, objected to the issues contained within the bills being discussed at length. What I am foreshadowing essentially is that any items the Labor Party might want to move by way of amendment will flow through the Senate process following the deliberations and report of that Senate committee. Those matters will be addressed by the shadow minister for communications, Senator Schacht.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While the Labor opposition supports in principle the two bills currently before the House, members of the Senate committee have expressed concern that, given such considerable debate of the bills before their committee by key industry participants and consumer representatives and given the fact that witnesses have raised a number of seemingly valid points in relation to the bills, consideration should await that particular Senate committee report. Accordingly, it is our strong belief that the final passage of these bills should not proceed in the Senate, and if need be by way of consideration of Senate amendments, in this House until that process is complete. A further reason for delaying final passage of the bills is that the Senate committee is still waiting for answers to questions on notice on these two bills—including information from the Department of Communications and the Arts. This information may be relevant to the final wording of the bills.

          Generally, it needs to be recognised that, in this period of telecommunications competition, some telephone numbers are commercially valuable. It is no secret that for most businesses the requirement of a recognisable, easy to remember telephone number has commercial value. In that sense, the numbers should be regarded as a community resource. It is quite proper, the Labor Party believes, for the government to levy fees, charges, taxes, whatever is necessary, to place a premium on that particular community resource.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We do not believe for a single minute that any of those principles should apply to nor
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           mal residential telephone numbers. They should not be covered by any user fee or any attempt by government to raise revenue. It has been an Australian tradition, I understand, from the good old days when Telstra was the public monopoly and had all the numbers, that they were provided free of charge. We recognise the community resource, the commercial importance of some telephone numbers—the ones that are easy to recognise and easy to remember—and government has a legitimate revenue raising function in that area, but it should not be expanded to cover any of the allocations of telephone numbers for residential use.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other matter I wanted to raise is somewhat closer to home—the question of telephone numbering and telephone zones. This is a particular issue in my electorate of Werriwa. The seat spans the south-west of Sydney. Two-thirds of the seat, from Minto north, is in the 02 telephone zone, and the bottom third, or southern third of the seat, is in the 046 telephone zone. So the northern two-thirds of my electorate is within the Sydney metropolitan zone and the bottom one-third of the electorate is in the 046 zone. This is a particular issue in my electorate. I would hope that if competition and technological progress in telecommunications is to bring benefits to average Australians—

          That has always been the irony of the 02 zone. The eastern half of that zone—if you draw the full circle—is across the ocean because the zone is centred on the Sydney CBD. It was drawn in a configuration when Sydney was a much smaller place, when Campbelltown, which is now disadvantaged by being placed in the 046 zone, was literally a country town. It is no more in the country these days than any other part of the great

As we have more active competition and a greater number of residential telephone providers, they should be actively competing in the urban fringe market to break down the sort of disadvantage that consumers have suffered for far too long.

          I urge the government to address this serious issue. It is most acute in terms of business development. I mentioned that the boundary between the 02 metropolitan telephone zone and the 046 zone cuts through the suburb of Minto in my electorate. Minto actually has an industrial estate. You can tell the business consequences of this. The portion of the Minto industrial estate in the 02 zone—that is, the northern portion—is fully built out. There is full economic development and location of firms in that part of the estate. Where they move into the 046 zone—you can literally see the divide at the boundary between the two zones—there is no take&amp;hyphen;up of the residential land. Business is obviously discouraged by the fact that they would be located in the 046 zone and have much higher telephone costs in the normal conduct of their business activities.

           year I placed a question—question No. 35—on notice to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts, to try to flesh out and gain the detail about the level of disadvantage in the two telephone zones within my seat. I was disappointed that the minister would not provide information about the unit cost of telephone calls out of the 046 zone. He said that that information was commercial-in-confidence. As long as Telstra is publicly owned—it still is majority publicly owned—I think there is an important responsibility to have some information available to the public as to how its cost structure is framed and what element of cost recovery or more applies in that 046 telephone zone.

          I was a bit disappointed that the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts—he has now joined us in the House—was not able to provide that information. I suppose his hands were tied. The useful part of his answer was just to point out the difference in telephone charges from 02, the Liverpool portion of my electorate, to 046, the Campbelltown portion. For instance, to make a telephone call, day or night, out of Liverpool to the Sydney CBD—this must be the most frequent call that businesses in my electorate make—there is a 25c flat charge. The local call rate applies. The Campbelltown portion of my electorate, to the south—in some instances, merely 100 metres from one business to the other as the boundary is formed—the rate is 25c per three&amp;hyphen;minute call. That is a severe disadvantage for businesses that frequently make their calls to the Sydney CBD.

In Avalon Beach to the north of Sydney the community call rate of 25c per three&amp;hyphen;minute period applies from Liverpool.

         Optus's published tariffs include a monthly charge reflecting the intrinsic value of a particular number. This intrinsic value is based on the ease of recognition of patterns of digits.

Instead, the charges that Austel will determine will be disallowable instruments, so parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise the level of charges. Carriers and service providers who, say, pay $200,000 for a block of numbers will be able to levy differential charges on the numbers they perceive as the most and least valuable to their respective customers.

         I will keep my comments brief, but I believe that this is a very important matter being addressed in this bill. I compliment the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, for his role in this and also the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senate Alston) in another place.

          —in reply—I want to take a few moments to summarise the debate. Firstly, I thank the members for Werriwa (Mr Latham), Dunkley (Mr Billson) and Bendigo (Mr Reid) for their contributions, particularly the members for Dunkley and Bendigo, who elaborated on the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           second reading speech when we introduced these two bills late last year.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Dunkley talked at length about the concerns and the rationale behind changing the numbering fee charging system. It will be done by Austel, the experts in this field. It will be a disallowable instrument and it will reflect the true value of those numbers—they have been talking about specialised numbers, not about the standard or business connection phones—to recoup, to the benefit of taxpayers and the Commonwealth, significant amounts of money because of the value of those numbers. I thank him for his contribution which was very erudite.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Bendigo referred to the other bill that is being introduced primarily in relation to emergency services, and what is emerging as an increasing reliance on emergency services being accessed other than by 000 numbers. He did not mention at any length the privacy considerations, but they are also taken care of in that amendment bill. I thank him for his remarks about those matters that we see as a proliferation. He mentioned the TTY services for the hearing impaired, for example. It is extremely important that they be able to access emergency services. He cited the recent difficulties in Victoria where we saw the requirement because of the fires for people to access emergency services very quickly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was one point that was mentioned by the members for Werriwa and Dunkley and it related to zonal charging arrangements. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I think you even mentioned it yourself. Communities outside urban centres have difficulties with the charging regimes because of these zonal arrangements. This was identified in a report in 1989 called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Poles Apart
         </emphasis>
         . It has been a continuing issue. I think the member for Werriwa, in a moment of complete honesty, indicated that this has been a problem for some considerable time. I notice that the shadow minister at the table, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), was the Minister for Transport and Communications at the time we first started to discuss how to deal with this problem.

          Those matters will obviously continue to be considered by the carriers and the government. Difficulties arise at times, and of course we are aware of those. We hope that as we move to a more highly deregulated and competitive arrangement in telecommunications these issues will be addressed successfully to the benefit of consumers.

           for a government to introduce a Charter of Budget Honesty Bill when it has been responsible for the most dishonest budget probably introduced into this country since Federation. How can the government credibly choose to talk about budget honesty when in last year's budget they broke at a minimum $17 billion worth of promises? To give just a sampling of the scores of broken promises that did occur in last year's budget, let me mention these: for a start, the coalition promised `to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC'. That was broken before the budget with there now being a $209 million cut to the ABC scheduled over a four&amp;hyphen;year period. The coalition promise that it had no plans `whatever to change the operational subsidy to the community based long day care sector' was broken by the budget abolishing operational subsidies for community based long day care which will increase fees by at least $14 per child per week.

In no part is the blame for this due to anybody other than the Liberal-coalition government federally and the Liberal government at the ACT level.

         People in the community are alarmed to the point of despair as to what they believe they have done to deserve such treatment from a government of this calibre, particularly when we recall not that far back the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) kept making statements such as, `We will govern for all of us. This is a parliament and a government for all of us.' It seems that the government has excised the ACT out of the map of Australia, because I cannot think of any other reason why the ACT is being treated in such a draconian fashion.

         The most alarming thing about Access Economics' announcement that we are now in a formal recession is that this really cements very clearly in the community's mind the fear that they have been suffering and experiencing over the last few months.

They have not done that because they are scared to spend their money. They are scared because they do not know whether either or both of them will have their job next week or next month.

The ongoing effect of that is that you have this down spiralling of economic confidence and business suffers as a result. Because of this lack of confidence, you have businesses unwilling or scared to employ anybody new.

          <break page="87" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Marsden Home for Boys situated at Kallangur in my electorate. The rural training program basically addresses the needs of very disadvantaged youth. I speak in particular of young people who have in many respects come on the wrong side of the law, have come from broken homes and are very difficult to manage and, more particularly, to get into and keep in a program of this nature.

         It was my great pleasure just before Christmas to attend the Marsden home for the graduation ceremony of six graduates from this course. Seven people were enrolled in the course, but one could not complete for a number of reasons that were not relevant to the capacity of the trainers. Six people completed the course and all six were placed in out-stations all around Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and parts of Queensland, I am pleased to say.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At that graduation ceremony we witnessed a number of demonstrations by these boys—the course is also open to girls—all aged between 18 and 22. We saw such things as the use of the tractors; riding of horses; operation of chainsaws, in particular in relation to fencing; and some skills in relation to the growing of small crops. It was a great pleasure to be there and present these boys with their graduation certificates and, as well, to hear them speak about the pleasures and benefits that they gained from doing such a course.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I emphasise how important this is to the community and how, whilst in this particular case the trainers had an almost 100 per cent success rate in terms of outcome, we ought not necessarily focus on outcomes as an economic rationalist way of looking at training in this particular case. We should have regard to the nature of the boys who come to do these courses—their background and the sorts of problems they have had in the community. The fact is that it is saving the community an awful lot of money to have them training in this way and also going to jobs rather than have them on the wrong side of the law, re&amp;hyphen;offending and causing enormous social dislocation in the community. So I was very pleased to see that they did graduate.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, I have since had an unfortunate occurrence. I have now been told by Fusion that the department has come back to them and said that their outcomes are not sufficient and that they need better outcomes overall. Figures were produced to show that over a period of time their outcomes were down to about 25 per cent. As the head of the program said to me, `Well, anyone can produce figures. We had 100 per cent last time.' Apparently, they have looked into the system and found that over time a number of people have gone back on unemployment benefits. However, the fact of the matter is that, even if only 25 per cent of these boys and girls are placed in work, in a situation where we are dealing with this sort of disadvantaged youth we are achieving great outcomes and savings to the community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In my view, any criteria on the basis that there must be guarantees in relation to outcomes really has to be looked at again, since it has been said to me by the trainer that they are looking for a guarantee that there will be a 70 per cent outcome. In my respectful opinion, that is not realistic in relation to disadvantaged youths in circumstances such as these.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So I hope that this situation will be reviewed and that there will be a continuation of the Bunya Bunya training program. It is serving the people of Dickson, serving the people of Pine Rivers and, overall, saving the community enormous sums of money by not having these people incarcerated.

          —In this adjournment debate I would like to speak about the work of the Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This chamber has been promoting business and employment growth in western Sydney for over 40 years. The chamber represents some 1,000 businesses in western Sydney and is active in seeking ways to assist both business and local communities by promoting full employment and business opportunities.

         <break page="88" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          market programs and is equally interested in continuing this cooperation. To this end, the chamber recently accepted responsibility to promote traineeships as part of a national program which has proved to be of enormous assistance in providing trained candidates with employment. The chamber's responsibility in this program is designed to promote traineeships from the Hawkesbury through to Burwood.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, DEETYA, Nettforce and the Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce and Industry are working together with group and industry training companies on a pilot program. John Camp, who is the chamber's regional training marketing consultant, is one of 10 consultants who has been selected to coordinate this national program. With the upcoming Olympic Games, considerable employment growth is expected in western Sydney. Industries such as the media, information technology, sport and recreation, hospitality and business services will attract future employees and apprentices of all ages. With progressive organisations like the chamber operating in the region to tap into major projects like the Olympic Games, the prospect for employment of young people should improve considerably.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

         The chamber is currently considering a project for 1997—the development of a research department. This department will determine the needs, strengths and weaknesses of small business at a local government, regional and state basis. The purpose of this project would be to develop a structure that could establish information relating to the reasons for the success or failure of small business in a defined area, to determine areas where additional training is required and to advise governments on legislative changes to assist small business. The research project is aimed at a wider area than western Sydney and would focus particularly on small- to medium-sized businesses.

         In summary, the project is aimed at improving economic development, increasing membership, improving services to members, obtaining information to lobby government, training in public relations development and establishing a statistical research unit which would be able to be self-funding. The chamber would be seeking funding from DEETYA to assist them to set up and train the research team. There is sufficient evidence available, based on previous successful chamber projects, for this particular idea to be the subject of further joint investigation. As the federal member for this area, I would be actively supporting this chamber's many employment generating projects.

          —I would like to begin by advising the House of some public meetings in my own electorate, called by residents in opposition to a plan by Vodafone to build a 30&amp;hyphen;metre telecommunications tower in Bon Mace Crescent in Tumbi Umbi. The first I learned of this was in mid&amp;hyphen;January when local residents advised me that they were planning to hold a public meeting a couple of days later in a park adjacent to the proposed site of the Vodafone tower. That public meeting was surprisingly well attended, with 150 to 200 local residents expressing their opposition to Vodafone's plans to build the mobile phone tower in an area that has quite a dense residential population and is relatively close to a number of local schools.

         There were a number of questions from members of the public to the mayor, Doug Eaton, and me about whether we were aware that Vodafone had originally sought an alternate site—an alternate site that some members of the public thought was on a ridge away from the residential population at a location in Anderson Road. The mayor advised the 150 residents that he had checked this out and it was incorrect. I discovered a few days later that, contrary to the mayor's claims and the advice that he had given to the residents at the public meeting, Vodafone did in fact lodge a formal application with Wyong Council to build the tower on a ridge in Anderson Road in Berkeley Vale. I am very pleased that, at its last meeting, Wyong Council reconsidered its position and has now resolved to oppose Vodafone's second pre ferred site in Bon Mace Crescent, Tumbi

If 1 July comes and a telephone company hasn't finished the construction of the tower, the government's transitional provision shouldn't allow the telephone companies in effect to have an exemption from the federal and state planning powers for years to come. I think that 1 July deadline should be quite firm.

         Tonight I want to raise my concerns about interest rates, particularly high business loan overdraft rates. Home loan interest rates have continued to fall by up to 2&amp;half; per cent since the coalition took office less than 12 months ago, to the lowest levels in 30 years, creating massive savings for families and first home buyers in the range of $188 per month. Coupled with continued low inflation and sound economic management by our govern ment, most Australians can look forward to

         However, I wish to raise my concerns over business interest rates. Whilst banking deregulation has seen intense competition in the home loan market, business interest rates have remained unacceptably high. During 1996, we saw the major banks announce massive profits. On 12 November last year, Westpac announced a net annual profit of $1.13 billion. On 20 November, the ANZ Banking Group announced, according to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Canberra Times
         </emphasis>
         , a dazzling, higher than expected profit of $1.116 billion for 1995&amp;hyphen;96. The National Australia Bank also released a record net profit of $2.1 billion. Even the St George Bank released a 1996 net profit of $148.3 million—a rise of nine per cent over 1995. I understand that these financial institutions have obligations to their shareholders, but I also believe the major banks have an obligation to pass on reductions in official interest rates to the small business sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst home loan interest rates have fallen to levels that we have not seen in this country for 30 years, business and personal loans remain high. Businesses are still burdened with interest rates of 14 per cent or higher, with penalty rates of up to 17 per cent if you should exceed your overdraft limit, even for one day. In addition, many banks have now introduced increased charges; for example, $15 for each and every cheque that is cashed while the business account remains in excess of the approved overdraft limit.

Only now can small business begin to invest with confidence in the sound economic environment of consistently low interest rates and low inflation.

         My electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast relies heavily on small business. We have few major employers, but we have a vital economy with new businesses opening up every day. Robertson is the fastest growing electorate in New South Wales and the seventh fastest in Australia. We need the banks to get off the back of small business and to pass on the falls in official interest rates not only to home loans but to business overdrafts as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's efforts to revitalise small business are being stifled and blocked at every corner by the attitude of the major banks: by their never&amp;hyphen;ending increasing fees and charges, by their unwillingness to pass on realistic lower  interest rates, and by the distinct change in attitude that has occurred in relation to customer service by the major banking organisations over the past decade. It would appear that the banks are preoccupied with profit, preoccupied with forcing customers to use electronic and telephone banking services and preoccupied with the reduction of branches and staffing levels.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another negative by&amp;hyphen;product of this attitude is the lack of savings incentives, particularly for young people. Australians have a dangerously low level of savings, and yet the big brother, standover attitude that is often experienced when young people attempt to open savings accounts is hardly conducive to creating increased savings habits. There is something drastically wrong when you receive three per cent to save and yet are charged 15 per cent to establish a business investing in the future of this nation and creating jobs for all Australians. This cannot be allowed to continue.

          The Mid&amp;hyphen;year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the last few days with great fanfare is a searing indictment of the government's attitude to continuing high unemployment. Page 1 of the Mid&amp;hyphen;year Economic and Fiscal Outlook refers to growth in GDP of 3&amp;half; per cent expected in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, unchanged from the forecast at budget time. The paper then refers to it being accompanied by moderate but continuing employment growth, and the forecast for employment growth is unchanged. On page 4 of the outlook document we see the comment:

          The labour market is expected to improve, but only at a pace sufficient to generate a gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Achieving faster reductions in unemployment will be dependent upon opportunities taken to adopt more flexible arrangements in the labour market.

         <para style="Para">
          When you turn to the key table on page 4, you find that, so far as the labour market is concerned, the employment forecast  has not changed from the budget to the revised forecast. The participation rate from the budget forecast to the revised forecast has not changed either—63¾per cent. But, for the unemployment rate, the forecast is from the budget forecast of 8¼ per cent to an increased revised forecast of 8&amp;half; per cent.

          Here we see the government presiding over 3&amp;half; per cent growth in GDP in the economy, with increasing unemployment. What commitment do we see from them on reducing unemployment? The only commitment we see from them is the mystical solution that achieving faster reductions in unemployment will depend upon opportunities taken to adopt more flexible arrangements in the labour market. They are handcuffed to that. When those changes do not improve unemployment one iota, the government will stand absolutely condemned.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Speaker, I have two questions to you relating to question time yesterday. After the response of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training in answering a question, the Prime Minister rose in his place and asked that further questions be placed on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         . However, a further question was allowed by the member for Capricornia. Can you look at the videotape of proceedings of question time and determine whether page 6311 of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         accurately reflects what actually occurred in question time.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         My second question relates to page 6305 of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         and the question asked by the honourable member for Hinkler regarding pensioner entitlements. According to House of Representatives Practice, page 524 of Browning, questions should not be asked without notice reflecting questions on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         . I draw your attention to questions No. 905 to the Treasurer, No. 907 to the Minister for Social Security and No. 908 to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Whilst I appreciate that this was not brought to your attention at the time, would you consider writing to the ministers in view of the breach of standing orders and requesting an early response to those questions on notice.

         I would not propose to respond in the House to all questions to me. I will however see that on those occasions when I do write to a Member, the response will be included in Hansard in much the same way as questions on notice.

At the same time, an Airbus A320&amp;hyphen;211 aircraft (A320), was on a short final approach for landing on runway 25. Runways 34 and 25 intersect, and Simultaneous Runway Operations (SIMOPS) were in progress. Landing instructions to the crew of the DC&amp;hyphen;10 included a requirement for the aircraft to be held short of the intersection of runways 34 and 25. A Boeing B747 aircraft was holding on taxiway Victor (EVE), north of runway 25 and west of runway 34, awaiting the landing of the A320 and a subsequent clearance to cross runway 07/25. While observing the DC&amp;hyphen;10's landing roll, the captain of the A320 judged that the DC&amp;hyphen;10 might not stop before the intersection of the runways. He elected to initiate a go&amp;hyphen;around from a low height above the runway. Under heavy braking, the DC&amp;hyphen;10 slowed to about 2 knots ground speed, at which time the nose of the aircraft was approximately level with the edge of runway 07/25. During the go&amp;hyphen;around executed by the crew of the A320, that aircraft passed above the DC&amp;hyphen;10 on its left and the B747 on the right of its flight path.

        (1) Yes. The previous planning for a second airport was based on projections contained in the 1985 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that significantly underestimated the growth in aircraft movements. The median 1985 figures projected around 12 million passengers for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in 1995. Actual 1995 passenger numbers exceeded 18 million. In 1985, the median projections for 1995 aircraft movements were around 216,000, while actual movements in 1995 exceeded 260,000.

One of the options at Badgerys Creek is within the existing site boundaries and I understand that a 360,000 aircraft movement per annum airport could be constructed, with terminal facilities and associated infrastructure to cater for up to 30 million passengers per annum. Two further options at Badgerys Creek and two options at Holsworthy are being assessed to enable the EIS team to demonstrate clearly the trade&amp;hyphen;offs between the noise, airspace, natural environment, cost and other impacts.

        (1) I am aware of the support of over 30 NSW rural local government councils for the establishment of an international freight airport at Parkes. However, to date the proposal has not been subject to any rigorous analysis and assessment and the proponents of the project, the Inland Marketing Corporation, have not been able to demonstrate the viability of the concept.

        (2) Parkes is located in a major agricultural production area. It is very well connected to other regions of Australia by rail and road. It is located on the Newell highway, the principal north&amp;hyphen;south road corridor in inland eastern Australia. Addition

The cost of the provision and operation of any such infrastructure would have to be able to be recovered from the users of the facility.

        The Inland Marketing Corporation, the proponents of an international air freight airport at Parkes, have suggested that the facility would handle some 882 B747 freighter flights into and out of the airport (an average of 2.4 B747 services per day carrying 150,000 tonnes of freight annually) by year 3 of the airport's operations. This is more freight than is currently carried from the combined Australian international gateways other than Sydney and Melbourne and is equal to Melbourne's current performance. The proposed number of flights would be equal to the total number of dedicated freighter services currently operating out of Australia.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) The entry contribution system, which has been operating in hostels since 1988 and will be extended to nursing homes from 1 July 1997, does not have an assets test. Entry contributions are negotiated between the resident and the provider, subject to a number of protections, including the provision that the resident must be left with a minimum assets level, currently $22,500, after paying the entry contribution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The honourable member for Sturt may be referring to the Financially Disadvantaged Persons provisions, which provide a higher subsidy for residents unable to pay entry contributions. These provisions currently define as a Financially Disadvantaged Person, a resident who is a full pensioner and has not owned a home in the previous two years. There is no definition of `home' and the current Hostel Manual uses this term and `house' interchangeably. Evidence about a resident's housing status primarily depends on the resident's statements to the hostel, and it is likely that the treatment of a person who had an interest in a retirement village unit would vary between hostels.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The Financially Disadvantaged Persons provisions are currently under review by a working group comprising representatives of peak consumer and industry organisations. It is likely that the definition of home ownership will be clarified to include residents who have a financial interest in their residence which is saleable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The honourable member may also be thinking of the Department of Social Security's pension assets test, under which a person is defined as a home&amp;hyphen;owner for pension purposes if they have paid a contribution of over $88,500 towards a retirement village unit. If they have paid a lesser contribution, this amount is treated as a non&amp;hyphen;financial asset.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The Commonwealth will be consulting with State Governments with a view to seeking appropriate changes in state nursing home and hostel licensing regulations in line with the integration of the nursing home and hostel systems under the Residential Aged Care Structural Reform Package. Commonwealth legislation governing nursing homes and hostels will be replaced with new unified legislation covering residential aged care, which is now being drafted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) The residential aged care needs&amp;hyphen;based planning formula builds in recognition of changes in population demographics, because it sets a ratio of 100 residential care places per 1,000 people aged seventy and over. Hence, as the population over seventy rises, the number of residential care places will rise proportionately.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        With the integration of the nursing home and hostel systems from 1 July 1997, the current separate nursing home and hostel ratios, now 40 and 50 places respectively, will be collapsed into a single residential place ratio of 90 places per 1,000 people over seventy, which with a ratio of 10 Community Aged Care Packages per 1,000, will comprise the needs&amp;hyphen;based planning ratio of 100 places per 1,000 people over seventy.

         Since the electoral division of Swan contains only the main campus of  the Curtin University of Technology, it is not possible to identify funding allocated to higher education provision specifically in Swan. The Commonwealth provides operating grant funding in the form of a single operating grant to higher education institutions and they are responsible for allocations to their individual campuses. The following table contains the funding allocated to all higher education programs at the Curtin University of Technology since 1989.

        (1) Untrained staff will not be required to perform nursing duties under the new arrangements. The new arrangements will ensure that residential care services meet standards that are acceptable to the community and will encourage facilities to exceed them. In particular, accreditation will require that appropriate care is given by appropriate staff. Hostels now have considerable flexibility to develop their own staffing mix across core and non core duties and with few exceptions use this responsibility suitably. Nursing homes also have the flexibility now to determine the mix of skilled and less skilled core staff. The changes from July 1997, extend to nursing homes the full flexibility now available to hostels by removing the barrier to effective use of staff for both support and personal care tasks.

        Currently the standard resident contribution for hostels is 85 per cent and for nursing homes 87.5 per cent of the combined pension and rent assistance. From 1 July 1997, the base contribution that hostels can charge will be brought into line with that for nursing homes, as part of the broader alignment of the nursing home and hostel programs. It will not be compulsory for hostels to charge residents the higher base contribution and the additional income raised from hostel residents as a result of this change will be kept by providers and not by the Government.

        For non&amp;hyphen;pensioners in hostels, the base contribution that can be charged will increase to the same level as for nursing home residents under current arrangements, an amount equivalent to 87.5 per cent of the combined pension and rent assistance. However, a different base contribution will apply for pensioners due to some technical changes to the way rent assistance is paid that will take effect at the same time. These changes will mean that the base contribution for pensioners in hostel and nursing homes will be reduced to 85 per cent of the

        The rent assistance changes will not have any significant effect on income for residents or providers. The reduction in the base contribution will enable residents to maintain at least the level of residual income that nursing home residents currently retain. The direct subsidy, together with the base resident contribution, will allow providers to raise the same level of income as nursing homes do from residents under current arrangements, an amount equivalent to 87.5 per cent of the combined pension and rent assistance.

        Yes. The guidelines for the environmental impact statement (EIS) on Sydney's proposed second major airport require the EIS to describe the proposed operation of the new airport, including the coordination of airspace requirements for aircraft approaching and departing from the airport with reference to other aerodromes in the region and implications for, or conflicts with, their operations. In this context, the EIS is to discuss how a second airport may affect utilisation of Sydney (Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith) Airport.
