            It should come as no surprise to honourable members, even those who lack the technical expertise to understand pharmacology, that a drug aimed at lowering cholesterol should be more effective than a sugar pill. I would make the point to the honourable member that this is the exact reason we take scientific evidence on the basis of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and do not allow politicians to make arbitrary decisions on the misreading of an article where we compare one drug with a placebo.

But I assure the honourable member, as he knows, this is a government that has been very vigorous against tax avoidance.

There is no doubt that many are already looking at very real difficulties. The government is watching the situation very carefully. From the Prime Minister down we are conscious of the need to meet expectations not only of people in the bush but of all Australians that the government will do what it can to help ease the burden in rural Australia should this develop into another full&amp;hyphen;scale drought.

            It is worth noting that last week we re&amp;hyphen;declared drought exceptional circumstances in the northern Darling Downs and South Burnett regions of Queensland at a cost of some $20 million. I know that the relevant members, Mr Slipper and Mr Truss, are particularly relieved. They have had several things to say to me about the matter in recent times. This re&amp;hyphen;declaration is a recognition that the recovery that everyone, including farmers in those areas, believed was under way in June 1996 proved to be a false hope, a false dawn. Here is the demonstration that the drought exceptional circumstances systems, as we have finetuned them, are working.

This is again demonstrating our commitment to rural people who are in difficulties and our willingness to help. In fact, the assistance is anything but paltry. In conclusion, I note that there will be a new program in place shortly to offer farm families a safety net when they lose access to the drought relief payment. All will shortly be revealed in the integrated rural policy package which has been alluded to since the time of the budget.

You do not persuade anybody in this parliament, any more than you have persuaded the union leaders that I have spoken to over the last couple of weeks. The constant theme of the union leaders is, `Don't any of you and your colleagues imagine that we hold you responsible for the job losses of the last 13 years. We blame the Labor Party. They ignored us. They destroyed the protection for our industries and they don't convince us with their crocodile tears of the last few weeks about preserving jobs.'

             —I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the very interesting developments in the Australian livestock industries in recent times has been the explosion in live exports, particularly in cattle from northern Australia, and the numbers have now reached very high levels. Some estimates indicate that the equivalent of throughput for some seven to 10 works are now leaving the country in live form, and that is understandably putting some pressure on domestic works. I note that processors have expressed some concern about that in recent times.

            Over the last couple of years, I recall the answer from those opposite to their political mates in the union movement in relation to having a very successful live cattle export trade was to say, `We'll put an export tax on them.' It was a successful export trade, so they wanted to put a tax on the trade to make sure it was not successful. But the real name of the game here is to ensure that our processing works are as cost-effective and efficient as possible and that their costs are as low as they can be. Again, those opposite failed completely to grapple with that issue. They failed to deliver any meaningful reform at all.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The industrial relations changes that we have made are making a real difference. The reductions in interest rates are also making a real difference. In the last year under Labor, and members might be interested in this, the export meat sector in this country paid $62 million for meat inspection services; last year under us they paid $53 million—less, even without a subsidy. Just this afternoon I have completed dialogue with the meat industry which ensures that they will again pay $53 million this year, in contrast to $62 million in the last year under Labor.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The final point I would make on this issue is to offer some hope, because we are genuinely concerned about those jobs. There are jobs being generated by the live trade. It is also keeping in business many northern producers and the trucking companies and so forth that go with them. But we are concerned about the processing works as well. That is
            <break page="7509" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
             why we want to give the meatworkers the opportunity to be more efficient and to preserve their jobs. One important aspect is that, often on the back of live exports, a boom in boxed beef exports can also be developed. I hope that takes place for the benefit not only of producers but also of those workers who  might otherwise see their jobs go in processing plants in northern Australia.

The only way we could do it was if we compared the lowest cost, lowest dose drug in one category with the highest cost, highest dose drug in another category. There are two flaws with doing this. The first is that the therapeutic premium applies across all dose ranges. So comparing the cost of a low dose with a high dose medication is completely erroneous and gives a totally incorrect result. The second thing that is wrong with the shadow minister's calculations is that they assume that there are no subgroups within categories. They assume that, say, nifedepine is charged at a similar rate to verapamil when you are looking at drugs within one category.

            We always assist those who make genuine claims. Equally, they must be dealt with quickly and fairly as well. I think it is fair to say that we now have a proven record of success. Last week, 135 people from the Port Hedland detention centre were returned to China. These were the people who arrived in the Torres Strait in June from the Fujian province. I know there was a good deal of interest in that matter. Four people from that boat remain in Australia to assist us with further inquiries. Regrettably, the cost of removal is quite expensive. It was $590,000. I am sure no-one is pleased with having to incur this cost, but it is the only viable way of returning people with safety after an incursion of this type.

            It is remarkable that we now have only 55 people in our Port Hedland detention centre. Very much larger numbers of people were held in recent years. The centre has accommodation for more than 700 occupants. Since the coalition achieved office, about 900 people have arrived illegally by boat. The vast majority of those have been returned home on the basis that they failed to have any claims that met our protection obligations. In addition, we have been successful in arranging for the return home of large numbers of people who illegally arrived in the term of the previous government. It is a matter of some concern that has been drawn attention to before that, regrettably, over a period of time, numbers of people were held in detention for periods far longer than most reasonable people would have expected was appropriate.

            I am pleased to inform the House that to help these students the government has decided to provide some $6.2 million a year for intensive English as a second language assistance for students who commence school for the first time next year. This is a very significant breakthrough in providing foundation English language skills for young Aboriginal students. It shows this government's commitment to addressing in a very practical way the literacy needs of all young Australians.

            The target group for this program will be young indigenous students living in communities in which little English is heard or spoken and who are therefore significantly disadvantaged when their first exposure to English is when they attend school. Each eligible student will attract funding to provide an average of 10 hours of intensive tuition per week for six months to enable them to reach a basic level of English communication. Eligibility for assistance will be based on a local assessment of language barriers to individual students' participation in the classroom, and it is expected that some 2,000 students will be eligible each year.

             <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
              Sydney Morning Herald
             </emphasis>
             reported that he had asked AGB McNair to undertake a survey question, which  was, `How secure do you believe you are in your job at the moment?' Interestingly, only 4 per cent of the respondents in paid employment said that they felt very insecure and a further eight per cent said that they felt somewhat insecure. That left 25 per cent reasonably secure, 23 per cent secure, and 39 per cent very secure. It is true that, asked whether they felt more secure or less secure than they did a year ago, 18 per cent said that they felt less secure now; but against that 21 per cent said that they felt more secure, which left 60 per cent saying that they felt no difference. The recent AWIR study is also relevant to this, and there has been some interesting OECD material.

           <para first-indent="16">
            Of more direct relevance is that if you ask in the public debate who is concerned about job security or insecurity, the Labor Party has a political tactic to raise the question of job security absolutely on every occasion. They get up in the morning and you say to them as they are walking along the corridor, `How do you feel today?', and they say, `We feel that job insecurity is on the rise.' If you say, `What's the weather like?', they say, `Job insecurity is on the rise.' In the trade union movement, they have got people going out with surveys promoting the idea of job insecurity and stress at work.

              The third question is, `Do you suffer from any of the following—never, sometimes, frequently?' Then it has got a list including headaches, indigestion and continual tiredness. It sounds like a description of those sitting on the front bench opposite. The interesting thing is that there is no reference to whether or not these conditions relate to people's work performance. This is a significant issue. The reality is that if people are to enjoy higher pay and secure jobs, then what Australia needs is a system which allows the terms and conditions of people's employment to relate to the circumstances of their work so that through higher productivity people can enjoy higher pay.

            The questioner asks whether or not the government has fulfilled its commitment in respect of better pay for better work. No better and more graphic demonstration of us fulfilling that commitment is the recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to give a $10 a week safety net wage increase to the low paid. Compare the reality of $10 in your pocket, which is a 2.6 per cent real change—that is, an increase in real wages for those most disadvantaged—to the situation that applied in the years from March 1984 to March 1996, when Labor was in government, when the minimum wages of those disadvantaged in our society actually fell by 10 per cent or more.

              August 1996 budget a decision was made to sell eight of those 12 business units. That decision was made for a number of reasons.

Access to capital was another real problem.

            I am pleased to inform the House that four of the business units have now been transferred to private ownership.

Yesterday I was delighted to receive a cheque for $407.9 million from Macquarie Bank for the sale of Dasfleet. The remaining four business units—Interiors Australia, the Australian Property Group, DASCEM and Asset Services—will be transferred to private ownership between now and early October 1997. These sales were certainly part of the government's agenda for smaller government.

            I am absolutely delighted to inform the House that we have achieved a very positive outcome for staff, with some 80 per cent of our staff who applied for jobs across all the business units being successful in gaining employment with the new owners. A great deal has been done too in terms of our outsourcing, and areas such as Nomad, Auslig, the Australian Government Publishing Service and support services have now been contracted out.

            One of the interesting things—it is probably the first time it has been done by a government, certainly to my knowledge, anywhere in the world—is that provision was made for the staff of these business enterprises to in fact buy out the businesses. Obviously, they had to compete with the private sector in those bids. At least two of these businesses will be taken over by the staff. Some people have been critical of what might happen to the staff members who did not go with their businesses. I think this department probably has the best redeployment, retraining and career counselling program, and those staff have been looked after. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that the savings to government and

             —by leave—On behalf of the government, I announce today a comprehensive set of financial system reforms in response to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry, the Wallis report. This is a major structural reform by the government which will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian business and consumers. In line with our election commitments, upon taking office the government moved quickly to set up the financial system inquiry, headed by Mr Stan Wallis. I take this opportunity to thank Mr Wallis for the job he did, together with his fellow inquiry members—Mr Bill Beerworth, Professor Ian Harper, Professor Jeff Carmichael and Mrs Linda Nicholls.

The report was directed to the fundamental goals of the government, to increase competition and improve efficiency, while preserving the integrity, security and fairness of the financial system.

            The Wallis inquiry concluded that efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector has improved since the major deregulation measures of the 1980s. After nearly two decades, now is the time to improve the system further. There are three main reasons. Firstly, in a globally competitive world we must strive to be the best. Given its contribution to every other sector of the economy, creating the best possible financial system provides a vital foundation to Australia's future economic success. The Wallis inquiry found Australia's financial sector performance to be close to the world average rather than among the world's best.

            Secondly, we must maintain the pace of reform to respond to change. The financial system is undergoing accelerated change through rapid technological innovation, increasing globalisation and changing business strategies and consumer needs. Our regulatory arrangements must keep up. Existing arrangements do not treat all new market structures and activities equally, and do not always ensure that we get the maximum benefits from change.

            The Wallis inquiry concluded that prudential regulation should maintain safety while being sufficiently flexible to respond to financial system developments. Prudential arrangements should also minimise adverse effects on competition, competitive neutrality and efficiency. The government agrees with this general approach. We have decided to establish a single licensing and prudential regulation regime for all deposit taking institutions. This will achieve more neutral regulatory treatment and maintain financial safety across all providers of similar deposit products.

             The broad objectives of prudential regulation will be set out in the charter of the regulator. In setting these objectives, the government will broadly follow the approaches to the conduct of prudential regulation recommended by the Wallis inquiry, ensuring that standards of financial safety are not diminished. In particular, the conduct of regulation will ensure that the risk of loss of depositor funds remains, as now, very remote and that regulation is consistent with international standards. Prudential standards will as far as possible be reinforced through encouraging greater public disclosure by financial institutions of their risks, management systems and ratings.

They are vital to the retirement security of millions of Australians and for increasing numbers of people represent by far the greater part of their total financial assets. The APRA will take responsibility for the prudential regulation of superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts.

              Financial sector conduct and disclosure regulation is currently undertaken by a variety of regulatory agencies. The main disadvantages with this are that: regulation is inconsistent across the range of competing financial products; financial service providers face a range of different regulatory rules that raises the complexity and cost of compliance; and consumers face inconsistent rules resulting in difficulties in understanding and comparing competing products.

             —by leave—The opposition welcomes the fact that the government has, after more than five months, finally got around to announcing its response to the Wallis financial system inquiry. Today's statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) at last tells us where the government is intending to go on the report's more detailed recommendations. Subject to some concerns and reservations about particular matters which I will come back to later and subject of course to reservations about not yet having seen the detail of the government's legislation, I can indicate that the opposition
             <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

            We do understand that some of the issues raised by Wallis are highly technical, but I have to say that a five&amp;hyphen;month delay in providing the kind of response we have heard today to the report is inexcusable for a government which has behind it all the bureaucratic might of the Treasury. In fact, it was not until the opposition announced a couple of weeks ago its in&amp;hyphen;principle support for the basic Wallis regulatory structure that we saw any sign at all of government action on this report. This kind of delay is really very typical of a government that is all drift, indecision and muddle. Here, as elsewhere, it takes the opposition to provide leadership.

           <para first-indent="16">
            The long delay involved has adversely affected the financial services industry. All the major players have had to put a lot of their planning on hold as they wait for the future regulatory structure of the industry to be determined. Indeed I note that the government is not proposing to introduce legislation to implement any of its decisions today until some time into 1998 and, moreover, that the transfer of responsibilities from the states, which is a very important part of bringing this whole scheme to fruition so far at least as building societies and credit unions and so on are concerned, will not take place until July 1999. So I do urge the government to get its act together. Try to improve your relationship with the states. Get a bit of speed up and get the regulatory system effectively into place.

            Let me begin my response to the substance of this report by just saying a few words about the Wallis committee report in its context. The Wallis report is widely considered to be the most important review of the financial system since the Campbell report in 1981, but, as important as it is and as useful as it is, this ain't no Campbell report. The simple fact is that the changes recommended by Wallis, while they are quite far reaching, are still relatively small beer compared with floating the dollar, opening up the banking system to foreign banks and deregulating as we did most of the financial system.

             The Treasurer may want to claim these things as his own but these are Labor's achievements. The deregulation that took place through the 1980s has brought significant benefits for consumers and business: there is now much greater competition in key markets such as the market for housing and finance, consumers have access to a much wider range of financial products, and there has been substantial innovation in products offered by financial institutions with Wallis counting some 1,760 differentiated mortgage products now on the market and another 1,800 deposit products as the fruit of that kind of deregulation. Before deregulation many borrowers were forced to supplement their regulated bank home loans with personal loans of higher interest rates, and these cocktail loans have now disappeared.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Although deregulation has brought tremendous benefits for business and consumers, it has not also been without its significant transition costs and disappointments, not least of those associated with the explosive and undisciplined credit expansion of the mid to late 1980s. But I think it is fair to say that the system is certainly now working a lot better. It has learnt a lot from those excesses. In particular, it is worth emphasising that the housing mortgage market is much more competitive than it has ever been and there are some hopeful signs of greater competition as well emerging in the market for small business lending.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The Treasurer shamelessly claims that this greater competition is his own achievement, but anyone with the most cursory knowledge of the financial markets and how they have been working in these institutional frameworks knows that this competition developed before Labor left office. It has got nothing whatsoever to do with any changes introduced by the coalition government. Although an important part of the Wallis report is concerned with stocktaking the effects of that deregulation over the past decade, obviously what it is basically about is the future and, in particular, the appropriate regulatory structure for the Australian financial system in the 21st century.

              It is worth saying that a Wallis&amp;hyphen;type inquiry into the financial system would have occurred no matter which side of politics had won the last election. As Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) foreshadowed the eventual need for it; Treasury had already commenced planning for a major inquiry, I can assure the Treasurer, despite his wishful thinking to the contrary, before we left office; and, indeed, an inquiry of this kind would have had to have been conducted under our national competition policy guidelines which required a review of the relevant legislation.

              Labor does understand the profound change that has been sweeping through the finance industry and the need for a new regulatory response to it. This change is the product of the financial deregulation which has already occurred, plus stunning continuing technological process and the impact here, as elsewhere, of globalisation. In the past, banks, life offices, superannuation funds and general insurers operated in quite distinct markets. However, with these other phenomena occurring—financial deregulation and so on—the differences between the products offered by these various institutions are becoming increasingly blurred. Life offices are now offering deposit type products which were once virtually the sole preserve of banks; super funds are entering the home mortgage market—so are the new mortgage originators; and the banks are offering superannuation and general insurance products.

              There are no signs at all of any slowing in this convergence in the services operated by different financial institutions. If anything, the trend seems to be accelerating. As a consequence, we have to put in place a new regulatory framework to accommodate these changes. That is what the Wallis report recommends.
             </para>
             <para first-indent="16">
              At the heart of the recommendations are those to create two new regulatory bodies, dealing with prudential supervision on one side and consumer protection on the other. What Wallis does not propose—or, indeed, give any consideration to—is the manifestly ill&amp;hyphen;considered proposal that was originally put forward by the Treasurer for a single mega&amp;hyphen;

               regulator. That would have been an absolute bureaucratic monster. It would have ensured that, both on the prudential and on the consumer protection side, we saw standards slipping in the context of that kind of regulatory nightmare.

             <para first-indent="16">
              On prudential regulation, the Wallis proposal embraced by the government is that supervision of financial institutions, including those in the insurance industry, be undertaken by a new body, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. APRA would pick up many of the current prudential supervisory responsibilities of the Reserve Bank, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the financial institutions scheme. The Reserve Bank, however, would continue to have responsibility for overall system stability, maintaining very close liaison with APRA, in particular, in arrangements for the provision of liquidity in dealing with the financial difficulties that might be experienced by banks and other licensed deposit taking institutions. The opposition is very supportive  of the Reserve continuing to have that role; it is crucial.
             </para>
             <para first-indent="16">
              It is also worth mentioning in this context that the Reserve will have the responsibility for oversight of the payments system, with the establishment within it of a new payments system board. There is a very significant job for that board to do. Given the decision to open up the payments system to some new types of player, we will be looking very closely at the actual implementation arrangements for that.
             </para>
             <para first-indent="16">
              Going back to the creation of the single prudential regulator, APRA, in the form proposed, we do support that. There are no compelling arguments against moving to a new structure that will accommodate more naturally the profound changes that are taking place in the financial services market. On the other hand, there are some quite compelling arguments for bringing all deposit taking institutions under a single prudential regulatory body, the most obvious argument being that this will help to achieve a more level playing field between the banks, the credit unions and building societies.

               The Wallis inquiry was presented with quite substantial evidence that the state based regulatory scheme for credit unions and building societies, while having raised prudential standards considerably from what they were before, was nonetheless still cumbersome, duplicative and costly. As a result, the report found that if credit unions and building societies `are to be an effective source of competition for the banks in the retail market, it is fundamental that they be able to operate on a national basis and to compete on the same regulatory terms as banks'. The opposition supports that key finding of the report. We hope that the states and territories, with a bit of encouragement, support and cooperation from the Commonwealth, will respond quickly and unanimously to the recommendation that they bring their relevant institutions under the national scheme.

              <para first-indent="16">
               The new approach to prudential regulation proposed by the Wallis report would see the application of consistent depositor protection arrangements to all deposit taking institutions. The opposition believes that that will be of considerable benefit to credit union and building society customers. With the credit unions in particular filling the gap left by the banks in many rural and regional communities, it is vitally important that credit union customers be covered by the same depositor protection rules as bank customers.

              <para first-indent="16">
               We have already stated our view in the opposition that the current system of depositor protection for banks has functioned well and should be the core of future depositor protection arrangements.

               We recognise, as the Treasurer said, that new legislation will be required to extend the existing depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act to other deposit taking institutions. The government must not use this process to water down the level of protection that is currently enjoyed by bank customers. I heard the Treasurer's statement today that that is not the government's intention. I simply say to him that we will be looking

               When it comes to consumer protection on a wider scale, the current regulation of financial services in Australia is manifestly highly fragmented and in need of some consolidation. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission, the Reserve Bank, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Payments System Council, state and territory bodies responsible for administering state fair trading laws—all of them have consumer protection responsibilities in this area.
               <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
                Obviously, it makes good sense for the current fragmented arrangements to be rationalised in a new body, as the Wallis report proposes, as the government has now said that it will do, and the opposition supports that general approach. We simply hope that the proposed new Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission, the ACFSC, is properly funded and resourced to ensure that it can perform properly the proposed new regulatory functions.

               While it is logical that this new body, the ACFSC, acts as the day to day consumer protection and market conduct regulator for the financial services sector, we do believe, however, that the ACCC should retain its role as the economy wide regulator, without exception, of consumer protection. The ACCC has real teeth, has been willing to use them and should not be gutted. Although there is obviously scope for some resource rationalisation with the new body, some allocation of responsibility in such a way as not to ensure day to day duplication, overlap and confusion, we do have a concern—and this is one difference which I think is there; it is a bit hard to tell the extent of the difference given that we have not yet seen the legislation—based on the fact that we are worried that the ACCC would be completely dealt out of consumer protection in the financial services industry and that dealing it out in this way would be the first step towards the fragmentation of a genuinely economy wide approach to consumer regulation.

                What we are saying is that, at the very least, the ACCC and the ACFSC should maintain a close working relationship, preferably under a clear operating agreement, with the ACCC retaining a reserve capacity, which you would not expect often to be utilised, to intervene to enforce the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act if it is becoming apparent that there is some shift away from a uniformity of regulatory approach. Maintaining strong consumer protection is absolutely essential in this area, as elsewhere.

                In that context, I emphasise that one area of great difference between the opposition and the government goes to the question of consumer protection in the context of bank fees and charges. Wallis recommends that banks and other financial institutions should have complete freedom to set fees and charges `without government intervention or suasion'. The Treasurer, unsurprisingly, supports that recommendation boots and all, and in doing it today he sent a green light to the banks, and indeed to the other financial institutions, to go ahead and keep raising their fees and charges.
               </para>
               <para first-indent="16">
                That open slather approach runs right against the Prices Surveillance Authority's 1995 report into retail transaction fees and charges. Among other things, that report found that there was a need for the ACCC not to informally but to formally monitor fees and charges. The government has consistently rejected our calls for such a formal monitor, an issue which has become very much more lively as successive interest rate reductions have come into effect, as the banks' margins have narrowed and as they are looking now to fees and charges to earn a much greater proportion of their profits. The best that the Treasurer can offer today is a promise to continue informally monitoring fees and charges. Frankly, that is not worth tuppence&amp;hyphen;halfpenny. Fees and charges will continue to spiral so long as there is no more formal monitoring process and, indeed, regulatory process put in place.

                 The Treasurer says that formal monitoring is unnecessary because consumer power is going to help keep fees and charges down, but consumer power can only begin to work when consumers have complete information about the alternatives that are available so they can in fact shop around to get the best deal. The trouble is—as I guess we all know in the real world—consumers are completely bamboozled by the fees and charges jungle.

                 that even finds it difficult to get consistent information on fees and charges which he can understand. The lack of authoritative, readily available and easy to understand information on the array of fees and charges in the marketplace today is a major market failure. There is a compelling need for the government to address that failure by directing the competition watchdog—ACCC—to formally monitor fees and charges, to make that information widely available so that ordinary people can in fact shop around and keep competitive pressure on the banks and on the other institutions to offer consumers a better deal.

                 The remaining area where we significantly depart from Wallis is that which was given no attention at all in the Treasurer's statement today—I suppose, he said everything he wanted to say on the subject in his initial response to Wallis back in April—and that is the subject of bank mergers and mergers between the major institutions in this sector. We have a very strong difference with Wallis in its recommendation to scrap the so&amp;hyphen;called four&amp;hyphen;pillars policy which has prohibited mergers between the major four banks. When the Wallis report was released in April the government did not rule out scrapping the four&amp;hyphen;pillars policy at some point in the future. Today's statement by the Treasurer has not changed that position because he was silent on the subject.

                  between the major banks. We already have one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world and further mergers between the major banks would lead to even greater concentration and less competition. In addition, consistent with the ACCC's decision in the 1995 Westpac&amp;hyphen;Challenge case, we believe that strong regional competitors in each of the states are necessary to promote competition.

                 Unfortunately, that ACCC position has now been watered down by the recent Westpac&amp;hyphen;Bank of Melbourne decision, a decision which, while on the face of it sets some conditions which modify the impact of the merger, only does so for a relatively short time and I think at the end of the day the consequences are going to be unhappy for consumers. The simple fact is that retail customers and small businesses bank locally—they do not bank nationally, they do not bank internationally—and strong regional competitors to the major banks to keep them honest in those local environments are therefore absolutely vital to competition.

                 It is also appropriate for me to restate here the opposition's concern with the government's decision announced last April to implement the Wallis recommendation to scrap the so&amp;hyphen;called `six&amp;hyphen;pillars policy'. The six&amp;hyphen;pillars policy, otherwise know as the `majors policy', was implemented by the Labor government to prevent mergers between the major four banks and the two large life offices. While the degree of job shedding would be far less than that produced by a merger between two of the major banks, nonetheless a merger between a major bank and a major life office would involve substantial job shedding. We remain very concerned about that prospect and we are concerned that, as usual, as predictable and as is to be expected, the government obviously remains utterly unconcerned about it.

                 Yet another subject related to the role and financing of the banks and the relationships between them is the question of foreign ownership. I want to take this opportunity, again for the sake of completeness, to repeat the opposition's concern on the question of foreign ownership of the major banks. The Wallis report says there should be no special
                 <break page="7526" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
                  restrictions on foreign ownership of the major banks. The Treasurer said back in April only that there would not be `open slather' on foreign ownership, but his idea of when the slather starts will make a great many people nervous. Our position is one of blanket prohibition against foreign takeovers of any of the major banks, and that is a position which we believe, in the national interest and in the interest of Australian consumers, must be retained.

                 In conclusion, I have identified those areas of the Wallis report and the Treasurer's response to it where we do have significant concerns. I have also indicated those areas where we will be scrutinising with a very beady eye indeed the government's legislation when it is eventually introduced. But it is fair to say—and I say it—that generally speaking the Wallis committee has made a major and very useful contribution to the ongoing modernisation of a key sector of the Australian economy. We would have established such an inquiry ourselves and the proposals that have here emerged and have now been accepted by the government are broadly consistent with those which we ourselves would have embraced.

Over the last three quarters, they have gone down from 0.8 per cent to 0.7 per cent to 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Each quarter since the middle of last year, since this government took over, those things have been falling.

The fact of it is that that is what would have happened. Fortunately, the commission rejected that and gave a little bit more—$10. Those figures are on the public record.

            Let us not forget that 33 per cent of workers depend on the award to determine their rates of pay. Those people's circumstances are getting consistently worse. We have got falling wages and worse. The results are getting increasingly unfair. In the last 12 months to June 1997 workers on the award received an average increase of 1.4 per cent. I know people will say, `Oh, but inflation is falling,' but go into the households of the people who depend on that 1.4 per cent and ask what is happening to the things they pay for. In the last 12 months the price of food went up 3.2 per cent; in exactly the same 12&amp;hyphen;month period—the 12 months to June 1997.

We know—the statistics make it clear—that in the bottom two quintiles, in the bottom 40 per cent of income earning households, a very low percentage of people are paying off mortgages.

            What is the government's response? It has introduced an industrial relations system expressly designed to make the outcome more unfair. Those who have the bargaining power can win bigger increases and those who cannot get nothing or worse. I reiterate: 33 per cent of Australian workers depend on the award system to establish their rate of pay. What in the new system helps these people?

            All you get from Australian workers about the proposal that under this government they  are getting better pay is a rather sad sort of horse laugh. But the situation is even worse when it comes to better working conditions. Before the election, the government really did not address what for many workers are the biggest issues: they are working longer; they are working harder; they are working more antisocial hours; and they are working under more stress—stress about whether they will have a job, about what sort of job it will be, about what the wages and working conditions will be, about how they will adapt those working hours and that change in income to meet their family and social commitments and about whether their kids will have a job.

             —They did not ask it last time, to the best of my knowledge. But there is a very serious concern about job security. If you think the concern is not increasing, I am very pleased and I hope you continue to ignore it. The government did not address it because it does not understand it. The government sees industrial relations exclusively as an economic issue. It misses the whole social aspect of industrial relations arrangements. The same person whom the government wants to work a 12-hour shift is the person who is worried about whether they are going to have time with their children and who outside working hours is actively involved in the community. But when you are working a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. shift, there is not a lot of time to be with your kids; there is not a lot of time to be involved in community organisations. These important social organisations that keep our society ticking over have depended, for the last 50 years and more, on people having time to be involved in them after they finish work.

            What is the government's response to this growing concern about job security? It is shown in every empirical study and given in every anecdote and discussion you have with people in every workplace that Australians are

             increasingly concerned about their jobs and their job security. The government, when it does not ignore it, makes it worse. The introduction of individual contracts, which make it easier to make changes to the working conditions that influence this concern over job security, and the overall pressure for deregulation of the labour market are leading to some changes that are exacerbating this very real and substantial Australian problem.

            The market gives incentives to employers to employ their workers for longer hours rather than to employ new people. We are seeing either cashing out of overtime or slashing of the rates. We are seeing penalty rates for antisocial hours disappear. Sometimes these are very unfair; sometimes they are not. Sometimes it is a decent outcome for those individuals working with a decent employer.

            But what about all those people who are not parties to the contract and who would desperately like to get some part of that extra work that is being generated? This is an issue that we need to begin to address, but this government is consistently making it worse. There are hundreds of thousands of Australians seriously concerned about this. They do not appreciate the fact that the minister who is supposed to be doing something about it thinks it is funny. They think it is an increasingly serious problem. There are lots of people working part time who want more work; of course, there are the unemployed who want work; and there is an increasing  proportion of people in work who would like to be working fewer hours. That is what the evidence says. It continues to say that the distribution of work is getting more unfair in our society.

            The government decides it will add to this: they have got a new strategy to help job security; they will make it a lot easier for you to get the sack. This does not seem to me fundamentally to go to the concern that ordinary Australians have about the security of their jobs.

            What we have is Australians working harder and for less. And for what? Where is the social benefit? We have not seen any upsurge in employment as a consequence. We have not seen any fundamental change in the relationship between growth and jobs. We have got growth declining. One of the substantial reasons for this is the insecurity that the government is creating. It might not be in the economics textbook but it ought to be obvious to anybody. If it was not obvious before now, yesterday's housing figures and the response by Ron Silberberg from the Housing Industry Association, who is not renowned as one of our most ardent supporters, made it clear. The issue of insecurity in Australian households is what is holding back the housing sector. It is the reason why the benefits from the cuts in interest rates are not flowing into increased activity and jobs in the housing sector, just as the same problem is permeating the retail sector and other industries.

            So let us have a look at the picture. This government has been in government for about 18 months now. They are about halfway through their term. We have some chance to start to measure their performance. In industrial relations, what do we see? We see the number of strikes going up. So what does the government do? It has plans for industrial war but no plans for industrial peace. We see wages rising more slowly, or even falling, but the government is putting on pressure for them to go down and not up. When figures come out, you sometimes hear the minister saying, `I am worried that the rate of increase is too high,' but I have never seen him express a concern that they might be too low. All the pressure is to put them down and not up.

             We see the outcomes of the distribution of work and wages becoming less and less fair and the government introducing policies to make it worse and not better. We see the job growth stagnant and the government slashing confidence and flattening the economy. We see rising stress and insecurity in the workplace and the government increasing the pressure on workers and reducing their protection. The government is consistently showing a pattern of ignoring this issue, which goes to the very heart of the social concerns of Australian workers and the households in which they live.

             If that litany of failure in the area of strikes, jobs, wages, fairness and confidence is a benchmark of this government's view that its industrial relations policies have been a success, I would hate to see what would be the benchmark for a failure. If they think more strikes, lower wages, falling jobs, increasing stress and insecurity are success, I would hate to see what constituted failure. Working Australians and their families and all those who aspire to work—if only they get half a chance—deserve much better than this.

I was left virtually without a response when the shadow minister, the member for Canberra, (Mr McMullan) said, `Let's be empirical,' and then rattled off a series of facts and figures which are patently  and obviously wrong. For example, he said, `Growth is declining.' Didn't you see the annual report of the Reserve Bank and yesterday's comments by the Reserve Bank Governor, who said that growth in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 would be just a bit under three per cent? How can you say that growth is declining when the Reserve Bank annual report, which was out yesterday, provided the actual figures which showed that you were wrong?

            We recently had a very interesting discussion in cabinet. In cabinet, we had a number of experts talking to us about the rate of unemployment. It is public knowledge that one of those academic experts was publicly advocating a reduction of 10 per cent in wages for low income people. So, during the discussion in cabinet, I asked one of our advisers, `Has it ever been known that a government of a Western democracy has advocated a cut in real wages of those most disadvantaged in our society?' Do you know what the response was from our economics adviser? The answer was, `Yes, one such government had a policy of reducing the wages of the most disadvantaged in our society.

Not only did we make that promise before the election but, firstly, we legislated the rock solid guarantees that we gave before the election and, furthermore, we went down to the Industrial Relations Commission and we argued the case that these people on low incomes should be fairly treated and, lastly, the commission gave a $10 safety net wage increase.

            During the period of the previous government there were numerous increases of between 10 and 15 per cent—in the oil industry, the mining industry, the building industry and the communications industry. The fallacy of the government's industrial relations policy is that in those specialist industries where there are high levels of skill and they are still prospering—the government has literally ripped open the shirts of the employers and exposed their solar plexus, probably lower down than the solar plexus in fact—they have taken the role of the umpire out of the equation and those employers are going to find that they will suffer from the assault that they are going to get because of the government exposing them.

            But the reality for most workers is that they are suffering stress and anxiety and it is now a major impediment to economic growth. I have referred to the AWIR survey which shows that slack demand rather than minimum wages is the main concern of small business, and that slack demand is the result of job insecurity. Job insecurity is now twofold. It is a question not only of holding on to a job but also of wages and terms and conditions of employment. Eighteen months after 1 January all but the 20 core conditions contained in section 89A of the act are going to evaporate. Overnight all conditions will go.

             Where do we find, under those 20 core conditions, anything resembling the termination, change and redundancy provisions which were contained in those famous test cases in the early 1980s?

Employers do not have an obligation to give notice to workers about intended changes, whether those changes be in respect of the introduction of technology or in respect of the changing of manning level or in respect of outsourcing of work, which is an increasing phenomenon.

The commission cannot make an award or order for an actual pay increase. They are left to award virtually poverty level wages with the $380 minimum wage rate. If workers want to improve on that minimum rate, they are forced into an enterprise bargaining situation. There is no longer any obligation to bargain in good faith. The employer is under no obligation to disclose, for instance, their profit level. The employer is under no obligation to disclose the salary levels of their chief executives. The employer is under no obligation to display what their proposed manning level changes are going to  be. Workers are going in cold. All those enterprise bargaining in good faith provisions have gone. They exist right around the world in just about all European countries and in North America. Indeed, they existed in South Africa under the former apartheid regime. But we have not got those. They have gone.

When there is a restriction or a hiccup in the bargaining process, what happens? What happens is what we are seeing at Rio Tinto. The commission has no power to arbitrate under section 170N; that has been taken away. The employer is also a victim in those circumstances where the reverse of the coin applies and unions, in the specific circumstances of the industry, retain industrial power.

The employers are able to do that by going behind the collective bargaining process and picking off employees. One example that I confronted was of employers inducing workers to sign individual contracts by offering them a free dinner. They were being as fickle as that to pick off workers.

That has all been removed. The commission's role as a legitimate umpire or referee to ensure and protect workers' terms and conditions has been completely and utterly obliterated.

New employees could work only a night shift; that was an unpopular shift. But of course the union said that new employees would work at that time. The lowest paid worker received only $55,000 per annum—only $55,OOO and their wage rates went up to $70,000 and $80,000. Industrial action in this coal industry, under the arrangements put in place by the former government, is 45 times the national average. There is a last on, first off seniority system for hiring and firing, as well as compulsory engagements from union lists. So if you were in the union and were put off, you were put on again.

The freedom of association provisions—that is, whether or not you join a union—are now being enforced under the new Reith legislation. The secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act have prevented strikes from escalating to national stoppages. The legislation eventually encouraged those train drivers to cross the picket line and deliver the coal to the port—something that would not have happened under the previous Labor government.

             It is interesting to do a comparison with the situation under the Labor Party's preferred option. If we look at the Rio Tinto No. 1 mine in the Hunter Valley, there are some very intrinsic advantages in terms of the quality of the coal and the overburden. We get one tonne of coal for every 2&amp;half; tonnes of overburden. That is a very important statistic which allows that mine to be profitable. You would think that that would be one of the best mines in Australia. The ratio of those figures is important. That is a union dominated mine where there have been a number of strikes which I have recorded. It was a first off first on attitude so nobody knew that employees

             Let us make a comparison with Queensland. We have the Ensham mine at Emerald in Queensland. They have 12 tonnes of rubble to one tonne of coal—a very difficult technical task. They decided to make a fundamental change to the industrial relations approach under the Reith legislation. The CFMEU of course wanted to fight that. One of the fundamental changes was the introduction of a 12&amp;hyphen;hour shift. Thirty workers went on to the new contracts. The shift rosters ensured a new arrangement: 84 hours a week, seven days a week at the mine and seven days off. The workers wanted this change. It provided more leisure time for them in their week off back home. Mr Ken Foots, who is managing the mine, is reported as saying:

            <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
             Foots told the Australian Industrial Relations  Commission earlier this year that the 12&amp;hyphen;hour shifts have been the key contributor to Ensham's productivity. Elsewhere in the Bowen Basin, open&amp;hyphen;cut mines operating on eight-hour shift rosters only achieve 5.5 per productive hours work a day because of meal breaks, crib breaks, demarcation and the extra time it takes to change over the three shifts, he said. "The Ensham roster, combined with no demarcation, enables us to achieve 23.5 hours of productive work per day on a particular piece of equipment," he said, "an improvement of more than 40 per cent in utilisation."

             The JCPA's report does not attempt to analyse in detail all of the audit findings and recommendations in those three reports. Instead, it draws attention to key issues
             <break page="7538" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
              discussed at the hearings and highlights commitments given by witnesses.
             </break>
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The audit on tax debt collection was a constructive exercise which resulted in a number of sensible and useful recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Australian Taxation Office. An audit office analysis indicated that a combination of minor improvements to the timeliness of debt collection and the effectiveness of recovery level would result in potentially significant net ongoing benefits to the Commonwealth. The audit report estimated that even a modest improvement would provide a net benefit to the Commonwealth of about $142 million.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The JCPA's review of the debt collection report highlighted three issues of concern. Firstly, there is a risk that penalties for late payments of tax are not being administered by the Taxation Office in accordance with the law. The legislation requires that additional charges be automatically imposed when a tax debt is paid late. An assessment by the audit office showed that 35 per cent of the outstanding debt cases finalised by payment in 1995-96 had no ATLP—late payment—imposed. The results of this assessment were supported by the findings of an internal tax office audit.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Secondly, it is a fact that taxpayers with large tax debts are more likely to have late payment penalties remitted than taxpayers with small debts. The audit report noted the risk that penalties may be being used as a negotiating tool in debt collection. The JCPA considers that both practices are wrong and represent an unacceptable risk to revenue.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Thirdly, the JCPA has a concern that too often litigation is pursued when negotiation would produce better results. It appears that good central tax office policy is not always matched by good regional office policy. A number of my colleagues have reported to me that regional tax officers were totally unaware of the thrust of the ATO's policy. From my own experience, my colleagues are right.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The JCPA made suggestions and recommendations to improve the tax office performance in all of these areas. The JCPA looks forward to the ATO addressing these criti cisms seriously and with urgency. Whether
             <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
              the response from the ATO is satisfactory will determine if the JCPA needs to conduct further inquiries.
             </break>
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The JCPA's review of food provisioning in the Defence Force again highlighted significant shortcomings in the ability of Defence's financial management systems to generate accurate information on the total costs of Defence activities. Defence was unable to provide the total cost of providing rations to Defence Force personnel to the audit office or at the hearing and took some time to construct an estimate of cost after the event. Defence's estimate of total cost of provisioning was $277 million per annum.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The lack of ready access to such information makes it extremely difficult for Defence to manage its resources efficiently and to account adequately for its expenditure and performance. It is clear that much remains to be done in Defence to reform financial management systems and practices. Financial management reforms need to be a clear priority for Defence, as it prepares itself for the Commonwealth's new accrual budgeting environment.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             As noted in the audit report and at the hearing, the fundamental flaw in food provisioning is the absence of a clear ADF&amp;hyphen;wide policy on food provisioning. The audit office highlighted the resulting risk that procedures on food provisioning are not aligned to Defence Force objectives and may not be cost effective or best practice. The Defence Force has acknowledged the deficiency, and the JCPA has been advised by Defence that a policy will be in place by the end of the year.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The third and final report that the JCPA examined in this report was work force planning in the ADF. Work force planning is an issue of central importance to the quality and preparedness of the Defence Force. It is also an issue of great complexity. The audit report attempted to assess the work force planning systems used by the Defence Force with a view to identifying better practice and making recommendations to promote the overall effectiveness of planning systems.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             One of the main challenges identified during the review was a need to devolve a greater degree of management responsibilities
             <break page="7539" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
              from Defence Force headquarters to individual Defence managers. Although a balance needs to be maintained when devolving responsibilities in an environment that has a demand for strong, central controls, the committee considers that the advantages to be gained from increased management flexibility are quite significant. It is a balance which, if achieved, could help overcome many of the rigidities and inefficiencies in Defence's work force planning systems.
             </break>
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             However, it is clear to the committee that Defence faces some fundamental work force planning problems. The committee accepts that the personnel managers require better tools and levers for managing the strength of the service than are currently used and notes the efforts currently being made in Defence to address a number of work force planning issues.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             I conclude by thanking those people who contributed their time and expertise to the committee's review. I wish to thank members of the sectional committee for their participation in this most effective round&amp;hyphen;table process of examining reports of the Auditor-General. The work done by the JCPA staff cannot be overstated. They continue to perform to the high standards the parliament has come to expect. In particular, I wish to thank Jennifer Hughson for another report of the highest standard and quality. I commend report 352 to the House.

Members of the House will appreciate that recently the High Court brought down a decision which invalidated certain state laws, which thereby undermined the capacity of state governments to raise certain necessary revenues for the running of those state governments. These nine bills are therefore obviously urgent. It is necessary that they go through this chamber to the Senate.

Who is running it? The fact of the matter is this is a matter of national priority. You people are playing childish, juvenile stupid games. It is amazing, Mr Deputy Speaker.

            I move this motion so that those members who had indicated their intention to speak on these bills will have some opportunity to do so. Members should be aware that the only reason that this guillotine motion has been moved today is that the opposition advised that, unless we had a debate and a motion and a vote on the TCF matter, they would not allow us to obtain passage of the tax bills—which is one of the more absurd and feral and stupid things that they have done in the time that they have been in opposition.

            Yesterday the opposition said that they felt that it was an inappropriate time for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to move a motion introducing his republic plebiscite bill, so we said that we were happy to have it moved today. We were happy to have it moved today, but when the opposition takes the view that they are going to do all in their power to prevent the passage of the tax bills, which forces us to the guillotine motion, obviously we are not going then to say, `Not only will we allow you to waste our time, we will give you more time simply at your beck and call.' This is one of the more absurd and extreme cases of the opposition being unprepared to sensibly manage the business of the House.

            We do not and have not moved guillotine motions, except in the most onerous circumstances. These nine bills are obviously important. Maybe members of the opposition have failed to notice a recent High Court decision. Maybe they are of the opinion that we can just let time go by. If we were to play your silly games, you would not have us ringing you; you would have Bob Carr ringing to complain that you, by your absurd and juvenile tactics, were preventing the sensible passage of important legislation to undermine the revenue of the state of New South Wales.

             We have had fine entertainment this afternoon. The Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) has accused the government of the most dastardly motives. I have been called a rat, I have been called incompetent, I have been called all my favourite nicknames. I have been called everything under the sun. I must say that we enjoy the banter, we enjoy the to and fro. We enjoy seeing the struggle of opposition. What those opposite have to understand is that in March 1996, the Australian people went to the polls and voted for the coalition to manage the affairs of this country. When they so voted, they invited us to manage the affairs of the House.

I commend this final motion to the House. With a bit of luck, this will be the last one for the day.

The Leader of the Opposition agreed to come in today and put his private member's bill before the House.

The reality is that they have lost for themselves, but they are not going to be entitled to deny the passage of this legislation—legislation that is so important to the revenues of the state governments.

The Leader of the House said that this has been caused because we want to debate the TCF issue. Too right we do. You have got it in one, but we are not the only ones who want to debate the TCF issue in this House. I will tell you who else wants to debate it.

            The House is considering a very complex and important series of bills in this debate. They are the Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (Customs) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (General) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, as well as the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 and three franchise fees bills—the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Bill 1997, the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Imposition) Bill 1997 and the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997.

            We are critical of the handling of these issues by the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I will come to that a bit later. The opposition intends to take a constructive and responsible attitude to this legislation. Indeed, the government's guillotine was entirely unnecessary. We have always intended to, and still intend to, support its quick passage through this House. It is Labor's intention to support relaxation of the cut&amp;hyphen;off rules in the Senate to allow swift consideration of this legislation in the other place.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            As members may be aware, this package of bills has been made necessary as a result of the High Court's decision. We are proposing to implement the temporary Commonwealth safety net taxation arrangements which were
            <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
             announced by the Treasurer on 6 August. The need for these proposed new arrangements has arisen from the decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases which were handed down by the High Court on 5 August.

            Those cases considered the constitutional validity of the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987, a New South Wales piece of legislation, which prohibited persons, under penalty, from selling tobacco, whether by wholesale or retail, without a licence. These licences are issued on application for periods of up to one month. The licence fees, payable prior to the licence period, were $10 plus 100 per cent of the value of the tobacco sold in the month two months prior to the period of the licence. For example, the fee for the month of August 1997 was payable at the end of July 1997 and was based on sales which occurred in June 1997.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The question at issue in the cases was: does the licence fee constitute an excise for the purposes of section 90 of the Australian constitution? The first part of section 90 states:
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
            On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.
           </para>
           <para style="Para">
            The first condition of section 90—that is, the imposition of uniform duties of customs—was achieved back in 1901. From that time onwards, the Commonwealth has had the exclusive right to levy customs and excise duties. The plaintiffs in these cases claim that the New South Wales statute breached section 90. New South Wales, which, in turn, had the support of all the other states and territories, submitted that the licence fees were not duties of customs or of excise within the meaning of section 90.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The specific argument which the states put forward was that the term `duties of customs or of excise' does not cover all taxes on goods but merely duties imposed respectively on the importation or the local production or manufacture of goods. That submission sought to reopen issues which had been decided in previous cases on the basis that incorrect reasoning had been used and that that reason
            <break page="7559" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
             ing had then been followed in later cases. Specifically, what the states were arguing was that the extension of the definition of excise to include taxes on the distribution or the sale of goods was incorrect and that that ought to be reviewed by the High Court.
            </break>
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The High Court did agree to reopen the issues. However, four of the seven justices found for the plaintiffs and therefore against the states, thereby invalidating the New South Wales legislation and, by extension, the legislation of the other states and territories concerning licence fees for tobacco. Whilst not certain, that decision probably meant that the court would strike down the licence fees on petroleum and alcohol as well.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The revenue threat to the states and territories from these decisions is estimated at around $5 billion in 1997-98, which is around one-sixth of the state's own source revenue. So we are obviously talking about a lot of money here. The only options for the states were to either recoup the threatened revenue from other tax bases or request that the Commonwealth use its power under section 90 to collect the moneys, effectively as an agent for the states, and to pass on that revenue to the states.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            In relation to the Commonwealth's temporary response, state and territory leaders unanimously requested the Commonwealth to utilise Commonwealth tax bases to collect the revenue that was formerly raised by the business franchise fees and to remit that money to the states and territories. The Commonwealth agreed to do so.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The issue of the Commonwealth stepping into the breach is complicated by the fact that the states and territories have imposed their own business franchise fees on differing bases and on differing rates. That is something that the Commonwealth cannot do, of course. The constitution limits the Commonwealth to imposing identical taxes across the whole nation. As a result, compromise rates have to be struck and a complicated formula devised to equitably share the revenue.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The Commonwealth has announced increases, firstly, in the level of customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.1c per litre; secondly, in the level of customs and excise
            <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
             duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram; and, thirdly, in the rates of wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent except for low alcohol wine which will not be affected. These bills are seeking to implement the announced increases. The Commonwealth has stated that these measures will be reviewed within a six&amp;hyphen;month period prior to permanent measures being decided upon.
            </break>
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            In the area of small business, to ensure that the increase in the wholesale sales tax rates does not detrimentally affect small business, the small business exemption and the quarterly remittance regime, which both provide greater assistance to small business than the normal administrative arrangements, will be calculated with the additional tax on alcohol being excluded. The opposition's position is that these small business adjustments are appropriate, and we will be supporting them.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            In relation to revenue collected, the total revenue raised is estimated to be around $6 billion. This is obviously substantially more than the lost revenue for this financial year of $5 billion. We have not seen details provided of the revenue from each of the increased tax measures on the basis that the financial impact on the Commonwealth will be nil. This is not sufficient reason to not inform the House of the amounts estimated to be raised.

Discussion of the customs and excise power has had a long history in the High Court. Contrary to what the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) was saying, the answer is probably to be found in the constitutional convention which has been proposed by this government and opposed by the opposition in the Senate.

            Certainly in 1901, when the Federation was first proposed, section 90 of the constitution gave the Commonwealth exclusive power over customs and excise taxes. This section has been disputed a number of times in the High Court. First was in 1904 in Peterswald v. Bartley. This was the first time the High Court examined the constitution's prohibitions on the states imposing an excise duty. In that case the High Court adopted a narrow interpretation of excise duty by deciding that licence fees imposed by states on breweries were not actually excise duties. Under that narrow interpretation, excise duty was a tax specifically on the quantity or value of goods
            <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
             produced in the states. States could therefore apply a tax on goods which did not discriminate between goods produced within the state and goods produced outside the state.

            In 1926 was the petrol tax case, Commonwealth v. South Australia. In that case the High Court ruled that a South Australian tax of 2.5c per gallon on sellers of petrol was invalid, despite the fact that some of the petrol came from overseas, some from Victoria and some was produced within South Australia. Again, under section 90, which prohibited the states levying customs and excise duty, that was disallowed.

            In 1927 there was a newspaper case where the High Court ruled that a New South Wales tax on newspapers published and sold in that state was invalid on the grounds that it was an excise duty. In 1938, in Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board, the High Court ruled that a levy of $2 per half acre on land planted with chicory was invalid. In 1949, in Parton v. Milk Board (Vic), a levy of 0.1c per gallon imposed by the Victorian Milk Board on sellers of milk who were not the original producers was declared to be an excise and therefore invalid.

            Gradually over time you can see that the definition of excise was expanded to not just the production of goods but every stage of the distribution as well. Then in 1958, in Dennis Hotels v. Victoria, the High Court ruled that the temporary licence fee based on sales during a permit's duration was invalid. But they did allow a slight loophole, if you like, in that the annual licence fee based on sales during the previous 12 months was held not to be an excise fee and therefore was held to be valid. A number of cases, including State of Western Australia v. Chamberlain Industries Pty Ltd and Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v. Tasmania, followed that. In the Dickenson's Arcade case, the High Court upheld tobacco franchise fees, as it had upheld the liquor franchise fees in the Dennis Hotels case.

            When the Capital Duplicators case was being heard in 1993 it was felt that the High Court might disallow all business franchise fees in that case. Some emergency legislation was put into place. In fact, that legislation has just been resurrected and put into place here. Certainly it is something that you could have done with a bit of cooperation from the state governments. You would note that it was the Labor government in New South Wales that actually had the greatest difficulty in coming to any agreement with the Commonwealth on how to remedy the situation.

            In fact, the Carr government in New South Wales had been paid over $130 million in business franchise fees that they expected to pay from 6 August when this legislation comes into effect to the end of the year. It was going to be not only a windfall gain but a double whammy for the hoteliers in New South Wales. After much protesting, Bob Carr very reluctantly agreed to refund that money. The reason he was so reluctant to do that was that he had blown out the New South Wales budget enormously. New South Wales, of all the states, is heading for fiscal crisis by the mismanagement of a—wait for it—Labor government.

            I have had experience of the way that they look after minor interests. Shortly before the by-election in my electorate they miraculously found money which had not been budgeted for, for a tollway promise, to refund a couple of million dollars to the tollway users of Sydney. It was not to lift the tolls, mind you, but to give them an incredibly complex paperwork exercise that they could go through in order to get the votes in Western Sydney.

             Fortunately, that did not work. Obviously, since it was not budgeted for, it was a recurrent expenditure. The people of Western Sydney could see that it was just adding to the budget deficit. They realised that eventually they would have to pay for that, and they have paid. They have paid for it with a pokies tax. They have paid for it with a bed tax. They have paid for it with a new land tax. They have paid for it with a jump in the stamp duty on car and home insurance. They have paid for it with the doubling of parking taxes.

             It is absolutely ludicrous. The member for Wills is worried about the extra money that might be raised by putting an even tax right across all of the states and territories. He wants to be assured that of the $4.9 billion raised by these fees amongst the states—when an equal tax right across all of the states will raise $6 billion for the Commonwealth—$1 billion will go back to the states. Between six states and two territories, I suggest that the amount would be something close to that $130 million that Bob Carr wants to rip off the hotel and liquor licensing bodies.

The Labor Party has never been afraid of embracing the concept of taxation reform. I have got to say that in 13 years we did a little bit of it. We did a touch of it.

             —One of the more significant implications of the recent High Court decision, aside from the obvious one of guaranteeing an even greater degree of vertical fiscal imbalance in our federation, is the removal of yet another safeguard to responsible state government. I have said in this place on many occasions that there can be no real fiscal responsibility in Australia unless governments are made accountable for the taxpayers' money which they have responsibility for and which they spend.

            In removing the states' responsibility to impose franchise fees on tobacco, and by
            <break page="7569" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
             association fees on petroleum and liquor, the High Court has eroded further the checks and balances on the power of both the state and federal executive governments that are necessary to maintain their accountability. The decision to impose a national uniform income tax during the 1940s signalled the beginning of the end, and the dominance, as it turned out, of the Commonwealth in revenue raising ability. Since then federal governments have continued to become increasingly prescriptive in state activities through resort to tied grants, despite having no constitutional responsibility for the state programs.

            The High Court decision of 5 August 1997 has provided the state Premiers with the opportunity to now push for a thorough recalibration of the federal&amp;hyphen;state compact. The Western Australian state government alone stands to lose something like $600 million or 20 per cent of its annual revenue because of the ruling on the franchise fees. While there appears to be agreement on the part of all governments that the states will not lose out in pure revenue terms, they will unarguably become more dependent on the Commonwealth for funding.

            Amendments to the relevant state sales tax bills will see wholesale sales tax on alcohol rise by a uniform 15 per cent. The existing Commonwealth sales tax of 22 per cent on beer will therefore increase to 37 per cent, while wine will now be subject to a wholesale sales tax rate of 41 per cent, rather than the current levy federally of 26 per cent. This will bring all states into line with New South Wales, which presently has the highest rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages.

           <para first-indent="16">
            Increases to the rates of customs duty on tobacco and specified petroleum products will be brought about by changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These amendments will see the duty on petrol increase by 8.1c per litre to a standard 42.7c per litre in all states and territories. The most significant price increase will be on tobacco, with customs duty increasing from $84.27 per kilogram to $251.27 per kilogram. Overall, however, Treasury has given a commitment that no state's revenue will be worse off.

             Furthermore, the coalition has taken steps to ensure that the increases in wholesale sales tax will not have a detrimental impact on current small business exemptions from sales tax. Presently, if a small business has a sales tax liability that is less than $10,000, then it is exempt from this impost. Many of these small businesses will in future find themselves exceeding this threshold due to the 15 per cent hike in the rate of sales tax on alcohol. The government is right to exclude the additional sales tax when calculating the total tax liability of these small businesses.

            <para first-indent="16">
             Similarly, I support the move to ensure that the increase in sales tax on liquor does not force small business over the quarterly remittance threshold. To oblige small businesses to pay monthly would create additional compliance pressures for the very group to which the government has promised relief. The final safeguard for taxpayers in this bill is the amendment that has been moved by the government in relation to the credits on alcoholic beverages.

            Another protective measure in this legislation relates to the taxable value of goods. Schedule 1 of the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997  sets out what appears to be a fairly straightforward calculation to ensure that the taxable value of alcoholic beverages does not change. As a result, any rebate or refund made by the states to a sales tax payer on alcohol will not diminish the taxable value of the goods. This is an important measure, because it will prevent a loss of revenue to the states and territories and is therefore supportable.

            The Fraser government's Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Bill 1978 empowered the states to increase their revenue from personal income tax or to give a rebate on personal income tax to residents of a particular state. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was then Treasurer, had this to say during the debate on the new taxing arrangements back in 1978:

             In short, the legislation would have given and enabled the states more authority over their own revenue and expenditure—the very thing that commentators, and the states themselves, today lament they do not have. It is worth remembering that not one of the state premiers took up the opportunity. Not one of them was prepared to take on the responsibility of appropriating by income taxation more of the money they were spending.

             Opponents of the 1978 bill suggested that they were precluded from introducing state income taxes because of already high levels of personal income tax. It is true that the taxation burden imposed then by the Commonwealth on ordinary PAYE taxpayers had grown well beyond the role envisaged for it by those who drafted the constitution. However, it is equally true that the states opted not to commit to fiscal restraint and budgetary reform by becoming increasingly responsible for raising the revenue that was required to cover their expenses.

             Concern is now apparently being expressed that certain states are dragging their feet in putting in place the framework for the uniform reimbursement of money from franchise fees. The Commonwealth has sought to expedite this legislation and to help the states come to terms with their undesirable predicament. However, the states now have to help themselves. The ball is clearly in their court—and I mean no pun in referring to the Western Australian Premier.

             —In 1995, I listened with great interest to the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) talking about the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance faced by the states. She showed then that the past decade had witnessed a dramatic decline in the payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. Commonwealth own purpose outlays rose by 11 per cent from 1983 to

              1996 whilst total payments to the states and territories dropped 22 per cent as a proportion of government outlays. This cut in revenue share was exacerbated by an increase in the proportion of tied grants. The member for Mackellar termed it as an abuse of section 96 tied grants, and I agree. Labor reduced the states' share of funding and simultaneously removed their flexibility in determining how their funds would be spent.

            The Commonwealth Government has long forgotten that it is merely the trustee of income tax and excise revenues paid by Australians and that it is not giving to the States its own bounty. It is merely the trustee of this money. The States have responded to the challenge by increasing their own revenue sources from 39 per cent in 1982&amp;hyphen;83 to 49 per cent a decade later.

            As a former member of the coalition I moved a motion on Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state revenue sharing in 1994. At that time, I asked the simple question of the then Labor government: who is fiscally more responsible and better able to spend the hard&amp;hyphen;earned money of Australian taxpayers and manage government services—the states or Canberra? I have always been of the view that the trend towards centralisation of power in Canberra is anathema to the ideal of giving Australians better and more efficient government services.

            This country needs governments to get closer to the people of Australia not further away. It needs to get closer to the people that governments are supposed to serve. States like Western Australia, which have led the way in micro-economic reform in this country, have consistently adopted tight fiscal policy in recent years and yet they are not able to get the services which they require funded by the central government. This should be extremely worrying when you consider that the services that state funds are targeted at are real com

            The unfortunate thing is that the coalition are also culpable because they have had 18 months in government in which to start the reform process and have done nothing but make it worse. What we are seeing from the Howard government is a transition from Keating to more of the same. Despite the promise of the then opposition leader, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), on revenue sharing, the states have been further punished for fiscal responsibility in light of the Labor government's deficit. The coalition have increased the conditional nature of states grants. We now see that revenue is dependent upon meeting national competition policy guidelines and making a contribution to the federal government's coffers to help recover from Labor's mismanagement.

            I think that the coalition should seriously question this approach, as the people of the Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria will. They have all done their part by struggling to overcome Labor's fiscal vandalism to return their states to productive membership of the Commonwealth and for their troubles they get less federal funding. Unless the states can be given a reliable expectation that their revenue base is reliable and will expand adequately to meet the legitimate expectation of Australians who live within their boundaries, they will continue to be driven to raise more and more of their own income. This will not help the issue of tax reform in this country, rather it will further complicate it. I am concerned that this central situation—

             —Any reform of the Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state fiscal relations must be dealt with thoroughly. There were five principles that characterised the make&amp;hyphen;up of the Fraser government's 1978 bill, to which I have referred earlier. This first stipulated the need for uniformity in taxation rates between the states and a system that was administratively simple and cost effective. The government of the day also indicated the need for a system that minimised the opportunity for tax minimisation and evasion and one that would be convenient for all taxpayers. The final consideration sought to give legislated arrangements that were free of any significant constitutional doubt.

            It seems to me that every one of those standards remains valid and should be pursued by government in the renegotiation of the Commonwealth-state agreement. In 1989, the former Labor government repealed the Income Tax Arrangements with the States Act 1978. During the debate the then Treasurer, a well&amp;hyphen;known centralist, Mr Keating, said:

            I rejected the then Treasurer's comments at the time, and I reject them now. If we have states, we should give them proper power over their own finances and they should accept the responsibility that goes with that, but they have been loath to do that on the few occasions they have had to correct the imbalance. At the same time, the states must demonstrate a level of financial responsibility

I will be monitoring carefully the implementation of these amendments and will certainly pursue any related matters if the need arises.

            The limitation on the Commonwealth rescue of state revenue is that the Commonwealth cannot levy different rates of tax across the states. This means that states would levy differing rates of excise tax for the same goods. The Commonwealth is obliged to tax all states at the top rate for each commodity and attempt a system of refunds for those commodities whose tax rate has increased from the particular state rate to the top rate.

            This relies on the states participating in the refund. It makes the scheme more complicated and unwieldy and would attract management costs for both the Commonwealth and the states.

We were told then that these state excises on alcohol, tobacco and petroleum were in trouble and were likely to be struck down.

            I accept that the government must act quickly and I understand that its view is that this course is necessary as a short-term solution. But even the thought that it will be in place for as long as six months should be of great concern to all members of parliament and all Australians generally.
           </para>

            The decision by the High Court is a dramatic confirmation that the taxation and revenue raising system supporting government and the manner in which it is disbursed is totally out of control and operating in a fashion that was never intended by the framers of our constitution or those of us who have had the opportunity to amend it through referendum.

            I have listened to people saying that this legislation is necessary because of a ruling by the High Court. It is clearly not the case. This legislation is necessary because the states have been acting unconstitutionally and the High Court has acted in accord with its duty. What worries me is that the Commonwealth sees no problem in introducing legislation to circumvent the constitution.

            What I would have expected to see in the government's response to this crisis in state revenue raising was a statement of its objectives on a restructuring of the revenue sharing relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. After all, I recollect the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announcing on 6 June 1995:
           </para>
           <para font-size="-=2">
            . . . a Coalition government will allocate a fixed percentage of tax revenue to the States and wind back the proportion of disbursements taking the form of tied grants so that the States will be able to decide their own priorities and stand accountable for them by the people of those States.

             ments and announced it over two years ago. I would have expected that some inkling of its objectives, in light of this revenue crisis, would be announced now. This would take pressure off the government, which sees as its only answer to legislate a loophole to overcome the intent of the Australian constitution.

            Such a statement would also give the states an indication of their future revenue base and the manner in which they should plan to appropriate funds for the future. Instead we have in front of us a set of bills which sets a process in place to perpetuate something which was found to be illegal. We are told it will be reviewed in six months, but we see no leadership displayed on the matter of where we are going with this.

            I mentioned earlier the problem of states revenue and in particular the greater and greater reliance on casino gambling income—a matter that is of particular concern to me. I notice at the table the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is a member of the Lyons Forum and would share my view that the burgeoning of casino gambling as a source of revenue for the states is a matter of grave concern to all Australians, and it is a matter that is exacerbated by this sort of legislation.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            When you speak to ministers in the state governments—as I have spoken to ministers in the Western Australian government—you find that they now see revenue from casino gambling as an integral part of state revenue. Of course, they see it translated almost directly into the sorts of services that states are obliged to provide to their citizens—the core, fundamental services that states view as being integral to their duty and service to the community.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            It is a matter of grave concern that, on the one hand, the states are providing these services and, on the other, they are relying more and more on revenue from casino gambling, which generates the sorts of social problems such as gambling dependence, bankruptcy, crime, drug trafficking, money laundering and even the withdrawal of money from the legitimate economy of the state.

             —The debate on Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2] is a continuation from last night. Many of us, certainly on our side of the parliament, wanted to see the sitting time extended because the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) was going to contribute. We were all very interested to hear what he was going to say, particularly about schedule 3 of this bill, which deals with the sugar industry. We all know that the honourable member for Kennedy has a particular interest in sugar. We know that the member for Dawson (Mrs De&amp;hyphen;Anne Kelly) similarly has an interest in sugar. We would like to hear from both of those honourable members on their position.

            As I mentioned, the legislation goes more broadly than simply talking about sugar. Last evening my friend and colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) put the opposition's view very clearly in respect of that particular issue. What he said was that there was a belief, and I think a justifiable belief, that the issues surrounding the passage
            <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
             of this element of the legislation were in fact contrary to what the government had previously said. It was contrary to what the government believed was necessary and probably, dare I say, contrary to what they had taken to the people of Australia, particularly in sugar seats, when they told them what was going to happen should they be elected.

            What we have seen for Queensland sugar growers is changed circumstances. What we have seen for northern New South Wales sugar growers is changed circumstances. What we have seen generally is an unhappy mix as a result of the decision taken by this government in respect of this matter. It more broadly fits into the whole issue that is raging in Australia at the moment about industry assistance. It goes more broadly to the way in which tariffs and customs schedules might be applied to industries where it is considered that a particular status should continue to be enjoyed by those industries in the hope that we will not see massive job losses.

           <para first-indent="16">
            We on this side of the parliament embrace those issues. We believe that whilst economic issues need to be considered when examining these matters so too must social consequences of decisions that are taken. I again cannot help but reflect upon decisions taken by the present government when forced to adopt Labor Party policies and principles in respect of the car industry. We all wait with bated breath to see what they are going to do next in terms of textiles, clothing and footwear. They have nailed their colours well and truly to the mast in respect of this element of the bill tonight, and I am talking of course about sugar. The member for Kennedy has indicated he supports Labor. He has indicated he supports this element of—

Again, on issues like coalmining and sugar the honourable member for Kennedy has very similar views to Mr Maitland, the president of the miners federation. I know Mr Maitland. If your views are close to Mr Maitland's, then you will certainly be voting with the Labor Party tonight or tomorrow or whenever this legislation comes to a vote because his views are the views that we are espousing.

             There are a couple of other matters I want to raise associated with this customs legislation. I refer particularly to a couple of the schedules dealing with our relationship with Canada. I am referring as well to information technology agreements, which my good friend the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) would be vitally interested in, and also tariff changes due to AAT decisions. I very quickly would like to comment on each of those. The opposition is not opposed to those amendments and will not be prolonging any debate or division in this place in respect of those issues. But we will be prolonging the debate on the issue of sugar, and we flag now that the issue of the sugar tariffs will be subject to our opposition.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Schedule 1 of the legislation before us is an administrative change. When the Customs Tariff Act was rewritten in 1995, a small number of editorial errors were revealed. As a consequence, there are some changes that are necessary there. All Customs documentation used since the commencement date of the new act—that is, 1 July 1996—quoted and used incorrect listing and rates of duties in a particular area, and as a consequence these changes will be put in place. Schedule 2 of the legislation goes to the bilateral trade agreement to which Canada and Australia are parties. It is called CANATA. Under this agreement, both countries allocate each other certain trade benefits.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             In 1995, Canada gave sugar from certain developing countries similar benefits to those received by Australian exporters. As sugar accounts for 20 per cent of Australia's exports to Canada, this decision had a serious impact on our trade. I am sure honourable members would reflect upon that very carefully. The then Minister for Trade, my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), advised the Canadian government that Australia intended to remove the CANATA rates of duty from Canadian imports of petrochemicals, namely, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl esters.

             In 1996, the incoming government reviewed the previous government's decision, and ministers Fischer and Moore decided to implement the withdrawal of the concession.

              The five per cent margin of preference has been withdrawn since 1 January 1997. Again, this is a sensible move. It is part of the bilateral trade arrangement between the two countries and, as I have indicated, the opposition will not be opposing that.

             I have referred already to the issue of sugar. The member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson will, I am sure, both be made welcome on the opposition side of this chamber when the vote is taken on this bill, as will, probably, a number of their colleagues. The member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) was also reasonably vocal. I can recall seeing a document that the honourable member for Richmond signed up to in the election campaign. He said that he would never ever support reductions of the sugar tariffs. A funny thing, that—the words sound a bit like the sort of spiel of our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with respect to a GST, `Not ever. Never. No new taxes.'

            <para first-indent="16">
             The honourable member for Richmond signed up to that. We have seen the documentation, we have seen the signature and we believe it is his. Accordingly, we would like to see him join the member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson on the opposition side when this issue is put to the test. Of course, it is all subject to the pressure that people like the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), and others will be trying to bring to bear on these people of conscience as they vote to support something which is right. People like the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) will also have a hand in that, I am sure.

As I indicated, the member for Bonython has a great interest in this. This agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on computer technology and telecommunications products by 1 January 2000. The agreement was signed by Australia on 13 March 1997 and has 41 signatories, which account for 92 per cent of world trade in these products.

              It is worth pausing at this time to reflect on the fact that the Goldsworthy report was handed to the government in recent weeks and talks about the technology industry in this country. It talks about a whole variety of matters associated with government incentives to try to give substance to and support for this industry. Most members would probably not be aware that, in terms of technology, Australia is the second highest technologically advanced economy in our region; second only to Japan.

As a consequence of that, of course, any agreements that are going to be signed between Australia, the European Union and other countries will allow us to take a great deal of economic benefit from any trade arrangements that are put in place.

              I mentioned also that tariff changes due to AAT decisions are included in this bill. They go to the issue of surgical drapes, lamps in chapter 85, power supply units for computers and, in each one of these cases, certain classifications and duties applying are reviewed as a result of AAT decisions in respect of where each of those matters should be classified. Again, the opposition signals that it has no problem with this at all and wishes it speedy passage through the parliament.

               Finally, schedule 5 reviews the international model of the WCO, which has a six&amp;hyphen;digit tariff. The difficulty is that Australia has added a seventh digit and an eighth digit to enable the application of different rates of duty to different goods within the international six&amp;hyphen;figure tariff. On 1 July 1998, the duty rate on some of these seven&amp;hyphen; and eight&amp;hyphen;digit tariff subheadings in the textile, clothing and footwear section of the tariff will phase down to the same level, making the need for these subheadings redundant. The amendments in this schedule amalgamate them and this will simplify the tariff and make classification of goods easier. Where separate trade statistics are required by industry, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will provide statistical splits to gather the data.

We will have to wait to see how that will work. I know that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) will be watching that with some interest.

                —You are on the list. That is good. We do not have to give up one of ours for you. You can tell the people of Dawson, just like you did on phase 1 of the reef tax, how you are going to support this issue. This will be an interesting and instructive example because, as I mentioned to the member for Dawson last night, phase 2 of the reef tax is going to be coming in towards the end of this year. The electorate of Dawson is vitally affected by this government decision, just as it is by sugar. She will have an opportunity to practise her response on the reef tax later tonight in the debate on this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill because she will be able to tell us about the sugar industry.

               Let me conclude where I started. I indicated that the opposition does not oppose schedules 1, 2 and 5. We certainly oppose schedule 3 in respect of sugar but not in respect of information technology tariff changes due to AAT decisions. The legislation before this parliament tonight is important, as it was last night. As I indicated, the honourable member for Burke went to a great deal of trouble to clearly set out why our party's position in respect of sugar is what it is. We simply say again to the government: we have laid out on

               The member for Richmond has signed a declaration in his own blood that he will support the sugar growers in his own electorate. We would like to think that that is going to be adhered to when he gets an opportunity to speak, as he will just before the member for Dawson.

                We look forward to the contribution by the member for Kennedy. It is probably worthwhile getting an audience for him at some stage. I commend to the House those elements of the legislation which the opposition will support.

The information on ranks was provided following a request by the Chief Minister acting in his capacity as the member for Port Darwin. Mr Stone asked that ranks be provided for those persons whose given and family names appeared on an extract which he provided from the electoral roll as being residents of Larrakeyah Barracks.

                   —Although there are a number of reasons why a country has a tariff and why a country keeps a tariff, there are two outstanding reasons. The first is when you are competing against product that is subsidised. Sugar is a

                    product that for various reasons is heavily subsidised throughout the world. If you are looking for the base reason to have a tariff, it is because you are competing against highly subsidised product which can come in from other countries. I believe profoundly the second reason that a country has to have a tariff is when it is competing against countries that pay slave labour wage levels to their employees. I will read from the Report to the President Publication 2276 by the US International Trade Commission in 1990. The US International Trade Commission 1990 Estimated Tariff Equivalents of US Quotas on Agricultural Imports and Analysis of Competitive Conditions in US and Foreign Markets for Sugar, Meat, Peanuts, Cotton and Dairy Products.

                  The average subsidy for sugar in Japan for the years from 1986 to 1988 was 481 per cent. In the European Community the average is 193 per cent. The average for the United States—and I must pay them some tribute for honesty because this is a United States publication—is 175 per cent. In the international marketplace we find ourselves competing against countries such as Japan, that has a subsidy level of 481 per cent; the European Community, 193 per cent; and the United States, 175 per cent.

They are dumping a product with a subsidy tariff equivalent of 193 per cent onto the world's market. Tonight many of the members of this parliament are moving to allow that product, subsidised at 193 per cent, into this country completely unsanctioned. All I can say is that the rest of the trading nations of the world must simply laugh at Australia.

                  Let us look at the way other countries treat the World Trade Organisation. We recently gave $1,000 million to Thailand. As a result of the WTO, Thailand, which has had a complete ban on the importation of sugar, has decided that they will shift down to a quota, and they are allowing some 13,150 tonnes of sugar into the country. To put that into context, we produce some 20 million tonnes of sugar in Australia. So their idea of free trade is a quota of 13,150 tonnes of sugar.

                 <para first-indent="16">
                  I do not know, nor do I understand, how Thailand can afford to have a subsidy level of between 80 and 110 per cent, but that is the figure quoted by the Sugar Corporation of Australia and various other bodies. I have no doubt that it is true. Thailand is one of the major players in the world export market today and will probably become a very strong competitor for Australia in the international marketplace.

                  The other sugar producing countries of the world are based in Central and South America where wage levels are commonly around $4 or $5 a day. We are asked to compete against such wage levels of $4 or $5 a day. It is with great pride that I reflect upon the fact that, in the main, the former Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland has been responsible—along, of course, with the industry which deserves 90 per cent of the credit—for producing an industry that is competing on the world market against the tariff subsidy of 193 per cent. The sugar industry is set up in such an efficient way on economies of scale which are unrivalled anywhere in the world that we are able to produce this product.

                  newspaper, Malcolm Fraser, a former Prime Minister of Australia, singled out sugar and said, `Europe is a country that should not be growing sugar. It is so totally non&amp;hyphen;competitive that it should not be growing sugar.' Yet, far from accepting or listening to the advice of a former Prime Minister of Australia, whom I think is writing very sensible stuff at present, we are going in the complete opposite direction. Those are the reasons for having a tariff.

                   The reason for removing a tariff which we hear constantly from the economic rationalists in this place and in other places is to reduce the cost structures of Australian industry. I was a very strong supporter of that point of view until I saw how it had worked out in the petrol industry. We deregulated that industry and removed all the restrictions on the importation of petrol into this country. The net result was not a lowering of the price of petrol in Australia. In fact, what happened was that the price of petrol in Australia doubled. The price we paid the oil companies went from 12&amp;half;c a litre to 22&amp;half;c a litre in exactly the same period of time that the world price of petrol, as all of us are well aware, dropped clean in half.

                   So that was a magnificent success story! The oil companies were able to get away with 20c a litre which they were not entitled to. Their take doubled in exactly the same period of time as the world's price for oil dropped clean in half. If you multiply 20c a litre by the litreage in Australia, you come up with a very interesting figure of $6,000 million a year that that little economic rationalist initiative cost this country.

                   One of the highly controversial areas at the present moment is the motor vehicle industry. The very wise people who advise governments in Australia came out with the ORANI model. The ORANI model said that, over a 10-year period, there would be a 20 per cent intrusion of imports of motor vehicle and motor vehicle components into Australia. They were not far out! There was a 63 per cent intrusion over five years.

                   That was just how staggeringly wrong the economic models upon which decision making in this country was based and is based right at this very moment. Not only is the philosophy and the implementation of that philosophy flawed but also the programming, figures and information that is flowing from the public servants who are responsible for advising the government are dreadfully and fundamentally flawed, the motor vehicle industry being a classic example. A 63 per cent intrusion over five years is an easy statistic to reel off, but that translates into a cost of $5,000 million a year to the Australian

                   The arguments for having a tariff in the sugar industry could never be stronger. The major world exporter has a 193 per cent subsidy. I emphasise they are not my figures; they are the figures of the United States government. The United States government freely admit that they have a tariff subsidy equivalent of 175 per cent. So I do not think we can accuse them of dishonesty in this case. There could not be a more cogent reason than the fact that we are up against slave labour wage levels from South America.

The ALP removed 60 per cent of this tariff; there is only 40 per cent of the tariff left that the government is attempting to remove this evening. The member for Richmond produced figures to indicate that, when the tariff of some $60 a tonne was removed on a product of some $350 a tonne—so it was a very hefty reduction in the price of sugar—the retail price of sugar for the consumers in this country did not go down but went up. We should pay tribute to the honourable member for Richmond for pointing out that to the House and to the people of Australia.

                   Let me move on: the reason that we are sitting here tonight allegedly is because the sugarcane growers of Australia want the tariff to be removed. All I can say is, `Please do not go to a sugar meeting and vent that sort of viewpoint.' I did hear a senator from this place put that viewpoint forward at a meeting in Ingham. I spent most of the meeting looking for a telephone because I thought I

That is what this translates to—a reduction in our incomes of some $4,000. I understand it is much higher in New South Wales, where all of their sugar goes onto the home market. It is probably some $14,000 per year there.

                   The sugarcane growers did not ask for the abolition of the tariff for any reason other than that the Hilmer gun was held at our heads. Whilst I do not wish to be churlish to the ALP—I am very appreciative of the fact that they are going to oppose this proposal—I must point out to the House that the reason we were placed in this invidious situation of a choice between deregulation or the abolition of the tariff was that the ALP passed the infamous Hilmer legislation and imposed that upon this industry and put the industry under great threat.

                   It must be pointed out to the House why the sugar industry is placed under such great threat by deregulation. Unlike other products, sugar is a very cheap commodity per tonne. In fact, growers get paid only around $30 per tonne for the product. If a grower is paid $30 a tonne for the product and the cost of producing that product is $22 a tonne—I think that would be correct—to cart the product 100 kilometres would cost $10 a tonne. I know this because we cart from Mareeba to Mossman at the moment, and that is the figure that is quoted there. So, if you add $22 a tonne for the cost of production and $10 a tonne for the cost of moving it 100 kilometres, you make no profit at all; in fact, you make a loss on the product.

Whatever so-called benefits will flow on to the consumers—and, listening to the honourable member for Richmond, I think they are negligible—they have already flowed. That is past tense. All we are talking about here with this tariff is keeping foreign product, which is subsidised and produced at slave labour wage levels, from coming into this country.

It has been the fundamental lifeblood of much of coastal Queensland. Australia is the world's seventh largest sugar producing nation and one of the largest exporters of raw sugar. Australia produces in excess of five million tonnes of sugar annually, with approximately 85 per cent of this being exported—and the proportion is growing.

                  Queensland is by far Australia's largest sugar producing state, producing approximately 95 per cent of Australia's raw sugar and virtually all of our exports. New South Wales has a small industry and there is an emerging sugar industry now also in Western Australia. Queensland has about 6,400 cane farms, with an average farm size of around 75 hectares. The Queensland industry employs approximately 19,000 people directly and a further 26,000 indirectly.

                  The tariff affects only imports into Australia. There is very little sugar that comes into this country. I am advised that only $70,000 of tariff was paid last year.

                  The reality is that sugar imports are very limited at the present time.

                  Mr Deputy Speaker, are you aware of the fact that every single tariff reduction in the history of the sugar industry up until tonight has been made by the Labor Party? It is the Labor Party that abolished the sugar embargo. Prior to May 1988, sugar imports were totally banned in Australia. It was the Labor Party that lifted that embargo. At the time, they announced that they would introduce an ad valorem tariff of 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar, both phasing to 15 per cent by mid-1992.

                 <para first-indent="16">
                  The industry was appalled by this shock announcement by the Labor government. It was clear that the legislation was not going to pass the Senate, so eventually a compromise was reached and the government introduced a specific rate of tariff on imports of both raw and refined sugar of $115 per tonne from July 1989, falling to $95 per tonne in July 1991 and $70 per tonne in July 1992.

                  The Labor Party were not satisfied with that. They did not even honour that promise. In March 1991, in their economic statement, they reneged on that deal and announced further reductions. The scheduled $95 per tonne in July 1991 became $76, and the $70 per tonne went to $55. That is Labor's record. They are the ones who have cut tariffs. How can they now possibly stand in this House and pretend to be the defenders of tariffs?

It was the Labor Party: Prime Minister Keating, Premier Goss and the other premiers, most of whom were Labor at the time. And who was it that accepted the recommendations and endorsed them?

                  But, when the report came in, it was a unanimous report. There were 74 recommendations, all of which were approved unanimously by the committee. The committee's recommendations were wide ranging and included some very significant matters of vital importance to the industry, such as the retention of the single desk arrangements on the domestic market. There are no other primary industries which enjoy that privilege, so that

                  They also recommended the retention of pooling and the assignment system—again, unique to the sugar industry and not generally approved of in other industries. Those are considered by the sugar industry to be fundamental planks to the future of their industry. But the committee, in one of its very early recommendations, also recommended that the tariff should be abolished from 1 July. The industry—those on the review committee—unanimously recommended that the tariff should go.

                  I think that the sugar industry dealt itself a pretty tough card. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), said, the coalition went to the last election promising to retain the sugar tariff. I believe that promise could have been sustained, and would have been honoured, had it not been for the fact that the working party and the industry unanimously recommended that the tariff should go. What responsible government could talk to the industry leaders, listen to what they had to say, and then not do precisely what they had asked it to do?

                  I know, and it is beyond dispute, that there are many farmers who do not understand the recommendations of their presidents and their leaders. There are many farmers who would like to retain the tariff. They see its comfort element as being important. They believe that it is a part of the protection that their industry would like to have. But the reality is that their elected leaders made a recommendation to the government, and it is therefore my view that the government has little option but to endorse that recommendation. To be fair to those leaders, they believed that they were delivering a comprehensive package of 74 recommendations. They made it clear that they did not want some adopted and not the others. They wanted the package adopted lock, stock and barrel.

                  The Queensland government was quick to accept the working party's recommendations and to agree to the proposals that were put forward. The Commonwealth government has been much slower to respond and I have to acknowledge that I, and some of my National

                   Party colleagues, were amongst those who urged the government to be cautious. We were conscious of the fact that there were ordinary growers who felt they wanted to keep the tariff and we needed to work through these sorts of issues to ensure that we were taking the industry with us in our dealings on these particular matters.

                  So I do not believe the government and the parliament has any option other than to accept the recommendations of the working party—the committee that was established to look at just these sorts of measures. I have to say that there are a number of the other recommendations which will have a much bigger impact on my electorate than the abolition of the sugar tariff. For instance, the decision to get rid of the two-pooling system will benefit sugar growers in electorates such as that of the member for Dawson (Mrs De&amp;hyphen;Anne Kelly) but will cause significant disadvantage in my own area where most of the growers have been long&amp;hyphen;term growers and therefore suppliers to pool No. 1. They are going to lose some returns as a result of that and I believe they will lose more from that decision than they will lose from the loss of the tariff.

                 <para first-indent="16">
                  But perhaps most important of all was the quite curious recommendation of the working party that the domestic price should be set at export parity level. Export parity pricing means that Australian sugar users will get the advantage of buying sugar at a price cheaper than it can come into this country by the equivalent of the freight. It would have been perfectly reasonable for the review working party to have recommended that the price should have been set at import parity. It would certainly have had a significant benefit to growers in real returns.

                  But they took the tough decision. They decided that they were prepared to lay their industry level with the rest of the world and to compete against them on the domestic market. I think that was a very courageous decision. But those two recommendations alone will have a much more significant effect on the welfare of the growers of sugar in my electorate, and indeed in many of the other parts of Queensland, than the decision to abolish the tariff.

                   I can understand as well why the sugar growers of my electorate are concerned that their tariff is going, only weeks after the government has announced a package that will sustain a tariff regime for the motor vehicle industry. Naturally, they have got a right to feel upset that they are losing their tariff while they are still going to have to pay $2,000 to $3,000 extra to buy a car because of the tariff protection for that industry.

                   They will be particularly annoyed because, just weeks after the government announced its tariff package for the motor vehicle industry, the car companies turned around and gave an industry leading pay rise to their workers. They were bleating about how the industry could not survive, yet they could afford, immediately after the tariffs were announced, major pay rises for their workers. This naturally concerns the growers in my area.

                   They are also noticing the lobbying from the textiles, clothing and footwear industries to protect their tariff. I was interested to read the submission of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, in which they were arguing for the retention of the tariff in their industries. On page 20 of the submission is an extraordinary confession. While they are talking about a loss of jobs in Victoria and, to some extent, New South Wales if the TCF tariff goes, they say:

                  <para style="Para">
                   That is assuming the tariff goes. They go on to say:

                  <para font-size="-=2">
                   This is more than offset by the benefit to them of job increases in other traded industries, together with the regional multiplier effects of this on non-traded industries. Queensland has a jobs gain of about 4,000, Western Australia, 2,600, and the two territories 1,000.

                   The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are themselves arguing that there will be job gains in Queensland, Western Australia and the territories if the tariff goes. So these stories are not simply one way. The facts are that Australia has been active in fora such as the World Trade Organisation in seeking to liberalise trade barriers, to work towards a situation where there is fairer trade around the world. We have only a very small domestic
                   <break page="7589" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
                    market. For sugar, it is around 10 per cent of our production. So we have a vested interest in having freer trade around the world. As an efficient producer of primary products in particular, with an educated and skilled work force, we can expect to expand our markets enormously if barriers to our products are eliminated by other countries around the world. It only requires about a third of our existing farmers to produce the food that is necessary to feed our population. So our farmers are particularly dependent on having access to world markets.

                   I believe that Australia is therefore right to be pursuing freer trading rules, but of course we should not pointlessly sacrifice Australian industries unless there is a clear indication that other countries are also relaxing their trading rules. The Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who I note is at the table now, made the point again just recently that Australia is not prepared to unilaterally reduce its tariffs unless other countries act likewise. It is pleasing to note that there has been considerable progress in breaking down barriers. Let us look at some of the recent events.

                   Over recent months Mexico has reduced the tariff on Australian wool. Malaysia and Thailand have eliminated tariffs on a range of dairy products. Korea has lifted artificial barriers on Australian meats and is taking our poultry. Taiwan will be accepting Australian fruit. The United States is taking another 85,000 tonnes of Australian sugar. So the sugar industry as well—indeed, all farmers—stand to benefit significantly from genuinely free and fairer trade around the world. We should not unilaterally disarm, but we should certainly be active in building new markets wherever we can.

I personally believe that in coming years the work of the missions will become even more important as it appears the Australian coast run is about to be open to the rust buckets of the world. The world's shipping fleet is ageing. Shipping is a very competitive business. Pressures are exerted to cut costs. It seems that it is usually the wages and conditions of the crews that are the first to suffer. This is not the main cost of shipping, but they are always the first things to suffer. Many of these crews are from Third World countries. They have no-one to defend them or depend on but the missions or the International Transport Federation.

                   I have been told many times, as other people have been, that if seafarers come into one of Australia's ports and make contact with the International Transport Federation and complain they often, not always, disappear off the Australian coastline. This could be on a trip from Sydney up to Brisbane. There have been examples of beatings and mistreatment. People who think that people like myself and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) exaggerate when we speak on such topics only need to talk to the chaplains, like Lance Puckeridge, from the many missions around Australia and they will find that they all tell the same stories of the mistreatment and malnutrition of many seafarers, especially those from Third World countries.

                   Yet through all this the missions serve as a beacon to seafarers of whatever race, creed or wherever they come from. In Port Kembla, as in missions throughout the world, they find a safe haven, comfort, fellowship and spiritual assistance. The seafarer's life means isolation and long absences from family, home and friends which create a host of special problems. The missions are always there at the dock to offer a welcome, to help with problems, to arrange contact at home and to provide care and fellowship. Long may the work of the missions' chaplains such as Lance Puckeridge continue. Long may it be a beacon throughout the world. Long may the flying angel be a sign of fellowship, comfort and understanding to seafarers throughout the world.

Princess Diana and the Queen Mother are the two that I consider to be great role models and if I hear their names mentioned I always listen with great interest. This is not to say that I am not fond of the others, but we are all individuals and they are my choice.

                  Whilst the 1997 budget has provided some partial and very much belated recognition of `operational service' for those veterans, an `active service' role for the RAN has continued to be denied by the government.

                  Anzac and Tobruk were part of a night operational gunfire encounter exercise with two Royal Navy destroyers and a cruiser . . . During this exercise both RAN ships were the target of illumination by star shell fire. My duties on that night were C.O. of "B" gun bay.

                  During the star shell firing an announcement was made that the exercise had been terminated and for all ships to undarken ship due to the Tobruk having been hit by gunfire (star shell) from a RN ship.

                  This issue, however, raises perhaps a bigger one, that is, what is the role of a representative? I have pointed out to my constituents that, whilst this is understandably something about which we in Bradfield are concerned, when I surveyed the electorate last year the issue of greatest concern to them was Australia's national debt. The government, having inherited a $10.3 billion deficit, set about returning the finances of the nation to a surplus. Of course we will be running a $1.6 billion surplus next year and a $10.6 billion surplus in 2000&amp;hyphen;2001.

                  In other parts of Australia, low income people have lost funding for dental health care. They have lost in areas of relatively high unemployment labour market programs. Commonwealth Employment Service offices have been closed. There is a significant human toll being paid by those who are  suffering the effects of industrial readjustment, particularly in regional Australia. We hear of, and I know of, Australians who are working in areas where they have relied on forestry, for example, where there is significant unemployment as we reconcile the needs for environmental preservation with the needs to develop Australia's forestry and timber industries.

If the greatest price my constituents pay for returning Australia's national accounts to a surplus is to have a Medicare office close in an area that is relatively well serviced, in an area that is relatively well off compared with other parts of Australia, then perhaps the sacrifice we are making is not that great.

                   —Sunday's death of Princess Diana must, when the grieving has stopped, warn us of the presence of an insidious sickness in our society—voyeurism. Those paparazzi whom Diana was fleeing when she died were acting as agents for all of us who buy the magazines, buy the newspapers and watch the TV footage for the latest bit of scandal. Diana's brother was right when he said that the media has blood on its hands. But I do not think the blood stops there. We need to realise what kind of society we have become and just how low we have sunk.

                  Clearly Diana's car was travelling way too fast, but that misses the real point. People who draw attention to this are really saying that Diana could not escape the paparazzi, that they could record and photograph her every move. Does anyone here seriously think the paparazzi or the media who buy their pictures have any standards, that they would have drawn the line, for example, at photographing Diana and Dodi in the cot? I don't. I think that is precisely the picture they were after.

                  In 1986, 12 men were entombed by a coalmine explosion in Moura, Queensland. The pregnant widow of one of the trapped miners was approached by a journalist at 1.30 a.m. and offered money for her story. On another occasion a photographer posed as a doctor to gain unauthorised entry to a hospital where he took pictures of an actress suffering from a drug overdose. One Melbourne paper published a photograph of two grief&amp;hyphen;stricken women who had just heard that their husbands' bodies had been found in a blizzard at Mount Hotham in Victoria. The picture was taken without the women's consent by a photographer using a long&amp;hyphen;distance lens.

We could kill this paparazzi thing stone dead simply by banning the publication of photographs taken without the subject's consent. Why should someone be able to take photographs of us without getting our consent and sell them for personal gain? There would need to be exemptions of course. The police could approve the publication of photos for persons wanted for criminal offences. Consent could not be given selectively or subsequently withdrawn. You would need to arrange prior approvals for sports events, broadcasts of parliament and all sorts of things.

                  Last year the Prime Minister acted decisively on guns and won the support of a nation for his strong stand which created something good from the national tragedy at Port Arthur and turned us away from a descent into a violent gun culture. The death of the Princess of Wales is a world tragedy. Is it not once more time for the Prime Minister to act decisively to rid us of another scourge—the incessant invasions of privacy which come, it must be acknowledged, from the voyeur in us all but also from a media which has lost its way and is caught in a vicious, ever downward spiral with standards falling, falling, falling in the incessant drive for sales and profits and an edge on the competition?

Both of us are opposing these moves tonight. Clearly we would not be doing that if the industry was in favour of these moves. So I must disagree with his statements. He said that there were two grower representatives on the review. One of those grower representatives has changed his position in the meantime. What is more, those growers only made that decision because they had the gun of deregulation at their head. That is a point that cannot be overemphasised in this place.

                  Adding to what I said previously this evening, there are two models—the Australian economic model and the Japanese economy model. In Japan, the trade balance last year was a $131,000 million surplus, the biggest trade surplus recorded in world history. Japan is a country that does not work on the policy of abolishing tariffs. It is a country that works on just the opposite policy of doing everything humanly possible to defend and develop industries. It seems to me that we have a policy that is just the opposite. To put a $131,000 million trade surplus into perspective, the United States last year recorded a $106,000 million deficit. The average income for Japan working on a policy of aggressive trade policies—the non&amp;hyphen;removal of tariffs and doing everything humanly possible to protect and defend their workers and the workers'

In 1972, unemployment in this country—the last year of John McEwan—was 2.2 per cent. In 1996, it was 8.9 per cent. The current account deficit was a $403 million surplus. It is now a deficit of over $20,200,000.

                      (2) On 2 March 1996 DIMA had before it 31 cases. The reason for the increase is twofold. Prior to the 1996 Federal election every effort was made to finalise outstanding requests for Ministerial intervention. Secondly, on 14 May 1996, Justice Merkel of the Federal Court handed down a decision in the Ozmanian case. The findings in this case went to the heart of the administration of my public interest powers. I appealed this decision. Further action on requests was deferred until the impact on administrative procedures was examined and further procedures were developed. Processing of cases did not recommence until 19 September 1996. During this period a large backlog of requests developed. In addition, there has been a significant rise in the number of requests for Ministerial intervention received in the last 12 to 18 months. This is probably, in part, because of the delay in processing requests which occurred as a result of Ozmanian, including dealing with the backlog. All requests seeking my intervention are now personally-seen by me.

                      (1) I have taken a close interest in Mr de Robillard's case. On 27 March 1997, Mr de Robillard was sentenced to two months imprisonment in Vanuatu for contempt of court. He subsequently lodged an appeal against his sentence, which was heard by a specially convened Appeal Court on 5 and 6 May. That Court quashed Mr de Robillard's conviction.

                      (2) When an Australian citizen is arrested overseas my Department undertakes as an established consular practice to inform next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin of the arrest, or else another nominated person if the citizen in question does not wish his next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin to be informed. Following his arrest on 26 March 1997, Mr de Robillard was provided with the Department's standard consular advice letter, which included that advice, by the Consul in Port Vila. Mr de Robillard informed the Consul that his next&amp;hyphen;

                       of&amp;hyphen;kin were already aware of his situation, but requested that a legal colleague in Australia be notified in order to arrange his legal representation. It was explained to Mr de Robillard that in circumstances where next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin had been informed of an arrest, the Department would not normally contact other parties. The Department considers next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin better placed than itself in notifying other non&amp;hyphen;family members of information relating to a person arrested overseas. Next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin can better judge whom the individual overseas would want contacted beyond the immediate family, and similarly, how much information to disseminate. Accordingly, the Department treats next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin as a central point for dissemination of information about an Australian overseas.

                      Mr de Robillard noted that he had instructed his secretary in Australia to advise his lawyers of his arrest, but took the view that the terms of the consular letter, strictly construed, entitled him to ask that the Consul contact someone other than his next&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;kin. The Consul agreed to pass Mr de Robillard's request to the Department in Canberra. Later that day—the day immediately before the Easter break—officers of my Department attempted to telephone the person nominated by Mr de Robillard, but there was no answer. The Department made contact with the person on the morning immediately following the Easter break.

                      (3) The High Commissioner, Mr Edwards, his staff in Vanuatu and the Department in Canberra were extremely active in their efforts to assist Mr de Robillard. The High Commissioner was informed of Mr de Robillard's arrest at approximately 10 p.m. on 26 March 1997. The High Commissioner in turn advised the Australian Consul, Mr Brims. Subsequent to the phonecall from Mr Edwards, Mr Brims contacted the Central Police Station and spoke to the Deputy Police Officer, who confirmed that Mr de Robillard had been arrested and was being held there. The officer refused to allow the Consul to speak with Mr de Robillard on the telephone, noting the late hour, and advised Mr

Mr Brims visited Mr de Robillard at the Central Police Station in Port Vila at 9:00 a.m. the next morning, 27 March 1997.

                      Following Mr de Robillard's arrest, the staff of the High Commission made a number of representations to the relevant authorities, to express consular interest in his case, to encourage the holding of an early appeal, and to raise the question of a possible early release to facilitate the preparation of his case for the appeal hearing. Those contacted included the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, and a number of senior officials. In addition, officers of the Department in Canberra spoke directly with Mr de Robillard on a number of occasions concerning the handling of the case. The Head of the Consular Response Group was sent to Port Vila from 19 to 23 April to assist the High Commission with the handling of the case. While there, this officer called twice on Mr de Robillard, spending a total of nearly three hours with him. Further, when the prison authorities sought to impose conditions more in keeping with those applicable to his fellow Ni&amp;hyphen;Vanuatu prisoners, the Mission interceded and assisted in restoring the food and telephone access privileges previously enjoyed by Mr de Robillard.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sought advice from the Vanuatu Supreme Court regarding the necessary procedures for Mr de Robillard's counsel to obtain a temporary practising certificate for the appeal hearing. This advice was passed to Mr de Robillard's counsel.

                      Two draft Optional Protocols to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) are currently being negotiated by Working Groups of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights (CHR).

                      The first Protocol will cover the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. At its 1994 session, CHR established a Working Group to develop this draft Optional Protocol. The Protocol aims to give greater definition to the obligations contained in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention, which require States parties to protect children from sexual exploitation (including prostitution and pornography), sale, trafficking and abduction. The Protocol would also aim to strengthen international mechanisms for cooperation in dealing with these issues.

                      Australia has been a strong supporter of this Protocol, and has actively participated at the drafting sessions of the Working Group. A third session of the Working Group was held in Geneva in February 1997. Although the negotiations were given significant political impetus following the August 1996 Stockholm World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, disagreement persists about the scope of the Protocol, with a small number of countries wishing to broaden the scope to include the sale of children for other purposes, such as for organ use or for illegal adoption.

                      The second protocol focuses on Children in Armed Conflict. A Working Group to develop this draft Optional Protocol was also established at the 1994 session of CHR. The Protocol aims to raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces, and for participation in hostilities, from the age of 15 in Article 38(2) of the Convention.

                      Australia strongly supports this draft Optional Protocol, and has been an active participant at the drafting sessions of the Working Group. A third session of the Working Group was held in Geneva in January 1997, where discussions focused in particular on two unresolved issues: the age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces, and recruitment by non&amp;hyphen;governmental armed forces.

                      Further sessions of both Working Groups will take place in 1998. Once the texts of the two protocols have been finalised and are adopted, they will be open to signature and ratification by States Parties to the Convention.
