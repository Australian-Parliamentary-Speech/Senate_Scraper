         Australian National's operations, in common with many other government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector, which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector. In particular, government rail authorities have in many cases over the years largely operated as monopolies, have often been subject to political interference and have not been placed on a fully commercial footing. Under these circumstances, pricing, operating and investment practices tend to be unresponsive and inflexible. If real reform is to be achieved in the rail sector, it is vitally important that the inherent deficiencies associated with government ownership be replaced by a dynamic market driven approach.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problems confronting AN, however, have been substantially magnified by the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. In particular, AN has been left with very large debts while the large bulk of its profitable operations have been transferred to NR. Furthermore, AN has been required to provide
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          NR with significant services at well below cost.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government became aware of the extent of AN's problems shortly after taking office. I commissioned the independent Brew review, which revealed a situation requiring urgent remedy. Increasing debt, a loss of business and escalating taxpayer subsidies were aspects of AN which the former government both ignored and failed to address. I want to make it clear that the financial mess at AN was not the result of AN staff or management, but the result of decisions made by the former government which left AN in an impossible position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result, I announced on 24 November last year a $2 billion reform package to rejuvenate the rail sector. The reforms will impact through the separation of the management of the interstate rail track network from above track operations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The major benefit of structural separation lies in replacing the incentives for anticompetitive and uncommercial behaviour with an incentive to maximise the number of operators on the network. The Commonwealth's role will concentrate on controlling and managing economically efficient and non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory access to the interstate rail network. This will allow the interstate rail network to operate largely as the roads do now: government owned, but open, upon payment of an access fee, to anyone licensed to operate a vehicle over the network. Such a change can only be of benefit to the users of rail transport and indeed to the economy as a whole.

         This bill is the first legislative step in achieving this important component of micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform. The injection of private sector expertise into rail operations will reduce costs, improve service responsiveness and increase rail market share.

          AN's rail operations have been restricted in their operation by corporate overheads and the burden of debt. Recognising that this arrangement is not sustainable, the government has decided to offer AN for sale free of debts and liabilities.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is proposed that companies be established under the Corporation Law to be the vehicles through which the sales occur. The assets of AN necessary for the operation of each component of the AN business will be transferred into a company by ministerial direction listing the assets, or classes of assets. The shares in the company will be sold to a new rail operator. The liabilities of AN would be retained and paid out by AN or transferred to the Commonwealth.

          Thus, the bill proposes flexible arrangements for the transfer of assets, liabilities and contracts between AN, the Commonwealth and a new rail operator. To provide maximum flexibility to a purchaser, it is not proposed that any staff transfer to private sector purchasers. Instead, it is proposed that staff be made redundant on sale or closure of the part of AN in which they work. There will be no requirements or arrangements in the sales process for the transfer or re-employment of employees and general industrial relations legislation will determine award provisions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The states have interests in a large proportion of AN owned land under the 1975 agreements, which transferred railway assets to the Commonwealth. It is proposed that the land revert to the states for them to lease to a new rail operator. It is important that the sale arrangement create an incentive for an injection of funds to improve and maintain the rail infrastructure. Ownership of infrastructure is considered a key part of providing this incentive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To achieve an infrastructure ownership arrangement under land lease, the bill proposes that railway land fixtures such as track, signalling equipment, culverts, buildings, et cetera be severed from the land by the sales legislation for sale to the new operator with above track assets.

          Agreements with the States
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Commonwealth has legislated a range of agreements with the states over the years. Some of these need to be amended or repealed to allow the sale to proceed. The government is negotiating with South Australia and Tasmania on these issues and is confident of reaching agreement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The shares in each new company established to operate a business previously within AN will become part of a sales agreement between the Commonwealth and a private sector purchaser.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is envisaged that these sales agreements will be a key mechanism by which Commonwealth commitments under the agreements with the states will be honoured.

            The future of rail in Australia lies with using our current system much more efficiently and effectively, through encouraging the participation of the private sector, introducing competition and providing a greater customer focus. It is possible for the rail industry to operate profitably, and this will require substantial programs of cost reduction and capital investment by the private sector, accompanied by improvements in service quality. It is these initiatives that will give us a viable long&amp;hyphen;term rail industry in Australia.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The legislation underpins the government's rail reform package and is essential to its implementation. The reform package has a number of elements but, in particular, seeks to revitalise rail transport by separating the provision of access to essential infrastructure—the interstate track—from the provision of rail transport services, which is more appropriately the role of the private sector. Passage of the legislation is crucial to the attainment of the government's timetable for the sale as it will enable the government to sell AN assets and services, clearly signalling the government's commitment to reform. It will also directly increase participation of the private sector in the rail industry.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            AN is losing money and is in an unsustainable and declining financial position which is unlikely to be improved in the current environment of uncertainty. The extensive restructure required to generate an efficient and profitable rail system is best able to be achieved through government divestment and the injection of private sector transport expertise. This is also the best long&amp;hyphen;term guarantee of employment in the rail industry.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            Prompt passage of the bill will mean that elements of AN can rapidly be divested and will thereby reduce uncertainty for AN, its staff, other participants in the rail industry and the community. Delays in sale will unnecessarily increase taxpayer liabilities and adversely effect the government's budget strategy. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum of the bill.

         The bill has two primary purposes. The first is to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences. The bill's second principal object is to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies and subsequent dealing with intercepted information are regulated by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. That act provides a detailed scheme of control, designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of communications passing over the Australian telecommunications system. A general rule of our society is that a communication of this kind is private to the participants. Intrusion into a communication, even by the government's law enforcement agencies, is subject to strict control. Interceptions can only be carried out by declared Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies and only under the authority of a warrant.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present, interception warrants may be issued by an eligible judge of a court created by this parliament. An eligible judge is one who has been nominated by the responsible minister, after having consented to perform the function. The statutory requirement for individual consent underlines that issuing a warrant is an administrative power conferred on a judge as a designated person. The bill proposes to provide for categories of persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved. The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The amendments will confer the authority to issue interception warrants on certain members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal who are nominated for this purpose by the responsible minister. The potential pool of nominees would be the deputy presidents and full-time senior members, as well as those part-time senior members and members—all of whom are part-time—who have legal qualifications. This new arrangement takes into account the special character of the authority to issue an interception warrant. The purpose of the issuing process is to provide an opportunity, before the event, for the conflicting interests of the state and an individual to be assessed, so that the individual's right to privacy will be affected only where the appropriate statutory standard has been met and the needs of law enforcement are demonstrably superior.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For such a process to be meaningful, the person making the assessment must be capable of doing so in a neutral and impartial manner. The government believes that the specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have both the independence and experience necessary for this role. However, an individual will only be given the authority to issue warrants after he or she is nominated by the minister. There will be an opportunity, before an eligible person is nominated, for consultation with the president
          <break page="3481" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           of the tribunal concerning their experience and background.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government believes that the new arrangement set out in the bill will maintain the integrity of the warrant issuing arrangements. I should also point out that the amendments do not in any way alter the provisions which permit judges to issue warrants should their views change at some time in the future. The bill introduces similar new arrangements for issuing listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Customs Act 1901. These warrants are also issued at present by federal judges.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I now turn to the provisions in the bill that are directed against the serious problem of police corruption. Most significantly, the bill contains a number of provisions relating to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission. The commission has recently been established as a permanent authority to continue the work of the Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. Members will be aware that the Wood Royal Commission uncovered disturbing instances of corruption and other serious police misconduct. The Commonwealth supports the government of New South Wales in its efforts to excise the cancer of corruption from within its police service and is ready to assist in providing the new commission with appropriate and effective powers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Experience has shown that covert surveillance is one of the most powerful investigative tools for uncovering and prosecuting police misconduct. The bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to permit the Commission to receive and use intercepted information originally obtained by other law enforcement agencies, where the information relates to a matter the commission may investigate. The amendments also open the way for a declaration to be made which will permit the commission to apply for warrants on its own behalf, once the Attorney-General, as the responsible minister, is satisfied that the statutory preconditions of a declaration have been fulfilled. These amendments do not involve any effective widening of interception powers. The respon
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           sibilities of the Police Integrity Commission for investigating police misconduct have generally been transferred to it from the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the New South Wales Police Service. Both these latter agencies are already able to apply for interception warrants for this purpose.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill further supports the Police Integrity Commission in other ways. Amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 will give the commission, as well as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, access to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre's database of reportable transactions. In addition, amendments to the Customs Act will permit the Australian Police and the National Crime Authority to communicate information those agencies obtain by means of a listening device directly to the commission, where the information relates to the commission's functions. Without this amendment, the Commonwealth agencies would only be able to pass listening device information about police corruption to the commission via the New South Wales Police Service.
         </para>

          Several of the amendments deal with more general aspects of police misconduct. The bill will permit the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to use intercepted information in deciding whether to appoint, re-appoint or dismiss a member or staff member of the AFP. This amendment is a response to a decision in the Federal Court to the effect that the Commissioner was not permitted to rely on intercepted information relating to corruption by an AFP officer in a decision not to re-appoint that officer. The government considers that position to be inconsistent with the Commissioner's responsibilities to keep the AFP free of corruption and the power given to the Commissioner over appointments within the AFP. The bill also contains an equivalent provision in relation to other police services.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I now turn to other amendments. The bill will permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in three categories of proceedings that relate to the commission of prescribed offences. One category provides
          <break page="3482" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           for an application for bail that relates to a prosecution for a prescribed offence. This amendment is a response to a decision by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Serratore which held that a bail application is not part of a related prosecution.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill will also permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in applications for restraining orders made under Commonwealth and state proceeds of crime legislation. The effectiveness of this legislation, particularly in relation to drug offences, depends on the ability of prosecuting authorities to obtain orders preventing assets from being dealt with pending the outcome of related criminal proceedings. This amendment is to clarify the legislative position following the Serratore decision.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The third category of proceedings is a coroner's inquest, if the coroner considers the subject of the inquiry—for example, a suspicious death—may have been caused by the commission of a prescribed offence. The purpose is to avoid a situation where a coroner is prevented from receiving evidence that may be vital to the coroner's determination.

          Finally, the bill contains a number of other amendments related to the use of intercepted information and record keeping obligations. The amendments have no significant financial impact.

           introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because the bill has features which characterise our current incumbent, Mr Howard, as Prime Minister. It is a bill that shows absolutely no leadership. It is a bill that shows absolutely no vision. It is a bill that is consistent with the increasing tendency of the Prime Minister to sully everything he touches. Here he is trying to rort the ballot for this constitutional convention.

         My colleague the member for Banks went into great detail about the flaws in the electoral arrangements in this legislation, and I will seek to do so in the time available. But what I really want to comment on first is why are we finding these incredibly convoluted arrangements which have, for the first time, the people of Australia confronting a bizarre, unorthodox set of voting arrangements.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Essentially it is because the government is trying to hide its real intention from the people and trying to hide from the real intentions of the people. It does not want to face up to the fact that the opinion of the Australian people has changed and that the majority of Australians want a change in our constitutional arrangements. The Prime Minister knows that he cannot present a unified position on the fundamental question of the nature of our constitutional arrangements on behalf of the coalition parties. So he has to hide, obfuscate and confuse and seek to debase the fundamental debate about the nature of our constitutional arrangements when in fact the issues can be stated very simply.

         In the United States you have to be a citizen of that country, you have to have been born in that country, to be eligible to be head of state. In Australia you are debarred from being the head of state if you were born in Australia. That is the stark position that Australians no longer accept. We do not actually need a constitutional convention to deal with the consequences of that conclusion that Australians have come to in clear majority. We should just give them a vote, a proper, decent, Australian ballot. Our great democratic contribution to the world is the Australian ballot. Let us use it to say to the Australian people in a plebiscite: confirm what the opinion polls say, that you believe an Austral

         It would not be so bad if the implications for some of our longstanding and proud democratic traditions were not quite so serious. There is nowhere to hide from the determination of the Australian people to achieve a republican constitution—and they will achieve it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As someone who has spent a long time associated with our electoral system and with our democratic processes, I am particularly worried about some of the implications of the changes that are in the legislation. Let me start first with the issue of voluntary voting. The idea has been put around by influential people in the Liberal Party for some time, particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin. To his credit, Senator Minchin has at least been open about it. He has advocated his position in public. I do not agree with his position but I respect the fact that he has come out openly and has said, `This is what I believe and this is why.' That has facilitated a decent debate. I know it has facilitated a decent debate within the coalition parties and between the parties in the parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I strongly disagree with Senator Minchin's position, but he has been up&amp;hyphen;front about it, unlike the Prime Minister, who has introduced a bill for voluntary voting but has never once actually said he agrees with it. He has never once said, `I think voluntary voting is a good idea,' but he has come in here and introduced a bill to start us down this slippery slope.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I worry that it is the first step on the path to taking the concerns of the disadvantaged off the agenda, to removing from the democratic agenda of Australia the concerns of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          those Australians least likely to vote. Everybody knows—the evidence is overwhelming—that, when you take away compulsory voting, those least inclined to vote are those who need the assistance of government most. Those to whom the attention of government should most be directed, the most disadvantaged, are those least likely to vote and, therefore, from whom the political focus will shift towards those most advantaged in our society who are most likely to vote because they have interests they wish to protect. To be debasing that great Australian tradition of the compulsory secret ballot on this occasion is something of profound implications.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We then move to the idea of having a voluntary postal ballot. If we put those two things together, what are we saying? We are saying that the vote about whether Australia should be a republic is less important than the vote about what our national song should be. In 1977, we had a ballot in Australia about our national song. I voted in that ballot. I have to say I did not regard it as one of the great exercises of my democratic prerogative.

         More than eight million Australians turned up to the polling booths around the country and voted in 1977 about what the national song should be, but I do not think any of them would have thought that it was a vote of profundity equal to what should be the fundamental nature of our constitutional arrangements in this country. Yet then that conservative government was prepared, quite correctly, to use the normal voting arrangements for Australians and we all trooped down to the ballot box and voted.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This government gives less weight to the ballot for this convention than to that ballot. If they do not take the convention seriously, there is a simple solution: do not have it. The
         <break page="3484" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          better solution is we do not have the convention at all. But, if we are going to have it, take it seriously, elect it democratically, do not set out as a matter of conscious public policy to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Australians. Everybody knows that this will disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Australians. There is a debate about how many, but not a debate about the fact that there must be hundreds of thousands.

         At any one time, there are 200,000 Australians overseas. None of them will get an effective chance to vote in this ballot. The biggest polling booth in any Australian election is in London. More people vote in London than in any polling booth in Australia, and the second biggest is in Hong Kong. The ballot paper will not be posted to them overseas; it will be posted to their home address, their registered electoral address. The prospect that they will get it forwarded to where they might be away on holidays, get it in time, get it back and have their vote recorded is very remote. So there are a few hundred thousand Australians.

         But what about our electoral laws that cover ordinary elections and that applied in the ballot for the national song so that for those many thousands of Australians who need assistance to vote have a right to come along to the polling booth and receive assistance from the Electoral Commission—the visually impaired, others who need assistance? There is no Electoral Commission assistance for them here.

         It is true they can probably invite a neighbour in, probably get their son or daughter. What happened to the secret ballot? `I'm not sure what this means. I'd better get Tom down the street to come and vote for me.' Not only now have we lost our compulsory vote, not only have we lost the capacity to turn up down at the local polling booth and have a secret ballot, the Australian ballot, but now we have even lost the secret ballot for all those who normally need some assistance because of the nature of their English language skills, their visual impairment or other infirmity.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a conscious, deliberate attempt to disenfranchise those people not because I

          think they are worried that all those people are republicans, although I suspect the majority of them are too, but because they really do not want people to take the outcome of this too seriously. They do not want a majority vote in the republican direction to have too much weight. If everybody voted in the normal way and the majority of them voted for a republic, it would have awesome weight and we do not wish to have that democratic imperative inserted into this debate.

         But the outcome of this ballot does matter. If you are worried about the cost and think this is too expensive a way to do it, I come back to my previous solution. There is an easy way to save the money. Do not have the ballot; do not have the convention; go straight to a plebiscite—that is, if you think democracy is not worth the money. But if you are going to have this convention, if you are going to have this ballot, do it properly.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We know that the anti-republican people consider the numbers important. We had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) saying, with the capacity of the government to make a lot of appointments, with the way the government's proposals rort the appointment proposal for members of parliament so it is overwhelmingly in favour of the conservative parties for the first time ever in a convention like this, that it is not even, it is gerrymandered, it is stacked in favour of the conservative parties. The bad news is that a few of those people are republicans, too.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nevertheless, this is the first time anybody ever tried to stack a constitutional convention. But even after that the parliamentary secretary says that the vote might only be about 88-64 in favour of a republic and hardly an overwhelming mandate for change. These conservatives are very strange people. They say that, on those figures, 57 per cent is not much of a vote for change. The corollary is that 43 per cent is a great vote for the status quo. That is the thinking that has dominated the manipulation of electoral laws by conservatives for centuries.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I come from Western Australia. They have rigged the electoral laws in that state since we
         <break page="3485" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          have had voting. For 106 years, the conservatives controlled the upper house of that state. They have lost election after election in the lower house, even though those ballots have been rigged too—but in 106 years they had never lost an upper house election, until last year, and they were shocked. They said, `For 106 years we have controlled the upper house. It belongs to us. The people made a mistake.' So what do they do? For the first time in 106 years they take advantage of the fixed term nature of the upper house to rip through the most unfair industrial relations laws in this country ever so they can get them through before 22 May, before the vote of the people would prevent it being passed. One hundred and six years of domination is not enough. They have to rort the  constitutional arrangements against the workers one last time.

         So a 43 per cent vote for the status quo is pretty good. A 57 per cent vote for change would not be much of a mandate. This is fundamental testimony to the unfairness of the arrangements we are confronting. Why have such peculiar arrangements? Why, once we go through all these machinations, can't we at least have ordinary Senate voting arrangements, not this complex set of arrangements? Everything is being done to make it harder, not easier, for people to express their views.

         The principle is not complicated. If you are going to have an election, the outcome of the election should reflect the intention of those eligible to vote. It should be a collective expression of the intent of those 10 million Australians eligible to vote. That is what it should be, and it will not be. It has been deliberately designed to make sure that that does not happen. The most basic democratic principle is that the outcome of the election should represent the intention of the voter. They are trying to make it hard for them to vote, make it hard for them to get there to express their vote and easy for it to be rorted and they have stacked the convention and then changed the voting rules so it is complicated. The principle is not the one I articulated—that the outcome of a ballot should be the collective intention of the Australian voters. The principle is: how can we hide from the people's will; how can we avoid the

         We heard from the member for Prospect and from the member for Canberra again that we have never had an Australian as a head of state, albeit that the Governor-General is the head of state on behalf of the Queen. But in the 1930s we had Sir Isaac Isaacs, who was an Australian. There was a bit of a quiet lull until the early 1960s. Then we had Viscount De L'Isle from 1961 to 1965. I believe he was Australian born.

         From 1965 on we have governors-general of Australia who have all been Australian born. Did we need to have that written into law or written in the constitution to ensure that? No, we had coalition governments and we had Labor governments during that period of time from 1965. We had several from both sides, but both governments upheld the convention that they believed was right and from that day we have had an Australian born head of state. So I think it is a bit hypocritical for the Labor Party to infer for some reason that we do not have an Australian born head of state in this country.

         I was dismayed at the manner in which the Keating government launched its campaign for an Australian republic led by an Australian president. The previous government beat the republican horse around the track in this country until it looked as though the RSPCA would have to be called in. There was evidence to suggest the issue was whipped up by the previous government purely for political expediency. I am still far from convinced it was an issue high on the public's list of political priorities. This was totally borne out when the then Prime Minister dropped the issue. Suddenly it was no longer a major media story, and the voices which had been

But this government has not whipped this matter up into an urgent priority; rather, it is to be considered at a respectable pace. We are creating a constitutional convention to address the question of whether or not Australia should be a republic. In a calm and rational manner we are attempting to do that. It is important everyone in Australia has their say. But first it has to be decided whether or not our present constitution should be changed.

When I spent some time overseas, I put in place arrangements for my mail to be adequately dealt with.

           1948 the Australian parliament debated and legislated for the Nationality and Citizenship Bill. I am proud that it was a Labor government, the great Chifley Labor government, which initiated and carried that legislation. But I think that, with the passage of time, we can all be proud of the decision taken to legislate to create that category of Australian citizenship, which up until that time did not exist. Until that time, we were all regarded as British citizens. At that time, there were people who argued that we should not create Australian citizenship—that that would impair our allegiance to the British motherland. That view should not be dismissed as ignorant or frivolous but ought to be seen as a product of its time.

         At that time, Australia had made unprecedented sacrifices during the Second World War. We had taken the historic decision to welcome a great many new migrants to build up this country after the Second World War. We realised then, and we have realised with increasing force ever since, that Australia had a new and more independent role to play in the world. So we created Australian citizenship. Does anyone seriously now think that that was the wrong step to take?

         But we are once again at one of these turning points and we have a similar situation now: Australians have recognised and are recognising with increasing force that it is quite inappropriate that we do not have an Australian head of state, that we do not have our own head of state. I think it was brought home to many of us in this place last year when we had the visit from President Clinton and the toast at the lunch where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) toasted President Clinton and President Clinton, by way of response, toasted the Queen. I cringed at that time and I think many other people in the room cringed at that time. If I recall correctly, one of the Liberal members of parliament indicated that that event on its own was enough to convince them that it was time for Australia to take that next step towards becoming a republic.

We have had pointed out the fact that this seems entirely inconsistent with our own constitution—section 116—which says that no religious test should be applied for public office holders. We have also had in the debate the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) make a splendid Freudian slip where he said, `Why not the Queen of England—the Queen of Australia, I should say?' What a Freudian slip that was because, when all is said and done, she is the Queen of England.

         We had ample demonstration of that in the last year or two with the controversy over French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I think most of us would see the role of a head of state as being an essentially non-political role and would not want to see our head of state involved in anything which looked like partisan political controversy. But occasionally there are issues which are such matters of national importance that we regard it as important that our head of state has something to say.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific was one of those issues which people in Australia felt so strongly about that it would not have been out of order for the head of state to have been making observations about that issue. Yet the Queen of England—being advised, as she was, by a British government which was reluctant to say anything which might offend France—was certainly not going to say anything on that issue. I am pleased to say that, with a Blair Labour government, if we have a similar circumstance arise again we might well have a government in Britain which is prepared to take more note of Australian concerns and priorities. But this sort of example also brings home to us the inappropriateness of having a monarch of a foreign country as head of our own nation.

          Queen of England. But it also has to be said that the royal family in recent times has found itself in difficult circumstances. I also have some sympathy for the fact that in large measure they have been done over by the Murdoch press, and I think any of us can feel some sympathy for people who find themselves in those circumstances. But however strong the case may be for having Australia retain its present constitutional arrangements while the Queen remains the monarch, it seems to me that the personal lives of the members of her family are in some disarray and that the baton should not pass to the next generation.

In the same speech, that member said compulsory voting ought to be abandoned. Compulsory voting, which has served this nation so well and has helped make us one of the finest democracies in the world, is something that he is prepared to abandon, notwithstanding the `if it ain't broke, don't fix it' test.

What about Working Nation, which was bringing down unemployment in this country to five per cent by the year 2000?

         It is a matter of common knowledge that the Prime Minister is a monarchist. But he was frightened, prior to the last election, of losing that election due to growing republican momentum and sympathies within this country, and he was afraid of internal strife within his own party. Indeed, what a fractious lot they are! They are back at it again with Wik and so on. He was afraid of the voters, so what he proposed was this convention, which turns out—as this bill makes clear—to be a very dodgy exercise indeed.

         What Labor says is: let us have a vote. Let us put this issue to the people. Let's have an indicative plebiscite and, if people indicate that they want a republic, that they want an Australian head of state, let us move to draft the constitutional changes which would be necessary to put that into effect. But, instead, they are giving us this Dodgy Brothers exercise which will not have any real legitimacy or credibility, and indeed they do not want it to. They do not want to see this constitutional change.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first problem with this exercise is that it is limited to a solitary issue: the issue of the head of state. We have always seen some merit in this, but then why do we need this convention? If that is the sole issue to be determined, why shouldn't it be determined by the nation right now through a direct election? Secondly, half the convention is to be appointed in a blatant stacking exercise. If this government is genuinely democratic, genuinely wants a people's convention to sort the issues out, then why not elect the whole lot of them—the 100 per cent? It is a blatant stacking exercise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third problem that we have with it is voluntary voting. As the member for Canberra and other speakers pointed out, voluntary voting carries within it a great many flaws which will deprive a great many Australians of the opportunity to vote and, in doing so,

         Fourthly, we have a postal vote. There are opportunities for fraud and there are security issues which have not been adequately addressed. We have contained within that the loss of the secret ballot. The secret ballot is a peculiarly Australian contribution to the world and it is part of our great democratic heritage. If we abandon things like the secret ballot, then we are not on the way to becoming a republic but on the way to becoming a banana republic. I have to say that any trade union which had its elections conducted the same way that is proposed here would have the result knocked out in a flash. It would simply not be accepted.

         The position that the government puts before us is a voluntary postal ballot. The Australian Electoral Commission has admitted that up to two million Australians may not receive their postal ballot simply because they have changed their address since the time of the last election. The material on the ballot will be available only in writing and in English. That will tend to disenfranchise Australians who are blind, older people, frail people, people who are illiterate or people who lack English language skills. Presently, many of those people receive a great deal of assistance when they attend at polling booths.

         We have a situation through the postal ballot where they will not have that assistance available to them. The postal ballot also will not be distributed to Australians who happen to be overseas at the time of the ballot. As I understand it, the Australian Electoral Commission is not going to conduct a habitation review to get its rolls in order prior to this election being carried out, so we will have a lot of people missing out on a vote. It has been estimated that up to a million people will miss out on a vote due to this process alone. I note that Chris Puplick has observed that the whole thing could be in breach of New South Wales anti-discrimination legislation.

         Furthermore, we have an extraordinarily complex voting system being adopted. The ballot paper will have above and below the line voting, as the Senate system does. But, in a number of respects, it will be different from that which is used at the Senate elections. For example, group candidates will be represented on the ballot paper by only the name of the first candidate in the group and a short name requested by the group. The names of the remainder of the candidates within that group will not appear on the ballot paper. Instead, voters will have to refer to an accompanying booklet and will have to write the names of the candidates on the ballot paper in order to vote below the line.

         It was suggested that this process was okay, because it was something that many thousands of Australian punters do every week when they bet with the TAB, the way they transcribe numbers onto betting slips. As the member for Banks indicated, a lot of Australians take their betting very seriously, including one or two of my staff members and my campaign director. But the suggestion that an election for a convention to discuss such weighty constitutional issues should be likened to a bet on the Dapto dogs is quite insulting. It is not the system we should be using. We should be using the Senate style voting system. There is no legitimate reason why we should not have the Senate style voting system.

Our history of parliamentary democracy is exceeded only by Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland.

         We are about to have a convention to let the Australian people decide if we really should consider whether we need to change this system of parliamentary democracy which has, indeed, served Australia so very ably and so well. I have grave questions about the need for change and I have great questions about the mechanisms for change, if indeed we do decide to go down that path. I accept that there is, in the Australian community, a feeling that we are somehow not our own masters because our constitution is still, in effect, an act of British law and our head of state, while being Queen of Australia, is also Queen of Great Britain. I accept that many Australians genuinely believe that we need to set up our own head of state based on some formula, some system, incorporated into our particular form of democratic institution.

         Let us talk briefly about that institution. We took from Great Britain, if you will, the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy so that the head of government is selected in the house of the people—the House of Representatives—by those individuals who can form a majority. In practice, it has meant that political parties form to provide an organisational base in order to make this system work. Individuals in those political parties may have varying and vast differences in philosophical view, in practical view, in how they would go about government, in how they would go about change in society and in how they would go about administering this democratic system in our country. But the
         <break page="3493" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         In effect, the Prime Minister and his senior cabinet advisers then advise the Queen of an Australian individual of great stature and great standing in the community to assume the post of head of state and the Queen simply confirms the Prime Minister's advice. Along with that goes the convention that the Governor&amp;hyphen;General has wide powers, but powers which are not specified, not codified in print. Some of the proposals to create a new head of state called `President', or perhaps still called `Governor&amp;hyphen;General', would have us codify those responsibilities and those rights of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General. I have great concerns about trying to codify rights because I have seen what happened in the country where I was born in terms of the Bill of Rights.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Codifying those rights has meant that their Supreme Court has, from time to time, come down with such disparate decisions on the same issue some years apart as to give little meaning to the codification itself. I put to honourable members that the words used when you legitimately try to codify those rights leaves open for great interpretation later individuals, later groups and later courts to decide that the structure itself has some other meaning than what it had when it was written down in the first place.

Then, just to make things confusing, we took from Switzerland a referendum system which allows us the mechanism to change the constitution, but based on only allowing it to be so changed if the people agree. A majority of the Australian

         Altogether, we have in place a series of checks and balances on executive action of government. The first of the checks is, in fact, the Senate. We all know how the Senate acts as a check. We have seen some of the Senate's obstruction both when Labor was in power and now while the coalition is in power. Many Australians think that is good; some think it is not so good. Some think it would be better if government could set an agenda, get on with that agenda and report back to the people at the next election—three years after the first one.

I am concerned that, if we were to go to change our constitution, to remove from the constitution the Queen of Australia as titular head of state—not as practical head of state but as titular head of state—we may in fact create some unknown, unforeseen instability that could act to the detriment of the checks and balances or act to the detriment of our democracy.

There are several aspects of that that concern me. The first is that some eminently qualified Australians undoubtedly would not wish to put themselves and their families through the trauma that sometimes attends hard fought election campaigns. It is a legitimate concern. The office of head of state in Australia is a very high office and we look to it not to run the government but for stability, for leadership and for a vision that Australia is represented by an eminent person who represents all of us in the community and indeed on the world stage.

          The convention idea was born a number of years ago and it was in fact in direct response to Paul Keating's absolute dominance of the debate about the republican issue and his insistence that we had to move down that path: we needed to get rid of the Queen, we needed to get rid of the flag and we had to have a new Australia based on Paul Keating's model and Paul Keating's vision.

          I notice that the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) in his contribution said that voluntary voting would deprive very many Australians of their voting rights. I am sorry, but I fail to understand how that could be true, that voluntary voting is undemocratic and that voluntary voting deprives one of rights. I thought that we were a country that believed in free speech, in freedom of the press, in freedom of religion, in freedom of assembly and in freedom of association. In all these basic freedoms we are essentially free, within the bounds of restrictions imposed by society through laws, to pretty well do what we like, go where we like, say what we like and meet with whom we like. Yet we are told by the member for Wills that it is undemocratic that this voting mechanism for the convention be voluntary, that is, if you want to vote for the elected members of the convention you have the opportunity to do so but it is not required that you do so; if you have no interest in the issue and no interest in who will be participating in the convention then you are not forced to participate. I fail to see how that is undemocratic or how it deprives one single Australian of any voting rights.

          Much of the debate surrounding the idea of a change of head of state is based on a perception that we will feel better if we finally sever our ties with Great Britain, our founding fathers and mothers. I have to say I have been unconvinced by that symbolism—excepting that, when President Clinton came to visit us here and we had a state luncheon in the Great Hall and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stood and toasted the United States of America and President Clinton stood and toasted the Queen, I must admit that I felt for the first time some disappointment in that symbolism.

There was a fear on the part of the Liberal Party that the push towards republicanism would be reflected in a negative vote for the Liberal Party. So their strategists said, `We had better neutralise that.' In their policy document regarding the constitution, they made this statement:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         No matter who wins the next election, the Australian people will vote about the Republic. Therefore, no person who wants a Republic should feel that it should in any way influence his or her vote.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         It is that neutralisation of the pro&amp;hyphen;republican vote in the last election which has given rise to the constitutional convention that we are facing at the end of the year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the Australian people will not be voting for whether or not they want a republic. They will be voting for 50 per cent of delegates at a talkfest. It is not a genuine convention that has any formal status under the constitution in making recommendations or decisions which will be binding in any way. Regrettably, the whole process is going to tarnish the image of the convention and remove any credibility it will have.

It was a picture of a citizen standing by a letterbox, posting their ballot paper for the convention delegates. The Prime Minister, dressed in his wet weather garb, with the rain teeming down, is saying to this citizen of Australia, `Okay, next you have to cross the Sydney Harbour Bridge on roller blades, wearing a G&amp;hyphen;string and with this egg balanced on the tip of your nose.' Obviously, those complications would prove a significant disincentive to all but the most exhibitionist of us, including perhaps those on the front benches of the House.

         Disincentives are well and truly in the proposals contained in this bill. The voting system, which has been described by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), is so complicated that you would need a three&amp;hyphen;year university degree on voting procedure simply to have a chance of casting a valid vote. Even after you have cast a vote, you have to complete personal details, including your name and address. The return ballot paper is going to be bar coded so that it can be computer tracked and, quite clearly, there is going to be a disincentive for people wanting to reveal that information and having that information retained about them. Moreover, the complications are going to affect illiterate citizens, citizens who do not speak English, the blind and the disabled.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The voting system itself is fundamentally flawed. I do not believe it constitutes a secret ballot, for the reasons I have mentioned, as a result of the ability to identify precisely who voted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, there have been a number of cases involving in particular trade unions but also Aboriginal land councils and other elections conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office where the fact that it was possible to identify a voter resulted in those ballots being set aside. In several cases that I am aware of, evidence was taken from witnesses indicating that the lack of secrecy was a specific disincentive for them casting a vote. I believe that inevitably there will be that sort of challenge to the ballot later this year. As a result of that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          challenge, there is, in my view, doubt that the convention will even take place. If there is a court case, it may well delay for quite some time the occurrence of the constitutional convention.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A second very serious concern is the fact that the roll of voters is significantly out of date. Any member in this House can tell you that when they do a mail&amp;hyphen;out to their electorate, which is sourced from the electoral roll, they receive hundreds, often thousands, of returned letters as a result of people changing addresses. Indeed, I understand that about two million Australians a year change address. Given that it has been 18 months since the last electoral roll was prepared, we are looking at a potential three million people not receiving ballot papers. That is, quite frankly, an outrage. Again, there are numerous cases where ballots have been set aside because the returning officer failed to take all reasonable steps to locate people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What does the returning officer do in this case when, as will inevitably occur, at least one million—possibly two million—ballot papers are returned to him? Does he then try to track down those people? The dilemma he has is that, if he does not do that, the process again risks being challenged, as I believe will occur.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, there is no plan to post voting papers to people overseas. One would think that members of our armed forces would have a very specific interest in the outcome of this ballot. Those who are serving this country overseas will be deprived of the right to vote for delegates because there is no procedure in place whereby those serving our country overseas can receive ballot papers. That is a real indictment of this government and the lack of respect that they pay to our service men and women who are serving this country so proudly.

         The reality is that those flaws are going to affect the bill. Unfortunately, it is not a secret ballot.

It is a butchering of a true democratic process and an indictment of the government.

          As I have said earlier, the bill is not a decision as to whether we will be moving towards a republic. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in his response to the second reading speech, it is a pity that it is not a bill for a direct vote by the Australian people on the question of whether or not Australia should have an Australian head of state.

          It is no secret that what we in the Labor Party have proposed—and we believe should still occur—a process whereby, first, there is an indicative plebiscite to ascertain whether the people of Australia wish to move towards a republic. Secondly, if there is a yes vote—we believe there will be—then we favour the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee. Following extensive community consultation, that committee would report to parliament on questions to be referred to the Australian public by way of a referendum. The third and final process would be the referendum, which would occur in 1999 at the latest.

          If those procedures were followed, Australia would be entering the next century with a head of steam, with momentum, with optimism and with pride. Unfortunately, we will not be doing that; we will be looking back over a flawed voting process, giving rise to an extremely confused and convoluted constitutional convention process. The fact of the matter is that the procedures are so flawed that any view that comes out of this convention will be able to be challenged and disregarded. It is going to be meaningless. As a result of the complications, it will probably be years and years before Australia, regrettably, has its own identity through having an Australian elected as head of state.

In that sense, we will not be opposing the process occurring. However, we are proposing several amendments which would make the process more legitimate. They include, first, a compulsory attendance ballot and, second, a regularisation of this complicated voting procedure to bring it into line with the method of voting for the

We propose reducing the parliamentary delegates from 20 to 16 and sacrificing four to community delegates. Those parliamentary delegates would be selected on a bipartisan basis—that is, eight government, six Labor opposition, one Democrat and one Independent.

         The first point I would like to make is I do not want to pass judgment in this parliament today on the pros and cons of whether Australia sticks to its constitutional monarchy or whether there is a change which will have to be made eventually by the will of the people through a referendum to change the head of state. I would, though, like to inform this House that, as a backbencher, I have held a number of public meetings in the electorate of Richmond—in the towns of Byron Bay and Ballina, which have very different demographics—about the constitutional convention.

          One of the reasons I am delighted to speak on this bill, and one of the reasons we are having a convention, is to try to increase the public awareness about what the potential moves will be if we are to change Australia's head of state, what type of republican model will be adopted and, of course, what the timetable will be. There is an overwhelming hunger for more information out in the electorate about these issues. When we look at previous conventions, reading from

          So, if we are to go to a referendum on this particular issue, the public has to be informed if there is to be any clear mandate for whether we maintain the status quo or whether we change. As I mentioned before, the first reason for having this constitutional convention is to help increase public awareness across Australia. Obviously, the debate now has very much shifted from the original ALP position when Paul Keating was the Prime Minister and, indeed, from when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) made his speech after that of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 4 December. It is interesting to note that there has been a major shift within the opposition on the merits of the people's convention, although now it is rediscussing the details.

           I would like to highlight former Prime Minister Keating's proposal of 14 February 1996. That proposal was to put to the people a plebiscite on the question: do you want an Australian to be Australia's head of state? Indeed, this was further confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition on 4 December 1996 when he proposed a three&amp;hyphen;step process to advance the republican debate. That process would involve, first, an indicative plebiscite to ascertain whether the people wished to move to a republic. If there was a yes vote, it would then go to a joint parliamentary committee and then, of course, it would go to a referendum.

           This people's constitutional convention will give a certain amount of ownership to the rest of the Australian community. I think it would be very unwise if we were to go straight to a plebiscite because the level of knowledge is so scant on this subject. We are dealing with an immensely important area. Whilst it might not put another meal on our table, fundamental changes to our constitution, particularly in relation to our head of state and the reserve powers that that person would have, are critical to the democracy of this country. There is certainly no suggestion—and I would not like to see it at all—that the Westminster system should be changed. It has proved to be a very viable and a very safe system not just in this country but in many other countries.

           The ALP's original plan was to have less people participation. If you go directly to a plebiscite, I would suggest you would get a less informed decision. Indeed, when the details of the people's convention were first put forward by the Prime Minister, it was interesting to note an editorial in the
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

           . . . if we agreed with the ALP's proposition that a plebiscite be held as soon as possible, then we would be supporting a limitation of the debate. For paradoxically (considering Opposition Leader Kim Beazley's view that the Constitution is owned by the people, not the politicians) the ALP would then have the debate channelled through a joint parliamentary committee which would report to Parliament on the particular form of questions which
           <break page="3500" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            should be ultimately put to the people. We believe a broader forum is required to attract and refine the public view. Those who fear minority&amp;hyphen;driven change should recognise the power of the Constitution which means that any proposed change needs majority support of States.

           It goes on to say there that the holding of the constitutional convention has merit because it will encourage this debate. Certainly, that was the input that I received from the public meetings that I had in the electorate of Richmond. There is certainly a lack of knowledge not just about this process but about our constitution. Perhaps this whole process that we are going through—firstly, the election of 76 of the 152 which will be from the public—will start to generate interest. That will then flow through to the 10-day convention which will be held in December.

           A myth that has been brought about by a number of members of the opposition is that somehow a non-compulsory secret ballot paper will have less impact on the community and that somehow it will be a disenfranchisement for democracy. Another interesting point that was raised in the

           One of the benefits of having a postal vote is that it does allow people to sit down and diagnose the information at their own leisure rather than going directly to a public ballot-box. As the opposition is articulating, if it were compulsory, I would suggest that there would be less scrutiny of the issues. Unfortunately, on many occasions, particularly in general elections, there is a high cynicism displayed by swinging voters. So, by having a ballot process, by receiving information a number of weeks beforehand, people will be able to make an informed decision and an informed choice of who they wish to elect to the constitutional convention.

            One of the other interesting points that was raised was that having a secret ballot would somehow lead to manipulation or the government choosing to stack the convention. As most commentators and readers would be aware, there is a wide disparity of views, certainly within the Liberal Party, between pro-monarchists and those proposing the republican system. Indeed, there is even some division within the National Party. Thus, one of the arguments that some of our opponents are using is that if we do have a secret ballot it can be manipulated. It is interesting to note that people like Malcolm Turnbull in an article written by Michael Gordon in the

            The Prime Minister has fulfilled his commitment by going to a people's constitutional convention.

            I think it is important to actually look at the convention. I have talked about the 76 of the 152 delegates who are to be elected. This will be broken down on a state by state basis: 20 from New South Wales, 16 from Victoria, 13 from Queensland, nine from Western Australia, eight from South Australia, six from Tasmania and two from the territories. This replicates the representation in the House of Representatives. I think that is a prudent representation, and that will then go on to a Senate style ticket.

           <para first-indent="16">
            The other 76 who will be appointed in the next couple of months, assuming legislation passes through the Senate, will be made up of 40 parliamentary delegates, 20 of these delegates coming from the state and territory parliaments, and the Premier, the Leader of
            <break page="3501" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
             the Opposition and a third parliamentary nominee of the Premier will be invited from each state. It is also interesting to note that there is a wide diversity of views amongst the Premiers and amongst the conservative states as to whether Australia should move to change our head of state or whether we should maintain the status quo.

           </para>

            The other 20 will be Commonwealth parliamentary representatives, and, not unreasonably, they will take the shape of the parliament we are in today: 12 from the government, six from the opposition, one from the Democrats and one Independent. These numbers broadly reflect the representation of parties in the parliament. To suggest that somehow we are manipulating the system, these people represent their constituents; they were publicly elected anyway. So there is a pressure valve in the whole election process of those 152 delegates—half appointed by the government, or 40 parliamentary elected delegates, and the other 76 from the public at large.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            There will be 36 non-parliamentary delegates so that those people who do not have an opportunity—whether it be because of their finances, their disadvantaged position or their age, and that will include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—will be able to be appointed to this constitutional forum. There will be a commitment to local government, which was not recognised in our constitution by our forefathers, and at least 10 per cent of government appointees to the convention will be young people between the ages of 18 and 25.

You will have a say there; you will be informed. Then it will go to the convention in December where there will be an enormous amount of discussion, which will probably come in the silly season where news items are of less currency.

To my understanding, when there is a general election, if you go into a ballot booth you do not have these interpreter services there. Certainly they are written down, but this way you will have three weeks to consider your vote and you will be able to access this AEC procedure. There will be a national hotline right across Australia. If these new immigrants choose to be part of the process, they will be encapsulated in this

That is where people must have an informed decision on whether or not we change our head of state. This process that we are going through now is a lengthy process and a better process than what Paul Keating or even the Leader of the Opposition have articulated. It will give greater ownership to Australians and to Australian electors than what the previous government had planned.

It would then go off to a joint parliamentary committee. How much ownership and democracy would there be in that decision? In our proposal at least 76 people will be elected outside of the political process. They will not be members of federal parliament or state parliament. Yes, they will encapsulate people from local government. Also, if you have a strong desire, whether you are in the ARM movement or Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, you can be a part of that process. Those people should be part of the process because they have been very articulate and very passionate about it. The ALP's original proposal was that it be hived off to a joint parliamentary committee. That is undemocratic.

          —The premise of this constitutional convention is that it is designed to enable the Australian community to express a view about the manner and mechanism that may be thought appropriate to move towards a new constitutional framework. But the truth is that it is a process made in order to avoid an outcome. There is no doubt that this is a system that has been set up to fail. You would not devise a process less able to be implemented had you gone about this process with the intellect of a gnat, with the greatest of respect to the lower orders of insects.

         This is a very silly piece of legislation if it is intended to do what the government says it is intending to do—that is, to seek the views of the community and to find a forum for their expression. It could only be designed in this way if it was intended to fail. Why would the government put forward a proposition intending it to fail? The reason it is doing so is that the leadership of the government is not committed to a republic. It is not committed to an outcome that it knows the great majority of Australians support, but it is frightened to say that. It is frightened to clarify its position with respect to the way in which Australia should shape its constitutional future.

          The best way to prevent Australians expressing their will is to set up a forum and a process which are bound to create discord and certain to produce an equivocal outcome. The only outcome that can emerge from this convention, unless it is amended in the manner suggested by the opposition, is a deeply flawed process, participation at abysmally low levels, and a sense in the community that the outcome was tarnished from the start because many of the delegates came from conservative parties in numbers which were quite unrepresentative in relation to their participation in the political process—in other words, stack the process so that whatever the popular vote a group of laggards will stand outside the republican process who can be counted on to say, `We can't possibly get a consensus.'

          I am not speaking of fantasy. Many prominent members of the coalition have already started to articulate the fact that even if 65 per cent of the popular vote is in favour of a republic, by the nature of the nomination and appointment process this government has set in place—that is, electing delegates to the convention who are not in favour of a republic—we are certain to get a convention where it could not be said there was near unanimity or anything that represents consensus. In setting up a process which will work only if there is consensus and then devising a mechanism which denies legitimacy and ensures there will be no consensus at the end of the day, a structural failure is being built in from day one.

          There are some key deficiencies in the elements of this legislation. The first of those deficiencies is that, against the pattern of Australian participatory democracy, there is to be a voluntary postal ballot. The experience in other countries of voluntary voting systems is that participation is low. In our country, when ballots of this nature have been held at the local government level and within the trade union movement, participation rates have ranged from the abysmal to the merely ordinary. This system could never rival the mandate that comes with popular elections held under our normal democratic system, where all Australians participate through a secret ballot managed by the Australian

          Next, the voting system will be inexplicable to many Australians. The voting system is not one that anyone will be used to. It is said the electoral system is one that people who fill in Tattslotto forms or punters will have some familiarity with, but it is certainly not one that citizens of this country have ever had any familiarity with in the voting system. So the ballot paper will be confusing.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The ballot paper will also be provided to electors only in English and only through the post. That is the starting point for two things: massive electoral fraud and the disenfranchisement, in practice, of many millions of Australians. Let us not focus explicitly on those whose first language is other than English. Let us talk about people who are sometimes embraced within what is wrongly called the Australian mainstream—wrongly because to talk of the Australian mainstream suggests that there are Australian citizens who are not legitimately part of the Australian community.

          If that includes the blind, how do they participate? If that includes people who have difficulty with literacy—unfortunately, still a substantial number of the adult population have difficulties with literacy—how does that affect them? Then there are the people who have changed address. The Australian Electoral Commission estimates that between two million and three million Australians change address between elections. There is no process here to ensure the electoral roll is up to date. Instead of what would be the case in a normal election, where people would know that there was to be a ballot on a particular day and go to a polling station to cast their vote, letters will be sent to people at their old electoral address. There will be no habitation update, so any Australian who has changed address is likely not to receive their ballot paper.

           How do we deal with the possibility of extremist minority elements seizing hold of this process, knowing that it is going to be a voluntary ballot and seeking to play a part in the process in a way which is quite unrepresentative with respect to their numbers? With the emergence of the Pauline Hanson factor, I do not think that this government really ought to countenance the prospect that this would be a referendum not on what should be the future form of government in this country but which would be the first test of the electoral mandate of a Pauline Hanson One Nation party; yet that is the kind of possibility that is emerging in a ballot which, by its nature, will not be an inclusive one.

           It will not, for example, be easily used by people whose languages are other than English. It will certainly not be used easily by people who are resident in nursing homes. The chances of fraud are massive. It is the case, of course, that there are opportunities for abuse whenever these postal ballot type elections are held. There have been instances in the past in the trade union movement where allegations of fraud have been made in relation to the way in which certain ballots of this nature have been conducted. I suppose a postal ballot of members is the best arrangement that you can come up with, because members are scattered around the country. You cannot have normal compulsory voting for people in those circumstances.

            But the potential for fraud is there and from time to time, it has been alleged, improprieties have occurred in those elections. Sending millions of letters out in the post—sometimes to group addresses like nursing homes, but certainly up and down the street—when the only security that is built into the system is that you have to put your date of birth on the return, is a recipe for rorting. You can well imagine people simply following the postman, picking these letters out of the boxes, getting the names, identifying the dates of birth, filling the forms in and sending them off en masse. What is to prevent it? Certainly there will be penalties if detected, but the Electoral Commission has said that there is no identifiable way of dealing with such fraud.

            So you set up a process which most Australians will be sceptical about, because it will have low participation. You expose it to the possibility of massive fraud. You create the climate for people to participate not on the basis of the ostensible objective of the convention but in order to test their political muscle. You do it in an unfamiliar way with a balloting system which has never been used before, which is likely to lead to massive informality of votes. And you do it in a circumstance where, whatever the outcome of the election process, the appointed people who come to contribute an equal share will be dominated by a political stack.

Instead of that, what we are being asked to do under this legislation is to endorse a process which is bound to produce a muddled, inconclusive and essentially illegitimate outcome—an outcome that is guaranteed to produce a flawed and deeply divisive result.

I heard comments along the lines that, if you have no interest in this, it is undemocratic to insist that people participate in the democratic voting process. I think one of the things Australians should be proud of is the fact that, as well as having rights, we as citizens have responsibilities. When you take citizenship in this country, you do not just become a person who puts their hand out and asks for things to be given.

         It must be remembered that this bill is not about whether Australia should remain a constitutional monarchy or become a republic, although I am sure that that will be made an issue in this debate. It already has been made an issue. This bill is about giving the power to the people to determine our future by choosing their representatives to debate our constitution and, in particular, our head of state.

         Prior to the election of the Howard government, we had a Prime Minister intent on imposing his will on the populace. He decided that he wanted Australia to become a republic, so he chose to pursue that goal, no matter what. The problem with that is that, when the people are not consulted, it inhibits the chances of achieving the intended goal at a referendum and only wastes the taxpayers' money. And that is the position that the previous Prime Minister risked by foisting on the people his intended agenda and not the agenda the people wanted. It was that sort of arrogance that showed how the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party had lost touch with the community.

         This bill establishes the framework for the election of delegates to the constitutional convention, which will debate our nation's constitutional future. I am delighted to support this bill—with a couple of minor reservations, which I will deal with later. There has been great debate over recent years about whether our nation should become a republic and at what time we should become one if we do. Some people have said that it is imperative that the Olympic Games in 2000 be opened by an Australian and that the new millennium is an appropriate time to become a republic. I do not think that that is the issue; indeed, I think it takes the debate away from the real issue of whether our nation remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic, and why.

I note the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement have launched their campaigns to elect delegates.

         One very attractive feature of this bill, which I welcome, is the provision of voluntary voting. I support the concept of voluntary voting and do not believe people should be compelled to vote if they do not wish to. It is anathema to the freedom of the individual and an obstruction to proper democracy that they should be forced to vote. I think that a voluntary vote for the election of convention delegates would be a good precursor for the introduction of voluntary voting in federal elections. It will show that, even with voluntary voting, Australians will take an interest in our nation's democracy.

         I note that members of the Labor Party and in particular the Australian Democrats, who would never win a place in parliament if it were not for compulsory voting, do not support voluntary voting. But, in this instance, the vote for delegates need not be compulsory because the constitutional convention will not be the final say on our constitution. It will only make recommendations. I hope those parties do not delay the debate by moving all sorts of ridiculous amendments to make the vote compulsory. Those who are interested in this issue will vote on it; those who do not care or are not interested should not be forced to vote on it. Nevertheless, the final say would be with the Australian population at a referendum for which, of course, voting would still be compulsory.

         I also welcome the concept of conducting the election via a postal ballot.

To make it cheaper would be to invite the typical mischievous candidate who puts their name forward not because of a commitment to the task ahead but as a cheap publicity stunt.

         On the matter of representation of women, I oppose any form of quotas. The fact is that there could be more females elected than males. It depends on how many nominate, of course. But if quotas are imposed it again impedes democracy. There should not be quotas for men or women. It should be up to the people to choose who the delegates are. I would hope their decision is based not on the sex of the candidate but on their qualities.

         My only concern with this convention, which I have made known to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), is the disproportionate representation of the states. I would rather the representation be similar to Senate representation, where the states have an equal footing. As it is, New South Wales has 20 delegates, Victoria 16, Queensland 13, Western Australia nine, South Australia eight, Tasmania six and the territories two each. This convention has enormous implications for the future of our nation and should therefore be seen to be equal and fair in its deliberations.

I fear that providing majority representation to the more populous states will place greater attention on the membership and biases of the major states and ignore the real issue of the future of our nation's constitution. The Senate has equal representation for the protection of the less populous states. This is an issue where the less populous states deserve, and should be provided with, a voice equal to the more populous states. I fear that failure to provide this could compromise the convention. I accept that this will not be changed. I only hope that this does not prohibit the will of the majority of Australians being heard and that the imbalance in state representation does not prohibit the opportunity for our nation to take the course of action the majority of Australians wish for simply because this will be used as a reason to oppose any proposed changes.

          —The Labor Party's position on an Australian republic is well known to all in this chamber and to the community generally. At the last election we campaigned on a commitment to achieve an Australian republic by the year 2000. What a magnificent opportunity there is when we are displaying ourselves as a nation in the course of what will be a marvellous Olympic Games—and the world will be coming here—to show a vibrant, independent minded, commercially effective Australia with great sporting and cultural achievements, and to have that opportunity launched by an Australian head of state. That was the objective, the symbolism that would be associated with that. As we enter into a new millennium we enter it as a proudly independent nation with our own head of state, our own constitutional arrangements.

          We have always taken that position in full knowledge that the constitutional arrangements which served Australia at our creation were constitutional arrangements associated with a great democracy, that of the United Kingdom, with great parliamentary traditions, great civil libertarian traditions, and great democratic traditions. We do not spurn them; we relish them, we value them, and we are concerned about threats to some aspects of them that are contained within this bill. But our position on the republic is not a statement of our views about the United Kingdom or about our origins. We are proud of our origins and we are proud of the sources of the democracy that we have here in this country. We are made even prouder when we see magnificent results like that which were seen recently in the United Kingdom with an overwhelming vote for the Labour Party. I congratulate Tony Blair on his victory.

We look forward to an Australian republic within that Commonwealth in which she is the head.

Nevertheless, our delegates at that time progressed the title of Australia to a republican title but did not progress our constitutional forms to the same position. That is left to us.

          This debate could be a unifying experience for the Australian community, an experience whereby they set aside their normal partisan commitments, their normal concerns with the political parties—indeed, maybe their hostilities with all forms of politics—and make a statement about themselves as a people and themselves as a nation. Either way, make that statement. That is why it is such a disappointment to find what ought to be an easy progress, via plebiscite and referendum to a final conclusion one way or another on this particular matter, is put like a limpet, if you like, to suck blood from this particular debate.

          Let us recollect where this particular convention came from. It did not come from a position inside the Liberal Party which said that this is the best way to go about this process. Indeed, as it has exited the last polls and been contemplated within the halls of government over the course of the last 12 months, I am as aware as anyone else that there has been a deal of backing and filling in this government as to whether or not they ought to proceed with a convention. That is perhaps because this leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister, recognised the political fix that was associated with it for his predecessor as leader of the Liberal Party as he desperately tried to control an issue that was getting out of control inside his ranks at that time—a pretty ignoble and expensive fix, as far as the Australian taxpayer is concerned, and a fix which is worse than simply that and in fact sullies what ought to be an interesting and pure debate, a relationship between us as a parliament and the Australian people.

          We are not writing on a clean sheet of paper, as the delegates did back in the 1890s.

          I go to the first issue which was raised by the person who spoke before me, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), the question of voluntary voting. There is a suggestion here that this voluntary voting issue, in this particular context, in no way foreshadows an ultimate intention by the government. Of course it does. The previous speaker made that amply clear. The previous speaker on the Liberal side said that he was overjoyed by the prospect that there would be voluntary voting associated with this because he believed in that.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We all know the consequences of, if you like, voluntary attendance at the poll, because there is not compulsory voting in Australia but compulsory attendance at the poll. You do not have to vote; you attend the poll. But, for shorthand, people talk about voluntary and compulsory voting. All you have to do, in looking at the consequences of voluntary voting associated with this and encouraging that attitude to develop in the community, is consider the unrepresentative nature of American politics, as it has now become, whereby the President of the United States effectively emerges with a mandate of about 15 to 20 per cent of the American people. If you think that the discrediting of politics has proceeded apace over the last few years or so in Australia and that a large percentage of Australians have turned off the political process, try the US.

          When you look at the citizen militias operating around the United States now, the fact that they feel totally disconnected from politics, that the political representatives do not represent the totality of the people of the nation, means that they feel that they can opt out of the nation in some sort of confederated anarchy. Their followers in this country, of

Lee and the folks who tried to revolt against the United States back in 1860; it is a description of the nature of the internal political process that they seek, essentially the dissolution of the nation. So the voluntary voting aspect of this is a bad precedent.

          The process by which it is taking place offends me even more—it may not necessarily offend all my party even more than the voluntary process, but it offends me even more than the voluntary process—and that is the postal ballot that is associated with this. There is one thing on which everybody in this chamber—Liberal, National Party, Independent and Labor—can stand proud in the international sphere, and that is on the fact that we in this country have come to epitomise corruption&amp;hyphen;free politics in the balloting process. The secret ballot is known globally as `the Australian ballot'. It is the Australian ballot that has come to mark the peculiar contribution of the Australian nation to the democratic process internationally. That reputation has stood us in enormous good stead over time.

          What is going to happen with this is several&amp;hyphen;fold difficulties. The first problem involved here is that up to three million Australians may well not receive a ballot paper because they will have shifted address since the last election. The second feature is that the material on the ballot will be available in writing and only in English. Unlike the polling booth process, whereby you can get assistance to vote, this is going to disenfranchise the blind, the frail or aged, the illiterate or people whose English skills are not of sufficiently high standard to be able to read what is going to
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           be an inordinately complex ballot paper when it finally hits the table. There will be hundreds of candidates, extraordinarily difficult directions and an extraordinarily convoluted process which they have to follow to fill it out, covering material, including their date of birth, and all the rest of it. A whole series of difficult processes will have to be gone through to cast a formal ballot. Instead of the ease of assistance at the polling booth, you are going to get confusion, fear and worry as this lands on the kitchen table of the average Australian citizen as this ballot proceeds.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Add to that the lack of secrecy. People are going to seek legitimate assistance; others are going to attempt to interfere. There will always be the need for legitimate assistance for that ballot paper to be properly concluded. Instead of a polling booth in which people's votes are cast in secret, we are going to have a kitchen table vote to which your neighbours can be witness, to which your friends can be witness, to which your enemies, if they can put enough pressure on you, can be witness. The whole point of the secret ballot process was to take that pressure out of politics, that corruption out of politics. This postal ballot puts it right back in. The fact that that great Australian tradition of the secret ballot has been so vehemently compromised by this process is an absolute tragedy in this process.

          Again, instead of having that vote cast in about five minutes flat when you are in the polling booth, these ballot papers are going to be lying about on people's tables for something like six weeks. This is going to compound the problems that are going to emerge with the difficulties that will be experienced from people having changed their address, the fact that large numbers are not enrolled and the fact that 200,000 people overseas will be effectively disenfranchised by this process but would not have been by another process. The time between close of nominations and close of rolls is going to be one week. So a whole lot of youngsters in Australia are going to be cut out of an opportunity to cast a ballot in this process.

          —The convention for which the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill legislates is a vital part of a process for coming to a conclusion about whether or not Australia should become a republic and, if so, what sort of republic and when. It meets absolutely the commitments made by the coalition to the Australian people before the 1996 election.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The path that led to this bill was shaped by the push and pull of political forces—there is no escaping that. But the process which has emerged has substantially transcended partisan politics and gives the Australian people a real chance to get the constitution they want. When Paul Keating mounted his campaign to achieve a republic he unleashed forces that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          did outlive his prime ministership. I think that, in the republic, Mr Keating found an issue in which he deeply believed and one which he thought would divide and damage the coalition. I cannot say whether he recognised fully that if his tactics succeeded they also risked dividing the nation.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the coalition has progressively built an effective consensus on the politics and on the substance of the issue, which is based on our commitment to giving the Australian people the constitution that they want. This is a tribute to a succession of coalition leaders. John Hewson, despite the fragility of his leadership following the 1993 election loss, overcame what must have been a strong impulse to simply deny that there was even any need to discuss the issue and declared that the coalition would engage in the debate and would consider whether or not there was a compelling case for becoming a republic. Alexander Downer took the process a step further by proposing a people's centennial convention, the composition of which was essentially the same as the one proposed in this bill, to which a coalition government would refer a broad range of matters for consideration and put to a referendum significant recommendations approved by a broad consensus of the convention.

        <para first-indent="16">
         John Howard confirmed this as Leader of the Opposition and finally blunted the divisiveness and partisanship of the Keating approach. Despite the fact that he is, by his own description, `certainly not Australia's leading republican', and his quite accurate perception that there are and were more pressing matters facing Australia than the debate, he made the opposition's final commitment:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         If a consensus emerges from the people's convention regarding the head of state, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. If no consensus emerges, then the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for change to establish which one of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing the president by direct popular vote as well as by a parliamentary vote as proposed by the Prime Minister . . . Naturally, the option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote.

         Taken together, these commitments provided security that the convention was not an attempt to bury the issue and guaranteed that, at the end of the day, the Australian people would be the ones who decided who their head of state would be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Getting things off the partisan agenda is one thing: delivering on promises is another. The Prime Minister and the government have delivered on their promises, despite media speculation that they would not do so and despite the imperative urgings of the opposition that the government break its commitment and go immediately to a plebiscite. Those urgings, I am interested to note, have been continued in this debate.

        <para first-indent="16">
         While I am totally committed to a compulsory voting system for federal elections, I do believe that voluntary postal voting for the election of delegates to the convention is acceptable and sensible both because of cost and because the convention will debate and recommend rather than decide the issue of constitutional change. There is this funny thing called the postal vote that goes around in federal elections, which we certainly do not think is constantly being rorted!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The decision on what comes out of the process will be decided by the people of Australia in a referendum at which voting will be compulsory. The government's commitments and its adherence to them have maximised the possibility of this nation coming to a rational and effective long&amp;hyphen;term solution to the issue of head of state. Despite the substantive and symbolic significance of the republican issue, it is not now a partisan issue amongst the public. The last public survey I saw indicated that it was one of the lowest factors motivating the vote one way or the other.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The low intensity register reflects the fact that Australians, despite their different beliefs and predispositions about the best way to go on constitutional change, believe that the processes that have been put in place will allow the issue to be appropriately and sensibly resolved without becoming a focus for politically partisan division. Equally, anyone who does not know that low intensity issues can quickly heat up if they are mishandled is
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        <para first-indent="16">
         There should be no doubt about the potential divisiveness of this issue: it is significant. This is why I believe that the people's convention—a convention which will in part emerge from the direct election of delegates—is important and why arguments for abandoning it and going directly to an indicative plebiscite do not serve the cause of a rational debate or a sustainable outcome. I do not say this on the basis of any belief in the inevitability of the convention coming to a consensus. A consensus may be too much to hope for given that there will be strong and organised republican and monarchist factions and that achieving a consensus requires arriving at a general agreement, which is more demanding than getting mere majority support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The prospect of a lack of consensus has been anticipated. There are fail&amp;hyphen;safe mechanisms in the form of the government's commitment to an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, there is the commitment to a referendum.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Above all, the responsibilities of the convention are to expose the issues fully and frankly. The real benefits of the convention, short of its achieving consensus, are to focus the attention of the Australian people, to expose the issues, to explore the consequences on the operation of our political life of taking different courses of action and to deal with what our political system should look like in the 21st century.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not believe that these issues will be dealt with appropriately nor that the convention will meet its obligations if it reduces the debate to a polarised and unreflective retracing of fixed positions. Both monarchists and republicans should review the set positions they have taken up and address straightforwardly the apparent predispositions of the Australian people. I want to focus briefly on some aspects of these tasks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first relates to the fact that the monarchists cannot overly rest on inertia as a decisive argument for their position. It is common ground that the present constitutional system has served us well since Federation. The real issue is whether this system will be
         <break page="3514" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          acceptable to Australians and serve Australia as well in the next century. The old saying, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' does have a certain ring, but its attraction should not be regarded as overwhelming. Constitutional mechanisms do have their limits. Their bearings can wear out. Structures which worked well in the past may not work well in the future. A consensual recognition of a status quo's past success needs to be matched by a degree of foresight and vision about what Australia may need in the future.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Past success is not a guarantee of future effective functioning, and this is certainly the case where one of the key elements that has allowed our system to work so well is the character and commitment of an individual. Queen Elizabeth II has been an essential part of the Australian constitutional mechanism. She has served that constitution superbly. The Australian federation has existed for 96 years. For 45 of those years, Queen Elizabeth II has been our monarch. She has bridged the period in which the British empire, of which Australia was once so proud a part, has been dissolved. She has been the only monarch that an overwhelming majority of the Australian people—80 per cent, on my estimate—have ever known. The Queen has been an intrinsic and much admired part of our nation, even in times of intense constitutional conflict. Indeed, although my recollections are a bit fuzzy, I recollect Gough Whitlam saying, in his moment of maximum distress at being dismissed by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General, `The Queen would never have done it.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Will the constitutional mechanism still bind as effectively, in the absence of the individual who has for so long and for so many Australians been the embodiment of the monarchy? Certainly, many Australians who are committed to the system have indicated that a key reason for their support of the constitutional monarchy is their personal attachment to Queen Elizabeth II and that, without her, they would consider republicanism. The convention, and particularly the monarchist component of it, must address this in an intelligent and dispassionate way. They cannot push the issue aside by saying it can be addressed later. To do this would run a substantial risk

         The republicans, for their part, have to abandon the pretence that there would be no change to the system if we were to move to a head of state elected by two&amp;hyphen;thirds of parliament. The minimalist republic is a total myth.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Republican Movement and the Republic Advisory Committee have taken the position that a change from a constitutional monarchy with an appointed Governor&amp;hyphen;General to a republic with a president elected by the federal parliament and possessing the powers currently held by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General—powers which the RAC believes would not have to be codified—would not have a real impact on the political system. The impact would be substantial.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Governors&amp;hyphen;General are appointed by the monarch on the advice of a single individual, the Prime Minister of the day. They are unsupported by any direct democratic mandate or parliamentary electoral mandate. Despite this, the reserve powers of the office, those exercised by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General—not on the advice of government but at the personal discretion of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General—are formidable. These powers are part of the background against which we play our politics and they profoundly affect the politics of the nation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Governors&amp;hyphen;General can, in some circumstances, choose the Prime Minister and they have, on occasion, selected leaders of the minority party. They can dismiss governments on grounds of breaching the constitution. They can refuse to accept the government's advice that the parliament be dissolved. A Governor&amp;hyphen;General can dismiss a Prime Minister who cannot secure supply: that has been proved beyond doubt.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The republicans' proposals would create a presidency combining the powers of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General with an unprecedented degree of parliamentary legitimacy and national authority. Elected by two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the federal parliament, the president would have greater parliamentary endorsement than the Prime Minister, who need only command
         <break page="3515" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          support of a majority of the House of Representatives. Only four Prime Ministers in Australia's history have achieved a two&amp;hyphen;thirds majority in the parliament and no Prime Minister has had such support since the system of Senate voting was changed in 1949.

         This president would personify Australia. He or she would, to use Mr Keating's words `embody and represent Australia's values and traditions, Australia's experience and aspirations'. It should be self&amp;hyphen;evident that the creation of a president with such powers, such parliamentary endorsement and such national authority would substantially change the operation of our political system. The president's views would, of course, find public expression. A new authority and a new influence would be created. This would impact on Australian politics and public policy in new ways. There would be frictions, uncertainties and new accommodations that, over time, would change our system of government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This conclusion is reinforced when we consider the experience of other parliamentary republics, which—the Republic Advisory Committee asserted—confirms the `feasibility' of a change to an Australian president without significantly altering our political life.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The international experience essentially does two things: first, it confirms that republics can deliver good, effective government; second, it confirms that the Republic Advisory Committee's assertions are invalid. I do not have time to go through a detailed analysis of the cases, but the bottom line is that international evidence simply does not support the RAC's assertion that we can have a president, with all the powers accruing to a Governor-General, selected by a two-thirds majority of the parliament and leave our system unaltered.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I believe that both republicans and monarchists must address the view registered by the overwhelming majority of Australians—that, if there is to be a republic, the Australian people want to be the ones who directly elect the president. The direct election of a president is the overwhelming preference of the Australian people. It is supported by over 70 per cent of Australians in all states;
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          over 70 per cent of Australians in both city and country; over 70 per cent of Liberal, Labor and minority party voters; over 70 per cent of Australian men; and over 70 per cent of Australian women.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that there might be some cynicism amongst the Australian people if monarchists and republicans, whilst being unable to agree on a preferred system, reached a form of negative consensus on this issue. But this cynicism would not really be the issue because, if the convention does not come to a consensus on its preferred alternative, the government is committed to a plebiscite which asks the Australian people to `vote on a series of options for the changes to establish which of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing a president by direct popular vote . . . '
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is clear that an elected president would change our political system profoundly. It is incumbent on the convention to fully draw out the changes to our political system that such a direct election of a president would bring. If the convention agrees that this is not the way to go, then it will have to put a significant effort into communicating to the Australian people the reason for its views on a directly elected president and convince them that this path should not be pursued. I do not believe that the convention can simply brush these views aside if it does not come to a consensus on the position of a head of state.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that the Australian constitution is uniquely the property of the Australian people. Dealing with it is quite different from the normal run of politics in which, essentially, the people delegate powers and elect politicians to discharge their will, and, if they do not like it, they can sanction them at the forthcoming election. Ultimately, the Australian constitution belongs to the Australian people. Only they can and should decide what constitution we should have. I believe that the most effective role for the politicians in this fundamental matter should be to draw out the consequences of change for the Australian people and for the future of Australian politics rather than to seek to impose their own prejudices, preferences and conveniences on the convention process.

          The attacks made by the opposition on the convention process—and they have been fairly sustained—do not have any legs. I reiterate that postal voting is not anathema to the secret ballot: indeed, it is part of our secret ballot. The fact of a convention rather than a plebiscite should focus attention on, and should provide the basis for, a rational and reasonable outcome.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact is that Australia now has an opportunity to deal with the issue of a head of state in a thoughtful and deliberate way. If we do not grasp this opportunity, the likelihood is that at some future point we will find ourselves in a position where fundamental structural decisions affecting the Australian polity are driven by political momentum, stress and passion. I believe that that would minimise the chance of achieving outcomes which we both intend and desire. The convention will make a significant contribution to this outcome. I commend the bill to the House.

          —As an Independent, I would have to say that it is a great shame that this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill has become so politicised over the past decade, since the push for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of our Federation first gathered steam. It became politicised largely because members of the conservative side of politics in this country found themselves being left behind as the ALP, particularly Paul Keating, championed the cause for Australia having its own head of state.

So significant is it that, in time, the Liberal and National parties found themselves having to play catch&amp;hyphen;up with the ALP. They realised that this was not an issue that was going to go away and they had to have some sort of credible alternative proposal—alternative, that is, to Mr Keating's plan to simply let the people of Australia have their

         While we have seen the government break quite a few pre&amp;hyphen;election commitments, it is a real pity, in some respects, that it has honoured this one because I am quite sure that the Labor Party's proposal to hold an indicative plebiscite first would have been a preferable way of handling this issue. That way any convention would at least have had a clear&amp;hyphen;cut idea of what the people of Australia wanted in general terms. However, I accept that now we are stuck with holding the convention first, thus putting the cart before the horse. Now that we have it, it should be our priority to ensure we make it work and work fairly. Let us not create a confrontation.

         In the interests of promoting the consensus approach I believe is needed as we come together to discuss the constitutional future of this country heading into the next millennium, I support this bill's idea but certainly not its substance. Amendments have been put forward calling for the vote to be made compulsory. I endorse those. Compulsory voting is an honoured tradition in our democracy. It is important because it ensures all Australians have a say on who they want to govern and the task is not just left up to those who are interested or do not have anything better to do on polling day.

Now the government want to tamper with that and bring it in the back door without a referendum. As I said, compulsory voting is one of the basic tenets of our unique Australian democracy. It is one of the things that sets our democracy apart from some of the other great democracies around the world.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but in effect that is what this bill is doing. It is playing around with, or at least challenging, one of basic rules that this democracy has lived by for almost a century. It will be a sad day for Australia if this bill is passed as it stands without the opposition's amendments making voting compulsory.

Non-compulsory voting in the US has led to marginalisation of unrepresented ordinary folk, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) alluded to in his speech on this bill.

         I have already touched upon the great history of democracy in Australia and we really are fortunate to live in one of the world's most stable and free nations. But, while our British heritage has contributed to that stability, it has been established and safeguarded by the people of this great continent and their respect for commonsense and a fair go. We do not need to wage scare campaigns to discuss this issue. What we do need is sensible, intelligent and constructive debate, much like we saw at the federation conventions of a century ago.

         I am pleased to say that one such convention took place in my own electorate. The Bathurst people's convention in 1896 was credited with getting the federation debate back on the boil. There are some remarkable similarities surrounding the federation debate of that time and the current republican push today. The People's Federal Convention was organised by the people of Bathurst frustrated that the push toward federation appeared to be on the backburner. Until that time, the federation debate had been dominated by politicians, particularly the father of federation, Sir Henry Parkes. Sir Henry died that year and the movement suffered because of the loss of a powerful and eloquent champion.

         One of the more interesting debates during the convention surrounded the question of how Australia's Governors-General should be appointed. Mr John Norton of Sydney put the cat among the pigeons when he suggested the Governor-General should be voted on by members of parliament instead of being appointed by an absentee monarch. He argued that people in Australia should have the power to elect their own head of state. He said:

         The convention was taking place just after the US presidential election of that year, and many argued Australia did not want to head down the same path as the USA. They said the US President had too much power and the campaign had disrupted business in the US for four months. `We're far better to have a monarch who reigns but does not govern,' was the argument that won the day, with the Bathurst convention ending with three cheers for the Queen.

Voluntary voting was used in Australia federally until about 1923 and it is not a matter of constitutional requirement that we should have either voluntary or compulsory voting.

The opposition really ought not to continue to criticise the government in this respect.

It is a matter for the Australian people, and the government will resist any attempt by those opposite to continue to politicise this matter and to turn it into a party political issue.

         Sir Harry Gibbs, one of Australia's most eminent jurists, pointed out that such a model could well turn into a republican dictatorship because, if there was a desire to sack the president, clearly the parliament would have to be called together for that purpose. The president would clearly hear of a proposal to sack him, and it would be quite simple for him to prorogue the parliament. There would, therefore, be no parliament to impeach him. In that situation, because his powers could not be challenged in the court, we would have a republican dictatorship.

         I will not go my entire time today because I am conscious of the fact that many issues have been covered already, but I would like to make a few points regarding this particular issue. We are here today to consider the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill which basically sets out the parameters for the Constitutional Convention. The question which is to be addressed is the question of whether Australia becomes a republic.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         How important is this issue? I think it is a very important issue because it is about the question of our national identity. It is about how we project ourselves internationally. It is also about how Australians see themselves and how they see themselves progressing into the future. However, having said that, is it the most important issue we face? Clearly, it is not. There are many other issues which relate to the general operation of society today, and into the future, which are also crucial.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The question of our national identity does impact upon those other issues in many different ways. Certainly, at the moment there is a debate which has been going on in Australia in a more general sense, many components of which have been quite outrageous, which also looks at the question of our national identity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, other issues are important and those who have said that the Labor Party, and particularly the former Prime Minister, was about this issue and nothing else, effectively undermine the question of its significance and misunderstand the operation of modern government. Even when this was an issue which was getting considerable media coverage in earlier days, when it was championed by the former Prime Minister, many other things were going on around government at the same time. Much was being done as the debate continued. The fact is, it is not the only issue we face.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current system is also something that is often raised by people in this debate. I put it on the record that I think Queen Elizabeth
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          II, as a monarch, as Queen of Australia, has done a fine job as far as it goes. However, the question of a monarch and a head of state resident in the United Kingdom but who also operates in relation to Australia is essentially hard to understand. The relevance of that to Australian society is difficult to justify. The question of relevance as we head into the new millennium, of how we operate as a country, and of how we utilise the offices of a head of state, are also very important.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a couple of issues I want to raise which result from comments made by the previous speaker. Concerning the issue of a republican dictatorship, the view that we should maintain what we have because it has served us well, the old slogan, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it', has some appeal except that I do not think anyone is talking about ending up in a system which could lead to a situation of a republican dictatorship. That is really quite a ridiculous line.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think any sensible commentator around this issue would reject it. Any fair-minded Australian who is considering the detail of what is being proposed, will be proposed, and can be proposed and what will eventually go to a vote of the Australian people will realise that that is not the intention and will not be the result of what is undertaken by the parliament and eventually by the Australian people. It certainly will not be the result of this convention.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another view that has been put is essentially that the previous Prime Minister was about imposing his republic. You heard it on the TV and you heard it by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard): `You will get the republic you want, not Keating's republic.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think we have got to clarify just what the previous government was proposing. Essentially, the first point of reference in terms of the question of what would happen was to be a national plebiscite, involving all Australians, on the basic question, `Do you want a republic?' If that was successful and indicated 50, 60, 70, 30 or whatever percentage support for that initiative, there would then be conventions, discussions and development of specific proposals and then a referendum.

          The argument often put by members of the other side in particular and others, who are not party political but involved in this debate, that in fact it was not going to involve the Australian people—that it was not going to be a situation where you got the chance to have your say—is absolute rubbish. I think that it does the debate no good to consider it on those grounds.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another issue that has been raised by many other speakers is the question of politicising the issue. This argument goes that decisions should not be an issue of party politics and that this one is becoming so because of the actions of the Labor Party. I think you have got to consider the nature of politics. The fact is in this House and in the media, debates are continued upon the question of, `What do we want to see occur within our society?' Whether it is the question of tax rates; of home and community care; of immigration or of who is to be our head of state—all issues by nature are political. The question of whether it should be seen as being a party political issue is another point. There are people of varying opinions about what should occur throughout this chamber in varying degrees. It is fair to say that there is probably greater unanimity that we should become a republic on this side of the House than there is on the other.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact of the matter is that to suggest that politicisation has occurred around this issue is really quite ridiculous. It is an issue which relates to what is Australia going to be into the future. Such issues are by nature political because they require people to take sides. They require debate about what should happen and they require, in the end, people making decisions for themselves about what they see as being the way forward.

          The conduct of this election for this convention is in fact in itself political. Not party political but, as has been made clear, there will be tickets running for election to this convention. There will be tickets from the constitutional monarchists. There will be tickets from the Australian republican movement. There will be tickets from a range of different organisations representing different views along the spectrum. What you are being asked to do is basically to pick a side. I think
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           it is fair to say, given there is a central question involved in the conduct of this convention, that people should be expected and will be expected to state where they stand on this particular issue. I think it is also fair to say that the overwhelming majority of those who will stand for election to this convention will have a view one way or the other. They may vary at the edges, but essentially, there will be pro&amp;hyphen;republic candidates and pro&amp;hyphen;monarchist candidates. That is their right and I respect that. I do not have a problem with that but I think to argue that it is not political is ridiculous.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Essentially, the Prime Minister is trying to take the politics out of this issue by subterfuge. He is trying to do the same thing with a number of other issues. Basically, he is trying to take the politics out of the coalition. He is finding that, in government, he is in a position where he has to make decisions, and those decisions have consequences, and so there is a difficulty in terms of holding the coalition together on a range of different issues.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Essentially, that was the problem the coalition faced on this question of a republic when it was first raised. That was one of the principal reasons why, rather than going one way or the other on that particular issue, we ended up referring it to a committee.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me make it clear that we support the bill. However, amendments can be made to improve it to make it more representative of the views of Australians, more inclusive of the involvement of Australians, more able to cover the issues in a way which will ensure that there is some scope for consensus—they find that difficult—and so that it gives a clear indication of the will of the Australian people.

          The Prime Minister is a monarchist. He is quite open about that. I respect his view—I do not agree with it, but I respect it. He did not really want to be engaged in this debate. He does not see it as being crucial to
          <break page="3527" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Australia's future. He thinks that many other issues are more important. In some respects, he is right. There are other issues that are more important, as I mentioned earlier, but to suggest that we cannot address more than one issue at a time is a Gerald Ford argument—you can't chew gum and think at the same time. I do not think that is the case. In this country we are capable, both as a parliament and as a people, of considering more than one issue at once. Lord knows, we have to.

Although I have great respect for the individuals involved, I cannot see a situation in which we will get agreement between Digger James and Malcolm Turnbull on the way to progress this issue. Essentially, they are coming from diametrically opposed positions. So there are difficulties in terms of coming to an agreed position.

          Many people who oppose what we proposed—an initial plebiscite—do so because they are anti&amp;hyphen;change. The intention of the plebiscite was to give an indication to delegates, through a convention, of the will of the Australian people on the general question of, `Do we want a republic or don't we?' That indication is important because what will happen now is a situation where the elected delegates will have differing opinions, and it is fair to say that there is unlikely to be an overwhelming majority one way or the other.

          Compulsory voting is not really compulsory. What happens in this country is that people are required to attend a balloting place and to have their name struck off the list.

          The nature of the way our system works means that we have turnouts of around 90 or 95 per cent, whereas in the United States 15 or 20 per cent of the people can decide who is the President. The American system could have a worrying impact on the way democracy in this country works and how our society works in terms of extremist minorities, from whatever side of the spectrum, gaining a foothold, what they could do to the operation of our system, and what that would mean for ordinary, everyday Australians and the conduct of their lives.

          In relation to the postal ballot situation, over the term of a federal parliament, even in 18 months to two years, something like three million Australians will move house. Many of those people, although they are required under the law to notify their change of address to the Electoral Commission, will not do so. It is the sort of thing—and I am one of the people who can plead guilty to this on occasion—which you often forget to do and do closer to the particular election only when you have heard the election being announced on the radio or the television. The fact is, a lot of those people will not make the change of enrolment and, through a postal ballot system, will not receive ballot papers and will not have the opportunity to vote. Something like 200,000 Australians will probably be overseas at the time of this vote, and they also will miss out.

          Others have covered the question of appointed delegates and other issues. I will not go into that today; I think that has been covered quite carefully by others. The basic point I will finish with is that the Prime Minister says he wants consensus but he has designed a process, through this convention, which will avoid it. We see a situation of division, which he says he opposes, and that consensus, that comfortable and relaxed atmosphere that he seeks for Australian society, will be very difficult to achieve through this process.

We look to a situation where that will hopefully come through this convention process, although we have our doubts. I commend the bill to the House, but I commend, particularly, the amendments that are being proposed as an opportunity to make this a real attempt to address this issue as we move into the next century.

         The end of the century mood in the 1890s was a catalyst or intensifier which encouraged the founding fathers—no founding mothers—to get on with it. From Henry Parkes' Tenterfield speech of October 1889, which revived the federation movement, until the inaugura

         In the first Australasian Federal Convention of 1891, an Australian republic was spoken of by a few delegates as a long&amp;hyphen;term goal—perhaps a hundred years or so later—without arousing paroxysms of enthusiasm or rage. Our founding fathers took a pragmatic view. Unlike the Americans a century earlier, they did not think they were writing a document for all time; it was simply the best compromise that could achieve approval by the British government and acceptance by the six colonies. Even so, it took a decade to jump these hurdles. There was a proposal, soon defeated, that the Governor&amp;hyphen;General should be directly elected by the voters—and that has a distinctly contemporary ring.

         A century ago, fear of isolation and concern about external threats persuaded six Australian colonies to join in a federation. This continent&amp;hyphen;wide aspiration sought nationhood within the British Empire, linked by the Queen, a promise of protection by the Royal Navy, White Australia and, to a degree, tariff protection. Parkes and later Griffith, Deakin, Isaacs, Kingston, Barton, Symon and other founding fathers had some vision, but they recognised that there were practical limits to how far they could go. Australia had a small, scattered population and a huge continent with poor communications—Todd's telegraph and primitive telephones notwithstanding.

         The white population was overwhelmingly English speaking and nominally Christian. Many citizens had been born in Britain and may well have seen themselves as mere transients here. The constitution of 1901 was a compromise document which needed to satisfy the different needs of six colonies before it could be put to popular vote. It also required the imprimatur of the imperial government—particularly difficult when Joseph Chamberlain, the then Colonial Secretary, dreamt of an empire which was to be an organic unity, tied together politically, economically and through trade. Hence, the British government retained the right of veto

         A century later, in the 1990s, there is a comparable move towards national redefinition, with the beginning of a new millennium as a psychological target. White Australia and tariff protection are both gone. The British Empire no longer exists. The United Kingdom is increasingly integrated into the European Community, both politically and economically. The relevance of the British connection is coming under challenge. Britain is no longer a major trading partner, although still a significant investor here, and the Royal Navy no longer guards our shores.

         The bill before the House is a very cynical exercise, designed to create a situation which is programmed to fail. It could be more accurately described as the `Constitutional Convention (Impediments to Voting) Bill 1997'. It creates an obstacle race, setting up hurdles to actually discourage voting. It is in very sharp contrast to our existing system. Voting is to be voluntary—in other words, to persuade the community that it is not a very important vote; voters do not really have to turn up; voters do not have to own the result; voters do not have to have a personal commitment or investment in the result. It is to be a vote that is postal, not a vote by attendance. It will be non&amp;hyphen;secret, in effect. If you read those extraordinary provisions, you will see you not only have to sign the ballot but also confirm it by indicating your date of birth. If voters forget to put in the date of birth then, presumably, the vote is invalidated. That is in proposed clause 68.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) calls himself a monarchist and he also supports what he calls `the existing system'. I am a republican and I also support `the existing system'. The problem is that the Prime Minister's approach could be described as the `empty room' theory of constitutional monarchy in which the qualities of physical absence and political indifference by the monarch are the major assets. If one asked the Prime Minister where the national focus was, he would fling open the doors of an empty room and say, `See! There's nothing there. Isn't it wonderful? And it works.' We must be able to have more than the empty room theory of constitutional sovereignty. When an anxious and eager House waits for my resumption of the debate after question time and later deliberations, I will, by peroration, go to a climax.

Does he recall the Treasurer subsequently revising that forecast up to 8.5 per cent? Is it not a fact that the level of unemployment is stuck at 8.7 per cent, some 150,000 jobs short of your government's earlier forecast? Why should any Australian believe the forecast in last night's budget that unemployment will fall to eight per cent when economic growth does not reach four per cent, the target set by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the level the former Labor government consistently achieved?

          —The growth forecasts set out in the budget are in the eyes of most economic forecasters very conservative and, therefore, extremely achievable. The budget attacks the issue of employment on two fronts. Firstly, it improves the economic outlook for jobs by taking pressure off interest rates. I would remind the parliament that, since this government came to power, there has been a reduction of 1.5 per cent in interest rates and that has saved business about $3.6 billion in interest payments. It also puts us on the path of long-term growth rather than the boom-bust cycle that was so characteristic of the former government.

There is the $1 billion Federation Fund for nation building projects. There is the $1.25 billion fund for environmental projects, bitterly opposed by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. There is road funding of over $1.6 billion that will create and sustain 19,000 jobs. There is a regional communications strategy that will spend $250 million in regional Australia—once again, a proposal opposed tooth and nail by the Australian Labor Party.

In rural policy, there is a $200 million package to improve the outlook for Australian farmers and regions. In relation to the regional forest agreements, we are continuing the drive to fix the forest issue with a balance for jobs in conservation, and we have created 400 jobs from the first of the RFAs in the East Gippsland area.

          —My question is addressed to the Treasurer, on the same subject. I refer to his statement last night that the bulk of his new savings rebate benefit, as he chooses to call it, will flow to individuals with taxable income under $40,000. Has the Treasurer any information as to how many wage and salary earners in this category have personal savings of $60,000 or more, enabling them to get the full $450 rebate? Is it not the case that the overwhelming majority of wage and salary earners earning under $40,000 would be lucky to have as much as $3,000 in personal savings, which would entitle them under your scheme to a grand total annual rebate of not $450 but at most around $23 a year, or 43c a week? Is this your idea of a benefit?

By the time we have read them out, we have all the punch of a marshmallow! You do not have to have $60,000 to claim this savings rebate; you can claim it on $1 or you can claim it on $100. If you want to put it into superannuation, you can claim it on $3,000 of superannuation contributions. Let me ask you this question: what tax rebate did the Labor

It was the coalition government that did it. It was the coalition government that gave choice in superannuation. It was the coalition government that introduced Australia's first ever breakthrough in relation to taxes on savings.

         Last night we also announced a number of other measures which will improve the operation of retirement incomes. We announced that from 1 July 1999 all contributions made by or on behalf of members into superannuation will be preserved. We announced a way of reforming the early release of superannuation benefits. We introduced provisions giving choice to employees between funds—between a retirement savings account and a fund. We introduced into the budget for the first time budgeting for pensions to be held at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Again, I ask the question: after 13 years of government, what year did the Labor Party do that in? None. They never put it into legislation and they never budgeted for it.

Is it not the case that the overwhelming majority of wage and salary earners in this group either pay no personal superannuation contribution at all or, if they do, it is very much less than $3,000? How can the Treasurer justify he and I and every one of us in this parliament now getting windfall $450 tax rebates for our personal superannuation contributions when those who clean our offices, some of whom I understand are paying personal contributions of three per cent, adding up to $600 a year, would get at most $90?

          —I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The government introduced a number of significant initiatives in last night's budget in relation to health and family services, and they have three basic priorities: first, to address areas where there have been unsustainable rates of increase in growth; second, to look at areas where we can improve outcomes for the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           public; and, third, to maintain our fundamental commitment to keep Medicare.

         What we have done in the health portfolio is rein outlays back from a 5.5 per cent average over the 10 years to 1995-96 to 2.6 per cent real growth over the forward estimates. The fact is, though, health expenditure is still going up and health expenditure is increasing as a share of government expenditure. Our key initiatives are in the public health area, where we are funding programs that were due to expire, and funding a number of immunisation initiatives. We will, for the first time, be making the hepatitis B vaccine universally available and part of the immunisation schedule.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, we have been able to come to an agreement with the Department of Finance about a new process for listing new vaccines so they do not have to go through the budget process in a similar way to the cost effective criteria which apply to pharmaceutical benefits. This is good news, and the first vaccine being assessed under this is the acellular pertussis vaccine.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second area where we have announced a new initiative is in the national mental health strategy, a six-year strategy which was due to expire next year. We have said we will keep the national mental health strategy going beyond that time in conjunction with the states and territories.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have put new money into the acute care sector, which is $40 million over four years, particularly to strengthen the evidence and research base of public hospital treatment. We are introducing electronic claiming for Medicare benefits, which will do a few things. Firstly, it will be a significant boost to the public in terms of easier access to Medicare benefits. Secondly, it will give general practice an incentive to computerise. Unfortunately, at the moment only half of Australia's general practices have a computer.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are spending $15 million new money on emergency relief, $17 million new money on rural health and $15 million over one year for the palliative care program, which we hope to be able to wrap up into the Medicare agreements from 1998.

          We are introducing a new system of scholarships called the Howard Florey scholarships. That will be for bright, young Australian researchers who are currently overseas, who want to get back to Australia and who cannot because there is no position for them. They will not be in the position that Professor Doherty has been in, where we lose our great researchers overseas and they do not come back.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The rural initiatives will be of particular interest to the member for Forde, because rural health remains one of our top priorities. We are introducing additional places for specialist training in rural areas and, because of some of the intractable problems of trying to get doctors into country areas, we will be looking at a range of innovative service delivery programs. One of these is obstetrics. A lot of country people simply do not have access to obstetrics services.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We are making some substantial changes to the pharmaceutical benefits system. But that in the end will be to bring the pharmaceutical benefits system back from 15 per cent real growth to 7.8 per cent real growth. The expenditure under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will still go up substantially. Even with the changes we are making next year, the increase will be $300 million over and above the amount we are expending this year. All in all, this will strengthen Australia's research base and put health policy on a much sounder evidence based footing, and that bodes well for the long term.

Also, the export market development grants scheme stays with a $150 million allocation and the tourist industry, as the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and I have confirmed, will in fact get the full rate of export market development grant—something Labor was never able to do.

Which side of politics last increased the rate of sales tax? It was Labor yet again. We have not increased taxes. We have maintained discipline and we will have a budget surplus next year.

It was the Labor Party that thought it was fair to lock 20,000 young Australians out of the universities. It was the Labor Party that thought it was fair to prevent Australians getting into universities on the same terms that they were prepared to admit overseas students. They understand so little about higher education policy that the member for Werriwa thought that the coalition policies would cut access to universities by 30,000. The facts are that this year, as I announced to the parliament yesterday, the universities have enrolled 26,000 students above the targets they set for this year. That is how we have expanded access.

From 1 July this year the dependant deduction for second and

          subsequent eligible tertiary students will be doubled from $3,700 to $7,400. The effect of this decision is to increase the parental income cut-off point at which Austudy is paid for eligible tertiary students. It means that more students in rural and regional Australia will get Austudy and that many of those receiving Austudy will increase the amount of Austudy that they receive up to $925 per student. These are significant improvements to the Austudy system.

          —My further question to the Treasurer goes to the economic rationale of the savings rebate which the Treasurer conspicuously failed to address in his last purported answer. I ask him: has the retirement incomes modelling task force in Treasury analysed your savings rebate proposal and estimated its overall effect on public, private and total national saving? If so, will the Treasurer make public that analysis? If not, can the Treasurer explain to the House why that analysis has not been conducted and the results made public? Is it because your own Treasury department has long argued against savings incentives of the type that you announced last night because there is no evidence anywhere that they lead to increased national saving and plenty of reason to believe that they do not—that they actually reduce it?

Beazley is going to have to look around at Simon and ask Simon's view. Come on! What's the answer? Are you in favour of this? No answer. What's the answer—yes or no? When I asked after last year's budget were they in favour of a surcharge on superannuation for high income earners, the putative Leader of the Opposition said yes. But I asked the wrong person; I should have asked Senator Sherry, because he said no. How you can vote for a bill in the Reps and against it in the Senate when it is the same bill?

We have overdelivered. We were elected to introduce a family tax initiative. We delivered. We were elected to introduce health payment bonuses. We delivered. We were elected to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. We were elected to introduce capital gains rollover.

Sixteen million dollars of that money will go directly to helping and supporting the carers and those they care for in the community.

          which states that, while you will pocket a tax rebate of $450, a battler with only $3,000 in the bank earning three per cent interest will be entitled to a rebate of only $13.50 a year as a result of your pathetic savings scheme?

          As for your allegation about drugs, the proposal that the government has introduced there is an eminently sensible proposal. It is a proposal that seeks to use the taxpayer dollars of the Australian battler in a more prudent fashion. It will put an appropriate discipline on the growth of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The essential principle of it is that, if two drugs of equal clinical value are available,  the subsidy will be available for the less expensive one. It is an eminently sensible proposal which the government will defend.

Commonwealth funding is increased in this budget by some four per cent, up from $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion in 1997&amp;hyphen;98. This includes $160 million for literacy to help ensure that every child is reading and writing properly at the end of grade 3, $156 million for special learning needs and $54 million for languages.

         The new Labor spokesman for education, the member for Werriwa, has also unveiled Labor's new education policy. No&amp;hyphen;one in this chamber knows about this policy, I feel sure, because it did not receive any press coverage, which was lucky for the member for Werriwa because his policy could lead to the closure of 300 schools. In a speech to the Centre for Public Policy at Melbourne University some two weeks ago he stated that the Labor Party would introduce a minimum enrolment number of 50 students per school before a school would get funding from the Commonwealth, with a minimum enrolment of 20 students in rural and remote areas. And he said—he made this claim—that schools with these numbers of students did not have the support of their communities and he would not fund them.

          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           of accumulated experience of other countries during that time, I can recall no budget speech more arrogantly and complacently unresponsive to the real economic needs of a country than that of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in this place last night. And nowhere was that failure more evident than in the arrogant, contemptuous failure to deal constructively with the issue of jobs and job security, overwhelmingly the biggest economic problem this country now confronts.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That was not the only failure in last night's budget. The failure to provide financial security for retirees, in a way that both we and the government had promised in previous years and in a way that we have been discussing in question time today, was an outrageous failure. It was lousy in its morality and its economics, and it is a failure we are going to hear more about later in this debate. So too was outrageous the failure to deal decently with Australian families, particularly the struggling and disadvantaged members of our community who will continue to be subject to the kind of onslaught by this budget that was commenced last year, and on which issue you will be hearing a great deal more from us in the period ahead.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the greatest default last night in the budget was unquestionably on the subject of jobs. There was just one sentence on the subject of unemployment in that entire 12&amp;hyphen;page speech. There was no expression from the Treasurer of any human concern about the scale of the tragedy unfolding out there in the community, with 800,000 Australians wanting work who are out of work. There was not even an expression of economic concern about the tragic waste of resources that is involved in that underutilised human potential.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nowhere in the Treasurer's speech last night was there any expression of regret that unemployment had in fact become worse over the 15 months that they have been in office, increasing from 8&amp;half; per cent to the nearly 8¾that we see at the moment. There was no apology for the fact that youth unemployment is now worse, nor for the fact that long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment has now become the highest it has been for the last two years, with nearly
         <break page="3546" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a quarter of a million people—on yesterday's figures—now out of work in that category. There was no recognition that job creation—in the way that it had to be stimulated if we were going to see some advance in the situation which is now so tragic for so many people—has simply evaporated.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was no analysis, moreover, in last night's speech of why all this has happened. There was no analysis as to why economic growth has fallen away, no analysis of the impact of the slashing of so many Public Service and public sector jobs over the last 15 months—the last two budgets. There was no analysis of the impact of abandoning industry support policy in the way that occurred on such a spectacular scale in last year's budget. There was no analysis of the impact on the unemployment situation of abandoning regional support policy, which was such a crucial part of our approach to this, but now has disappeared completely from the horizon. There was no analysis of the effect on rising unemployment of cutting education and training funding, abandoning the job readiness and the labour market job skill training programs that were so crucial a part of our strategy. There were no positive proposals in last night's speech to do anything whatsoever about generating jobs, generating job security in the future. It was all a barren, tragic wasteland on this issue last night. You turned the pages of that speech and of the other budget documents, looking for inspiration, leadership, direction and some hope on this issue. All of us found absolutely, precisely nothing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The truth of the matter is that, for this government, unemployment is a second, third or fourth order problem. However, there is no doubt that it is not a second, third or fourth order problem so far as the Australian community is concerned. The most recent opinion poll evidence of that was the AGB McNair poll just before the budget, reported in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         : `Voters put employment top of their budget list.' Sixty&amp;hyphen;seven per cent of respondents rated the reduction of unemployment as the most important issue the budget should address.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The truth of the matter is that out there in the community there was a big expectation
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that this budget would address the unemployment problem head on, that we would hear from the government a spelt&amp;hyphen;out set of strategies to stimulate growth and restore those labour market programs that were so crucial in establishing job skills and job readiness but which were slashed last year, that we would see something to restore the incentives and support to efficient industries to generate new jobs, and that we would see something to generate new momentum in the regions, especially those which have been hard hit by recent economic or business decisions, Newcastle being prominent and conspicuous among them most recently. The community had hoped that we would see some money spent and some commitment made to straight&amp;hyphen;out job creation programs, in order to cover the very real transitional problems that exist in our community at the moment while we are waiting for growth to take hold and other measures to generate more sustainable jobs. But those expectations were profoundly and comprehensively disappointed. On all of these issues the Treasurer had three&amp;hyphen;fifths of five&amp;hyphen;eighths of damn all to say, and that was outrageous and a disgrace.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whether or not the government admits it, we all know the scale of the problem of unemployment—or I hope we do. The question is what the government can and should be doing about it. The government's response, as we have heard over and over again, is to say, `It is all a matter of labour market flexibility. The cyclical problem will look after itself and, as to the structural problem of unemployment, labour market flexibility will fix that under the workplace relations bill when it comes into full force, effect and operation.' But, frankly, there is absolutely no&amp;hyphen;one in the country who believes that to be true, including the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane. At the ANU in September last year, he gave a very polite little answer on the issue of whether labour market flexibility, through the present legislation, would have that effect—about as polite as a Reserve Bank governor ever gets when he is rejecting a policy position on which the government of the day has its heart. The Reserve Bank Governor said, very politely and very kindly,
         <break page="3547" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that he was agnostic. He did not believe it and nobody believes it.

         It is possible that, if labour market reform, so&amp;hyphen;called, is taken to the kind of extremes that some people on the other side want to take it to—if we do go down the American path of having a deregulated labour market that will result in that market being cleared at poverty wage levels—then we might do something to improve the notional level of people in employment. But at what social cost?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is no good going down the US path unless you are prepared to accept with those US figures the whole box and dice of US social problem implications that flow from it. As Ken Davidson said the other day in a very interesting article, it is all very well to compare the US figures with ours, but you have to take into account, among other things, that there is one very big difference between the American labour market and ours, that is, a very significant proportion of it is in gaol. There is about four per cent of the American work force tied up in the correction system at any given time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not making a cheap point against the social conditions in America. I am simply making the point that there are social consequences when you have an economic system that pushes people into depressed wages and that creates the kinds of social conditions that the other side of the House over there is so keen to talk about. You cannot get there by decent means unless you adopt a completely different strategy. The truth of the matter is that, to generate jobs in Australia, you have got to have a much more sophisticated, multifaceted strategy than anything we have seen capable of emerging from the other side of parliament at the moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You have got to have, in fact, a strategy which addresses simultaneously five different issues. The first thing you have to do is generate internal demand in the domestic Australian economy through budgetary and interest rate policy which is growth oriented and deliberately designed to generate that demand. The second thing you have got to do is harness the domestic Australian economy to the international economy so that you get the benefit of extra demand that is out there,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          particularly in our own Asian region. That means trade policy and foreign policy that integrates Australia with that external demand and makes it possible to take maximum advantage of it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third thing you have got to have is industry and regional development policy which is supportive, selectively crafted and operates in such a way as to translate that generalised demand into specific business opportunities and specific job opportunities. The fourth thing you have got to have is job skill creation through education, training and labour market programs that ensure that you have got the skill base in the Australian economy to take advantage, again, of that demand when it picks up through your other strategies. If you do not do that, you get inflationary bottlenecks through skills shortages—even worse, you export the job opportunities overseas. You abandon at your peril education, training and labour market and job readiness programs. They are crucial to ensuring that you can manage the process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, what you need—I make absolutely no apology for saying this the other day and saying it very often—are some transitional job creation strategies to recognise the reality that we now have a very large pool of long-term unemployed people who, with all the formal skill training in the world, are going to find it difficult for quite some time yet—until this economy picks up and stays picked up for a long time yet—to get jobs. Work for the dole is no solution in this situation. You have got to be prepared to actually get out there and create through carefully crafted public spending jobs that do, in fact, meet community needs, through environmental measures and community service measures of this  kind can provide rewarding and fulfilling job experiences and can provide, hopefully, some experience and training that will make people more job ready for the future but nonetheless just meet that need of keeping people in work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You need to address every single one of those things to get it right about jobs. How many of those issues, how many of those five themes, were addressed in this budget last night, in anything this government has had to
         <break page="3548" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          do? Answer: none of them. The government has misconceived the nature of the task, misconceived the nature of its policy responsibility—abandoned its policy responsibility—on every one of those fronts.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far as growth is concerned for a start, beginning at the beginning—I have about one minute on each of them—this is not a growth oriented budget any more than was last year's budget. The forecast is for 3¾ per cent. That is less than what the growth needs to be—must be—if we are going to make a significant inroad on unemployment by generating a higher level of demand in this country. We are perfectly capable of generating four&amp;hyphen;plus per cent growth. We did it for our last three years in office, and a good deal of the period before that as well, and we saw unemployment coming down as a result—from 11 per cent to 8&amp;half; per cent—over that period.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You have to go out there and have deliberate strategies, however—both budgetary and interest rate strategies—to achieve that result. It does not just happen, and it certainly does not happen if your whole approach to budgeting is contractionary, if you are obsessed with the balance and surplus bottom lines, if you do not understand the dynamics that are at work in the economy, and if you are simply not interested in generating the growth that the economy is capable of delivering.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course that growth has to be sustainable. You have to have regard to the inflation constraint. You have to have regard to the current account constraint. But, on all the knowledge we have about the way the economy is structured at the moment, the way it is working, those constraints are not applicable in such a way as to inhibit growth moving along at much better than four per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has no confidence, obviously, that it is capable of generating that level of growth. Certainly, the figures that it is using about the unemployment that will flow from the growth that it is predicting are simply themselves hardly believable. But they are not very satisfactory figures at that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The trade point needs to be made very quickly. You do have to have active strategies if you are going to harness the Australian
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          economy to the external one. That does not just happen. You have to have good, sensible trade policy and good, sensible foreign policy—God help us—and you have to have trade promotion strategies which are designed, again, to make those linkages. What have we seen in the last budget and this one? We have seen the decimation of the capacity of Austrade to do the job that everyone knows it can. We have seen the decimation of EMDG and ITES and a whole variety of trade promotion support mechanisms and budgetary mechanisms that were crucial for us making that connection.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the things tucked away in this budget, which frankly just appals me, is that we have seen the demise of NTIOC—the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference. Started three or four years ago, it has become Australia's most successful window on the trading world—literally thousands of delegates, a huge event in Melbourne each year. Now, for want of $1.3 million worth of government subsidy, it has been abandoned on the never-never promise that maybe it will be picked up the following year by some private company if there is a buck to be made from it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Industry and regional development policy—it speaks for itself. This is a government which has just created a barren vacuum so far as that is concerned. It does not understand the necessity for having targeted strategies. It is not business welfare, it is national welfare—as Heather Ridout from the MTIA was saying the other day—to have sensible research and development strategies. It is not business welfare, it is national welfare, to have carefully crafted subsidies and strategies that are designed for particular industry sectors inherently affected and for particular struggling regions—like South Australia, like Tasmania and like Newcastle—to have that support which enables us to make a difference.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have seen what has happened with education, training and labour market programs. They were decimated last year and have remained decimated. They have not been picked up in any rational or sensible way by further measures in this budget. If anything,
         <break page="3549" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          things have gone backward with a further cut in vocational training and, overall, a reduction in support in those sectors. As for job creation, all we have got is the whiteboard federation plan looming its scurrilous scam-like head so far as the future—18 months out before the election—is concerned, plus the work for the dole, which is not going to produce the kind of training experience or work experience that will make any difference to anyone.

          —What a pathetic attempt! The matter of public importance itself relates not just to job creation but also to financial security for retirees. There was not one word from the spokesman on behalf of the Labor Party, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), on the question of financial security for retirees. The reality is that financial security for retirees was a focal point in last night's budget. The honourable member from the Labor Party had every understanding of that and refused to address it because there was nothing to say other than to congratulate the government on the manner in which it has brought forward a number of initiatives that will give that security to so many people in our community.

         The Labor Party cannot and will not ever be able to stand up with any credibility on the question of employment. We heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in question time today assert the fact that, in the last year of Labor, 57,000 jobs were created. Let me take the House through the last five years of Labor. The last five years of Labor saw a net increase in full&amp;hyphen;time employment in this country of 7,100 jobs. It started in the early 1990s when, of course, the recession we had to have destroyed over 300,000 jobs in this country. That recession we had to have was as a result of a major contribution from the then Labor government to the economic policies governing this nation.

What was the unemployment figure in December 1993, two years after the current Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to do something about jobs, to reduce unemployment in this nation? The unemployment figure in December 1993 was 10.6 per cent. Over two years under the stewardship of the now Leader of the Opposition, unemployment increased by 0.2 per cent from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent.

         To turn around that very important problem, which is very much in our focus, very much to the forefront of the policies which we have instituted, this government has put the conditions, the foundations, the ingredients in place. The ingredients are, firstly, to stop the waste that we saw under Labor, to stop the increasing burden of debt, to stop spending what we do not have. We have already seen a $12 billion turnaround in terms of the management of the Commonwealth's finances in the context of three budgets—last year's, this year's and leading to next year's.

         That in itself has an impact downwards on inflation. That in itself has an impact downwards on interest rates.

         We heard today in the House a whole lot of posturing on the question of what it means. Let me say just one thing in terms of what it means: for anybody who gets any deduction in terms of their savings—if it is as little as $1, if it is as little as $100 or if it is as much as $450—it is all a hell of a lot more than they were ever going to get under Labor's policies because Labor never had an initiative to encourage savings in respect of the public generally. They certainly did nothing to make a contribution towards national savings on the basis of the debt and deficit programs which they went into year after year.

          and a sham. It is a rip&amp;hyphen;off because all wage and salary earners and many self&amp;hyphen;employed people will now be deprived of the hundreds of dollars per year they would have received from Labor's savings scheme which this government promised to introduce in the election campaign  but has now scrapped. It is a sham because, whilst it masquerades as a boost to savings, the real story is that, unlike Labor's savings scheme, it will reduce national savings.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me go to the rip&amp;hyphen;off point. In the 1995 budget everyone will remember that Labor promised to introduce a savings scheme funded from the second leg of the tax cuts, which would require all employees to contribute three per cent out of their after tax pay into superannuation and there would be a matching co&amp;hyphen;contribution from the government, dollar for dollar, up to $1,000, or three per cent of average weekly earnings at that time. It was subject to an income test, which would phase it out at twice average weekly earnings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the election campaign the coalition promised to introduce that savings scheme if they were elected. Let there be no walking away from that. Page i of the `Federal coalition's superannuation and retirement incomes policy' says:

         It is absolutely clear. They talked about reserving the right to vary the mechanism, but the commitment to meet the co&amp;hyphen;contribution in full was made, and made several times. It was a promise they made to the Australian people. It is a $4 billion promise, which they walked away from last night. It was a $4 billion promise which they pulled the plug on. Most wage and salary earners and many self&amp;hyphen;employed who would have benefited from Labor's scheme are big losers as a result.

It is extraordinary that they can pretend they never made this promise and try to walk away from it and say, `Hey, you're a big winner here; there's a beaut scheme here for you.' The fact is that these people—millions and millions of Australians—are losers as a result of this action by the government last night.

         It is important to note that to get the $450 rebate that is all over the press, you have to have $3,000 of superannuation contributions or investment income of $3,000. It is only those who have substantially high incomes and that level of superannuation contribution or that level of investment income who are going to benefit. Someone on $100,000 a year would get a $450 rebate on their $3,000 superannuation contribution under the Howard&amp;hyphen;Costello scheme. Under us they would have got nothing because they would have been means tested out of it. Our scheme was designed to help the low and middle income earners, not the well off. The Howard&amp;hyphen;Costello scheme is the reverse. It is all about helping the well off. Only reasonably well off people are likely to have $3,000 a year in investment income, as I have said.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         People with little or no savings, such as low income earners, low income families especially, pensioners and the unemployed will receive little or no benefit from this scheme because they have little or no savings on which to receive the investment income.

It is a rip&amp;hyphen;off from low and middle income earners in this country, not the rich, who are the beneficiaries of this. They are benefiting while everyone else is suffering. That is what this scheme is all about.

          them of several hundred dollars a year without a word of apology. No&amp;hyphen;one has said, `Gee, we're sorry we can't afford this;' they just pretend they never made the promise and try to tell them that there are some goodies here for them. They should be apologising abjectly for their total breach of promise and failure to deliver. It is not just to deliver in terms of the individuals in Australia; it is delivering for the nation. As I said, this is a sham of the first order. But the failure to deliver to the people and then refuse to apologise and try to deceive them shows that this is a government which has no shame.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to the sham aspect, let me say that their savings scheme does not increase national savings, contrary to the claims made by the government. Labor's scheme, as shown by the Treasury retirement income modelling task force calculations, would have boosted national savings by 1.4 per cent of GDP by 2005 and over two per cent of GDP by 2020. This was on top of the boost that came from the superannuation guarantee scheme, which would have given us another two per cent. We would have increased superannuation savings by 10 times, to $2 trillion by the year 2020.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         According to Treasury, our scheme would have provided a major boost to national savings, but the additional saving of two per cent of GDP from Labor's SCG scheme has now been lost. Instead, we have a scheme that is likely to reduce savings because, firstly, the money spent on the tax scheme is a loss to national savings. The tax rebate reduces national savings, and the money paid out as a tax rebate will be largely spent because it is paid to people to spend as they like. Most of them will probably save a little of it but they will spend most of it, whereas all of Labor's payment with the co-contribution went into savings. There was no leakage to consumption. It was totally saved. This is a dramatic difference between the two.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, because of the way this scheme is designed, the inducement effect for increased savings is likely to be very small because the scheme is not targeted in any way at rewarding additional saving. Instead, it will reward current savers, who will receive a
         <break page="3554" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          bonus for doing what they were already doing without the bonus. Thus, private pension recipients, shareholders with dividend income, landlords with rental income, investors in interest bearing deposits, investors making capital gains and partners in business will all be eligible for this bonus for doing what they were already doing. Where is the boost to savings? Many of them will fully utilise this with their current entitlements.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For many of them there is no incentive to undertake any further savings because they have the maximum investment income they can get from what they are already doing. So why would they bother making any more savings because of this? It will not give them anything. In fact, people could even reduce savings and receive the benefit, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out in question time. So this measure is little incentive to increase savings. In essence, it is just a handout to those already saving.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, the scheme does not require people to hold their savings for any length of time. They can get the rebate one year and then spend it the next, which is just ridiculous. In other countries where these sorts of schemes have been introduced there is usually a holding time requirement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My time is running out, but let me say simply: this scheme does not have the approval of Treasury. The mark of that is all over it. Treasury reported in its economic round-up in 1995 that the OECD found that such schemes do not improve savings. Of course, this contains no figures from the retirement income modelling task force showing what the boost to savings will be. Do you know why that is not there? Because there will be no savings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So much for the charter of budget honesty. When the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said that this savings scheme would knock your socks off, he was misreported. What he really said was: `This'll knock you suckers off.' And in saying that he was 100 per cent right.

           before have I heard such a pathetic attempt to demolish the coalition's budget. I would like to echo the words of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey): the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) did not even address half of the matter of public importance—pensioners. Obviously pensioners rated very little in the scheme of things when his party was in government and they rate very little now. For the 13 years that Labor was in government, they failed to look after their core constituency and they created for this country high levels of unemployment and huge levels of debt, which threatened not only the battlers but also the security of pensioners. I suppose what logically follows is that because they failed they expect us to fail. Quite frankly, we will not.

         I do not know why those opposite even put this matter of public importance up for discussion—I suppose it deserves a response seeing it has been listed for today—but I would like to examine two aspects of what they have put before us today. The first relates to the jobs issue. If we are going to create jobs we need, firstly, a climate in which the jobs rate can grow. I reiterate that in this budget there were no new taxes—no new income tax, no new sales tax, no new company tax and no increase in the fuel excise. We have reduced the deficit and, in so doing, removed pressure from interest rates. Clearly, this will encourage small business to create jobs.

         There is a savings initiative which will reduce the reliance on foreign debt, which in turn will form the basis for steady economic growth. We have the Federation Fund and the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, with a total of $2 billion between them. The focus of these funds is to create not only national pride, pride in our 100 years of government, but also pride in our heritage. But the heritage fund goes further. It goes into rivers, land restoration, various forms of foliage, micro-environments and the like. The opposition feels this money will be spent willy&amp;hyphen;nilly. Of course it will not. It will be spent in a structured way, and delivering these programs will in turn create jobs.

For example, we will spend $1.6 billion on labour market assistance in 1997-98 and, on the work for the dole scheme, $17 million—not to mention our small business package, the reforms to the delivery of employment services to the unemployed and the recently announced changes in IR reform.

The ALP under Keating drove us head&amp;hyphen;on into a recession that we had to have. It was the ALP government that destroyed 400,000 full-time jobs. Under Labor, unemployment rose to a massive 11.2 per cent in December 1992, its highest rate since the Depression in the 1930s. Under the ALP, for three years our unemployment rate was higher—note this—than 10 per cent and for 32 consecutive months it was higher than it was at the end of the war—32 consecutive months! You would think that in three budgets they would have been able to make a bit of an impact on that, wouldn't you?

         From June 1990 to the election of 1996, Labor created only 35,700 new full-time jobs. Under Labor the percentage of people in part-time work looking for full-time work or more hours rose from 19 per cent in 1983 to 26 per cent in 1996. In Labor's last five years of government, youth unemployment went to 27 per cent and at times touched 30 per cent. It is interesting to note that, under the previous coalition government, which experienced a lot of the same difficulties as the former Labor government, youth unemployment never rose above 17 or 18 per cent.

From December 1991 right through to the election, for 4¼ years, we had almost consistently, with one or two exceptions, 13 per cent unemployment. At times it went to 14, 15 and 16 per cent. For

         So today in the parliament they adulated themselves for their marvellous labour market programs—these programs that achieved so much for people! They were nothing more than a cruel hoax that recycled young people from one level of hopelessness through a period of Indian summer into another phase of hopelessness. Just have a listen to the cost per net impact of some of these programs: jobstart, $3,700-odd; job clubs, $6,100; skillshare, $3,800; jobtrain, $7,000; wait for this one, job skills, $76,500; and the doozey of them all, the much celebrated, the last desperate attempt of Labor to seal their place with the Australian public, the NWO program, the new work opportunities program, $143,000 per net impact. Just think how many jobs that could have created.

         If that was not enough, we even had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition going through this nonsense that somehow they had a marvellous regional package. Before I came into politics, I spent over 20 years in regional development and I know what regional development is about. If ever I saw a badly structured program, it was the REDO program. It was full of promise and delivered absolutely nothing. If you sat down, took out a pen and analysed what it was offering, you could see that it was really nothing more than a sham.

         Quite apart from the fact that it duplicated what in five of the six states was already present by way of local regional development boards that could have been quite easily funded by the government, what did they do? They provided $150 million over four years to 41 regions. Just work that out. Take $150 million, divide it by approximately 40 regions, divide it by the number of years, then take off a third—a massive third—for administration and then you can see that it was nothing more than a sham.

          —In speaking on this issue, I find myself once more having to take issue with both sides. I heard the Labor spokesman talking about the importance of their labour market programs. Quite frankly, they were greatly overstated. I was in the Labor Party caucus when Paul Keating said that the future lay in the service sector. The service sector is political code for tourism. It was from that point on that we stopped training metal trades apprentices. As a consequence, you cannot get a boilermaker now in Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Port Hedland, Gladstone or anywhere where there is any development required, because we stopped training them. Australia, the country that used to provide arguably the best metal trades apprentices in the world, now produces drink waiters.

         It also needs to be made clear that while you have 8.7 per cent unemployment, and that is an artificially low figure, there will be a continual erosion of wages and conditions, and there is nothing government or the unions can do about it. I think the opposition are right when they say that there needs to be transitional job creation programs. But they are wrong when they say that work for the dole cannot work. If it is properly structured, work for the dole can be very useful. But I fail to see any reason to believe that the government understand this. If there is going to be work for the dole, it would clearly be

         If you are going to do transitional job creation, it is quite clear that roads are a big priority.

Roads built in the city can only cost—and that is a point that seems to be not understood by either party. The best welfare is a job—a good, worthwhile, credible job. There seems to be no evidence that this is on the minds of either party.

         It is true: there are people in the opposition who believe that a deregulated labour market is the answer. A deregulated labour market can take us down the American road. I have been there and I have seen it. In 1973, the Americans declared class war on their own people and now they have 20 per cent of those people in gaol. They are incarcerating people at a rate 10 times that of Europe and about four to five times that of Australia. They are using gaol as a remedy for unemployment, and building gaols is one of the growth industries in America. You see areas of very low wages. You see areas where illegal immigrants are being employed at very low prices—being exploited. That is the America of today. It is not a pretty picture. It is certainly not something which we would want in Australia.

         In the budget, there was a clear absence of an industry policy. But there is no sign either that the Labor Party see a need for an industry policy. They mouth the jargon. In the debate today I heard talk about small business being the powerhouse of job creation. What a fine platitude and how well the government and the opposition like to mouth it. The truth is I do not believe there is any real understanding of the problems of small business and I do not believe that the government come anywhere near in addressing their needs

         There has to be an industry policy. And this does not mean just blind re-introduction of tariffs, although I do not resile from tariffs under some circumstances. There are lots of other things governments can do. One is to change the government's purchasing policy—foolishly changed by a Labor government—to capital cost. The real criterion should be through live cost. If through live cost is the criterion, Australian products shine.

         Let me just give you a few examples relating to a town on the east coast of Australia—Sydney. In Sydney, you have probably the last integrated truck manufacturer in Australia—RFW. RFW were consulted by the Australian Army for the purchase of 55 recovery vehicles. RFW have got a lot of expertise in this area. They are probably the premier constructors in the world of large off-road four-wheel drive vehicles. The army opted for Mercedes-Benz. Each one of these units creates between 2,000 and 2,500 hours of work—in round figures, 137,000 hours of work per year or 34,000 weeks of work. What is the cost of giving that to Germany? They ended up buying from Mercedes-Benz an overgrown Unimog six by six. Given the enormous trouble that we have had with the Unimog vehicles, the need for recovery vehicles is in part to recover the damn things.

         Another example of the stupidity you have to deal with is that the army bought Mack trucks because the American army bought Mack trucks. The Americans have much better roads than we do in a lot of our country, where our trucks do not run on bitumen. The trucks were so rough the army could not carry troops in them for any distance. They did this for occupational health reasons. They decided that they would have to change the suspension. Australia invented air suspension. It was invented by Permatrak in Sydney and they offered to re-equip all the army Macks with the Permatrak suspension—the one commercially chosen not only in Australia but throughout the world—for $16,000 a pop. The army signed the contract with the Americans at $22,000.

          It is true that RFW did not tender. They just said, `Take away your 12 inches of tender documents. This is the price. You know it works commercially. Every truck in Australia is running on these things. You know it's a superior product. Our price is this. See if you can better it.' The army signed the contract at $22,000, and the trucks are still unrideable. That is what you are dealing with. And no government seems to have the will, the wit or the wisdom to take on these facts.

          Let us look at another example—a qango—Qantas. Qantas purchased 30 RFWs. Remember, when I am talking about this one little company in Sydney, I am only talking about their construction hours, not about the hours of the people supplying the castings, the electrical or the other components—just their own construction hours. One can undoubtedly add substantially to that figure. Qantas bought 30 of these catering vehicles and they were well satisfied with them. They get a consultant, however, who, for whatever reason, decides that he will buy on price, so he sources the next supply of vehicles—over 100 of them—from Sweden.

          The first Volvo that came from Sweden fell to pieces. But Qantas will still persevere and buy 100 of these things from Sweden when it could have got a superior vehicle from Australia.

There is nothing you can't do. You have these enormous facilities—a government aircraft factory that is the best in the world.'

         I want to explain that the Senate amendment No. (3) allows members of unfunded defined benefit funds to pay the surcharge liability as it accrues rather than when the benefit is paid. What this means is that members of unfunded defined benefit schemes are treated in the same manner as other superannuation funds where members can make additional contributions to cover the amount of the surcharge.

          an employee's employment is terminated because of bona fide redundancy or under an approved early retirement scheme or because of invalidity.

         The government will be agreeing to those amendments, but let me make it quite clear that the government maintains that the surcharge measure was all about reducing the tax concessionality in superannuation. High income earners gained large tax benefits from the concessional tax treatment of superannuation. The surcharge is not about raising taxes. Even after the surcharge, superannuation continues to receive concessional treatment. The Senate is quite clearly grandstanding and playing for cheap political points by relying on the surcharge and asserting that it is a tax. The government does not accept that the surcharge is a tax. The government does not accept in any way that it has broken any election commitments on new taxes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the government does want to get this package of legislation through the House because these bills are now two budgets old. To avoid further obstruction from the Senate over these bills, particularly from the opposition, we will accept the amendments. Despite the claims of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to be supportive of the surcharge, the Labor senators in the upper house defied their leader and voted against the bills in the Senate. Labor senators evidently took the statesman's view that, as the surcharge affected them, the surcharge could not possibly be in the public interest. Let the responsibility for this action in the upper house be squarely on the opposition and minor parties if there are any unforeseen consequences from the amendments to this bill.

         Equally, of course, I cannot imagine how the minister or his government has the gall to continue the line that a surcharge is not a tax. Look up your thesaurus. `Surcharge' is a synonym for `tax'. If you want to play around with the language, you are free to do so of course, but it really is very childish. Why that charade has been perpetuated I cannot understand. Even the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), is embarrassed about it because he knows it to be childish and just an attempt to avoid the use of the correct adjective to describe what the government was proposing to do.

         I guess after several months of perfecting the art of tax avoidance—the coalition, that is, avoiding calling a tax a tax—the government has finally conceded that its 15 per cent superannuation surcharge is indeed a tax. That is despite the words of the minister who spoke to the motion before the chair.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In agreeing to replace the word `surcharge' with the synonym `tax', the government is also clearly coming clean to having broken one of its 1996 election promises of no new taxes, as it did indeed with its selective Medicare impost. Why pretend? You have broken a few promises and we understand why you had to do that, but to go through with this pretence is a little bit irksome and I do not think it brings any credit upon the government.

         The amendments to clause 5 of the original bill will mean minor changes to the way in which the superannuation tax will be applied to funds for which no tax file number, TFN, is provided to the fund manager. The government initially intended for the full 15 per cent impost to be levied against any superannuation account if the account holder failed to provide the TFN. The general consensus amongst the taxation fraternity and fund managers was that that was quite unreasonable.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Senate amendments will have the following effect. If a TFN is not provided, if an individual's superannuation contribution does not exceed the contributions threshold of $2,000 and if the contributions began to be paid before 7 May 1997, then the account will not be subject to the new tax for that year. However, if the TFN is provided at a later date, these contributions will be reassessed and subject to the additional impost. If the contributions amount does not exceed the threshold limit, and if the account holder commenced payments prior to 7 May 1997, then the full 15 per cent tax rate will be levied against the contributions for that year.

          The Senate nominated 7 May as the date of effect, as it was the date on which the amendments were first canvassed. The clear intention was to discourage taxpayers from opening multiple small superannuation accounts in order to avoid paying the new tax. The amendments to clause 5 of the principal act will see little change to the cumbersome procedure that the Commissioner of Taxation is obliged to follow in obtaining TFNs.
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          The commissioner will be accountable for ensuring that every fund contributor who fails to provide their TFN receives two letters advising them of their compliance obligation. According to the legislation as now proposed, the commissioner is to determine `the most appropriate' address for each fund member. This is absurd. The commissioner earlier described the super tax as an `administrative nightmare'. I am quoting the commissioner. It is even more nightmarish after the inclusion of these Senate amendments.

          How can anyone argue that this amendment meets the criteria of simplicity and efficiency, which are two of the three measures of a reasonable tax? Quite simply, it does not. Even the revenue that it is reckoned will be raised by these measures cannot justify the principal measure because it involves bad, bad, bad, bad law—it is bad law.

The amendments to clause 5 are also of consequence for those in clauses 16 and 19. Clause 16 in the original bill describes the various alternatives for reducing the surcharge debt available to fund members. It also indicates the procedures that the fund provider must follow if a member does opt to make payments to reduce the deferred amount in the surcharge debit account.

          Consistent with the words of the Commissioner of Taxation, this procedure is unmanageable and is likely to—in fact almost definitely will—increase compliance costs for fund managers. So you have the additional cost of collection because of these amendments on top of already horrendous collection costs and you have equally untenable compliance costs by the fund managers. Nothing in these amendments is going to change that and in fact will exacerbate that state of affairs. In all likelihood these increased costs will eventually be passed on to those fund members who are liable to pay this new tax, as well as every other Australian taxpayer who contributes to a superannuation account. Despite the justification for some of these amendments in the Senate, that will be the case.

The coalition has remained true to form and follows the example of its Labor predecessor by introducing, in last night's 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget, another raft of changes to the way in which superannuation will operate.

They are worth while; the government has accepted them. However, all they really do is make a very unsavoury tax slightly more palatable.

It is like the problem we confronted in this House with the workplace relations bill: the amendments in the Senate improved the bill but left it so profoundly inadequate in key ways that we could not support the motion. We find that again here. As it relates to superannuation, these amendments and the bill as a result of these amendments make absolutely clear—and, once again, the member for Curtin was correct about this—that this government has no fundamental understanding of superannuation at all.

That is just not true. In other circumstances one might have thought the Treasurer was seeking to mislead the House. But I am absolutely sure he was not; I am sure he just did not have a clue what he was talking about. And he is the minister responsible for superannuation. He just got it wrong.

The member for Curtin gave one reason that explained simply why it is a tax in terms of the nomenclature but, by any definition, a tax is a law that says, `Some money that otherwise is in your pocket has to go into the government's pocket.' That is what this is. Pass the law and the money transfers from you to the government, not in return for a particular service for which you are paying a fee but as a compulsory acquisition to the consolidated revenue fund.

I have one from a firm in my electorate which points out that just to communicate with the 15.7 million individual superannuation accounts is going to cost $30 million. It has also been estimated that the cost to the superannuation funds will be $100 million a year. They say that, while the government hopes to raise $450 million in revenue, it is going to be nowhere near that as a result of these administrative complexities which started because the government wanted to pull a swiftie.

That is precisely and only what the government have in mind. They are fundamentalists saying, `If you have a small government, if you retreat and retract from involvement in industry, by some miraculous process of conception the economy is going to lift off.'

         Many of those workers, particularly if they are in their 40s and beyond, have virtually my hope and Buckley's of getting another job—this is the only chance they have to provide some sort of stability for their family, to pay off the mortgage a little to get ahead so the family is not destitute as a result of the trauma of having their jobs obliterated. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) still has not answered whether they are going to have to pay for employment assistance or whether they are going to be entitled to free service from the Commonwealth Employment Service to help them find another job. He did not know and he still does not know. He still has not answered that.

         There are all kinds of ridiculous things in this bill. For instance, we are trying to avoid a situation where, if a worker has not provided his tax file number, the Commissioner of Taxation has to write him two letters—the second letter has to be within three months of the first letter. It does not say what happens if it is three months and one day after the date of the first letter—presumably the process would have to start again or any tax collected would be invalid.

         As the member for Hotham said, while there is some advance in excluding eligible termination payments, that phrase itself has a lot of complexities. It certainly does not include accumulated long service leave, annual leave and sick leave. While that is being included in a retrenched worker's termination pay for the purpose of assessing this tax, there is no way that the Labor Party would support a bill such as this.

          —I am very pleased to speak on the Senate amendments to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997. I am told that Ben Chifley had a saying that if something looked like a duck, walked like a duck and was generally seen in the company of ducks, it was fair to assume it was a duck—and so it is with this superannuation contribution surcharge. The Senate has insisted that this surcharge is a tax. It is something that we in the opposition have said all along. The government has insisted that this is not a tax but a surcharge. If you wanted to strike the middle course, you could probably say it is a tax surcharge. The bill will now be a tax. Unequivocally, the surcharge is now defined within the bill as being a tax.

         It is very interesting to note that when the government said, `You ought to be in favour of this surcharge because it is really hitting those people better able to pay,' we said, `No, you've got to be careful because, as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and a number of other speakers have mentioned, the sacked steelworkers in Newcastle will be caught up in this legislation,' the government ignored it. As the member for Hunter said, even when he pleaded with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time to have some compassion for these workers, saying, `There has been such a massive loss of work in one city; try to see if we cannot make some exemption for them,' the answer was no.

         I want to make the point that the government argue that they are really trying to target the top end of town. We have said that the top end of town is not being targeted; they are hitting ordinary people. When they bring in their great savings scheme, where is the targeting in that? The Prime Minister gets up and says, `I'm a big man; I'm not going to

You will recall that this was the pay-off to the banking industry by the government. Today in question time, talking about superannuation, the Treasurer said, `Oh, you're opposed to competition in superannuation.' Ironically, this element that is supposed to introduce competition in superannuation is guaranteed by the government—in the minister's second reading speech and every other speech—to give workers lower superannuation returns.

          —This is a government that claims to want to encourage savings, and made a big showpiece of that in last night's budget, yet the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997 which is before the House actually discourages savings. This is a measure which taxes savings and drives people out of superannuation. It is not a superannuation policy because this government is trying to discourage people taking out superannuation.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government introduced in last night's budget a so-called savings measure, but it is a benefit for the rich and a paltry amount, if anything at all, for the very poor in our community. Why is that? Because to get the benefit, you have to save. We all know that the vast majority of low income earners spend everything that they earn, through whatever means. They cannot save and, therefore, they cannot get this benefit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very interesting that even for those who would have gone into superannuation, people on average weekly earnings paying the equivalent of $1,000 a year into superannuation would have, under Labor's previous policy, got matched dollar for dollar every one of those $1,000 put into superannuation. This was a promise this government said it would keep, but ratted on the Australian population last night. It has not kept it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now a person who puts $1,000 into superannuation only gets $150. That is a $850 slug—$850 taken away from the battlers of this country. Yet the people at the top end of town, including the Kerry Packers and politicians, get the maximum of $450. That is the reason this savings measure introduced in the budget last night costs $2 billion when fully
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          implemented versus their previous commitment to honour and match the co-payment. That would have cost them $4 billion. It is still going to cost $2 billion, but the weight of benefit will go to the top end of town. The people at the lower end of the scale get nothing or a very minimal amount.

         Today in question time the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tried to go through his theatrics—Mr Smug playing to the gallery and to the televisions, saying, `When in all of Labor's 13 years did it do anything to encourage savings?' The answer to that question is that we did it consistently over our 13 years. We made a commitment to lift national superannuation in this country from zero—because there were very few wage earners in this country in superannuation—to 15 per cent by the turn of this century.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we left office, that target was between nine and 12 per cent—nine per cent for everyone; 12 per cent for those who had started to make their three per cent contribution. Our promise was, for all those making the three per cent contribution, we would match it. That is how we would have got to the 15 per cent. But the fact of the matter is the decision that was taken last night stops that dead in its tracks. It means that no-one will put in more than the nine per cent. It means that the move to superannuation and therefore genuine long-term savings in this country has stopped dead in its tracks. Treasury has said we will get a greater lift in national savings through Labor's superannuation plan than any tax concessions on saving.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality now is the government will knock off up to six per cent of the target of our strategy. The further reality is this nation will be stuck with a nine per cent contribution to superannuation until Labor is returned to power. This is not a government committed to encouraging genuine superannuation; this is a government committed to only the top end of town. It is not a government with a commitment to or compassion for the battlers. The piece of legislation before us is just another demonstration of that. For that reason we will oppose it and we will persist with our superannuation strategy, which was the right strategy.

         For the first time in this place I have encountered a bill that encompasses every single thing that is bad and wrong about those opposite. It encompasses stealth, dishonesty and a failure to recognise its own mistakes. For that reason, for me this bill is something unique—and, I would suggest, it is unique for others who have served much longer in this place. It is a blatant repudiation of a cast&amp;hyphen;iron pre-election promise that no new taxes would be introduced. An unequivocal election promise put many times by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in a read my lips fashion, was that he would not introduce any new tax.

Contrary to government rhetoric, our proposals and amendments would not have burdened small business with masses of paperwork. Small business already has to report the date and amount of contributions for each and every employee as a result of government changes to the averaging of superannuation contributions in the 1996-97 budget. That rhetoric is clearly spurious and goes out the window.

Furthermore, the government's complete and utter lack of commitment to national savings borne out by this proposal makes its national savings objective pale into insignificance compared with our commitment to this worthy objective. What message does this bill send to individuals who are doing the right thing and saving for their retirement or to, more particularly, those individuals whom we are trying to encourage to save and take their superannuation as a pension? This government will tax them at a phenomenal level.

         In the couple of minutes available to me today, I want to draw attention to some of those impacts of this legislation which the government has ignored and which many people who are going to bear the brunt of these changes are sadly not yet familiar with. In the defence forces there are a number of people who receive not simply the base salary but a range of allowances in addition to that base salary. Indeed, most members in the services would receive some additional allowance, whether it be for the period of time they are on exercises and camping or because of the nature of the unit to which they are attached. For example, those that are involved in parachute units would receive about $1,600 a year on top of whatever other benefits they may get on top of whatever other allowances they may get. Those payments that those defence personnel receive do not contribute to their superannuation benefit at the end of their service. They are not used in calculating the superannuation benefit.

        <para first-indent="16">
         However, under the government's legislation, you will count that income for the purposes of determining whether or not they have gone over the threshold and will have to bear the brunt of your superannuation surcharge tax. So they get no superannuation benefit from that income, but they get the penalty you are imposing on them in this legislation. But, worse than that, in an act of absolute personnel management lunacy, your government is out there at the moment trying to retain highly skilled people—particularly in the air force, in areas such as key pilot positions and air traffic controllers—offering them a retention bonus, offering them $20,000 or $40,000 to sign up for another period of time because we need their skills. And we do need their skills.

          their superannuation. Put that in the brochure you send them and see how many of them want to take up the offer.

They cannot believe it. They cannot believe the government, their employer, would be so stupid and so underhanded to say to them, `You are so valuable that we want you to stay in the service,' and at the same time strip away from them, without telling them, the superannuation benefits they are going to get at the end of the day because you are going to slug them with this new tax.

They are willing to give a commitment to you and this nation to serve for another five years or seven years. In return for giving you that commitment, you are going to slug them with another tax. The worst part about this is that we moved an amendment in the Senate to fix this problem and you defeated it. You consciously defeated it so that they would be slugged with that tax.

As the Western Australia Liberal finance minister, Mr Evans, said, there must be some very adverse comments in that report. But it is going to stay a secret document in this open government!

There is the fact that there is a proposal for advance payment—just a revenue grab; nothing to do with any of the merits in this. Many of the people adversely affected by this legislation who are not its target will in fact be slugged with a 22.5 per cent tax in the first year. There is the threshold issue which we have spoken about. There are the changes to the adjustable taxable income definition which I have spoken about.

So, unfortunately, I think those people are going to be hit. We have got some serious problems still about what happens with some of the defined benefit schemes and the amendments we moved, which would have ensured that they were affected only as intended, to the maximum of 15 per cent; but that is not going to be caught up either.

          everybody acknowledges—even the advocates of the legislation—that some people are going to get caught up, at least temporarily, having to pay. Then ultimately they will get their money back. But they are not going to get any interest on the money. So that is an effective tax. They will lose the use of their money—we are not quite sure for how long; up to a year, perhaps—and they will not get any interest on that money; the government will. So they are paying a tax when everybody knows they are not eligible. Even after they prove they are not liable, they will not get back the full value of the money that has been taken from them.

         That money should have been in the superannuation fund of those workers for a year. This government is taking it, using it for a year and not recognising the loss of interest. There is no argument that it is a severe penalty on people who are not eligible. It is imposed on them after they have proved they are not liable. This is a very unfair measure.

         There is a question of principle: the actuarial guidelines will determine the formula which will determine the tax liability of many hundreds of thousands of Australians, but will not be a disallowable instrument in the parliament. In a democracy, only the parliament should set the circumstances in which the citizen has obligations to pay money to the state. Even if you accept that everything else about the bill is right, how can you justify saying that the guidelines that affect the tax liability of Australians are not subject to review by the parliament? This is unique and wrong. Senator Harradine spoke eloquently about it in the Senate, and he was right: it does not cost you a cracker.

         This is not a question of whether you get your revenue or not. It is a question of whether you act with principle in the way in which citizens' tax obligations are determined. Is the parliament the final arbiter of the citizens' obligation to the state? I always thought the answer was yes. If we pass this motion today, for the first time, the answer will be no.

         The Senate's requested amendments Nos (3) and (4) to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 require the Commissioner of Taxation to take all reasonable steps to obtain a member's tax file number before imposing the surcharge where a member has failed to quote a tax file number and their surchargeable contributions are below $2,000. Further, existing members of superannuation funds at 7 May 1997 with contributions under $2,000 have a nil rate of surcharge imposed, even if they fail to quote their tax file number. Members who join a fund on or after 7 May 1997 will have the surcharge imposed at 15 per cent but are entitled to an amendment if they subsequently quote their tax file number. This supports the policy that low or middle income earners do not need to pay the surcharge.

           Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), I am going to speak on the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and it will be the opposition's comments on all the subsequent bills that will come before us. I will not be getting up and speaking on any of the others because, in effect, we had the debate on all the bills in the debate on the first bill. We all appreciated the tolerance of the chair in allowing us to range across all the bills. I am sure that that tolerance will speed up the overall process, even though it lengthened the consideration of the first bill slightly. So this will be the only other contribution we will make and we will not be dividing any further.

         The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), with whom I have discussed this, I know would have welcomed the opportunity, having voted with the government on those amendments, to actually vote against the bill because, although he supported the amendments, as we did, in so far as they moderately improved the bill, they did not leave the bill as adequate to reflect his concerns, but there is no procedural device available for that to occur.

         We want to make clear that our views on these subsequent bills are the same in principle as those to the first bill, that is, while we accept that the amendments improve the bill, they still leave all the bills inequitable and unjust. This bill in particular attempts very inadequately to address the fundamental question that we raised in the Senate in respect of our amendments that would have effectively excluded low to middle income employees from paying the surcharge. This attempt creates a very artificial distinction between prior to 7 May and post 7 May 1997 accounts and lots of middle to low income earners are going to be caught. It seems to me to be an exceedingly complex and entirely unfair arrangement.

         What you have is people in the same circumstances paying different rates of tax. That is not a good principle. In fact, it breaches all the fundamentally sound tax principles that I have dealt with in debating tax bills in the parliament over the last decade or so. We accept that that is the majority view of both houses and we will not take the time of the

         It is a source of serious concern to us. We will continue to talk about it in the community, we will continue to make clear in Newcastle, we will continue to make clear in Geelong and in all the regional cities being hit by the redundancies that are going to flow from the decisions made in the last budget that those workers are going to be affected by these bills. In discussion with the workers throughout the country, we will make it clear that many of them will be unfairly and unreasonably affected by what we hope is the unintended consequences of these bills and affected by what the government declares are the unintended consequences of these bills. I would hate to think that they were actually a deliberate misleading of the people.

         Nevertheless, the outcome is that people who were told that this legislation would not affect them will pay the cost and many of the people who are its target will not. This is a failed attempt to implement a principle that we could have supported. We will vote against all these bills because the amendments do not solve our core problems, but we will not be speaking on any of the others and we will not be dividing any further.

         This bill has returned to the House with Senate amendments. Amendment No. 3 ensures that the surcharge does not apply to termination payments made by an employer that include an eligible termination payment made from an employee share acquisition scheme. This achieves a commitment by the government to leave the status of these payments unchanged and removes concerns that the surcharge may have retrospective application to amounts accumulated in employee share acquisition schemes prior to 20 August 1996. The government accepts that Senate amendment.

         On behalf of the government, I would like to thank those on the other side of this House who I understand wished to speak on this bill for their contributions to the amendments that have come back from the upper house and also for their consideration to make sure that these bills do go through the parliament tonight, as they are already two budgets old.

         The Senate amendment to clause 38 in relation to this bill clarifies the policy objective of the regulation&amp;hyphen;making power which enables regulations to be made about RSA fees and charges; that is, the amendment will ensure that the power to regulate retirement savings accounts, fees and charges is for the purpose of ensuring that the objective of a low cost product is met. The amendment was supported by the government because it is
         <break page="3581" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          consistent with the government's overall policy intention for retirement savings accounts, which is to provide a simple, low cost, convenient product that complements existing superannuation arrangements.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The further amendments that the Senate made to this bill inserted a new clause, clause 51A, and amended clauses 52 and 55 to ensure employees are given a choice before they are signed up to retirement savings accounts by employers. So, before an employer signs up an employee to a retirement savings account, they must give him or her application forms for four different superannuation vehicles: namely, the retirement savings account, the retirement savings account with an institution that is accepting the employee's salary, an industry based superannuation fund that the employee is eligible to join and, finally, another regulated superannuation fund.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For new employees, the employer will be able to open a retirement savings account for the employee where that employee positively opts for the retirement savings account within 28 days or fails to make any choice within that period. For existing employees—that is, those in respect of whom the employer is already making contributions to a fund—the employer will only be able to open a retirement savings account where the employee positively opts for the retirement savings account within 28 days. Further, if the employee is silent, the employer must continue to contribute to the employee's existing fund. The government supports this amendment because it is broadly consistent with our policy of promoting greater member choice of fund and competition in the superannuation industry.

The government supports this amendment because it will prevent retirement savings account

         The Senate has removed the due diligence defence for retirement savings account providers who are subject to civil action for false or misleading conduct. This was set out in clause 168 of the bill, which relates to relief from civil liability. The due diligence defence provides a shield against civil liability where the false and misleading statement is due to such causes as a reasonable mistake or reasonable reliance on information supplied by another person. In effect, this provides a shield against innocent mistakes where due diligence was exercised to avoid the contravention. Similar defences are commonly used in other legislation, such as the Corporations Law and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government supports the amendment as a means of securing passage of the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill and meeting its election promise. However, government support for this amendment should not be taken as general support for the removal of due diligence defences from conduct and disclosure requirements in the financial sector.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government notes that the final report of the financial system inquiry—the Wallis report—affirmed the need for due diligence defences in relation to positive disclosure requirements. Notwithstanding our support for this Senate amendment, the government reserves its position on the general desirability of these defences, for consideration in the context of our response to the Wallis report.

         The government and the Democrats did a deal on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill. The Senate had deliberated on the legislation and voted it down. They defeated the third reading. That is a similar situation to the debate we had before. Right up to the end, we were prepared to give the government a chance to try to get this proposal right. But they did not get it right and, therefore, we
         <break page="3582" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          sought to defeat it and, in the first instance, we succeeded.

         But, as is the case in such matters these days, the government and the Democrats went away and came to an agreement and, once again, to be fair, it is an agreement that improves the bill. Because of the amendments, it is a better bill than it was before them. But it is not good enough to warrant the support of this House, and it is certainly not good enough for the Labor Party—the opposition—because our view is that the interests of working Australians and their superannuation are not adequately protected and the basic, very important structure of the Australian superannuation system—which has been developed over the last decade with such a lot of effort and over such a lot of resistance from those who are now the government—is too important to be played with like this.

         We know that the government in general—and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular—hate industry superannuation funds. They call them `trade union funds'. They cannot find the conspiracy, but they know there is one in there somewhere. They are like bloodhounds chasing it. In 10 years, they still have not found it, but they know it is there. And they will not stop until they find it.

         What it really means is that trade unions have no right to be involved in the management of the nation's finances. They do not control them entirely. They just participate. I get a lot of complaints from employer organisations about the government calling these things trade union funds. I know people who run important industry funds—employer representatives who chair these funds—and they do not enjoy having their funds called `trade union funds', because their employer members contribute, share in the responsibility for these funds and choose the trustees for these funds. But the government hate them, and they will continue to seek to undermine them.

          what we have got in front of us here today—the outcome of those factors and nothing else. It does nothing to enhance superannuation.

In fact, out of all the changes that have been made by the government to superannuation—at the cost to the credibility of the superannuation system that the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) spoke of in the last debate—not one extra dollar of superannuation will flow as a result.

         Everybody knows—even its advocates—that retirement savings accounts are a low return product. Then why are we advocating them? What is the point? We are saying, `What we want is for you to have less. It is a great reform.' And it is under the heading of choice. I will come back to the detail of the choice in a moment, but it is a pretty rum old choice to say, `What you are being offered is a guaranteed low return product.' It ought to have a warning on it like the health warning on a cigarette packet—`Be warned this is a low return product'—before you sign up for it. So that is one of the areas of profound concern to us. The Senate killed these bills, and that is what deserved to happen to them but, as a result of this deal, we have them back before us.

         What we have is a very different product from the one promised during the March election campaign. We accept that the government said, before the election, that they would give this return to their banking supporters, and they are delivering. But they are delivering a very different product. It is no good anyone pretending that is not the case because, in the Senate, we were able to table the cabinet document to prove it, so it is not exactly a big secret any more. This is a different document and a lesser one.

          the history of banks with fees and charges does not give the Australian people confidence that leaving the banks to set fees and charges on workers' superannuation, on what is already a low return product, is going to take care of the interests of the millions of Australian workers whose superannuation we are putting in jeopardy by these measures.

         What we are getting, for the first time for superannuation, are products with no trustee structure to underpin them. It has been the core of the security of workers' money—the onerous duties on trustees. When we were in government, we were frustrated by the way trustees were so cautious and so conservative. But that is a proper function. I sometimes might have wished that they made different decisions, but they are very careful in their proper protection of the concerns of the members whom they represent, and they deliver good results for them.

         Similar products have been offered in the United Kingdom and experience shows that they failed.

         The government moved an amendment in the Senate to the Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill to amend the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. The principal object of this amendment is to modify the signatory identification requirements of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 that ordinarily apply to accounts held with financial institutions and other cash dealers in order to promote the aims and objects of the retirement savings accounts legislation.

         The amendment reduces the obligations of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 on employers who open retirement savings accounts on behalf of their employees. This will reduce the administrative burdens and enhance efficiency for employers, particularly small business proprietors who open retirement savings accounts on behalf of their employees. The amendment does not detract from the integrity of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, because a person will have to satisfy the identification requirements of that act when the person seeks to withdraw those benefits from the retirement savings account, for example, upon retirement.

           —It has not been explained why an 1890s political structure—a convention—is thought to be appropriate for the 1990s. The conventions of the 1890s filled a political vacuum which no longer exists. Clause 6 of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill accepts the constitutional convention as a given. It does not explain its necessity nor its functions, only the methods for its election. If we had to define the existing system, `de facto republic' would be far more accurate than `constitutional monarchy'. As for the monarchy, or the monarch, where is it, or are they in our present system?

         <para first-indent="16">
          The proposed convention is both tainted—the method of election or selection virtually guarantees its failure—and unnecessary. The tainting, of course, is deliberate. If there is a low percentage of votes cast, if people find the obstacle race too much for them, and there is only a narrow majority for the republic, the argument for change can be discredited and disregarded. If there is a stacked deck through appointed delegates and the convention then goes against the republic, or if the convention is divided or cannot reach any agreement on the major issues, reform can be delayed interminably.

          In the 1890s, conventions were needed because there were no federal institutions. In 1891, the members were appointed. All were serving colonial MPs, including premiers, from the six colonies and also there were three representatives from New Zealand.

          An 1897 Sydney street directory would be an interesting artefact to have, especially if in mint condition, but not of much value in helping people find their way around. The harbour, Parramatta and Kirribilli House would be there, but there would be no bridge, airport or University of New South Wales. It would not really represent Sydney as we all know it. An 1897 Canberra directory would be even more useless. So with the constitution. The US still applies its constitution, operative in 1790, as written. We do not. One alternative might be to publish an annotated edition of our constitution with marginal notations against many sections which read, `Disregard this section,' or `This section has never been implemented.'

          In the 1890s, there was no nation called Australia or even Australasia; it was a geographical term or a concept, not an entity. There was no national parliament, no body which could speak for the continent. There was no national political leadership. Completely new structures, including a constitution, had to be created. The leaders of the six diverse and distant colonies had zero years of experience with federation and a very shaky and remote knowledge of federal systems such as the US and Canada which they derived from the textbooks.

          In the 1990s, Australia is a de facto republic already and has been at least, I would think, since 1942. There is a strong and growing Australian national sentiment.

          We have now had 96 years of experiencing the strengths and weaknesses of the federal system. The 1901 constitution was a very unsatisfactory document. Of its 128 sections, I estimate that 32 are irrelevant, anachronistic or purely transitional. I would invite the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), all of whom describe the `existing system' as perfect, to read aloud in here, on television or on radio chapter II of the constitution, `The executive government', and then say two things: firstly, `That's an accurate description of the way the system works now,' and, secondly, `I would not change a word.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          It would be very unselfish of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to show their commitment to chapter II because they would then have to give up their titles. The challenge can be safely made. They will never do it. Chapter II actually describes a top down, divine right monarchy with all powers in the hands of the Queen. Of course, it is all fairyland now. It was fairyland even in 1901. But do we have to maintain a constitutional commitment to fairyland into the 21st century?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The best that can be said about chapter II is that it does not mean what it says. But some latter&amp;hyphen;day conservatives say that we cannot change it either. The founding fathers in 1901 had the good sense to disregard the constitution as written. There is an unbridgeable gap between the big C `Constitution' and small c `convention'. My argument is that small c `convention' ought to be incorporated in the big C `Constitution'.

          Have we learnt nothing from 96 years of Federation? Apparently not, say the fearful, the timid and the cynical. Our leaders talk about the constitution but give no evidence that they have read it. In this debate, it is amazing how few speakers have actually referred to it.

           But who wants to change the system? Nobody is proposing an alternative model—not him, not me, not even Paul Keating.

It is the 1901 constitution that is out of sync.

           In the same interview with Laurie Oakes, the Prime Minister referred to the Governor-General as `our de facto head of state'. But Laurie Oakes could have followed that up and said, `Well, Prime Minister, you might describe yourself as the de facto head of government or the de facto Prime Minister,' because under the constitution that is precisely what he is. The office of Prime Minister does not exist as such in our current constitution.

            Prime Minister could provide national leadership and end the existing confusion if he proposed the following question, or some variant of it, to the convention and then to the people, preferably first to an indicative, non-binding plebiscite to assess the level of popular support—something along the lines of the indicative plebiscite that was held on the national song back in 1977 during the prime ministership of Malcolm Fraser. My preference would be for a referendum question which read along these lines:

I fear that the Prime Minister's response creates a false antithesis. I am not aware of any responsible republican who advocates changing the system. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) last night mournfully declared that he did not want Australia to adopt the US model. Well, he is not Robinson Crusoe in that. Could he provide the House with the name and address of anyone proposing this course? I have never heard it suggested in the course of the last three years.

           The most distressing thing about the nature of the debate is the kind of fatalism that seems to infect some members to say that we are not up to it, that if we attempted to do it, if we attempted to reach important decisions on critical matters, we would muck it up and damage the Commonwealth. We ought to have the same courage that our ancestors had a century ago. They had the guts to go ahead and make very major decisions where there was admittedly an element of risk. We seem incapable of doing it.

          —As the last remaining Privy Councillor in this place, it seemed to me appropriate that I might say a few words on this particular subject. I think, first of all, one should say that constitutional change has never been an easy subject. Of the 42 referenda that have been conducted, there have been so few that have been passed—some eight, as I recall. Constitutional change has, in the past, often dwelt on the same subject with an equal lack of success. For example, those referenda that suggested that the election for the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate should be conducted at the same time were put to the people on four occasions and defeated on four occasions.

         What I wanted to do in opening was to first divert a little from the convention itself and say to a number of countries in our region to whom we are trying to encourage an understanding of democratic processes that it is a pity they find it so difficult to introduce into their systems the sort of particular election process without difficulty that has been put before the parliament in this bill, the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. It does not mean that the process is not without some contention or without some difference.

         For example, in Hong Kong, those of us who are involved and interested are concerned that there should be a provisional legislative

          council. Essentially there is now no electoral law to elect a new electoral council within that former independent territory that will become part of China on 1 July. I commend to Tung Chee&amp;hyphen;hwa and those who are members of the provisional legislature an examination of the electoral processes of this legislation.

         Similarly, in Cambodia, I am one of those most concerned that there is no electoral law in place to allow the conduct of their second democratic election. Yet it is quite critical that it be held. That is a diversion, but it is important because in this place, for all the differences between us and some of the nuances of this legislation, we can devise  electoral laws which, having passed the parliament, we will all accept. It might well be that each of us would see processes that we would like different, whether it should be a voluntary election or a compulsory election or whether the postal voting system is applicable or not, but the point is that it is an effective and democratic process. I would say to both those countries that I would hope that they can look at what we are doing and perhaps see that it is not all that difficult.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As for the legislation itself, I first want to say a few words about the process and then comment on some of the aspects of the convention. On the process, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who has just spoken, quite properly looked at the historical process of change. In my own electorate in Tenterfield the first of the constitutional conventions was held in the 1890s. The remarkable degree to which that 1885 federal Australian council was able to generate processes whereby there seemed in the 1890s to be greater capacity for dialogue between state premiers than now exists is something that I think might well be reflected on occasionally by those who attend COAG meetings who find it easier to find fundamental differences in their attitude than in those days long since where, for all its defects, they were finally able to come up through their own dialogue with a process of change. That to me is the most important part of our constitution.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          While it was passed by an act of the House of Westminster, it was an Australian constitution, with advice and consultation, but drawn more heavily from the United States constitution than from the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom. I think it is important as we look at change in the 1990s towards 2001 that we understand that it is possible to look at change without fearing that change itself is a bad thing. I say that having started off talking about some of the referenda and the difficulties that have been involved in constitutional change. I think I remain the only member of this chamber who has attended each one of the modern constitutional conventions since they were first constituted by Gough Whitlam in 1973.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The point about those constitutional conventions, as the honourable member for Lalor has just suggested, is there is a large degree of unanimity in terms of the modernisation, if you will, of the constitution—eliminating certainly the anachronistic provisions within the constitution and making the constitution so that those provisions that are now relevant are there and deleting those that are no longer relevant. I think it is a pity that this constitutional convention, dealing as it is required only with whether or not Australia should become a republic, cannot perhaps advance constitutional change to the point of at least accepting the deletion of those anachronistic provisions. Once you move beyond that, there are difficulties.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Along with a number of other members of this place, I was privy to—I know it is something a number of us have been involved in—the production of a very good report called
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Constitutional change
          </emphasis>
          by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of this place. Those who are interested in changing the constitution would do well to refer to it, not because it has any particular preference in the forms of change but because it has identified all the debates and all the product of recommendations. It allows in an annotated version reference to each section of the constitution to see where either there has been a referendum or there has been a recommendation for change and to understand as a result where we are in terms of what seems to
          <break page="3589" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           me across quite a lot of the constitution considerable unanimity that a number of the sections should be modified.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So my first and fairly significant argument would be that I think it is a pity that we cannot look at something beyond just the republic in this convention and see whether we can come to an argument on the minimalist approach, if you wish to call it that, for at least removing those anachronistic provisions of the constitution. I say that having in mind that, if you can come to an agreement on that, it might help to remove part of the opposition that exists within the essentially conservative Australian electorate to the process of change.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As the honourable member for Lalor has just suggested, there is really nothing sacred about our constitution. It is not like Moses tablets handed down from Mount Sinai. It is a living, functional document which still provides the basis for our government legislative process. But people forget in the separation of power debate that it also constitutes the High Court. It not only sets the role of those of us who are within the legislature or identifies the role of the administration but also identifies the role and responsibilities of the High Court. That is an important part of why it is very much a living document.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Just as the High Court, often amidst considerable controversy, has reached decisions which we feel intrude into our legislative process, we need to be aware that if we are going to change the constitution there is no reason why we should not intrude, if we wish, into their particular part of the legislation—in other words, the role and identity of the courts. Indeed, it has already been extended by statute—the fact that we now have Federal Courts and the fact that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is now considering a federal magistracy. These are all worthwhile extensions, not referred to in the constitution because the High Court has a separate role.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I see no reason why we should not, therefore, look at constitutional change. In doing that, I would hope for at least something beyond just that minimalist question and that we look towards those areas where everybody accepts there needs to be change. I think that
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           would help in the process of accepting the concept of change apart from the particular questions involved.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having said that, I want to refer to two aspects of the constitution about the role and responsibilities of the head of state. I mentioned in opening that as a Privy Councillor I am unique in this place. In days gone by all senior ministers and people like the late Arthur Calwell were members of the Privy Council. Arthur, in fact, was not at that time a minister. He was an `Hon.' because he had been a former minister under successive Labor administrations but was made a member of the Privy Council while Leader of the Opposition in this place, the point being that at that stage the Privy Council had both a legal division and an administrative division. People like Tony Blair, the recently elected Prime Minister of Britain, was a Privy Councillor before he became Prime Minister. They were members of the Privy Council because of the important function of members of the executive of advising the head of state.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As the honourable member for Lalor suggested, the head of state in Australia, while nominally the Queen, is in fact the Governor-General. The way sections 1 and 2 of the constitution work is that, while section 1 states `The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament'—and that is defined as consisting of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives—section 2 immediately defines, in the form that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has defined as a monarchical republic, the Governor-General's designated responsibilities. It states:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          A Governor-General appointed by the Queen—

          Without going into the nuance of that because I am rapidly running out of time, I think it is important we understand that the only role of

           I think it is important to understand that the executive role of the head of state in Australia is in fact in chapter II. The point I want to make is that when people talk about the head of state they need to understand, not particularly as far as their own constitution is concerned but for the way in which our system works, that the executive function of government is in fact exercised by the Governor-General in consultation with ministers. We tend to think in this place, when we pass laws or when appointments are announced or policies promulgated, that this is where those things are in fact done.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           But neither federally nor in the states or territories are they in fact done in this place. They go from here and, either through the Executive Council or by signature of the Governor-General—or in the case of the states the state governors—are then promulgated into law, appointments are made and dismissals or resignations accepted. And there is indeed another process which is almost outside the light of day, which is the advice of and relationship between each of the continuing members of the Executive Council and the Governor-General as far as Australia is concerned. It is that which is one of the most significant and more important elements of the executive function of government.

I put to this House that there is an alternative, which is that, instead of having, as has been proposed, a system of election of the head of state by a process of this parliament, an electoral college or the electorate at large or some other group, if we are going to move at all, it would be far better for us to constitute an Australian governors council.

It is important we understand that, if we had an Australian governors council, we could then, through recommendations from the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, from state Premiers to the Australian governors council for governors, preserve our system with a genuine minimalist change. At a federal level, it would mean that the person who is the last Governor-General—providing he was alive; if not, then the most senior of the governors—would preside. If you were appointing a successor to the Victorian governor, for example, the immediately past Victorian governor would preside or, if not, the most senior of those who were governors-general or governors.

           By doing that, I would submit that you would be able to allow direct continuity of that one function that is defined within section 2 of the constitution. Instead of `appointed by the Queen' it would be `by the Australian governors council'. I would put in some conditions. At least section 44 should cover the requirements of the person to be nominated. If we change section 44, then of course it could well be that the same changes apply to everybody. But we have laid down certain requirements for a person to become a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives. I think it is appropriate that those same provisions should be applied. Section 44 actually refers to disqualification. But the constitution lays down provisions for a person to be capably made a member of the parliament. It really sets out in part 4, without identifying anyone in particular, that they could apply to the person to be made Governor-General.

           The third thing that I think is important is that you have them subject to the same constraints as the Governor-General. So the Governor-General, having been pointed by that process, would act in accordance with section 63 of the constitution. In fact, what I
           <break page="3592" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            am putting to people is that, if there is to be change, there is a process by which you can have an Australian governors council which would maintain our federal system, maintain the system of appointment of governors-general and governors and would allow the continuation of Federation without prejudice to some future change that might well occur at some foreseeable time. I have actually said a little more and promulgated a little more of the concept elsewhere. But it is important that we think there are processes by which we can protect the system, and we do not want to feel that the constitution is inevitably entrenched. It is a living document and I think the process that I have suggested would in fact work.

I was quite pleased, in fact, at being a student at St Mary's Cathedral. I was able to attend the demonstrations that were held in the Domain, my school playground, on the Friday after the coup of 1975.

It is envisaged in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that the cost of the election will be $35 million. The cost of the 1993 election, according to the AEC, was $46.6 million. It is estimated that a full and proper democratic election would cost $49 million at most. So you are talking in effect of a maximum figure of $14 million, in addition, to do it properly. If you have a choice of spending $49 million to actually get something that is useful at the end of the process or essentially wasting $35 million, then I do not think it is a matter of

Unfortunately, too many lines have been drawn in the sand which people do not wish to pass over and there has been far too much—I nearly said `passion', but I don't mind passion in the argument—jingoism in the argument so far. What all that has done is help to destroy what should have been a very sensible proposition for Australians to consider. There is still time for us all to take a deep breath and try to decide how we come to some conclusion on this.

         Other countries around the world managed to sensibly make changes to their constitution to catch up with modern times and they did it far more sensibly than we are attempting to do it. I think the founding fathers, when they put our constitution together, decided to make it as hard as possible to do that in order to protect the smaller states. That was sensible in those days and there is probably less need for that now, but the reality is that that is there. The referendum process to change the constitution makes it very hard.

         Surely, in the run&amp;hyphen;up to this constitutional convention we should not be trying to strangle the idea at birth. That is what the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 does. This is a bill which has the fix already in. The government should either have the courage to say that they are not going to go ahead with this or have a fair ballot to have a fair convention. To try to rig the representation, as they have done, with the appointed nominees to start with, is a bit silly. There have been a number of constitutional conventions in this country since the 1890s. I went to one as a nominee of this parliament in the
         <break page="3596" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          mid&amp;hyphen;1980s. We did not have proportional representation there; we had a number of nominees of the Prime Minister and a number of nominees of the Leader of the Opposition. One wonders, of course, whether the government would have been so keen on proportionality if the last election had given them a majority of three or something like that. It suits the government to try to skew this, and it is the same for the state representation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It just happens that around this country at present there is only one Labor state or territory government. So what have we got there? We have a fix in that too. Each of the states will send three people, the Leader of the Opposition, the Premier and another person nominated by the Premier. If the fix is in there, then you get two people from the government in all the states who will have a different from the government in New South Wales. Even in the government party here we will be very keen to see what the breakup of the people to represent this place is. If you talk to a number of people in the opposition, you find that on the opposition backbench there are a huge number of people who have a different view from the Prime Minister's view. One would be interested to see whether they are properly represented.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the reason why the Leader of the Opposition has proposed this amendment. To have 16 parliamentary delegates appointed from the federal parliament consisting of eight members and senators appointed by the Prime Minister, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the leader of the Democrats and one to represent the other Independents in the place would give a more proper representation of the views around this chamber.

         The proposal also put forward by the Leader of the Opposition to increase the number of elected delegates to 80 to be chosen from the states and the territories so that you get a wider representation is a very good thing. Otherwise, if you start to have a convention where people have already tried to fix the outcome from the beginning, you will not get an outcome which the Australian people deserve. My point is that, if the fix is in, then the people deserve better than that and the government should look at some of

         Australia has always been a democratic society with proud democratic traditions and it is the legitimate right of any person to express their views on a range of issues and to set up branches of a political movement if they so desire. However, the member for Oxley ought to be aware that progressive elements in the electorate of Corio who value racial tolerance, who are concerned about unemployment and who treasure the social harmony of Geelong's multicultural society intend to challenge vigorously in public debate the more divisive elements of her political agenda. I am personally confident that once that debate takes place the narrow view of Australia and what it is and could become that is currently presented by the member for Oxley will be rejected by the overwhelming majority of citizens of goodwill in the Geelong region.

Simply put, the implementation of the member for Oxley's agenda will not remove the teller machines from bank walls and replace them with young people behind the counters.

As the member for Makin, I have been approached by constituents who have experienced significant losses after association with Berklee Ltd. These people have in the past been associated with Berklee Ltd in different areas of South Australia and have experienced serious personal and financial disadvantage. Consequently, some franchise operators have combined forces to seek justice in what appears to be a superior example of the failure by Berklee Ltd to meet any commitments and promises made to prospective owners.

         By way of background to my particular involvement, a delegation of constituents met with me and explained their concerns in my office earlier this year. To take one example
         <break page="3598" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          from this group, Messrs Hossack purchased a Berklee franchise at 97 Brighton Road in the suburb of Glenelg in South Australia for $185,000 on 1 April 1989. At this time Berklee Retail Ltd claimed franchisees were granted distribution rights, so one could only purchase a Berklee muffler from a Berklee store and franchise operators could only purchase and sell Berklee products.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, this commitment continued only until July 1989 when Berklee Retail Ltd removed their embossed name from their product and began flooding the independent stores and retail outlets with stock. The franchise operators had no knowledge of this plan prior to Berklee's action. Further, this procedure effectively destroyed the Berklee franchises and left the operators bankrupt after investing their life savings into their small businesses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of Messrs Hossack, an alternative enterprise, `Speedy Mufflers', commenced trading at a nearby location at 93 Glenelg Road in August 1989. Only four months after Mr Hossack and his brother purchased the Berklee franchise down the road, Berklee Retail Ltd was then contacted by the Hossack brothers and I understand their concerns were discussed. But this meeting, from all accounts, was unable to allay any of their concerns. Further, I understand that their concerns were considered unimportant. Prior knowledge of the establishment of the Speedy Muffler enterprise was denied by Berklee Ltd.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, a copy of the Glenelg Council letter sent to Berklee Ltd, dated 7 February 1989, supports the view that Berklee Ltd had prior knowledge of Speedy Muffler's plans and that they concealed this fact from the prospective franchise operators. Negotiations that Messrs Hossack, Murphy, Griffiths and Faggotter held with Berklee Ltd and their discussions with Mr Brian Graham, South Australian Operations Manager, and Mr John Rippon, National Marketing Manager, did not reveal this fact to those purchasing the franchises.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Additionally, there were reports of tactics being employed such as cutting power supplies to the businesses during usual hours of

          operation, and Berklee Retail Ltd stopping payment of rent to landlords of the properties and effectively excluding people from their businesses by changing their locks. Messrs Murphy, Griffiths, Faggotter and Hossack took to sleeping inside their premises to protect their interests from further interference from Berklee Ltd. These disreputable strategies used by Berklee Ltd proved to be an obvious attempt to dissuade the franchisees from further action.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Arguably, in advertising these franchises, Berklee Retail Ltd portrayed their enterprises to the prospective operators in a shamelessly deceitful manner. Further, a commitment was made to provide a 10 per cent royalty of total turnover, which would be paid by franchisees to be used for advertising, promotion and marketing, and demographic surveys. Mr Rippon also assured the franchisees that 50 per cent of these advertising funds paid by them would be used in their local area. Other undertakings such as training for the new staff, back&amp;hyphen;up and support for the franchise operators and promised national advertising campaign were also not honoured by Berklee.

I come into this House tonight to
         <break page="3599" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          set the member for Oxley straight on these matters regarding my community—a community which she obviously knows nothing about. I do not expect that what I say will make any difference to her whatsoever; she has proven herself incapable of even trying to listen to reason. But I am damned if I am going to let the people of my electorate—the people I have lived with and worked with for over 40 years; the people I have represented at all three levels of government for over 25 years—be attacked and smeared in such an outrageous fashion.

         We may have our problems in Cabramatta and Fairfield—and they are well publicised. But they are problems which are not specific to any one culture or ethnic background: they affect us all. We are also a thriving community, rich in civic pride and full of concern about each other's and our community's wellbeing. The member for Oxley has no such concern for us. She has been to Cabramatta—so I have been told—on a very quick, private, whistlestop tour; she has never set foot in Fairfield, to my knowledge. If she had any concern for our area she would not spread such inflammatory and divisive lies about us without concern for the damage and suspicion that they create. How brave of the member for Oxley to spread this malicious gossip and then not be around to pick up the pieces when it does its damage!

        <para first-indent="16">
         So what did the member for Oxley say? She said, about Cabramatta's Asian population, `If you go to Cabramatta, there's street signs up in their own language.' That is an outright lie. The member for Oxley has lied on this point. If she has not lied and has simply based her comments on misinformation, I would suggest that she come into this House and admit her mistake and retract her statement. There is not a single street sign in Cabramatta, nor anywhere within the Fairfield City boundaries, which is written in Vietnamese, Chinese, Laotian, Khmer, Italian, Macedonian or any other language. Not one of the over 100 languages spoken in my community—apart from English—is used on any of our street signs. The street signs are written in English, they have always been in English and they will remain so.

          The member for Oxley then said—and, again, I will use her words—`Ask the parents at Fairfield why have there been notes sent home with the children that their children must learn Vietnamese.' This is another lie. The children of Fairfield have not been told they must learn Vietnamese as part of some sort of sinister re&amp;hyphen;education campaign. I have been assured of this by the district superintendent of the state department of education. Where the member for Oxley may be getting confused—and I know she gets confused quite easily—is that there are many language courses offered in the schools in my area. Starting from this year, all year seven students in New South Wales—continuing until year 10—are required to study one language for 100 hours in one 12&amp;hyphen;month period in order to be awarded the school certificate. This is a language of their choice; no&amp;hyphen;one puts a gun to their heads and tells them what they have to study.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Some primary schools in my area offer languages under the LOTE program—languages other than English—as part of their normal curriculum. For the kids this is an opportunity to learn a few key phrases in a particular language and some background on the culture. We should be thankful that this is the case. As for which language they learn, that depends on the resources available in the school and whether there are teachers working at the school who are proficient enough in a language to teach it. One year the language may be Vietnamese, the next it may be French. Many schools in my area also take part in the community languages program, which is designed to foster and further develop the language that kids from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds use at home. A child can only participate in the program after parental permission has been given.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If I thought it would do any good, I would invite the member for Oxley to spend some time in Fairfield and Cabramatta and see how 130 different cultures live happily together side by side. But I know it would be a waste of time, because she would not be coming to listen to our views. She has already proven herself to have a very closed mind on these matters. She would be coming to use our

I was thrilled when we launched the New South Wales black spot funding in the community of Ettalong. The reason that community was selected to launch the New South Wales black spot funding was the fact that the community had raised a large amount of money from the shop owners and the registered club—the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club—to input into the construction of a roundabout to save lives and to help employment in Ettalong.

As I mentioned, there is now a real possibility that the black spot funding may be undermined because of the lack of community contributions that would have come from the clubs.

          According to Mr Hale, this tax will cost 500 jobs over two years. Mr Hale also said that typical sponsorship was threatened to clubs such as the Umina Beach Surf Club, which the club was sponsoring for $75,000 over three years. This is just one of the examples of the good work that is done by the Central Coast registered clubs. The Central Coast Leagues Club, one of the biggest clubs in New South Wales, also stated that many of its community projects are at risk. The Central Coast Leagues Club gives assistance totalling $5 million a year to the community, and to cricket, rugby league, soccer, Aussie rules and other sporting groups. All these sorts of projects are now at risk, simply because of the tax grab from the New South Wales Labor government.

          —Over the years, I have attended hundreds of naturalisation ceremonies and been associated with parliamentary colleagues from the state and federal parliaments and from the Liberal Party who, on every occasion, have extended their congratulations and best wishes to those people of Asian origin who chose to become Australian citizens. I have never had any reason to doubt their sincerity and I now know that members on both sides of this House deplore the incoherent and racist attitude that has been displayed, not merely in this parliament but outside this parliament, by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She has the support of longstanding racist organisations who are only too happy to provide her with a platform—I refer to the racist and anti&amp;hyphen;Semitic organisation known as the League of Rights. In over 30 years in politics, I have never heard any member of any parliament say of one group of constituents, `I will not deal with you, I will not represent you, for no other reason than that you belong to an indigenous group of citizens,' and I, of course, refer to the Aboriginal citizens of Oxley.

For some months now editorial writers, religious leaders and leaders of the ethnic communities have been asking the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give a lead on this important issue and to demonstrate that in no way does the member for Oxley represent the broad views, or even the narrow views, of members of this House and the Australian community generally.

I would have understood if the Prime Minister had said, `I would like to talk to my party about it.' I would have understood if he had said, `I would like to think about it.'

          —Earlier this year a mobile phone tower was constructed in Murrumba Downs, a suburb in the northern reaches of my electorate. I know that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, is interested in this issue as well. It is pleasing to see him here. Having read his very early speech on this subject, I think he is

         This particular tower is an absolute blot on the landscape. It was erected in the space of one morning. It does not give me much pleasure to say this, but it is the product of an unholy alliance, in my view, between Vodafone and a local church which has seen fit to overlook the concerns of local residents in favour of the return to be derived from leasing part of its land to the mobile phone provider.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I say `an unholy alliance' because Queensland churches anyway—I do not know about other parts of Australia—are put at a very significant advantage in the community in that they have a rates exemption because they carry on an activity of religious instruction and education, and otherwise ceremony and tradition. So they get a rates allowance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For a church to abuse, in my view, that special privilege by entering into a commercial deal with a phone carrier is totally unacceptable and something that the state government, maybe even the federal government, has to look at. Certainly, the state government could use the Local Government Act, but perhaps the federal government should bring some influence to bear there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The positioning of the tower is alarming. It is in very close proximity to the Undurba State School and Inverpine Retirement Village and is immediately adjacent to a kindergarten. It is also flush&amp;hyphen;up against the boundary of a neighbouring property. The particular person concerned was never consulted about the positioning of this tower by the church.

         Concerned residents will be meeting at my office this coming week to discuss health and safety issues with independent expert, Dr Thiel of Griffith University. Vodafone representatives attending a recent meeting of the school P&amp;C Association were asked by a parent whether Vodafone had ever moved a tower. One of the representatives replied, `No, and it is unlikely that we would ever do so.' To make matters worse, the facility erected by Vodafone, subject to local authority consent, could be upgraded or used by other service providers.

The residents of one street—which, incidentally, was promoted as a quality estate, with all underground services—have been told that they either get aerial cables, whether they want them or not, or, incredibly, they pay $300 to have them installed underground. They have until 27 May to decide.

         I say `incredibly' because there is no demand, it appears, in the particular estate to have these so-called services. Telstra is saying, `If you want them underground you pay for them,' but they do not want them in the first place—an extraordinary non sequitur, I would have thought. The residents presented a petition to the local authority, the Pine Rivers Shire Council, about the Telstra plans but, until the new telecommunications code takes effect on 1 July 1997, it is powerless to intervene.

In my electorate, Vodafone, Telstra and Optus have caused their share of distress. People are forced to cop this sort of thing and it is really unacceptable—1 July cannot come soon enough. These operators are making the most of the remaining month and a half to create as much havoc as they can.

          —We on this side of the House will not detain the passage of this legislation for too long. I should signal at the outset that both the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997, which are the bills under discussion this morning, are supported by the opposition. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) will be raising some issues associated with the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997 that he believes need to be addressed. In the main, these are not, I think, controversial by their nature.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill, in fact, seeks to change the way in which excise duty is calculated and paid on stabilised crude petroleum oil from three times a month to once a month and will take effect from 1 July this year. These amendments are in conjunction with amendments which are contained in the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1997. The second thing that this bill does is to remove liquid petroleum gas, which is currently excise free, from the application of the tariff act. Thirdly, this specific bill decreases the excise duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.75c per litre, with effect from 1 September 1997. This is as a result of an over&amp;hyphen;collection of duty during 1995&amp;hyphen;96.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reductions also take account of the reduction in operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the forecast growth in airline activity. I am not sure about that reduction in operating costs for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority with the recent appointment there. I am sure, as time goes on, we will see how effective that is, with the pay&amp;hyphen;off to the new deputy chairman of that organisation by the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This affords me the opportunity, whilst these two bills are within the House, to make a couple of passing comments in respect of petroleum and to actually pay a compliment to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). It is not often, I suspect, when a budget is less than 24 hours old that an opportunity can be taken by the opposition to pay a compliment to a minister for having taken a decision which is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and which probably has been long overdue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am talking, of course, about the crackdown on dangerous fuel substitution. I say to the minister that this is a very appropriate and timely decision the government has taken. As was announced last night in the budget, the government is going to clamp down on dangerous fuel substitution by introducing chemical tracers for concessional fuel. This should be bad news, as the minister pointed out in his press release, for shonky operators who sell fuel blends containing concessional and waste fuel products as automotive diesel in order to avoid tax.
         <break page="3606" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          The concept embodied in that, of course, is very significant in terms of the bills that we are debating here this morning.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your benefit and, I am sure, for the benefit of other members, that this is a practice which has been going on for some time. What has tended to emerge—certainly in metropolitan areas and in cities such as my own city of Wollongong—is the growth of service stations which are not linked directly to one of the major suppliers in this country. The effect of that is that people have been buying in fuel from different sources and, as a consequence, the mix that has been retailed by these smaller operators has probably not been the purest form of fuel that should be sold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The effect that that has had is that it has been a real boon for automotive repair shops and automotive tuners in my electorate of Cunningham, because consumers who see that they are getting petrol which is often several cents cheaper than at a service station operated by Shell, Mobil, or whatever, on the opposite corner to them suddenly find that one or two uses of this fuel lead to dreadful engine problems in their vehicles. As a consequence, they have to take them off to automotive repairers, to people who are charged with the responsibility of tuning these engines up, and what they are finding is all manner of muck contained in that particular fuel blend.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am delighted to see that the minister is here. Minister, I was just singing your praises for the budget initiative last night with respect to the crackdown on dangerous fuel substitution. Now that you are here, let me congratulate you, face to face. It is a measure that is long overdue. I was just relating some circumstances in my own electorate where, in recent times, this has been highlighted as a problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we have done, on this side of the House, is conduct a price watch on petrol in a number of electorates. Over a few months now, one of the issues which is constantly coming up is the concern about the shonkier dealers, people who are buying fuel mixes which often contain sediment and have a whole range of other problems, or the mix that has been put into that fuel has been inappropriate. I was saying, Minister, that it has actually improved the opportunities for people who tune up vehicles to have a tremendous business in Wollongong, because a number of these service stations are now operating. So I say to you again that the measure that you announced last night in the budget is a very welcome one in that respect.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To return to the legislation before the Main Committee, the opposition has no problem with the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. We give it our unqualified support. I want to thank the minister for the opportunity that was provided to me and my staff for a briefing on this particular matter and the courteous way in which that briefing was conducted by officers of his department and from the Australian Customs Service. It is refreshing to see that level of cooperation and I appreciate it greatly. I wish this legislation speedy passage through the Main Committee and, indeed, through the parliament.

The Howard government came to office with simple promises to the Australian people: we promised to talk with Australians, not at them; we said we would give Australians a say in public policy and make public policy making a public matter once more. That is the principle that has made the Charter of Budget Honesty a keystone of fiscal responsibility at the federal level. It is a principle that has fuelled much&amp;hyphen;needed reform to tax collections for the tax law improvement project; likewise with the small business deregulation task force.

          It gives me precious little satisfaction to learn that, as recently as March last year, this parliament was passing about three times as many acts as its Canadian or British counterparts and that the amount of paperwork generated by the parliament has expanded exponentially in recent years. These are not issues that are in some way irrelevant to the needs of the Australian community. The government's election policy said:

         <para style="Para">
          The prospect of lawyers profiting from the misfortune of the public and the inadequacy of the parliament does not please me, for one, nor the government as a whole. For this reason I am honoured to speak on the legislation before us.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The two bills we are addressing seek to clarify the law so as to ensure fair and efficient excise collection in the industries of stabilised crude petroleum oil, crude oil and liquid petroleum gas, better know as LPG. Instead of forcing producers to calculate excise amounts and make payments of excise 36 times a year, this concurrent legislation will increase the length of that prescribed division to a month. The result—one&amp;hyphen;third the number of calculations of payments in a year—will help alleviate the administrative burden presently imposed on crude oil producers. The reforms will also reduce the government's meddling in this market.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These reforms are motivated by a commitment to greater flexibility and understanding on the part of government and reflect significant changes in the crude oil industry itself. In the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, the current excise system allowed the government to take advantage of the boom in Bass Strait crude oil production. In fact, it has been noted that in 1984&amp;hyphen;85 $4.2 million was collected in this manner in excise payments. Since then, significant amendments have been made to the collection system as the crude oil market was deregulated and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987, which determines the volware price of crude oil, was passed. Yet the administrative mess that necessitated 36 annual payments and calculations remained.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Furthermore, the extension of the petroleum resource rent tax regime to Bass Strait reduced the number of payees to only three, excise collected on crude oil dived to $12.2 million in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. It seems ridiculous to continue with such an outdated and burdensome system on such amounts of collectable excise.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Both the amendment bills before us have been developed by the government in full and open consultation with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. The amendments also ensure consistent treatment of LPG by making production of LPG excise exempt by removing LPG from the ambit of the tariff act. This will remove the administrative burden on producers of LPG and the government, and bring the treatment of offshore LPG production in line with onshore LPG production.

          —The opposition supports the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997. They are appropriately being dealt with together as a package. In a strict portfolio sense, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the shadow minister for small business and customs, has dealt directly with the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. As shadow minister for resources and energy,
          <break page="3608" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The minister, in his second reading speeches on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill in his own right and on the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill on behalf of the Minister for Resources (Senator Parer), detailed the arrangements to be effected by the package of legislation. In effect, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill change the way in which excise duty is calculated and paid on crude petroleum oil from three times a month to once a month from 1 July of this year. That bill removes liquid petroleum gas, which is currently excise free, from the application of the tariff act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill reflects those changes and also removes the requirement to determine the volume weighted average of realised prices for oil producing regions which have exceeded the excise free threshold but have not produced oil at a rate which attracts an excise liability. It also removes the need to determine a reference price for oil for the following month.

         These are technical provisions which provide for better administration. They are supported by industry. The relevant formal industry association, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association—APPEA—supports these measures. They are supported by the opposition on the merits, but also because they were initiated by the now opposition when in government. They did not reach the stage of legislation, but the substantive decisions had been made prior to the last election. If they had reached the stage of legislation and been introduced by the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), in his then capacity as Minister for Resources and Energy, I am sure his speeches would have been almost precisely the same as the speeches of the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) on the occasion that he introduced the bills in the House.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They are technical bills, but they reflect important policy and a shift in the nature of tax arrangements so far as the petroleum industry is concerned over the years. This was touched upon by the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) in his contribution. Basically, they reflect the change of taxation arrangements, so far as the petroleum industry is concerned, from excise or royalty to resources rent tax. That is a secondary tax, or a tax on profit, which is generally regarded by the petroleum industry—it is certainly regarded by those on this side of the parliament—as being a more appropriate taxation regime. It taxes profit. The petroleum industry, based as it is on the high risk of exploration, regards this as a more appropriate arrangement. Certainly, on our side of the House, we regard it as a much more effective arrangement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Excise, so far as petroleum is concerned, is currently only payable on a small number of petroleum producing fields. Since the diminution of production in Bass Strait, we are really talking about the Jackson field in south&amp;hyphen;west Queensland, the Harriet fields in Western Australia and, when production starts in the course of the next financial year, the Wannaea field in the North West Shelf region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst these bills and measures are technical, they do reflect some significant changes in the petroleum and oil industry over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s the crude oil regime represented the Commonwealth's most significant petroleum production taxation mechanism. In some years that collection was as high as $4 billion per annum. We are now in the hundred million range, or lower.
        </para>
        <break page="3609" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          As a result of a decline over those years in oil prices coupled with, as I have indicated, the development of the resources rent tax and movements in those areas, we have seen the Commonwealth's collection move more comprehensively to resources rent tax. We have also seen the diminution of Bass Strait as a production area. Whilst I am sure the member for Forrest and the Minister for Small Business, like me, puts on his selfish parochial cap and says that to some extent the expense of Bass Strait has been at the great burgeoning of the North West Shelf so far as the national mix is concerned, that has also been reflected by the Commonwealth's collections.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those remaining crude oil areas which are excisable, as I have indicated, now come into the hundreds of millions or less, rather than the $4 billion peak. We are dealing with much smaller areas. The administrative and technical changes which are being made really reflect a significantly smaller volume production. Whilst the regime which is proposed to be amended by the bills was appropriate in earlier years for much larger production areas, it is administratively unsound for the current volume of production. It is administratively inefficient. The regime places an unnecessary burden, not on only the department but, also and more importantly, on industry. Consequently, these measures are supported without reservation by the opposition. Like my colleague the member for Cunningham, we compliment the minister on bringing it forward.

         The purpose of these bills is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987. As honourable members have stated, these bills are a legislative package which include, firstly, an alteration to the arrangements for the calculation and payment of excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil. The proposed amendment here reduces the calculation and payment of excise duty on stabilised crude oil from 36 times per financial year to 12 times per year—a significant cutting of red tape in anyone's language.

         These amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 also require consequential amendments to the calculation of volware prices under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act.

The proposed amendments to the Excise Tariff Act and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act have been developed after consultation with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.

        <para first-indent="16">
         First of all, on the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997, we believe that in many ways the current government is implementing the views of the former government and the former minister on this issue—that is, that the government is seeking to ensure that the community continues to get a return from the private use of frequencies for radio and television broadcasts.
        </para>
        <break page="3611" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In Australia, certainly ever since we have had television and over the many years of the existence of radio, we have had an expectation that those companies that are awarded television and radio licences should pay an annual fee to the taxpayer as a return to the community for allowing that company the exclusive use of the scarce radio electromagnetic spectrum. One of the difficulties which arose during the time I had the honour to serve as the minister for communications was an anomaly that emerged in the Broadcasting Services Act, as originally enacted by this parliament. The anomaly was that all of the existing radio and television licence holders knew that they were up for a certain annual licence fee, but the act provided for the auctioning to new licensees of new frequencies. As the act was originally passed by the parliament, they would be auctioned, the government would get the maximum price, and those licensees would pay no licence fees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Of course, that immediately meant that every one of the existing radio licence holders was knocking at the government's door to demand that the anomaly be removed by exempting them from having to pay annual licence fees—which would have been a massive handout to all of the existing radio and television licence holders. Given that these are some of the most profitable companies in Australia—although, admittedly, some of the people involved in the radio industry are small families in the bush and are not large companies—it would have been ridiculous to have given such a massive financial benefit to some of the largest companies in Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The alternative way to overcome the anomaly was to impose the same regime on the new licence holders as has traditionally been placed on the existing radio and television licence holders, which is what the former government said it would do and what this government is now implementing; and this is one of the main reasons we are supporting the proposal which is before the committee at the moment. We think the public should continue to receive that annual payment in licence fees as some return to the community for the exclusive use of that scarce spectrum.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 also clarifies the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to inquire into on&amp;hyphen;line services. This is as a result of some questions being raised about the excellent work that the ABA has been carrying out in investigating the regulation of on&amp;hyphen;line services in Australia. At my request during the life of the former government, the ABA produced a report, which was tabled after the change of government, entitled

          I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and many other members of this House welcome young children and schools being given increased access to many of these high&amp;hyphen;tech pieces of equipment that equip them with better skills for better jobs in their future life, but there are many community concerns about some of the material to which children can easily gain access through the Internet. This has been the subject of a number of stories, some of which have exaggerated and sensationalised the threat. Many parents have quite legitimate concerns about how easy it may be for their children to look up how to make an explosive bomb from agricultural chemicals, or about how some people might use the Internet to transmit photographs involving child pornography, for example.

           While most people think of the Internet these days as a mechanism for transmitting words and data, dangerous information available could include, for example, how to make a bomb. It could also be used to transmit photographs but, in the not too distant future, it will be easier for people to transmit audio signals—and, of course, video is not too far away at all. As a community, we have established quite strict categories for the regulation of film and television, and it would be quite ridiculous for us to have tough regulations on classification and censorship in film and television but to allow a whole new method of communication to develop that bypassed those regulations.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Many complex issues are raised by this, because in many ways it is impossible to regulate the Internet. Australia cannot pass laws which govern the citizens of all the other countries that are connected to the Internet. Despite the complexity, some countries have tried to regulate this and have tried to pass laws which put the onus on the Internet service provider to ensure that there is no illegal, outrageous or dangerous material available through that particular company's access to the Internet.

           There was a great debate in the US Congress about how some conservative members of Congress wanted to make the Internet service providers—companies that provided access to the Internet—legally accountable for any unsavoury material that people could get access to through the Internet. I think quite rightly the US Congress, after a lot of debate, a lot of heat and I am not sure how much light, decided not to go down that path. I understand that in some countries in Europe that debate is still wending its way through their legislatures.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In Australia we have tried to make sure that there is cooperation between the federal government and the state governments on ways that we can make it an offence for people to store and misuse material they may get from the Internet. A number of charges have been laid in recent years arising from this and I think we have to see if we can come up with commonsense ways to ensure that we are doing all we can to protect Australian children without passing laws that are unenforceable or laws that try to impose legal obligations on Internet service providers that are just unworkable.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The long&amp;hyphen;term hope for the side is that a number of the large software companies are developing software filters. I am sure that several members present would be aware of some schools that have developed their own smaller pool within the Internet which simply restricts quite severely the material that young children in a school can access on their school computer equipment, perhaps limiting their access to material that is stored on CD&amp;hyphen;ROMs and other material. That is one way to impose some restrictions on what children at various schools can access, while also giving them the additional training and skills to use this new technology, which is welcome.

           The other issue that is dealt with in the Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is a change to the cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership rules. The change which is proposed in this act is something which the opposition supports. It seeks to make a minor modification to the rules in the way they affect small companies in one particular service area—Brisbane. The difficulty that has arisen in Brisbane involves Australian Provincial Newspapers, a company which owns 4KQ, one of the major radio stations in Brisbane. The company also owns the

            The cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership rules were meant to restrict common ownership between the main radio stations and the main television stations in capital cities and also in country towns. In the case of Brisbane, it was meant to restrict common ownership in the television stations, the radio stations and the main metropolitan dailies of Brisbane.

If we cannot use this occasion in the parliament of Australia to talk about one of the most important debates taking place in our country, then there is something wrong.

          The legislation seeks to amend the cross-media ownership rules which were introduced in 1987. Some people try to say that, in some way, those 1987 rules were meant to punish the Fairfax group. It is true that John Fairfax, after changes in its ownership, did not comply with the cross-media ownership rules and it ended up selling off some of its media assets, as did Rupert Murdoch, and as did the Herald and Weekly Times group. That was because in those cross-media ownership rules we said that no&amp;hyphen;one should be able to own a television station and a radio station, or a television station and a major newspaper in the same city.

The people, such as Mr Howard, who are saying that we need to abolish the cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership rules are saying that in some way that means we will end up with stronger Australian companies. Mr James Packer goes around saying that this will mean that they could export the

          The problem with that theory is that Rupert Murdoch took his company to the rest of the world, and he did that from a very small base. He started in Adelaide with an afternoon newspaper, I think it was. He picked up the

           Daily Telegraph

When he started investing overseas, he was much smaller than Mr Packer is today. Look at the Seven Network: it has recently made a major acquisition in the United States in MGM. Channel 7 is much smaller than Mr Packer is today. This argument that Mr Packer has to swallow more of our media assets so that he can look for opportunities offshore is completely bogus. It is an argument that I hope government members will put to the strongest possible questioning. The clear statements from Mr Stokes and others is that this is an argument that simply does not hold water.

          Before I finish, I would like to say that a few of us, including the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), have been through these debates before. The debate that took place during the last parliament was probably one of the most important decisions that the Keating Labor government made during its time in office. A loophole emerged in the cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership rules that if people were not in control they could build up their cross&amp;hyphen;media shareholdings. We asked the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a report on that loophole. The loophole meant that Mr Packer was able to get more than 15 per cent of Fairfax, as long as he could not be proven to be exercising control. We got independent advice from the ABA. The ABA recommended that we return to the clear number of no more than 15 per cent. That is what we did when we were challenged: we restored the strength of those cross&amp;hyphen;media rules because they are important to Australia.

          We know the pressures that are placed on governments and members when these interests are being discussed and debated. I simply say that I respect the strength and courage which has been shown by a number of members of the government who have spoken out publicly on this very important issue. I hope that, when this debate reaches a conclusion in future months, we will be able to say that, in Australia, no one person can own a television station and a major newspaper in one of our capital cities. I hope at the end of the day we can say that, in Australia, we have kept the integrity of those cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership laws so that we have made sure that debates in Australia are still carried out and reported by a media which is as diverse as possible, given the very high concentration that we already have in Australia.

I think it will be one issue which will tell whether Mr Howard has the courage and the strength

The difference in the value of their shares prior to the media ownership changes and after the media ownership changes was some $2,000 million: a very cogent argument for having destroyed and torn a big hole in the democracy of Australia!

In North Queensland, we have been very blessed with people of great courage and integrity in our media, and Alex Rainey, John Nutting and Kirsty Alfredson are three people who leap to my mind and are associated with the ABC. Whilst the ABC is not involved in what we are talking about today, the preservation of that institution standing upright gives a diversity of ownership that is desperately needed in this country, particularly in light of the damage that was done to democracy in this country by the previous Prime Minister.

In one piece of monumental and almost mind&amp;hyphen;numbing bureaucratic stupidity, not just 100 but hundreds of narrowcast licences in regional Australia were, I am told, handed out to a single person for a charge of $20 per licence.

You may say that we cannot redress without providing compensation, but this is such an absolutely outrageous case that

For tiny towns of 1,000 or 2,000 people, they were being asked for $20,000 from a person who had filled out a form and put up $20. It received, I am told, most certainly over 100 of these licences throughout Australia.

         On the issue of providing licences for some of these small towns, the bureaucracy controlling this area is not taking a sensible and flexible approach to the granting of these licences. With the proposal before the House that owners of radio stations now be able to have an interest in newspapers, there has to be some flexibility and sense built into the system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That particularly applies in country Queensland where we had the ridiculous situation where none of the locally owned radio stations could get the licence to provide the TAB service to the people. We went for three years without that. When the bureaucracy eventually got around to making a decision on that, it gave the TAB of Queensland exclusive rights to that coverage, thus tearing a big hole in the little locally&amp;hyphen;owned regional radio stations throughout Queensland. I do not think good judgment was exercised there at all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A further issue on the subject of television is that television broadcasters pay a common fee. They pay a licence fee to the government, but really what the government has given them is a monopoly that is controlled by three people. That is an enormously powerful asset.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would not be hypocritical enough to say that we should listen to Mr Hilmer, but it seems to me that the decision makers in this place take their riding instructions from him. It seems to me that those riding instruction are always the wrong ones—they do not take the good ones. However, if we were to take the principles of those policies seriously three people would not be given the licence to print money through the ownership of these three licences. The most common fee paid by the TV broadcasters is very low compared with the enormous benefits that flow from the three&amp;hyphen;man ownership of this Australian monopoly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That monopoly was produced by the decision making of the people opposite when they were in government. They stand condemned for moving towards the situation we have today where we have three networks, and regional television has almost ceased to exist in Australia. It has been destroyed. As our image of ourselves in regional Australia has been destroyed, so too has the soul of the people of regional Australia. Members opposite can take responsibility for that.

         A recent survey of young people in Australia asked them to list the 20 most famous people they knew of and looked up to in Australia. Not one Australian was listed amongst the 20 people that they knew of and looked up to.

         Finally, in canvassing these issues today there are two other issues that need to be addressed and I would be doing a great disservice to the people of Kennedy if I did not address them. In the western towns of Queensland, while some of those towns can pick up the satellite pay television, most of the people there have mean incomes that are so low that it would be very difficult for them to pay for pay television and the vast bulk of those towns cannot get pay television anyway. There needs to be some flexibility built into the system to allow us to take the pay television signal down to earth and relay it. There are some new technologies that will allow that but in my discussions with the licensing authority for Australia, I really have had a very large level of ignorance and a very low level of helpfulness so I would have to speak with some criticism of the officials and the department in that area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second issue relating to television licensing that we are discussing here today is the fact that all of those western towns in Queensland can receive channel 7 and channel 9 albeit without the advertising. There are little gaps in there and we just have a blank television screen where the advertising should be. But in places where we have very few recreational pursuits—entertainment is a better word—available to us then television becomes a very important entertainment resource to us. We have no local picture theatres, we have no theatre—not that too many people would go to theatre—we have none of those things in these country towns and yet we do have channel 9 and channel 7. The existing laws do not allow us to pick up those television broadcasts and there is just no reason or logic attached to that. There was in days past when channel 0 was up on the satellite by itself and put a very special satellite service into regional Australia. Maybe there needs to be some protection for that but really the way the situation is working at the present moment, I would find it very difficult to argue against the people's right to be able to take the channel 9 and channel 7 service that they can get right now. But they are not allowed to because of the laws that exist in Australia. A person in Brisbane is able to get the four channels but a person in Julia Creek is only able to get one channel and that is channel 0.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In days past, there was a full television crew out in Mount Isa. I do not wish to criticise channel 0 and the people that are in Mount Isa today work very hard but it is no longer a proper journalist set&amp;hyphen;up where the journalists go all over the countryside picking up news items from western Queensland. That situation no longer exists in central Queensland or in the mid&amp;hyphen;west of north Queensland. The arguments that existed before are not there today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, an excellent charitable institution in the state of Queensland operates in my electorate and they unfortunately got caught as one of the COT cases. When we talk about communications and fairness to everybody—as we are talking here about fairness to everybody by allowing a regional newspaper to go into towns and the television broadcaster's most common fee—we are trying to establish laws that are fair to everybody. There are some really dreadful problems in there with the big institutions. If there is any watering down of the media ownership rules and the ownership of the media becomes more centralised, we then have huge institutions that become not only unreactive but enormously oppressive. In this terrible case, it was admitted in the Senate estimates that $7 million has been spent fighting 20 or 30 of these COT cases, one of whom is a charitable institution in the state of Queensland, looking after crippled children. When institutions get big, not only do they become unreactive, but they also become oppressive.

          —in reply—It is my task to briefly sum up these three amendments. They have been agreed to by the opposition and I gave detailed second reading speeches in the chamber some time ago. We are pleased that the opposition has joined us and that these bills will go through. I might make a few remarks about some of the things that were discussed.

         The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) talked about the issue with regard to on&amp;hyphen;line services. That is not part of this legislative package. I want to point out to the Main Committee that the issues that he was talking about are in a piece of legislation that has been introduced into the Senate and is yet to come to this place. His remarks, all the same, were well made on access to Internet and protection. How one might limit access to some of the activities that one might find on the Internet is an issue that each member in this place would be concerned about. Most certainly, the government is and the minister is as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other point that he made, and he did wander a little, was about the cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership change in this piece of legislation that relates to an uninfluential newspaper being in the same market as a radio station. This amendment is designed to correct that position, primarily in Ipswich in Queensland, and he accepts that. He went on to make other comments about cross&amp;hyphen;media ownership and related those back to 1987.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have some regard for the member for Dobell. He was a former minister and did chair a rather well&amp;hyphen;known committee into media law. His comments are noted, but he would not expect me to comment on those matters other than to say that these are issues actively being considered by the government at this time. There have been comments made by many and sundry. I am sure that will continue. That is the nature of the debate which is being held but the government, once it has fully consulted within the government and with all its members and more broadly in the community, will make a decision in the broader public interest.

         The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made a well&amp;hyphen;informed contribution about these matters.

They will be able to address some of those issues more directly.

         You made one point about narrowcast licensing. I was not aware of that issue. I would make the point that narrowcast licensing is somewhat qualitatively different to radio licensing in that they receive what is known as a transmitter licence from the Spectrum Management Agency and attract a cost recovery fee. I do not recall what the limitations are under the act, even though I was the one who brought it into the parliament in about 1991 on behalf of the opposition. I am sure that matter will be subject to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) reviewing some of the issues with the SMA later this year or in 1998. That matter will, I am sure, be taken up and answered to your satisfaction. I thank you for drawing that matter to our attention.

         There are a few observations that I would like to make in respect of the dairy industry and my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) will be following me in making some comments. It is worth pointing out that, whilst this bill provides for an increase in the levy to be paid to the Australian Animal Health Council to ensure that the AAHC and the system around it is capable of maintaining and furthering Australia's animal health standards, the legislation does not provide at this point for an increase in the levy. It simply makes it possible for the industry to apply to the government for the right to do this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I would say to the industry is that when it comes to the point that they are looking for an increase in the levy, and knowing full well that such an increase is accompanied by a government matching contribution—don't hold your breath. From what I have seen from the fine print of last night's budget, particularly in the allocation to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the allocations are all on the downward slope, not the upward slope.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is one thing we will have to be cognisant of—and I put the government on notice now on this matter—if we are to proceed with the extraordinary rate of progress that has been made in this industry. I note from current statistics that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has provided in the second reading speech that we have now reached production levels of nine billion litres of milk per year in the dairy industry and we now have exports of the order of 50 per cent of that production. Assuming that we are now in the stage where those exports are profitable, it should be remembered that when Labor's reform of the dairy industry began back in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, much of Australia's export produce from the dairy industry was significantly subsidised by the domestic consumer. We have now turned that around and are on a forward path.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key point I make about that is that the science is vital. I think that is well understood by the farm community. It is understood by government, I hope. So when it does come to the point that the industry is proposing an increase in the levy and that means, therefore, an increase in the budget allocation to that science to ensure that the Animal Health Council and the research that flows off it is available, then there should be no penny&amp;hyphen;pinching about this on the part of the Treasurer (Mr Costello).
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to foreshadow a concern that, given the trend of budget provisions, particularly as they affect primary industry, this does not sound as straightforward and as easy to win as we might think. So, it is on notice to the government as one of the matters we will be committing to because we want to emphasise the importance of this commitment to research and development of science in the development of the industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While I am speaking about the dairy industry, I could not avoid making some observations on some of the allocations in the budget announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last night. They pertained very relevantly to people in the dairy industry. The first thing I want to make an observation about is what I call the `great savings con'. What we saw announced last night was that a previously committed and opposition guaranteed contribution to the incomes of farmers and farmworkers in the form of superannuation contributions to be made by the government, has been snatched away. And it is interesting to note that an ordinary farmworker about 30 years of age working through to age 60, be it a dairy farmworker on wages around the level that dairy farmworkers get—and we all know what they are—would have received
         <break page="3622" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

We are talking about an industry in some parts of Australia which is facing very severe weather patterns and a food crisis at the moment. In fact, it is spending all its savings buying feed for stock that cannot now be fed. So how on earth are those people going to ever qualify for any of the Treasurer's great savings rebate?

         In speaking to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill, I endorse the words of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). He talked about the importance of this levy and the importance of ensuring that Australia's animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet both consumer needs and market requirements in domestic and international markets. As he went on to point out, the Animal Health Service is jointly funded and jointly owned by the states and the Commonwealth government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill is about raising the ceiling on the amount of levy that can be charged on the dairy industry. It is not actually about raising the levy per se, but it does recognise that the current level of levy is very close to the previous maximum research levy rate and, therefore, it is important to allow that flexibility and scope for an industry that chooses to increase its contribution to research to be able to do so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I was amazed by the extraordinary insinuations that the member for Burke came up with, suggesting that, if the dairy industry actually increased its contributions, he was not sure that the government would match it. That is a load of nonsense. He then went on with some
         <break page="3625" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          convoluted logic about finding the money from part of the budget, but not the part of the budget that he said it should find it from. Again, that seems to be utter nonsense. Really, we expected better from him in his contribution to this debate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also make some reference in passing to the fact that the member for Burke made another extraordinary claim about the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) by saying that he had made no comment about the current seasonal difficulties that are facing dairy farmers in his region. I can say that I happened to hear on the radio in the last couple of weeks the member for Gippsland drawing attention to that very fact. I suggest to the member for Burke that he ought to do a bit more research and that he ought to do his homework instead of coming in here and making absolutely nonsensical statements which only go to show one thing: how totally ignorant he is about the whole issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other point that we ought to draw attention to is that in last night's budget there was a tremendous announcement about the whole question of quarantine and the contribution that the Commonwealth is making to quarantine. This very much reinforces the government's commitment to the dairy industry, because we all know how important it is to have a really first class quarantine service that will in fact ensure that, when we talk about animal health and about reaping the benefits of the research from such things as the dairy produce levy, they do not in fact get lost because we have not maintained the world's best quarantine standards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That contribution is very welcome. It is a very big plus and it shows, most significantly, that we have a government that recognises how important it is in primary industries—and the dairy industry in particular—to ensure that we do maintain very high standards. I commend the minister for that initiative. I believe that it shows again that the government is very much in touch with the needs of the dairy industry and also very much recognises that we have to maintain the highest standards possible and not allow industries such as the dairy industry to risk the importation of some disease that could put at risk not only our domestic consumers but also our very significant export markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will now take up some of the issues that the minister talked about in his second reading speech. He spoke about the significant growth in recent years in the dairy industry, with milk production in the current financial year expected to exceed nine billion litres for the first time on record, which is a tremendous achievement. But, as he pointed out, half of this production will be exported, with the value of exports expected to be about $1.8 billion. That is a fantastic achievement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will expand on those comments of the minister and talk about them from the local perspective of, in particular, the south&amp;hyphen;west area of Victoria—which I have the great honour to represent and which is also shared by my colleague and good friend the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). What we have seen in the dairy industry in the south&amp;hyphen;west corner of Victoria is enormous changes over the past 80 years, and what we are now looking at is a very significant industry that makes very significant contributions not only to the economy of Victoria but also to the economy of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Victorian dairy industry is now producing about 62 per cent of Australia's milk; but, better and more significant than that, is the fact that it is also producing about 85 per cent of Australia's dairy exports. The Victorian dairy industry is the state's largest decentralised industry, adding about $5 billion to the economy. As I have pointed out already, Victoria is the largest dairying state. We have more dairy farmers, more dairy cows, more milk produced and more butter, cheese and milk powder manufactured than in all other states combined. In
         <break page="3626" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          fact, the south&amp;hyphen;west diary industry, which is just one part of Victoria, is larger than the combined dairy industries of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, and the flow&amp;hyphen;on benefits to local industries and to the local economy are enormous. But not only that: it is a very efficient industry. As the Boston Consulting Group found in 1993, our dairy industry is among the producers of lowest&amp;hyphen;cost milk, by world standards, and we rank alongside New Zealand.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, the contribution that dairy farmers make to the community is very significant. The average farmer spends around $2,400 a week on farm input and services. This has a major impact in a local community. The growth that has been achieved by farmers in the region is very impressive. Over the last 10 years, Victorian dairy herds have increased almost 40 per cent to average 143 cows per dairy. They are forecast to average around 200 cows in four to five years time. These are fantastic achievements. This is fantastic growth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing to note about the dairy industry in Australia is that the production per cow over the last 25 years has literally doubled. I listened to an eminent scientist talking about this who went on to suggest that not only has that been achieved; there is also an expectation that production will double again over the next 25 years. It really is an industry that has a very proud record of achievement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also significant to note the input to the local community. For every 100 jobs in the dairy industry, there are another 110 created in associated activities. To put it another way, for every dollar of farm output, there is another $2.80 worth of goods and services created as a result of dairy processing and associated activities. As a result, in the south&amp;hyphen;west region of Victoria, the dairy industry is responsible for the employment of around 10,000 people. South&amp;hyphen;west Victoria produces around 30 per cent of Victoria's milk from around 2,000 herds and under 400,000 cows.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing to note is the sheer size of investment in the region. This is an industry of great significance, but also an industry of confidence. Recently we have seen Bonlac spend $50 million at Cobden in my electorate. We have seen Murray&amp;hyphen;Goulburn spend $35 million at Koroit in my electorate. Warrnambool Cheese and Butter is spending around $50 million over five years in their expansion. Nestle, also in Warrnambool, is undergoing a $30 million expansion. These are big investments and they show that this industry has significant confidence and is a major contributor, not only to my region of the state of Victoria, but also to the whole state and, indeed, to the whole nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The clean and green reputation of this region puts the local dairy industry in a prime position to make the most of opportunities in the increasing export demand in Asia. It is worth noting just how significant this export demand is. As the Asian region becomes more affluent and seeks alternatives, such as more dairy products, we are seeing that the opportunities are enormous. For example, while the average Japanese currently eats 1&amp;half; kilograms of cheese per year, this is expected to increase to 2&amp;half; kilograms by the year 2000. That will mean an additional 120,000 tonnes in exports and it is obvious that much of this will come from Victoria.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing to pay tribute to is the dairy community, which has shown that it can respond to challenges. These people are not waiting for it to happen; they are working to make it happen. We have seen the challenges that will be there for the future. We obviously have to continue to seek new export markets and that is being done. We still have to deal, as a national government, with attacking some of the problems of the incentive programs—as they
         <break page="3627" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          are called by other countries, such as the United States—and how we can best make sure that, through the World Trade Organisation, our dairy farmers are not disadvantaged by some of the trade barriers that still exist in the world.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nonetheless, if you look at our share of the world dairy trade, it has more than tripled since the 1980s. It has gone from three per cent to 10 per cent. It is quite an impressive record. In fact, I would suggest it is an extremely impressive record and one that all Australians ought to be made more aware of.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Interestingly, despite all the opportunities in Asia, if the Australian dairy industry continues to increase at its current rate, our market share in Asia will actually decline. In other words, while we are continuing to improve our performance and the volume and value of our exports, the opportunities are so great that we are going to have difficulty in meeting those opportunities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another thing to note about the region is that in 1977 there were 8,500 dairy farms in the region. Twenty years later—this year—that figure has dropped by around 6,000 but, despite this, productivity has continued to increase by about three per cent per year. I think it is also worth looking at some of the ways that the industry has not only made these great strides but is continuing to do so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look, for example, at some of the ways that the south&amp;hyphen;west is positioning itself for the 21st century we will see a number of things that I think are very impressive. For example, under the property management planning funding we will see local farmsmart coordinators being appointed. They will work with the dairy farmers and with risk managers to look at the best ways of risk management to cope with some of the unavoidable seasonal difficulties. This is the positive way that the local dairy farmers are setting about to look at some of the difficulties that the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) seemed to want to dwell on so much. Rather than taking his negative, pessimistic view, they are looking forward and taking a positive approach to see how they can better improve their lot and manage those sorts of risks.

         We have the WestVic Dairy, which has several projects running looking at both the scientific and the human side of the industry. We have seven Focus Farms up and running between Swan Marsh and across to Mount Gambier in South Australia, and the information that is gained from these farms is being transferred through support farmers and to the communities. We have the Target 10 program, which is all about increasing pasture productivity and optimising pasture development—again a very significant project. We have the farmsmart program and we also have the Demo Dairy which was recently set up just outside Terang. That is another example of just how the dairy industry can in fact ensure itself that it is doing the very things that are needed to improve the productivity and consolidate the position of the dairy industry in the region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As well as that, there has been an enormous amount of work undertaken by the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the WestVic Dairy—as I mentioned—and Glenormiston Agricultural College and the South West College of TAFE are in the region. All of these factors are ensuring that we have a strong, vibrant, healthy, growing industry that is taking up the challenges of the future and is not sitting back saying `Look what we have achieved so far' because they recognise that they have to continue.

         One of the interesting spin&amp;hyphen;offs, or side developments, is the Acme field days. Here again is an example of this region taking up the challenge in the dairy industry and building a very

          successful field day. It only started 15 years ago and has gone from 20 exhibits in the first year to 450 this year. I was very proud to have the opportunity to open these field days because I think they are one of the highlights of the agricultural agenda of the year in my region. From around 600 visitors in the first year the number now exceeds 20,000 at the field days—it is now the biggest dairy field day in Australia and is also recognised internationally.

         These are the sorts of achievements that have been going on in my region. I cannot overlook the achievements of the Warrnambool cheese and butter factory itself, a cooperative that has been extremely successful and has moved with the times. As I mentioned earlier, it is in the process of undergoing a $50 million expansion. Some of that has already been done but in five years that is a tremendous achievement. The Warrnambool cheese and butter factory began in 1888 and it has expanded every year. The new expansion that it has just announced is going to serve 600 suppliers. That is an example of a cooperative that can actually make sure that it is not only in tune with today's needs but is planning for the future.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the dairy industry in my region, in fact in Australia, is an industry that has been one of the quiet achievers in the Australian economy. It has been a quiet achiever because it is made up of people who want to get on and make the future happen rather than just letting it happen. Therefore this bill, which allows the opportunity for the industry to increase its efforts into research, is to be commended. It quite clearly shows that the dairy industry has recognised the value of the research which, of course, is matched on a dollar for dollar basis by the Commonwealth government, and it recognises the importance of increasing that effort.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Most importantly, it recognises that if an industry is to be able to continue to be competitive and to expand into markets in Asia, in particular, and elsewhere, it has to have access to the best research it can afford. I commend the industry for being forward looking in this. I believe that its contribution to the Australian economy will continue to grow. Most significantly, I believe that the south&amp;hyphen;west dairy region of Victoria—in my electorate—is going to continue to be a leader in the dairy industry in Australia.

          —The opposition's position on the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1997 has been explained to this House by the shadow minister for primary industries, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). Let me reiterate the introductory remarks in the explanatory memorandum that the purpose of this bill is to establish a statutory levy mechanism to fund the dairy industry's contribution to the Australian Animal Health Council and to double the maximum research levy rate specified in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act of 1986. The Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill of 1997 establishes a new levy—the Australian Animal Health Council levy—which is to be imposed on milk producers to fund the dairy industry's contribution to the Australian Animal Health Council.

          —Dairy farmers throughout the length and breadth of this country will tell you that it was the Kerin plan that set up the prosperity of the Australian dairy industry, followed by the Crean plan, and supplemented by the measures of Labor governments. Those are the things that have propelled this industry to the forefront of rural industry in this nation today. I can understand that the sheep man over there, the honourable member for Corangamite—I stood against him in 1984 for the seat of Corangamite—is a bit testy on this.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me give you a bit of history, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the 1984 campaign, John Kerin and I went into the Heytesbury settlement, which was then in the electorate of Corangamite but is now in the electorate of the honourable member for Wannon. We went to a meeting of dairy farmers in the Heytesbury shire hall. They had been stirred up by the honourable member for Corangamite and his cohorts in the Liberal Party. Indeed, if they had had a rope there that day, they probably would have hanged us.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We delivered a fairly blunt message to them but it was a visionary message and one that has set the industry up for the prosperity that it enjoys today. We simply said to them, `We don't like the fact that over the next 10 to 15 years many dairy farmers are going to be restructured out of this industry. But there is a window of opportunity and you have to restructure and prepare yourself for the competition that is going to come from New Zealand and from the changes that are going to occur in the domestic and the international marketing environments.' We were opposed at that time bitterly by the honourable member for Corangamite and his cohorts, the rural Liberals, throughout the length and breadth of Victoria. If we had not had the vision, the political commitment and the will to restructure this industry, the prosperity that it enjoys today would simply not be there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those are the facts of the matter. Looking at 13 years of Labor government, not only did we introduce the great plans that restructured and repositioned this industry for the prosperity that it enjoys today, but we were the government that opened up the international marketplace where previous coalition administrations had failed miserably. We were the government that provided the labour market assistance programs that saw 1,000 dairy industry traineeships raised under the Working Nation program. It is the present government which has taken that away from the dairy industry in Victoria and the dairy industry in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The honourable member for Wannon has the temerity and the gall, if I might be so presumptuous—without going outside the bounds of propriety in this debate—to mention the Demo Dairy. The Demo Dairy in his electorate was funded under the regional development program that was abolished by the Howard government in its first budget. The one initiative that he stands up for in this particular chamber, where he says to the dairy farmers of Australia, `What a magnificent initiative this is,' we funded in the previous Labor government. His government abolished the very scheme under which we funded it.

         It is an industry which has undergone significant adjustment over the past 20 or 30 years. The farms are fewer, and the farmers are fewer, but the farms are producing more milk than they did in the 1970s. That structural adjustment has resulted from the introduction of new technologies and reduced levels of assistance over time that have forced the industry into looking for greater efficiencies and greater productivities. Those structural adjustments have been brought about also by changes in domestic and international marketing environments.

         I can recall past days—as does the honourable member for Corangamite; we were reminiscing over in the corner. He is a sheep man now but he assures me that in his younger days he did the same thing as I did—milked the cows by hand. The herds were small, the farms were small and the output was delivered to the factories in cans. The production of fodder on farms was done by a lot of labour associated with that dairy farming operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my father's day and in my day on the farm in the Western District, the great technological innovation was milking machines. The government of the day, which was a Liberal government, actually gave a subsidy to dairy farmers to put in stainless steel vats to assist in the storage of milk on farms before its collection. Times have changed. If you go to a dairy farm today there is massive capital investment in new technologies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the particular area in which our farm was situated, the surrounding farms have been amalgamated into one farm and a rotolactor dairy now milks around 350 cows in an irrigated farm operation which is extremely productive. If you look at the production of fodder on farm,
         <break page="3631" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          you will see that a lot of that can be done now by one or two people with the fodder being stored in round bales on the farm and being produced with heavy equipment. Times have really changed in this industry and massive increases in productivity have come with the changes.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at the outlook for the industry, generally it is projected to expand over the medium term in response to rising world demand, especially in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. The outlook for the industry comes off the back of the improved skills of dairy farmers and it comes off the back of improved herds and breeding programs and the introduction of new capital equipment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As far as the manufactured milk sector is concerned, there is a positive outlook in that sector. Growth in milk production, which has been alluded to already in the debate, will be used mainly in the manufacture of butter, cheese, milk products, milk powders and other milk products. Unfortunately, the sales of market milk are not forecast to rise dramatically, but the big growth will be in the sales of manufactured milk and in the export of cheeses and other milk powders.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We look also to the spectacular exporting performance of this industry. We note also that exports are expected to rise in the medium to longer term. That reflects the increase in production which has taken place in the dairy industry today, the relatively small demand that will be generated in the domestic market and, more particularly, the spectacular growth which is predicted in the South&amp;hyphen;East Asian market for manufactured milk products.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The important impact the dairying industry has on key regional areas in Australia and in my state of Victoria has already been alluded to in this debate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The dairy industry does provide direct employment on farms. It is a source of extensive value added employment in country areas in the Western District, Gippsland and Goulburn Valley, with the great manufacturing production cooperatives and, of course, it is an important source of private investment. We have seen the trend to small value adding on farms. I was at the recent alternative farm vision expo in Geelong and one of the winners in that expo was a small concern producing specialty cheeses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the industry faces challenging external conditions in the longer term. It still faces heavy competition from New Zealand, from the policies of the European Union with its heavily subsidised cheese exports, and from the US farm support programs which provide subsidised exports into our traditional markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Burke alluded to the fact that he and I had recently visited a very important dairy production area in Gippsland in the state of Victoria. We met with local farm representatives in the Morwell area who have been experiencing severe drought conditions. They have experienced abnormal rain patterns and this has meant that farmers have not been able to harvest fodder on farms, fodder stocks in the region are nearly exhausted and external sources of fodder are drying up as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I gave a commitment to the dairy farmers of that area that I would raise this matter on the floor of the parliament to see if we could excite the interest of the federal minister, as the state minister for agriculture had not even paid the dairy farmers of Gippsland the courtesy of visiting there in a time of desperate need for them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some farmers in the Gippsland region are spending upwards of $1,000 a day to maintain fodder supplies for their herds and they are going into debt to do this. The herds in the area are in danger as a result of the climatic conditions that have existed there and the situation
         <break page="3632" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          will not really be improved by the breaking of the drought. The existing provisions of the national drought policy do not permit the exceptional circumstance provisions of the scheme to be brought to bear in the case of the Gippsland farmers. There is, however, a strong case for assistance to be provided on the basis of the severity of the crisis that these dairy farmers are facing and the rare climatic circumstances that have prevailed up to this time. Despite the recent rains, the problems for these farmers still exist.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The effects of this situation have been heavy financial burdens falling on dairy farmers in that region and a rundown in the quality of their herds. Sharefarmers have walked off properties and rural businesses in the Gippsland towns have been affected. As a result, there is a severe adverse regional economic impact pending in the Gippsland area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I mention that in the hope that the Victorian agriculture minister takes another look at the plight being faced by the Gippsland dairy farmers and, perhaps with the federal minister, engage in some discussions as to how the plight of these farmers, and others who face rare and exceptional circumstances, can be accommodated within the ambit of the national drought scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last week I visited the Goulburn Valley and met with a local UDV representative, Alan Burgess, and I discussed with him a range of issues related to dairy farmers in his region. Those matters ranged across features of local production; competition in the manufactured milk sector in the region; the recent anthrax outbreak in the Goulburn Valley; the supply of quality water for manufacturing milk production; health and education issues affecting farmers; research and development funding, and the need to constantly work on improvement to costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, most interestingly, what featured in our discussion was the manner in which the dairy industry in Victoria had utilised labour market programs under the previous Labor government. They had raised 1,000 dairy industry traineeships in the past three years. The industry has recognised the importance of having a stream of skilled young people coming into the industry and assisting in its productivity improvements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These positions were abolished, as I mentioned earlier, by the first Howard budget when it cut $1.8 billion from labour market programs, and it has cut further labour market assistance in the current budget. I will not dwell on the matters in the budget that will affect the dairy farmers because the Deputy Speaker who sat in the chair previously did get a bit testy when these issues were raised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will return once again to the basic proposition that I started with, that coalition members get up in this parliament and talk till they are blue in the face about what a great economic state this industry is in and what a magnificent contribution it makes to the Victorian regional economy, to the national economy and to the national export effort. The member for Corangamite, do yourself and your party and the parliament the courtesy of getting up now and acknowledging the plans that were implemented by Labor governments that have brought prosperity to this industry.

I draw to his attention the fact that whilst he was lucky to get out alive from the Heytesbury shire hall at his meeting with Minister Kerin, I likewise was lucky to get out alive on two occasions in the Colac hall after meetings with the UDV. Some of the views presented there were very strongly held by members of the UDV and dairy farmers in that region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the record, the Kerin plan basically had the concept correct. The plan was that the dairy industry should export to those markets that provided a competitive price and that the fresh milk market was no longer the be all and end all of the dairy industry. Like the member for Corio, I battled long and hard to bring about a better export focus for the dairy industry. I have said on the public record that I agreed with the Kerin plan and, in general, I fought a battle with members of the UDV at that time as they campaigned to maintain a protected domestic market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Corio would recall those arguments quite well. Mr Kerin fought a lengthy battle, particularly with the state of Victoria and with those farmers who wished to maintain the fresh milk market premium rather than sell on the overseas market, which at that time was not all that lucrative. I refute the claim that I did not support the Kerin plan. I have put on the record my support for the Kerin plan and its eventual outcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, I draw a distinction between Mr Kerin and the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The member for Hotham considered himself to be an outward looking minister in the previous government but has had a turnaround on the tariff debate in recent times. The member for Hotham has completely changed his former free trading approach to the dairy industry, the TCF industry and the car industry. He has been converted to an internal, high wall tariff supporter when formerly he was very strongly supporting lowering the tariff position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I ask the member for Corio to get himself on the record as to where he stands on these issues since he is so clearly a free-trader for the dairy industry, an industry that has to meet world market conditions—the uneven playing field of the EC producers, the uneven playing field of the Canadian producers, and the uneven playing field of the American producers who are supported by the USA taxpayers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I acknowledge that the member for Corio does know something about the dairy industry, unlike the shadow minister. At least the member for Corio has some hands&amp;hyphen;on experience. I accept the view that seasonal conditions are difficult in Gippsland, but I am not sure that the former government or the current government could bring about a change in rainfall in Gippsland or in western Victoria.

         The Australian Animal Health Council is a positive development in the formation of a national body to oversee animal health policy around Australia. As other members have mentioned, the recent anthrax outbreaks in northern Victoria highlight the need for a strong emphasis on animal health issues, especially for Australia, which has traditionally benefited from a clean, green, disease free image. We need to defend this image and make sure we have a national policy to maintain this island as genuinely disease free, in most cases, in our animal industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the hands&amp;hyphen;on management of the disease outbreaks remains with state governments and health authorities, the Australian Animal Health Council now exists as a national policy coordinating role. I again commend that conceptual arrangement. The council is an unlisted public company, formed on 18 August 1995 by a meeting of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again, I commend the attitude that it is a commercial organisation, funded in a commercial way with commercial objectives. It has a broad role to advise the industry and the government on animal health issues, to develop and maintain a national animal health information system, and to develop and manage animal health programs around Australia. Previously, as I have said, there was no national animal health body to advise and assist the Australian animal health service system to maintain acceptable national health standards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The membership of the Australian Animal Health Council is comprised of the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments and industry bodies. All livestock and animal related primary industries have agreed to contribute to the funding of the organisation. I list them for the record. They are: the Chicken Meat Federation, the Egg Industry Association, the Dairy Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Pork Council of Australia, the Sheep Meat Council of Australia, the Australian Horse Council and the Wool Council of Australia. Many members of the House would have had some association with those particular groups in relation to animal health problems and some of their policies with regard to imports and exports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was agreed that the various industries would contribute to the Animal Health Council roughly in proportion to the numbers of livestock for which they are responsible. Up until now, the dairy industry has funded its contribution through reserves, but the industry felt that in the future the most effective way to fund its contribution was through a transparent levy on producers. I think this is an acceptable way to go, that research and development and animal health issues are funded in this way for the general good of the industry. The resolution passed by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation states:

         The amount of the levy on dairy farmers will be modest. Again, I think that is important. There is always a tendency for these levies to rise. It has been estimated by the Australian Dairy Industry Council that the average dairy farmer will pay about $20 per year towards the council.
         <break page="3635" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Again, I support that general concept that this would be a small amount for each dairy farmer to pay to maintain a disease free status here in Australia.

         The second part of the bill relates to the doubling of the maximum research levy which may be prescribed. The money raised by the research levy on the dairy corporation goes to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation for the purpose of conducting R&amp;D for the benefit of the industry as a whole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The maximum of the levy at present is 2.3c per kilogram, milk, butterfat equivalent. It had been set at or near the rate for some three or four years at the industry's request that the maximum rate be raised. Again, the industry has made the request rather than the government. There is now a realisation that we have reached a ceiling and if the Dairy Research and Development Corporation is to respond to the needs of the industry in the future, the levy must be increased modestly. The industry has requested the levy be increased so the initiative comes from the representatives of farmers and the processors themselves—again not from the government. It is important to realise that, although the maximum allowable rate of levy will be doubled, the actual levy charge will rise only slightly.

         I have here a letter from the Chief Executive Officer of the Dairy Industry Council, Helen Dornom, to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, dated 19 June 1996, which sets out the case for the increase. She says in that letter:

         Whilst recommending the change to the maximum, the ADIC is not at this stage foreshadowing an increase in the research levy, but simply allowing for an increase over and above the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 research levy. According to the Australian Dairy Industry Council, they would like the levy to be set at 2.9c per kilogram, that equivalent a modest rise but one which is necessary if the Dairy Research and Development Corporation is to continue its good work. Apart from the market support levy, the research levy is the most significant paid by dairy farmers. They also pay a promotion levy for generic and domestic and overseas promotion and a corporation levy which goes to fund the Australian Dairy Corporation. These levies are considerably smaller than the research levy of 2.3c per kilogram of milk fat equivalent.

         Whilst I have had some reservations about promotion levies, statutory marketing arrangements and all those things—the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) would understand—I do think there is a case for the industry providing resources to protect its disease free status and encourage further research in the whole area of animal welfare and animal disease control, especially in view of the export potential from the dairy industry.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I just add to the remarks of my good friend and colleague the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) who made some observations about the dairy industry in western Victoria, which is really a very important part of the dairy industry of Australia, with respect to my colleague from Lyne. I think we provide about half the dairy product from Australia and, over the last two decades, there have been quite remarkable changes in the way in which the dairy industry has been structured. We had some interchange with the member for Corio about the attitude of the industry in relation to the Kerin plan and there is an emphasis on the dairy industry now being an export industry with the capacity to provide very good returns to those producers without relying on the fresh milk market.
        </para>
        <break page="3636" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am reliant on the Outlook Conference of 1996 for material that I will use to make some broader observations on the industry. The number of farmers have halved over the last two decades. The number of cows are down 20 per cent and, of course, with the introduction of supplementary feeding and improved genetics, the dairy industry has improved quite remarkably. Australia and New Zealand are low cost countries in terms of production and compete very favourably with every other country around the world.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the significant things that people tend to overlook is that we do not have the problem of a northern winter where the dairy cattle are housed for three months. Our dairy cattle have free range conditions and I think that gives us a tremendous comparative advantage and a big international comparative advantage in our ability to sell the product competitively. So Australia and New Zealand now move into the demand and supply position in terms of milk products around the world. The free trade rules under GATT and the Uruguay Round introduced in 1995 have provided that there are reductions of subsidies in northern America and in Europe, so Australian dairy farmers are now, under the Kerin plan which I acknowledge, able to compete favourably on the world market without the unlevel playing field subsidised by taxpayers in Europe and taxpayers in northern America.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I make the observation that the dairy industry is competing on the world markets, handling the ups and downs of the price which just in recent months has dropped a little bit although long&amp;hyphen;term expectations are encouraging. I draw the obvious comparison of this industry in the electorate of the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), in my electorate, the electorate of Wannon and in Gippsland in Victoria where they are competing on the world market, no matter what, with the automobile industry which still enjoys a tariff protection of 22 per cent and the TCF industries which enjoy protection levels of 37 per cent and are protected from the vicissitudes of international trade.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I note the comment of the member for Wannon when he was talking about the total production of nine billion litres of milk. That is a far cry from the restrictive attitudes of policy makers that we would only produce five billion litres of milk in Australia if we did not export. The attitude was that we would supply the domestic market and if we managed to do that at a profitable rate, then we would move to the export market if it suited us. The changes that have been brought about by the Hilmer competitive arrangements in terms of fresh milk again have contributed to that. This debate was going on during the 1980s when fresh milk was sold at a regulated price. Now there is a movement by all state authorities under the Hilmer competition policy that the fresh milk price will tend to be regulated over the next three or four years and will be integrated into an export price.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Certainly the liberalised trade, as I say, around the world has ensured that the dairy farmers are meeting the expectations of markets in Asia. They are getting profits out of this expanding market of South Korea, of Japan and of other emerging Asian nations that have the capacity to buy these dairy products. That is a far cry from a domestically orientated market industry that concentrated purely on the high profit fresh milk market of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, and Adelaide to a lesser degree. It now has an export industry based in the electorates of Wannon, Corangamite, Gippsland and in the seat of Murray. Of course the other states provide, broadly speaking, milk product for the domestic population with some export markets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think the dairy industry is a great example of an industry that has made some fundamental changes, reinvested in the processing facilities, utilised the grain feeding and supplementary

           feeding of their animals, improved production through increased genetics, been prepared to make changes and been prepared to meet export market requirements in terms of quality and price. From a situation in the early 1980s where the arguments and the orientation were for maintaining a domestic market focus, they have now moved to be a very profitable export industry providing export earnings on the world market for Australian farmers and Australian consumers.

He made reference to the fact that, whenever legislation about the dairy industry is being debated in this place, members of the coalition, particularly members of the National Party, are always in here crowing about what a great industry it is. Of course, we are in here crowing about what a great industry it is. The former member for Murray and shadow minister for primary industry, Bruce Lloyd, represented an area in Victoria that has probably more dairy farmers in it than what there are in New South Wales. It is a very important industry to our constituency.

He is correct again. We have never argued that or disputed that. We have supported it. At the end of the first I think it was seven years of the Kerin plan, when it was being renegotiated—I think the then minister for primary industries may have been the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)—it was supported—

I instance the US here and the dairy export incentive program that it had from time to time. There are also the current arrangements under the CAP in the European Union. The member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) highlighted the fact that for half the year or more the dairy herds in those European countries are housed indoors and are grain fed.

We have seen what happened with world beef consumption as a result of mad cow disease in Britain. It was not anywhere near Australia but it had a detrimental effect on the consumption, world wide, of beef. That is just part of the problem that our beef industry faces.

         But the dairy industry continues to improve. In those early days there was a great rationalisation in the numbers of dairy farms. Those farms have got bigger and more efficient. We are going to go in 1996 from producing 9.055 million litres to 9.411 million litres. The value of exports is going to go from $1.905 billion to $2.122 billion. A lot of people lose sight of the fact that Australia is a major exporter of primary products and, of course, the dairy industry is very important at the centre of that.

         I want to make a comment on the importance of undertaking initiatives as the industry and the government are with the introduction of this bill where that levy is going to be increased. I think the member for Corangamite alluded to the amount of money that producers would be paying in this levy. But the more important point is the principle of having the levy paid directly from the producer into that fund, which all goes to research and development, so that it is completely transparent. It is not going through their industry organisations. As is pointed out in the explanatory memorandum and in the Bills Digest, this has been supported by industry.

I am referring to what originally started as the Kerin plan. Everybody in the industry contributed to that because everybody benefited; whether they were providing manufacturing milk or market milk, everybody benefited. That has been acceptable. But with the finalisation of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the WTO, somebody, somewhere—whether it was in one of the European cities where these things are based, or in the WTO—decided that the mechanisms that had been established in the dairy industry were GATT illegal.

         The industry, being as dynamic as it is, was able to deal with that quite expeditiously. They developed a mechanism whereby they could replace that original all&amp;hyphen;milk levy with a contribution to develop export markets that was acceptable as far as the World Trade Organisation was concerned. We have done that and the industry has responded quite expeditiously, so they can continue in the positive manner that they have over many years. But we do not see that from the nations that we compete with for world export market share in this industry. Anybody who has travelled to Europe and raised the issue of the common agricultural policy with any of those European countries knows that you get met with a stony look and a blank wall with regard to any moves to address the inequities that that policy creates. Those are the sorts of mechanisms that we have to compete against.

         I still question the pace of change. We are being asked in Australia, in my view, to lead the way with regard to trade liberalisation, tariff reductions, getting rid of subsidies and the impediments to the clear transparent forms of trade. But my view is that we are not following the rest of the world; we are leading the rest of the world. We are trying to lead by example in Australia. And let us not be deceived in this, that Australia has a small population, a small economy by world standards and we are not leading anybody. We have not got the muscle to push other nations around, and I believe that we should be a little more diligent with regard to our industries in Australia, monitor how it is travelling overseas and do what we have got to do to keep pace. We all support trade liberalisation, but not at the expense of Australian industry and certainly not at the expense of the Australian dairy industry.

         There is an expected continuing growth in Australian milk production, and the expansion in Australian milk supply is expected to continue in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 with production forecast to increase by 3.9 per cent. This growth is based on a forecast increase in cow numbers and on milk yields returning to their longer&amp;hyphen;term trend following the dry conditions in 1995&amp;hyphen;96—that came out of that journal again.

It is going well. Those figures substantiate it. We understand that there are very dry conditions in Victoria, but in times past there have been
         <break page="3640" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         And as an individual that represents an electorate that has a predominant primary industry, the dairy industry, I will continue to get up in this place and represent the views of the dairy farmers in my electorate. They have progressed and gone with the times and, in my view, the dairy industry leads our other agricultural production industries in Australia, in terms of what its farmers have done in developing their industries through self&amp;hyphen;help. They do not come around with their hands out to government and say, `You prop us up. You do this. You do that.' They are proactive.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The measure that we are debating today in this dairy produce levy bill is a proactive move, supported by the industry. They are going to increase the levies payable so that they can ensure the protection of the health of the herd in Australia and they want to make those levies direct so that they are quite transparent. They do not want any organisations like the World Trade Organisation criticising Australian producers for being corrupt, or saying that it is another hazy sort of subsidy. They want to make those levies direct.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So, it is important that we answer those criticisms that have been levelled at the government by the opposition members this morning in debating this bill. It is important that we recognise the job that has been done by the industry as a whole, and particularly the industry leaders over the last 10 or so years. We acknowledge that the initial development of the Kerin plan started this process, but it was not going to work without the absolute commitment of all the players in the industry: the producers, the processors and the exporters.

         Against the odds and despite the corrupt practices of the European Union and, from time to time, the American dairy industry with their subsidies on milk powder into South&amp;hyphen;East Asia, one of our major markets for milk powder, the industry has progressed.

         And before I finish, I will make a comment on my views of how the dairy industry will deal with their situation as they face up to the reviews that are being implemented as a result of the implementation of the Hilmer national competition policy. As there is a requirement for a review of the activities of all the statutory marketing authorities across Australia, I believe that the dairy industry will come through that review process as having modernised itself, as being very competitive and as being able to maintain an argument that there is a provision of public benefit in the way the industry is structured now, without having to dismantle it for the sake of some ideological dogma.

         I am pleased that the member for Corangamite is still here. I point out that this industry is unlike other primary industries in that it is genuine about the way it performs in the modern world as far as a liberalised market is concerned. I do not support change for change's sake. I do not support change just to ensure that something fits into an ideological model. I acknowledge that there are areas of our economy that need change, but I do not believe this is one of them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This industry has made the hard yards over the years. It really is an example to other primary industries in this nation. They should get off their backsides and do something about their product, and not just produce a bit of excess and say, `We can't sell that in the cities so
         <break page="3641" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          we will export it.' They should target their export markets and earn export dollars for the Australian economy. This industry is a perfect example of that.

         Like the industry, I support what is proposed in this bill. I believe it will further encourage the development of an industry that is really going to be important to the Australian economy as we move towards the year 2000. I commend the bill to the House.

          —I speak today in support of these important amendments contained in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1997. The dairy industry is one of Australia's key export industries. Most of the Victorian part of that export industry is in the electorate of Murray.

         The bill before the House today does a number of things. It imposes a levy on milk producers to fund the contribution of the dairy industry to the Australian Animal Health Council. It also doubles the maximum research levy rate which may be prescribed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Animal Health Council is Australia's peak animal health body. Its main function is to ensure that our animal health standards are world best.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the previous speaker—the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)—said, there is no room today in our highly competitive markets for food and fibre for any industry that is less than world best. All industry has to be competitive in terms of its costs. Those costs include the amount of dollars that have to be spent on animal medication, in making sure that animal health is always at a peak. Our reputation in Australia for the export of animals and dairy product is beyond reproach in terms of its safety for human consumption.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Animal Health Council is funded by Commonwealth, state, territory and industry contributions. Until now, the dairy industry has contributed to this organisation through the surplus moneys paid to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation—these were left over when the exotic animal diseases program ended—and also through grants from the Australian Dairy Corporation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Other industries like beef, wool, sheep production and so on agreed last year to a package which introduced a similar system to the one that is now before the House. That package received bipartisan support in both chambers, and the support of the minor parties and independents in the Senate. These amendments have wholehearted support throughout Australia, given that they seek to give an industry more self&amp;hyphen;sufficiency and more dollars to make sure that we have disease free status for our dairy production.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The activities of the Australian Animal Health Council are crucial to Australia as we seek not only to reach world best—I suggest we are just about there at the moment with our dairy production—but to maintain that footing in our highly competitive markets. Therefore, the importance of world&amp;hyphen;best research and development in the areas of animal health cannot be underestimated.

         The Australian Animal Health Council, when it was established in 1995, was in many respects ahead of its time. It recognised the significance of partnerships for growth between industry and government. It was a model advocated by the Nairn report for adoption in relation to plants. This council recognises that there are important animal health issues which cross industry boundaries. They must be responded to nationally in a coordinated manner. All of the Australian industry needs to be involved.

          Our continued growth in export development across all of our agricultural industries is dependent on our being able to demonstrate the highest possible standards of animal health and quarantine services in Australia, particularly in relation to border checks and risk analysis assessment. Our budget, just announced last night, adds substantially to this country's ability to put in place world best quarantine services. More than $70 million are now going to be dedicated to ensuring—as we have ever more visitors to Australia—that we can stand up and do the best possible to stop diseased animals or plants from coming into this country.

          We have the good news that the Olympic Games will be here shortly. Of course, that exposes us to many more pressures at the borders. We expect a great number of visitors. We will have to make sure that our quarantine services are up to speed and that the people coming to our Olympic Games are not hampered or held up at our airports but, at the same time, are exposed to the most rigorous testing of any product that they might bring in inadvertently—or perhaps deliberately—that could put our animal or plant industries at risk.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It was a very important initiative in our budget last night, and it shows that our government understands the significance of agribusiness in Australia. It not only gives lip&amp;hyphen;service to the importance of the agribusiness industries but it also puts the dollars there to make sure that we can sustain our world best practices. Where we are still a little short and need more research—perhaps in introducing more feedlot technology for some of our animals, for example, our poultry or our piggery industries; or introducing new forms of agriculture—we will take on board world best practice. We will test that world best practice in Australia and make sure that none of our changes in animal husbandry are ever compromised in terms of the disease factors that could be introduced with new systems.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The advantage of this amendment is that the levy allows the Australian Animal Health Council to plan, coordinate and have total industry involvement and cooperation across the nation. It is exactly what we need and it is what this bill promises to deliver.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I hardly need to say that the dairy industry is one of our most successful agribusiness stories in Australia, and the previous speaker acknowledged that. The dairy industry in Australia has a long history. It began as the milk cow of the early settlers; a few more cows were milked; the billy was taken around; and the milk was sold in an unpasteurised form. We used our dairy industry as a means of settling a lot of our returned servicemen after World War I and World War II. The industry has played a great role in our social engineering in Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Today, the management of our dairy industry has nothing to do with social engineering. It is businesslike in every way and shape. In fact, in the electorate of Murray, it is world best in terms of its current technology. Its cost competitiveness has been recognised by joint ventures with Snow Brand, one of Japan's leading dairy manufacturers, which has come and joined forces with our Tatura Milk Products factory in Tatura. Together, they manufacture infant formula to the highest standards of hygiene. That infant formula is re&amp;hyphen;exported throughout South&amp;hyphen;East Asia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Very recently, we had another greenfield development when Mitsubishi and Meiji joined Murray Goulburn at Cobram. In recognition of the long&amp;hyphen;term sustainability of our dairy industry, they entered into an agreement. They now manufacture infant formula in conjunction with one of our dairy icons, Murray Goulburn, and they, too, export that infant formula into South&amp;hyphen;East Asia.

           Quite clearly, if there was ever a major disease threat in Australia, those exports would be compromised—infant formula or any form of food—as they are highly susceptible to consumer lack of confidence. In Australia, we are preparing our industry with this funding levy to ensure that we are always on the front foot when it comes to doing the research and development, to ensure that we have the best information, the best advice and the best management practices on our dairy farms.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The electorate of Murray is one of Australia's largest producers of dairy product, in our Goulburn, Loddon and Murray valleys and it is the home of Australia's dairy export industry. In particular, besides the infant formula that goes straight out into South&amp;hyphen;East Asia, we are also targeting the high value added ends of the markets in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. We are already experiencing some of the biggest market growth in Japan, where we are neck and neck with New Zealand in claiming about one&amp;hyphen;third of that export market for our dairy product. As well, within our own domestic market for dairy products, we have some of the highest dairy product consumption in the world, and so it is equally important to make sure that our domestic consumers are protected from any disease that could enter the food chain and jeopardise both the consumption of products and human health in Australia.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We have already, in the dairy industry, a number of support programs. They have, over the years, helped our industry to grow from its infancy and to establish a form of dairy production which does not depend on artificial feeding of animals all through winter. We still have range reared animals to a very large extent in Australia, and many would argue that this is the healthiest way to produce dairy product: beta carotene from the sun is still to be found in our dairy products. The previous government support programs have been always of enormous support to the Australian industry. Now, of course, that dairy industry has come of age. It does not need, and has not asked, in recent times, for handouts. The levy system, which involves our dairy producers contributing towards their R&amp;D costs, is the sign of a mature industry with mature members who understand that the industry needs to stand on its own feet.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The industry does look to government to maintain a fair and equitable trading regime in our region and to make sure that our quarantine services are as good as they can possibly be. It looks to our government to insist that the tariff regimes that we face in other nations should be brought down, in line with WTO obligations and commitments. But, in this bill, we are certainly not asking for any form of subsidy, handout or support. As I say, this bill is evidence of a mature industry that can stand on its own two feet and that understands that it needs to make a contribution so that it can be in control of its future. The Australian Animal Health Council levy will ensure that we can be world's best, cost competitive, and that both Australia and overseas countries continue to benefit from some of the world's best and safest dairy product.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I am very pleased to be able to support this amendment bill today. I believe, as I said before, that it is a mark of a mature industry, an industry that understands what it has to do to stay world's best.

           Before I do that, I want to make some comments in relation to some of the criticisms that have been made from the other side of the House, and I will conclude with an outline of what the bills seek to achieve.

         Firstly, let me say that the shadow minister's performance here clearly underlines his position as remaining very much in the shadows for an awfully long time. He really was not quite across the issue at all. The comments made from the other side of the House were in relation to the government's support for, and commitment to, research and development. Let me make it quite clear that we do fund research and development on a dollar for dollar basis: a dollar from the government for every dollar contributed by the industry, up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. Last night, that commitment was locked up in the federal budget; so any suggestion coming from the other side of the House that we are not committed to delivering on research and development is a fallacy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another benefit of the coalition in government has been our responsible approach to the management of the economy of our nation. This has had a dramatic effect on the small businesses of Australia, the primary producers of Australia and, in reference to this bill, the dairy industry in this nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since coming to government 14 months ago, official interest rates have fallen by 1.5 per cent. Every 0.5 per cent reduction in official interest rates delivers a saving of $90 million to the farm sector alone. It benefits all farmers, because everyone can participate in those lower interest rates. It also helps the processing and manufacturing sector of the dairy industry, to which this bill refers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our financial management has seen official interest rates at their lowest point for 30 years—unlike Labor's disaster, where they took interest rates to the highest we have ever seen in this nation. So Labor members should not come into the Main Committee and lecture us about the budget last night. They should get their facts straight.

         It is acknowledged that drought is starting to return to some parts of Australia, and we acknowledge that there are some dairy farmers in those areas who will have their capacity to maintain production affected. We are concerned that drought is once again creeping into many parts of Australia, but let me remind the other side of the House that it was this government that extended by six months the exceptional circumstance provision for that recovery phase for those producers who had come out of drought.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might remind the other side of the House that they had a recovery phase of six months post the revocation of drought status from an individual or a region. We extended that at the end of last year by a further six months, effectively doubling the recovery phase. The shadow minister is not in the House, and he is obviously going to remain very much in the shadows whilst ever he comes in peddling this misinformation.

         Not only have we seen the dairy industry modernise itself, we have also seen it become more and more world competitive. It is important we continue to support them in their efforts to make sure they remain cost competitive. The latest commodity bulletin,

          Australian Commodities, Vol. 4, No. 1, March 1997

         If we are to make the most of those forecast price increases and let the dairy farmers capture their share of that market, we have got to make sure we provide them with the best possible economic climate in this country, we support them with research and development and we make sure the changes to the industrial relations legislation allow for the processing plants and the farm labour side of things to be world competitive.

         In conclusion, I want to say that we will deliver on R&amp;D. It is the base for building a more productive agricultural sector in Australia. We will deliver in terms of our Natural Heritage Trust Fund which will flow into many regional areas of Australia and benefit the agricultural sector and, at the same time, create jobs in regional Australia. We are also committed, as per the budget last night, to making sure that our quarantine service is not underfunded, that it has the funds it requires to make sure that we remain free of diseases which could accidentally arrive on our shores. I thank all those members from both sides who have made a contribution and I commend the bill.

        The Government identified significant savings in the 1996 Budget through simplifying labour market programs and cutting back on ineffective programs. Consequently, the Government reduced funding for training programs by one third overall in the current financial year. Savings were achieved in programs such as the Special Intervention Program, now part of the Job Seeker Preparation and Support Program, which was a major labour market program providing English as a second language training.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The Department is unable to provide information on a State by State basis of savings in funds. The Department's programs are administered on an Area basis and Area boundaries are not congruent with State boundaries. In addition, it is not possible to quantify the impact of the savings because the use of labour market program funds in Areas is determined by labour market circumstances which change from year to year.

        (3) It is anticipated that there will be some reductions in the number of English courses funded, however, the Department is unable to provide an estimate of numbers of teachers or job seekers likely to be affected. The Department contracts courses from a range of providers who determine their own teacher numbers.

Accordingly, the FAC considers that it is not necessary to have safety and disaster precautions in place in anticipation of such an event.

They include both aviation and non aviation development. It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the aggregate value of these proposed investments given their different stages of development. Some may not proceed for commercial reasons, and the future of a number of these proposals is dependent on the Government's decision&amp;hyphen;making on the future of Essendon Airport.

The PSBR may also be disaggregated into net financing requirements (NFRs) for each level of government and/or institutional sector.

Net worth is determined by a range of factors including receipts and expenditures and changes in the value of assets (ie appreciation/depreciation). Whether a secular decline in revenue would contribute to lower public sector net worth would depend on other factors affecting public sector net worth. Important elements would be movements in outlays and changes in the value of assets and liabilities.

         (5) The data indicate that, as a share of GDP, the fall in national saving since the mid&amp;hyphen;1970s has largely been due to the weakness in public saving since that time. In turn, the weakness in public saving reflects the large underlying Commonwealth budget deficits from the mid&amp;hyphen;1970s to the mid&amp;hyphen;1990s, with only occasional surpluses achieved. The Government therefore gives priority to improving public sector saving by addressing its own saving performance at the Commonwealth level.

        (2) and (3) In relation to the article in the Australian of 17 January 1997, even with some changes in available freight space on passenger operations, it is still the case that at present around 90% of air freight transported to and from Australia on scheduled services is carried in the belly hold of passenger services. This position has been reinforced by the major expansion in passenger services with currently 54 international and Australian carriers operating some 700 services per week to and from Australia. Freight carried on these passenger services is supplemented by 28 weekly dedicated freighter services.

        The current level of belly hold capacity on scheduled passenger services per week means that there is a well developed and sophisticated transport system which provides freight capacity to a wide range of gateways and destinations. Importantly, the level of scheduled passenger services means that freight space is often available at much lower rates than would otherwise be available if freight capacity was only provided on dedicated freight services.

This conclusion will be kept under review to take account of additional data which will become available in the lead up to the Games.

        (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has endorsed the use of Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) for all infants. However, HBV has not yet been included in the standard infant schedule because it is only available as an additional injection.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The NHMRC has advised that parents who do express an interest in infant HBV should be encouraged to have their children vaccinated, as long as compliance with other schedule vaccines is not compromised.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The NHMRC has also emphasised that the progressive introduction of universal infant and pre&amp;hyphen;adolescent vaccination should be in addition to continued and vigorous implementation of the previous recommendations for selective hepatitis B vaccination for those at risk, i.e. all infants born to HBsAg+ mothers and to all infants from communities with a hepatitis B carrier rate over two per cent. This includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and individuals from most countries in Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central and South America, Eastern European and the Mediterranean region.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The NHMRC reviewed recommendations for Hepatitis A during 1996. Hepatitis A is not recommended for universal vaccination. Instead vaccination for those at high risk of exposure, such as staff travelling to areas of high of intermediate endemicity (e.g. Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Central and South America), child care staff, homosexual men, individuals with chronic liver disease, recipients of blood products and food handlers has been recommended.

        All recipients of the Income Support Supplement are war widow(er)s. Therefore the total number of war widow(er)s in the electoral division of Fisher is the total of ISS recipients and recipients of the war widow/widower's pension only, i.e. 610.

        All data are as at 30 September 1996 except for DP Dependants and VCES. My Department's data holdings do not maintain history of these allowances. Hence, the figures relating to the recipients of the DP Dependant's pension and the VCES allowances are as at 11 March 1997.

        Data concerning recipients of benefits from my Department are recorded by postcode. The latest available postcode to electoral division concordance was used to convert this information to electoral division. (This is based on the boundaries used in the March 1996 Federal election.) The use of the concordance is necessary as some postcodes cross electoral division boundaries.

        Part (2) of the question asked for the number of beneficiaries in Fisher by postcode for 19 postcodes. One of these postcodes (4405) is almost entirely outside Fisher. It is assumed that no DVA beneficiaries who reside in 4405 lived in the Fisher electoral division. Three other postcodes to the 19 listed (4402, 4521 and 4554) are partially in Fisher and consequently the numbers of beneficiaries for these postcodes are also listed.

        The total additional cost of supporting this event was calculated at $108,000; however, because the operational aircraft involved undertook meaningful training enroute to and from the venue, the majority of this cost can be assigned to training. The additional cost of involvement was therefore reduced to approximately $28,000. This figure does not include the short duration participation by three local military bands on 9 March 1997. The organisers were not charged for the use of the area in Albert Park Barracks.

        (3) Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use the frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel whenever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, eg. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are "block out" periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available.

        (3) No. Frequent flyer points were to have been used for a Sydney to Darwin trip on 19 September 1996. However this trip was cancelled and has been rescheduled for later in 1997 using frequent flyer points. On each internal flight booked for me a request is made for a frequent flyer fare. The restrictions the airlines maintain in allocating a limited number of frequent flyer seats per flight, the requirement by the airlines to book these fares in advance, as well as the frequency of changing flight details at the last moment before leaving, make it difficult to utilise the frequent flyer program effectively. Every effort is made within my office to comply with the Government's current policy of using frequent flyer points for Ministerial travel wherever possible.

        (3) I have not used frequent flyer points for either domestic or international travel. Consistent with Government policy, I look for the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, eg. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are `block out' periods by the airlines (peak periods) when no seats are available.

This service has been developed to assist employees in finding a new job as soon as possible.

        (a) A total of 2664 civilian positions have been abolished in Defence from 2 March 1996 to 28 February 1997.

        It should be noted that the number of positions abolished in any given period is not a reliable indicator of staff reductions. For example, some positions abolished might be replaced by others in different parts of the Department and at different levels. Further, it is usual, for a variety of reasons, for any department's establishment to contain a certain number of positions that might not be able to be filled within available resources; a certain proportion of these positions will be abolished from time to time.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Thus, in the period covered by this question, the number of civilian staff in the Department decreased by around 1650 with some 1500 staff accepting voluntary redundancy.

        The Royal Australian Navy Torpedo Maintenance Establishment (RANTME) and the Army Malaria Institute (AMI) (both previously based in the Greater Sydney region) might both be considered to be Defence "offices" which have been closed since 2 March 1996. However, many of the functions and staff at RANTME have subsequently been relocated to other Defence locations in metropolitan Sydney, while the AMI has subsequently been relocated to Enoggera, QLD.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (b) The existing Defence civilian personnel information management system, CIVILPRISM, is not able to breakdown the abolished positions into localities. Such information could only be obtained by extensive research of the records in units and commands all around Australia. Given the magnitude of such a task, the information could not be obtained in a timely or cost&amp;hyphen;effective manner.

        (4) Raising awareness of the importance of science and technology for Australia's economic and social development requires attitudinal and cultural change, which is a long&amp;hyphen;term proposition. Activities being conducted under the Science and Technology Awareness Program are part of a strategy which is designed to contribute to the objective. Individual elements and activities target specific groups in the community, and each project supported has specific milestones and outputs which are judged to contribute to the overall Program strategy. Research on Australians' attitudes to science and technology is commissioned to evaluate the Science and Technology Awareness Program.
