I am told that Mr Funder advised that he had been informed that the ALRC had prepared a draft report which it was proposing to present to the joint parliamentary committee on native title. Mr Funder also noted that the ALRC's actions appeared to be inconsistent with a recent letter which the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General had sent to Mr Rose to the effect that the Attorney be consulted on matters on which the ALRC proposed to comment where there was no specific reference to it from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General. It was suggested that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General should address the matter in light of his letter to Mr Rose.

As has already been foreshadowed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the government will outline this afternoon a very comprehensive, a very reformist and, I believe, a very fair response to the report that has been brought down by the committee chaired by the member for Bendigo.

         It is true that the small business sector is vital to Australia's economic future. In the
         <break page="8742" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          decade to 1994&amp;hyphen;95 it generated 1.1 million jobs. Unlike the arrogance of my predecessor, who told small business that this is a good as it ever got, it has got a lot better since March 1996. Interest rates have come down by 2&amp;half; per cent; provisional tax burdens have been reduced by $180 million. We went much further than we promised in the election in providing capital gains tax relief. We have made it easier to build new and larger businesses. We have responded very positively to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, including a package costing more than $600 million over a four&amp;hyphen;year period.

         On top of that, we have significantly reformed in a quite far&amp;hyphen;reaching way the workplace relations conditions applying to small business. I notice that the opposition spokesman for small business is nodding his assent. Well may he nod his assent because we have, in fact, brought in a new era for the small business community; and I can say that my colleague this afternoon will add to the store of measures which are of positive benefit to the small business community of Australia.

         Can I simply make a final contrast: in the 13 years that Labor was in power it had 17 reports on small business and did nothing. We have received two. We have acted on the first one and we will be acting on the second one this afternoon.

         I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has today claimed credit for what we are doing, which is really quite incredible when you think of the differences between them and us on this issue. The Prime Minister referred to the 17 reports that Labor had which led to nothing during Labor's years; and what an incredible tally they are. Labor came into office in 1983 promising to look after small business and they got a report in 1984 and did nothing. In 1986 they introduced a bill and did nothing. Again in 1986 they had an exposure draft on franchise and did nothing. In 1986 they had a second exposure draft and did nothing. In 1987 they had a ministerial council meeting and they abandoned the draft that they introduced in 1986.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then in 1989 they had a House of Representatives committee and a discussion paper from the Trade Practices Commission. In 1990 they got really busy about small business, so they had a House of Representatives committee again, they had a discussion paper from the Trade Practices Commission and they had a government response. They were so good at doing nothing they decided to do it all again in 1991. They called for a report. Then they had another report from a Senate committee. Then they thought, `No, we have had reports. We have had reviews. We have
         <break page="8743" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          had discussion papers. It is time for something new, something different, something powerful for small business.' They had a task force. That was in 1991.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then they went quiet. Then they sat back. They rested on their laurels. They had done nothing, absolutely nothing. Then in 1994 they got Bob Gardini to do a review and they did nothing. In 1995, as we headed towards the 1996 election, once again they lifted the pace and the tempo of their great policy development and they had a report by a working party, a supplementary report and we ended up with yet another discussion paper.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the end of it, after 13 years, they did nothing with 17 reports. And the Leader of the Opposition has the gall to stand up and say, `If only we had been re-elected in 1996 we finally would have done something about it.' In fact two years after they introduced one change to the Trade Practices Act they themselves were then fiddling around with their better business conduct bill which they introduced in the last week of the parliament before the 1996 election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I can say to small business people in this country is that this afternoon we will introduce reforms, amendments to the Trade Practices Act, which will give it real teeth for the protection of the small business community. Our package of reforms will introduce some real change in the behaviour of businesses to the benefit of small business. We will ensure that the ACCC has the capacity and the resources to undertake its enforcement role on behalf of small business. It is time for action. Our response to the fair trading report built on our existing track record of development and improvement for this sector. Above all, we want a new deal, a fair deal, for small business.

One of the great things about the 1996 election was that elected into this place were a lot of people who knew about small business. Tremendous from the point of view of the small business community is that a lot of these people—the member for McEwen, of course, is in the resurrection club—came into the parliament to give the perspective of the small business community so we could do a decent deal for the small business community. So I do thank her for her contribution.

         When the terms of reference for that committee were drafted—and I also take the opportunity of commenting upon the tremendous work done by my predecessor as the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest, in getting this under way—we in fact included a reference to the franchising sector because we wanted those business conduct issues in the franchising sector examined in detail.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that when this government came into power in March 1996 we inherited Labor's failed voluntary code of conduct for the franchising sector. That was their preferred approach in government: basically to leave small business to the goodwill of big business. Of course, true to form, they have a very different view now that they are in opposition. It is interesting that, when they
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          were in government, they received a report from Canberra consultant Mr Robert Gardini which reviewed the operation and effectiveness of the franchising code of practice.

         He went on to recommend a mandatory code. What did the Labor government then do? They ignored that advice and they continued with their flawed voluntary code of conduct for franchising. The hypocrisy of Labor never ceases to amaze me. They even had the hide to criticise us for running with their franchising model pending the outcome of the fair trading inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition now has, as I said earlier, the hide to suggest that we are doing and responding to Labor's position. You had an opportunity at the very latest in 1994 to respond to the Gardini committee and you failed to do so.

         We accept the fair trading inquiry's assessment that Labor's franchising model—the self&amp;hyphen;regulatory approach—has simply not worked. We will ensure that, for the first time, franchisees have the protection that they need. Our approach will have teeth, it will have the force of law—something the opposition never had the gumption to do when they were in government. The message I pass on to franchisees who are getting a raw deal is that, in the statement to be made by me this afternoon outlining the government's response to the fair trading committee report, we will respond to their plea for help and we will deliver on the fair trading recommendations.

         This is just another smear campaign. There was an attempt at that in the upper house yesterday. And I will answer one of the questions raised yesterday. This is just another smear campaign which was tried in the upper house yesterday when Senator Faulkner stood up in the Senate and said that I was in Townsville and yet I claimed in Canberra.

         Let me detail that question and my answer to that smear campaign by Senator Faulkner yesterday. In relation to 17 June, I can confirm that I was in Townsville to address the Queensland RSL Congress. I flew on a commercial air service, QF 649/679, from Townsville to Canberra that evening, arriving at 8.50 p.m. I consequently spent that night in Canberra as it was a parliamentary sitting week. I was not in Townsville that evening, as the smear campaign from Senator Faulkner suggested yesterday.

         The investigation has centred around the date of the by-election for Lindsay, which was held on 19 October 1996. The Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, MAPS, processes car hire invoices on the basis that there has been an approved authorised booking made by a senator or a member. Invoices were forwarded to MAPS by Dasfleet. Simultaneously, a copy would be referred to the senator or member for the certification to MAPS. An invoice would be paid unless it was clearly outside the terms of the entitlement. There is no record of a payment authorisation from the Leader of the Opposition in this instance.

         Members of the government and the public will welcome the fact that Australian 10-year bonds and US 10-year bonds now have a spread of practically zero. The last time there was a narrow spread of the dimension that currently exists between the US 10-year bond and the Australian 10-year bond was in 1980.

         At the end of March 1996, yields in Australia were 8.8 per cent, compared with 6.7 per cent over 200 basis points, or two per cent. Now, after the coalition's period in office of 18 months, they are practically the same. That means there is now no premium for borrowing long term in relation to Australian bonds. That is a reflection of an expectation of inflation. Financial markets now believe that Australia not only has low inflation but has low inflation locked in and locked in for the long term. This signals Australia's return to the ranks of the low inflation countries of the world.

         As a result, over the last 12 months, the coalition government has been able to do something Labor never could—sustain growth whilst inflation was actually falling. We have got inflation under control whilst sustaining growth now at the three&amp;hyphen;plus percentage points in relation to GDP. Not only does this reflect the government's fiscal policy of taking that deficit that the Labor Party had built up and turning it over the course of one

          parliamentary term into a surplus; it also indicates the conduct of monetary policy by which the government, in an agreement with the Reserve Bank, set out a transparent monetary policy to give people confidence in Australia's inflation prospects.

         Like all of the government's economic reforms, that reform was opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed an inflation target set by agreement between the Reserve Bank and the government and threatened to sue us over it. One idea the Labor Party had in relation to inflation was to get it up along with interest rates. It had no economic policy whatsoever—none whatsoever. No strategy to lock in low inflation, no strategy to engage in fiscal consolidation, no strategy in relation to interest rates, no strategy in relation to growth in a low inflation environment. All we hear is this populism, do nothing, vacuous sound that comes from the opposition, with not one economic idea.

         Now let me take the opportunity of contrasting that with the disgraceful behaviour of my opposite number, the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has to explain to the Australian people how he has allowed a member of his staff, apparently outside of entitlement, to use a privately plated, self&amp;hyphen;hired motor vehicle for 22 days during an election campaign when plainly that staff member has not been engaged on the official business of the Leader of the Opposition.

         That is whom she was working for, and everybody in this parliament knows that. What Vincent has done and what we have done, according to my advice from the federal director of the party, is absolutely the right thing.

         I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts from both sides of the chamber on their report, and in particular the chair of the committee, the member for Fairfax. The report is, as one would expect, a very thorough and professional report. It makes a number of very sensible suggestions for improving the bill or the subordinate legislation. None of these recommendations, so far as I am able to determine on my first read through, affect, the fundamental integrity of the bill that the government has put before the House, and I believe that many of the recommendations of the committee have merit.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee supported the need for the present legislation to be replaced and favoured simplification and modification of the legislation governing the Public Service, as the new bill does. Indeed, most of the witnesses before the committee saw that the 1922 act was in need of desperate overhaul. I want to record the fact that this bill that the government has brought forward is the culmination of many years of work on Public Service reform. I acknowledge the work by the previous government as well as by many leaders of the Public Service itself. The bill is not a partisan piece of legislation. It is a bill designed to put in place a framework for the
         <break page="8751" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Public Service of this country which will enable it to serve, in an outstanding way, governments of all persuasions over the decades ahead.

         The Australian Public Service is a key institution in Australian democracy and both sides of this chamber have an interest in ensuring that the framework within which the Public Service operates is a framework that will enable it to be a high performance, best practice organisation. The challenge for the Labor Party coming out of this report is to recognise the fact that the bill before the House is one which reflects views which have been expressed on both sides of this chamber. I challenge the Labor Party, which so far has had an abysmal record of reform in so many areas, to demonstrate that it is prepared to support a non&amp;hyphen;partisan, major, substantial piece of reform to ensure that the Public Service in this country is the kind of Public Service that the Australian people want it to be.

The honourable member is referring to the Immunise Australia initiative that we announced in February this year. Over the next 12 to 18 months we can expect a number of new and quite exciting vaccines to be coming on the market, and I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the government has made the decision to fund the first of these which is an acellular pertussis vaccine.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are two types of vaccines that do this. The first is called DTPw, which is the whole cell vaccine, and then DTPa, which is the acellular vaccine. The whole cell vaccine is safe and effective, but it does lead to reactions in a small proportion of children, such as local irritation, swelling, and sometimes a mild fever. The acellular vaccine has a much lower rate of local reaction. It is, however, much more expensive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has decided to make this generally available for the boosters for children at 18 months of age and four to five years of age—also, to any children in the primary course at two, four and six months of age who have a reaction. It can then be expected to have a lower rate of reaction in any subsequent injections.

         Looking to the future, there are now vaccines in development that we expect to come on board in the next year which will protect against more diseases at the one time.

           A survey of consumption taxes: a worldwide perspective
          </emphasis>
          . Coopers and Lybrand have published similar surveys for the past two years, and the survey covered 167 countries: 143 countries imposed a broad based indirect tax on goods and services; 17 countries did not impose any taxes on spending; and only seven countries imposed a wholesale sales tax or manufacturers tax. One of those countries was Australia.

         Australia is the only developed country in the world which imposes a wholesale sales tax. Of the seven countries imposing a wholesale sales tax or manufacturers tax, the other countries—apart from Australia—are Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, the Solomon Islands and Swaziland. Unlike Australia, some of these countries also tax services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The surveys conclude that Australia's indirect tax base is in urgent need of repair. This is contributed to by the recent High Court decision resulting in the repeal of some state business franchise fees. It is compounded by the majority of indirect taxes which are imposed on a narrow range of goods, and our sales tax collections in Australia apply to business inputs. The survey concludes that this makes our exports more expensive and less competitive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The case for reforming Australia's indirect tax system is overwhelming. This government believes that it needs to be improved and that Australia needs substantive tax reform. We have previously said that, if the opposition were prepared to do something in the national interest, to sit down and work with the government to improve Australia's tax system and give Australia a tax system for the 21st century, they could really contribute to the national interest. That would be something positive that the opposition could do rather than cheapjack, populist do&amp;hyphen;nothing, know&amp;hyphen;nothing vacuous politics. We again extend that offer to the opposition to see whether

         The Leader of the Opposition is fast running out of ammunition. Here we are at seven minutes past three in question time and the Leader of the Opposition is asking me a pathetic, deflated question about some statement I made about the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I have put certain documents on the record. I have described the situation. It is perfectly clear that there is not a skerrick of evidence against me. It is perfectly clear to the Australian parliament and it is perfectly clear to the Australian people that the standards of this government and the probity of this government soar way above that of our predecessor government.

         What is not perfectly clear are the conversations that took place in the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the late weeks of September and the early days of October 1996. Did he sit down with Miss Horne and say, `Do you want 22 days or 25 days? Do you want one hire car or two hire cars? Have you spoken to Della Bosca about how much time you have to spend there? Have you had a word with Ross Free?' Ross Free was no young mistake maker. He has been around for a long time.

          —I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I know what great concern she has that young people in her electorate should have real opportunities to do programs in school that will help them get jobs. The Dusseldorf Skills Forum is a non-partisan organisation, which released a report last week. It compared vocational education programs in schools across the various states and territories. It is a very useful report, but it did highlight some disturbing variations across the states in the quality of the various programs that are being put in place, the involvement or lack of involvement of local industry in those programs, the quality of the student work placements and the flexibility of timetabling to allow students to undertake programs.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report showed that, while New South Wales had a very large number of students involved in vocational education programs compared with other states, those programs generally were, I regret to say, of low quality. They were programs which resulted in lower achievements for students. They provided limited opportunities to gain structured training in industry and to obtain workplace placements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These programs are under the control of the same government which forbade school principals from taking part in a Commonwealth program to provide job placements for school leavers. This suggests that the disre

          gard of the interests of young Australians stretches right across the Labor Party—federal and state—and that the performance of the Carr government in this regard is no different to the performance of the former Labor government in office and, indeed, of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is already putting into vocational education programs in schools some four times as much as the previous government. That shows the enormous difference in priorities. The Leader of the Opposition sat back and did nothing while the structure of the Australian economy changed and tens of thousands of students every year were dropping out of school and falling into the unemployment queues. It is no wonder that youth unemployment under the previous government rose to 34 per cent. That is the dramatic contrast with this government, which is putting $187 million over this four-year period into expanding vocational education offerings in schools.

         It is about time the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, got together and decided that they were finally going to do something for young people in this country. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might get the Premier of New South Wales to allow principals in that state to permit their schools to participate in the jobs pathway program when it is tendered next time.

         What do we know, nevertheless, about what has happened as a result of that?

Today, I understand, there is a possibility that another public servant has been stood down. But, Prime Minister, is it not a fact that, with the exception of Ms Bisshop and Ms Hughes, none of these people can be called by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to assist his inquiry, and that therefore it makes it impossible for him to ascertain the full facts relating to the `Travelgate' cover&amp;hyphen;up?

         When you look at what those documents contain, they contain great strength in the suggestion that a deal of information was placed in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

         Front and centre, straightaway in May—the full facts and the details straight into the Prime Minister's office.

          Let us recollect what has been covered up here. What has been covered up here is an offence worse than those with which Cobb, Colston et al have been charged with—an offence manifestly worse than those. The Prime Minister wanted an allegation yesterday. The allegation is that he is covering up, stalling, what would have ultimately emerged by any decent standards as a police inquiry into this matter. He has stalled that. He has prevented it being brought forward. He has circled the wagons around himself on this matter. In circling the wagons around himself he has sought to protect himself. He has raised one smokescreen after another in an attempt to defend himself on this matter.

          Further, we know about the circumstances of Mr Sharp's position about which the Prime Minister says, `Forget all about that now.' He knows darn well that Sharp cannot be called by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. Always remember that: Sharp cannot be called by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to discuss his motive on this. He knows darn well that Sharp's information that in January he went through his particular propositions is a lie. He knows darn well by now, although he refused to answer Mr Brereton's specific question on this, that the first of Mr Sharp's propositions which were put into his claim—which included two false claims within three days of actually putting in that claim—includes 60 per cent of the false claims that Mr Sharp put in place.

          I will tell you what happened on Monday and Tuesday and what happened over that weekend. What happened is this: even if Morris had forgotten it by the time he received that vivid telephone call, even if he had forgotten it by the time he concluded that vivid telephone call, the full details of all this—the cover&amp;hyphen;up, the decision to draw a distinction between the Labor ministers' payback and Mr Sharp's payback; why is there that distinction?—it is one of two motives. Firstly, to put the Labor Party in a bad light or, secondly, certain knowledge that when the two were compared and a comparison made one would appear an honest mistake and the other would not.

           Labor ministers in comparison with Sharp's position. That was in fact the real distinction between those two positions: the Labor ministers did not need to do it, but were revealed; Mr Sharp, at a minimum, was required to do that and Mr Sharp's position was effectively concealed. His office knew it. By that weekend he knew it himself.

          The Prime Minister has tried to dance around this issue and not answer it. Then he managed to stand up in this parliament and give the most extraordinary ringing endorsement of Sharp on that day. This was his position on Tuesday—I remind you of it:

          `Immense confidence' and `full support' for a person that he knows has been the subject of a cover&amp;hyphen;up. But why did he wait until Wednesday to act on it in a totally different manner? The answer is simple. He had had a couple of soft questions from Laurie Oakes, by that journalist, into the offices of the various ministers involved—soft questions that displayed sympathy about Mr Sharp's situation. Of course, the Prime Minister felt Mr Sharp was not a rorter; he may be a little forgetful.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What was being put in place here was not probity, was not integrity, was not presentation of a set of facts; it was a decision to enter damage control: `Sharp too valuable to dispense with. Let us go into damage control. Let's state our very strong support for him. Let us rely on Sharp. There's a certain amount of sympathy for him and support for him in the government. Let us rely on that. Let us rely on these opinions and leave ourselves with the wagons firmly circled around Sharp.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          By the time the Prime Minister saw the real nature of the journalist's story on the TV news that night and the next day, he suddenly recognised that this would not be possible; this would not be plausible. So, instead of the wagons being circled around Sharp by the Prime Minister, Sharp was circled around the Prime Minister to protect the Prime Minister from this.

He slings propositions at me and Evans, though he knows darn well that Evans's department cleared off on the action taken at that point of time, but he will decide to raise all that. Mr Evans's then department, under the now tender mercies of Daryl Williams, have not yet had an opportunity to express a view on this, and they will not get it. If they decide to take it, at any point they decide to take it, they will not have had the opportunity of an Auditor-General or any investigative process at that point of time going to Sharp's motives or the motives of the other ministers who are concerned here. It was a point of sheer maliciousness approved by the Prime Minister's office and approved by the Prime Minister himself. `Take those Labor members who did not need to declare their proposition and pay it back, but do not reveal what Sharp has done.' You can understand to some extent why you would not want to reveal what Sharp has done. It puts him right in it, unlike the other persons.

          But the problem is that what is involved there, Prime Minister, is a cover&amp;hyphen;up. The only way you will get to the bottom of that is through a judicial inquiry. You have a shattered government. Probity, from a man who has lost seven ministers in 18 months! He says that a new standard has been established in Australian politics. You can bet your bottom dollar a new standard has been established: it is right down there. This failure to take on board immediately after question time, after no censure motion had been moved until this point of time on these matters—despite the fact that three ministers have gone—just goes to show that the cover-up is still in, the fix is still in, as far as this Prime Minister is concerned. We will not be blackmailed by paltriness into backing off on this.

          —The Travelgate cover&amp;hyphen;up has engulfed this government: three sacked ministers, three public servants gone and, as we understand it, another one still to go. What we have is the unctuous Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this House today reminding us of when he said to the Australian people, `I am going to be a different Prime Minister; I am going to be a better Prime Minister; I am going to raise the standards.' This is a person who has hidden every aspect that we have tried to drag out, and it has been revealed in this House only when we forced him to do so.

         Through yesterday's documentation we have shown that we have evidence that at the core of this cover&amp;hyphen;up is a politically framed document—a document which differentiates Labor Party members from those of the government, a document which misled this parliament and led to the person who tabled it having to be sacked. We have a government which, in the process, directed the public servants to prepare that document. That is what we have got from a Prime Minister who says he was going to lift the standards—misleading and directing the Public Service to prepare a document that presents the misleading.

         Who was in on the act? We know that the Prime Minister says that he does not know anything. He said it six times on Friday. And it is not the first time he has used that excuse—not the first time at all. In case anyone missed it, the Prime Minister of Australia's
         <break page="8759" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          defence for this tawdry cover&amp;hyphen;up is, `I don't know anything.' We have a Prime Minister of the nation that repeats six times over, `I know nothing.' The Prime Minister of the nation is somewhere between Sergeant Schultz in

          —`I know nothing, I know nothing.' This is the pathetic defence of the Prime Minister of the nation.

         Who were the players that have been revealed in the documents tabled by him yesterday? We have got the ministers, Sharp and Jull. We have now got embroiled Minister Scott, and I hope that he is looking through his records and I hope the National Party leader, who expressed confidence in him today, is asking him the same probing questions as those that we are prepared to ask. We have got Sutherland, we have got Morris, we have got McKenna, we have got Semmens in DAS, we have got Carolyn Hughes in DAS and we have got Philomena Bisshop in PM&amp;C. They are the players we know so far. They are the players identified in the documentation tabled yesterday. Eight out of nine of those players have already been sacrificed. The bodies are falling around the Prime Minister like nine pins. Remember the old Queen classic

          Another one bites the dust

        <para first-indent="16">
         The simple facts are these: the Auditor-General's review is flawed. It is flawed because it has no power to call the majority of those key players. That is the fact of it. We have got these people identified on the record because of documents that the Prime Minister has tabled, yet he is going to have an inquiry that will not even have the power to bring them forward. That is why we are saying that what we need is a full judicial inquiry, an inquiry with the ability to compel people to come in under oath and to fess up. The Prime Minister's inquiry wants to hide them. He wants to hide them.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of the Prime Minister's knowledge, he says that he did not know in May. But we know that he knew on Sunday, coming backing from the Cook Islands. We know that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Morris related to him the vivid recollection of the conversation with Sutherland. We know that the Prime Minister was fully briefed. We have a Prime Minister who every time he is in trouble sets up an inquiry without power. He sees bodies fall around him like ninepins and his defence is, `I know nothing.' He pleads ignorance. The Prime Minister who said he is lifting standards has debased them and he should be censured.

         This is a real fizzer of an attempt to censure. It is an absolute fizzer because there is no substance in your allegations. Look at those who sit opposite and the sort of clockwork, but fundamentally unenthusiastic, response of those who sit behind. Your moment to try and generate a bit of momentum was yesterday, but instead of getting stuck into it from the very beginning yesterday you wasted 50 minutes on the Australian Law Reform Commission. Really, I must have a mole at their tactics meeting—I really must; I wonder who he is—because they wasted 50 minutes on the Australian Law Reform Commission and then they squandered two questions on the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith.

         Of course, the real reason why the Leader of the Opposition has moved this attempted censure motion today is that he is under heat over his car rorting. That is the reason why.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The `take' out of question time today is that Beazley has got to explain why it is that he rorted the Comcar allowance; why he sent a staff member on leave, still being on the payroll of the Commonwealth, when that person was not working for Mr Beazley, not working for the Commonwealth government, but working for John Della Bosca, the general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. We all know those rules. He thought rather cleverly that he had caught me
          <break page="8760" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           on that. He tried to besmirch the name of my good friend Vincent Willcock and instead of being right he was wrong again. Your information on that was absolutely wrong.

         But today's rather pathetic censure motion, Kim, is a day and a half late and it is on an occasion when the real news is your having to explain to the Australian public why it is that you allowed a member of your staff to act in a particular way. You asked me a few questions; we might well ask you, did you authorise Miss Horne to claim the use of that car in breach of her entitlements? Was it your idea or was it her idea? Is the real explanation that Ross Free and John Della Bosca rang you up and said, `Look, mate, the New South Wales branch is stony broke.' Remember, the New South Wales branch was keen to run in this. You were not terribly keen as I understand it. You perhaps feared what the result might be. But Della Bosca said to you, `Look, Kim, you are the leader; it is your opportunity to make a dent in the Liberal members' majority, so will you please make a staff member available?'

         With reckless indifference to the rules, without asking yourself whether you were breaking the rules, without asking yourself whether you had any entitlements, what did you do? Did you actually directly authorise her? Did you give it to Epstein to authorise her or what? Perhaps you might like to table a few documents. Perhaps you might like to explain to the Australian parliament how it is that this came about.

         Let it be understood by the parliament from the very beginning that the reason we are having this censure motion today is that the Leader of the Opposition is in trouble over rorted Comcar claims. That is the reason. It has absolutely nothing to do with any argument of substance. It is well known in this place that the censure is meant to be the culmination of a concerted parliamentary onslaught. It is meant to be the high point of the opposition's attack on the government. It is meant to be the moment at which the person against whom the censure is directed is left staggering under the rhetorical blows of his all&amp;hyphen;powerful opponent. But what do we have today? It is the old story: if you live in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          glass houses, you do not throw stones. And if you have rorted your Comcar allowance, you do not make allegations against decent people. That is what has happened to this bloke and that is why he has decided to drag out this censure motion.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us, once again, take the opportunity that the censure motion affords us to very calmly go through the facts. In order to establish a case in this parliament for the establishment of an inquiry, it is first necessary to have not a huge detailed body of evidence, but at the very beginning you have got to have some evidence. You cannot just have mere rhetorical assertions.

         Do you know what my opposite number had the hide to say at the weekend? He said, `This is like Neville Wran, when he stood aside.' Do you know what happened to Neville Wran? The allegation made against Neville Wran was that he actually rang up Murray Farquhar to fix the hearing in relation to Kevin Humphreys, the former chief executive of the New South Wales Rugby League. In other words, in relation to Neville Wran, there was a direct allegation by a third party of wrongdoing. In relation to me, no such thing has happened.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The allegation has been made by Mr Sutherland that he spoke to both Ms McKenna and Mr Morris. Of the two people whom he claims to have spoken to one of them has categorically denied any recollection and the other has explained a contact, in the document that has been tabled, in circumstances that are entirely understandable and entirely consistent with the way in which she handled the particular matter. That is the beginning and the end of this unbelievably serious charge against me. This is the withering onslaught that I am meant to crumple under. This is the killer punch that is meant to bring the Prime Minister down. This is the culmination of a well orchestrated, carefully planned, meticulously mapped out parliamentary onslaught on the leader of the government, and it works out as a complete and utter fizzer.

         Do you know whose idea this was? I think this was Simon's idea. I do not want to be uncharitable or unfair, but do you know what
         <break page="8761" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          I think happened? Simon was not allowed to ask a question yesterday. Remember? He was gagged yesterday. We all thought we would have this onslaught from the member for Hotham. He probably went back to his office and said, `How do I get back at him? How do I pay him back for having shut me out of the action? I have lost a whole night on television because he would not allow me to ask a question.' He goes back to his office and he says, `I know what I'll do. I'll advise him to move a censure.'

         So having lost his opportunity yesterday, having really wrecked it yesterday, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? The Leader of the Opposition decides to move a censure motion knowing full well that the real story out of today is the absolute failure of the Leader of the Opposition to explain away his own rorting of his Comcar allowance. Let me say again to the Leader of the Opposition: there is no substance in this allegation. The Australian public knows that. I am telling the truth. You are flailing around without any substance to your allegations. You are in trouble and you owe the Australian public an explanation as to why you systematically rorted your Comcar allowance.

What I have said, and I am very happy to repeat it today, is that I have assured the members of the government parties that in any taxation changes we make we will not be acting in a manner that would seriously damage, or indeed damage at all, small business. But at no stage have I said that my government would never take action against the abuse of trusts. We will always take action against abuses within the tax system.

         Three years ago the then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating told Australia's small business people that `This is as good as it gets'. Well, I am delighted to report to the House, and to Mr Keating if he is listening in, that under a Howard coalition government it is now getting a whole lot better. Make no mistake about it, this federal coalition government, this Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and this minister, is pro&amp;hyphen;small business, and proud of it.

         This response is a further down payment on the coalition's `New deal for small business', the small business policy on which we were elected in March last year.

         There is no doubt that after 13 years of federal Labor governments small business has done it tough. Labor gave small business an

          economic recession, record interest rates, a punishing tax system, a huge burden of bureaucracy and red tape and a job&amp;hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal law. And in relation to fair trading, Labor governments squibbed the issue. Small business did it tough under Labor governments. Now a coalition government is making the tough decisions for small business.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In July I assumed portfolio responsibility for small business when the Prime Minister elevated small business policy into the Australian cabinet. I have spent the bulk of this time listening to small business across Australia on the issue of fair trading and on other issues of concern. I have been reminded by small business how frustrated they have been by the failure of previous governments to take action to address fair trading issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor's approach was to raise small business hopes by promising reviews, reports and recommendations only to have those hopes dashed by inaction, by reports shelved, recommendations ignored and issues deferred to the too&amp;hyphen;hard basket. In all, 17 fair trading reports, reviews or draft proposals in 13 years of Labor. Nothing achieved. That was life for small business under Labor, where the Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating cabinets rolled small business every time because they never really understood the non&amp;hyphen;unionised small business community in Australia. It is laughable that Labor would now have you believe they suddenly care about this and wanted to act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am pleased to announce that the cycle of reports shelved, hopes dashed and Labor cabinet inaction has been broken. Today I announce to this House that after consideration of our one and only report on fair trading we have decided, unambiguously, that small business is right when it calls for action to address fair trading issues.

         With a coalition government, small business gets action, not just words or promises. So much so that I will be immediately introducing into this House today legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act that gives small business protection in its commercial dealings with big business.

          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Finding a balance
          </emphasis>
          , outlined the litany of business conduct issues that had emerged during the past decade and which had not been addressed by Australian governments and policy makers in the ALP.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee was given broad terms of reference to examine these business conduct issues, and to develop options and strategies which would provide solutions. Although not limited in its analysis, the committee was asked to have particular reference to the position of small retail tenants and franchisees—areas of industry where repeated calls for action against unfair conduct had been made.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Reid committee received more than 200 submissions from business groups and individuals, and over 50 organisations gave evidence in public hearings. The report was tabled on 26 May 1997—18 weeks ago. The committee found that small businesses were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. According to the committee, much of this unfair business conduct has arisen from the imbalance between parties prior to making an agreement. Without a doubt many small business operators have suffered as a result. The risks associated with operating a business have increased with the economic and social costs being borne by the whole community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In presenting the report, the committee advised the House that the concerns about unfair business conduct towards small business are justified, and should be addressed urgently. The committee recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business, and to provide unfairly treated small business with adequate means of redress.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has accepted these conclusions. This is the time to act—to rectify the policy failures of past Labor governments and Labor cabinets and to induce the behavioural

          change which the committee so rightly identified. That is why I am moving immediately to introduce legislation into this parliament.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government will act on the recommendations of each of the seven areas of reform identified by the committee—unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice and education. The government has accepted the committee's recommendations either in whole or in part, according to the constraints on Commonwealth powers and the importance of delivering a policy outcome that maximises the benefits to small business whilst minimising any counterproductive impacts on the sector. In a number of important respects the government response has gone further than the committee has recommended, particularly in the area of effective enforcement of fair trading issues for small business by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, ACCC.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government response is a package of reforms. The reforms are based around stronger legislation protecting small business through the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state and territory retail tenancy laws, as well as legally recognised codes of conduct, more powerful enforcement of legal rights and better targeted information and alternative dispute resolution. Our response will ensure that small business can confidently deal with large firms in the knowledge that the rules under which they are operating are fair, and that there will be proper redress available when those rules are broken. Our response will give small business the confidence to grow jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fundamental objective of the government is, in the words of the committee, to `induce behavioural change' where improved standards of commercial conduct are required, and not a mere desire to create a more litigious commercial environment. By adopting these measures the government has ensured that the desired outcomes are achieved without unduly impacting on the operation of the open market or compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risk which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy. I now outline the
         <break page="8767" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         Pivotal to the government's response is an acceptance that the Trade Practices Act must be made to work for small business. This requires an approach which improves the substantive legal rights available to small business against unfair business conduct, as well as administrative measures which facilitate improved enforcement of rights and access to remedies.

         Mr Speaker, the legislative strengthening of the Trade Practices Act in this manner will provide for open and fair competition which underpins the legislative scheme of the act.

        </para>

          Accordingly, the government will mirror in a new section of the Trade Practices Act the legal rights available to consumers in section 51AB and incorporate a range of additional matters set out in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report in order to tailor the provision appropriately to its statutory purpose of protecting small businesses. Conduct against business consumers which is unconscionable having regard to the enumerated factors will be prohibited by the act and give rise to a broad range of remedies under the act.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This new provision will extend the existing common law doctrine of unconscionability expressed in the existing section 51AA of the current act. The bill will use the expression `unconscionable conduct' rather than `unfair conduct' in order to build on the existing body of case law which has worked with respect to consumer protection provisions of the act and which will provide greater certainty to small businesses in assessing their legal rights and remedies.

          The Reid committee devoted much analysis to unfair conduct issues experienced in the franchising sector. The committee concluded that specific legislative measures were required to be taken to redress the imbalance in commercial relations between franchisors and franchisees.

          The government has accepted the broad conclusion of the committee that retail tenants are entitled to stronger legislative protection against unfair conduct than currently applies.

          It must be recognised that the Federal government has only limited constitutional capacity to legislate with respect to retail tenancies. Any legislation would leave some small businesses outside the scope of such protections because they and their landlords may not be incorporated.

          Notwithstanding these limitations on Commonwealth power, the government has seized the political opportunity made possible by the Reid report to facilitate national negotiations between peak representatives of retail tenants, the Australian Retailers Association, and retail landlords, the Property Council of Australia, on best practice principles for tenancy reform.

          The government particularly believes that effective low cost justice is an essential element of any retail tenancy safety net and should be incorporated in all state and territory legislation where it does not currently exist. Accordingly, the government will adopt a dual strategy to address tenancy issues raised in the committee's report. Firstly, the government will release to state and territory governments, and publicly, national benchmark principles for tenancy reform, and take a leadership role in advocating an enhanced safety net of legal protections for retail tenants under state and territory legislation. A special meeting of state and territory ministers responsible for retail tenancy will be convened before the end of this year. That special ministerial meeting will be charged with the task of responding to the nationally determined benchmark principles, as well as addressing the non&amp;hyphen;agreed matters which relate to security of tenure, disclosure of turnover, and recovery of outgoings.

I am not sure whether, if his friend and colleague the Treasurer (Mr Costello) had been in the country, it would have been such an easy battle, but he has succeeded.

         On behalf of the opposition, I say that this response is welcome. It is welcome, even if it is overdue. Those on the other side may laugh, but this was a government that went out amongst the small business community and said, `We established a committee of inquiry. When its report is tabled, we will respond within three months because we know it is so important.' Subsequently, there was the demise of the then minister for small business, who was minister for landlords, and the installation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in that job, so an extension of time was granted. Then the government said, `We will come back by the end of September and bring down a response.' They made it with a day to spare. I suppose, therefore, the small business constituency and we in this place should be grateful that that happened.

         Before I go to some of the specific issues that are contained in this statement, I say to the House that I think that on a number of occasions the minister and other people in this place have actually maligned the position that former ministers and indeed the former Labor government took in respect of small business. It is a fact that a former Minister for Small Business, the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), brought forward a report and proposed legislation to look at the issue of unconscionable conduct. It is a fact—and he
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          admitted it in this place when the report was tabled—that he was unsuccessful in getting that through the cabinet, for reasons that I explained a little earlier.

         It is also important to recognise that it was a Labor government that in 1995 brought into this parliament a bill to do exactly what, on the outline that has been presented to us today, the present government seeks to do on unconscionable conduct. In fact, that bill was introduced in 1995 by Senator Schacht, the then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. Regrettably, for a number of reasons that occurred in March the following year, parliament was not reassembled after the Christmas break. As a consequence, with the change of government, that legislation lapsed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, it is also fair to say that that exact same legislation, picking up unfair and unconscionable conduct, was laid before this parliament as a private member's bill by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in May of last year and again earlier this year, when it lapsed and went off the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         . That was done because we believed after our time in government—as some have rightly pointed out, it probably took us longer than we would have liked at the time to get that legislation here—that it needed to be picked up. It is interesting that that same bill, if I am not mistaken—we have to wait until this afternoon when the minister actually introduces the legislation into the House—will mirror exactly what Kim Beazley put into the place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the bill has been there since May of last year. If this government were serious about protecting small businesses from unfair and unconscionable conduct, they could have simply picked up the Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill and introduced it here. I have said time and time again that we had done the work for you, as usual. We had led by example. We had provided the bill. All the government had to do was pick it up and run with it.

         At the end of the day it was because of the mobilisation of small businesses right around this country of ours at retail rallies.

         There is another element of this too. When this report was instituted and when responses were being sought to it, we had at the time a minister in the coalition government—the now defunct minister for small business, the minister for landlords, who now sits on the back bench—actually going out and playing a spoiling role. Without dwelling too much on the history of that, I think we had in the frame of the then minister for small business, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), a role being played where he was out there espousing the principles of the landlords all the time, rather than saying he would wait to get the report

         As a consequence, it is difficult then to go on and talk about the sorts of things which my good friend the minister does—unfair dismissal laws in small business and so on. They are not the major issues that they are worried about. They are worried about people coming in the front door. They are worried about business confidence. They are worried about the confidence in the economy. They are worried about interest rate reductions being passed on to them as small business people in the same way as they are if you are a new home buyer. They are worried about whether or not their franchise is going to continue to operate in a reasonable environment and relationship with a franchisor. If they happen to be retail tenants in shopping centres, they are concerned about whether, when they come in the next day, the shop will be boarded up or locked up by landlords who are trying to get excessive rents out of them.

         When you see the minister say in his speech, `The government has accepted the committee's recommendations either in whole or in part, according to the constraints on Commonwealth powers and the importance of delivering a policy outcome that maximises the benefits to small business whilst minimising any counterproductive impacts on the sector,' you have to have a very close looksee at what that actually means.

          , this committee report, the Labor Party would support the legislation emanating from it in both this House and the Senate posthaste. Get it in place and give some relief to small business. The government has committed itself to some changes and the government has committed itself to bringing down some legislation. That legislation is to be introduced this afternoon. We will reserve our view on that legislation until we see it. But if it goes in the direction in which the minister outlined in his speech here this afternoon, then again I reaffirm Labor's endorsement of it and its swift passage through this place, because that is what is necessary for consideration.

         As I have said, I agree that the parliamentary committee did a great job. Whilst we welcome the reforms that have been introduced in a variety of areas, particularly the legislative protection against unfair or unconscionable conduct, I have to say that this response by the government does miss the mark in one very important area—retail tenancy. It misses it because it has just introduced some bandaid measures in respect of retail tenancy matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am afraid that this government response does reflect something of a lack of courage on behalf of the government in going the whole hog for small business. I am afraid I still see the hand of big business or the hand of the former minister for landlords on the shoulder of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business at the present time because where it has been squibbed is in respect of small retail tenants who are in shopping centres. That is where it has been squibbed here.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Of all the recommendations contained in this response, the recommendation in section 2 on retail tenancy, which says that there should be a uniform retail tenancy code underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, is missing. Instead, in its place we have, as has been clearly outlined by the minister, a discussion that is to take place with state governments on the pretext that the states are the responsible entities when it comes to retail tenancy matters and the Commonwealth has not got a legitimate role.

        <break page="8775" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          That simply is not the case. I refer the minister to the committee's report and also to the report of the Motor Traders Association of Australia called

           Addressing the balance
          </emphasis>

Attached to that report is legal advice provided by Blake Dawson and Waldron to the effect that the corporations power gives this government the opportunity to deal with retail tenancy laws at the state and territory levels.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So the government, by not putting a uniform retail tenancy code in place and instead going off, as the minister has said, and talking to the states and all the rest of it, has not done what retail tenants want. It has not given them the protection that they want in respect of the sorts of things covered in here. What are those sorts of issues? Again, I simply refer members to the report itself—
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          Under the uniform retail tenancy code that was being sought, small businesses wanted to have covered issues such as security of tenure, lease assignment, disclosure of rents paid, rents and rent review, outgoings and promotions, leases and disclosure statements, tenancy mix, redevelopment and relocation. Under what we see now, none of that is there. Under what we have seen here, it simply is not going to happen. What we are going to get, as I have said, is just a series of talkfests put in place.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The other element in respect of retail tenancy matters was the recommendation that retail lease tribunals as part of a low&amp;hyphen;cost mediation and conciliation process be put in place. Again, that is not adopted. That recommendation is critical to allow the mum and dad small businesses low&amp;hyphen;cost redress if they have a problem in a regional shopping centre with the management or the company that operates that centre. That is not there.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In fact, we see the minister talking about going back to the courts. Go and talk to these small business people. Talk about inverse market power! If the mum and dad running a small business in a regional shopping centre were to take on the might of one of the large

          In relation to saying that they will put money into some of these cases proceeding so that there is a body of case law, I understand that that has been tried. I understand that that was a suggestion that was made in the past. It all gets settled out of court because no-one has the money to go on with it and the big companies do not want to take it any further so that that case law exists. How do you expect this thing to work if those sorts of problems are still there?

          As far as the uniform retail tenancy code is concerned, I think small businesses have been sold a pup. I think they really have. I think the minister has tried to dress this up by saying, `I'm sorry, the Commonwealth has got no power in this,' and clearly it has. He has tried to say, `I'll go and have a talk to the state governments and we will try to redress some of the issues there.' But it simply is not going to work.

           —Rugby league on this particular occasion. What he has done by playing strong is put in the recommendations that the Reid committee wanted on unconscionable conduct, with a few minor variations. Of course, we have to see the legislation, but he has actually done it. The minister has also put in a mandatory code, underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, for franchising. Again, we welcome that. I have a couple of concerns regarding that. He made mention in his speech here this afternoon of giving this new organisation that he has established a first chore to go away and come up with a definition of franchising.

          The minister's predecessor, the member for Forrest, cut the funding for what was then the Australian Franchising Code Council. He cut $2 million from the budget as an offered&amp;hyphen;up saving for the new body that was created. Is he going to reinstate funding for this new franchising council that he has developed? Not only that: what is he going to do about the replacement that has now been established called the Franchising Council of Australia—a revamped FANS? Of course, it lost all its money as a result of Geoff Prosser's action. Where does that organisation fit into this? Has there been consultation with them?

          I want to go back to retail tenancy matters and recommendation 2.1 on a uniform retail tenancy code. It says that the minister, in coming up with a uniform retail tenancy code, did not just have consultations with the Property Council of Australia and the Australian Retailers Association. I have to tell you that a lot of small businesses will tell you that the Australian Retailers Association does not represent them. This recommendation actually goes on to spell out another half a dozen organisations, as a minimum, that should have been consulted when coming up with a uniform retail tenancy code. Clearly this minister did not do so.

          As far as the new legislation for a franchising code of practice is concerned—I gather that will be coming not too far down the track—we would ask whether or not the dispute resolution adviser position that the minister talked about creating as part of the code of practice will have a statutory role. How will the position be established? I ask the minister to address those matters when he is speaking at the second reading stage or when the legislation to create the changes to the Trade Practices Act in respect of franchising is introduced.

          In respect of misuse of market power; again, there will be more consultation with state and territory governments. You have to ask the question: what happens if one of the recalcitrant state and territory governments does not like any of this? When consultations take place on areas such as retail tenancy and misuse of market power, what happens if the government of the day in South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland or wherever says, `Look, I'm sorry. We don't like what you are talking about. We don't like those mandatory codes. We're not going to be stood over by the Commonwealth government'? Again, a number of waterings down have occurred in the recommendation specifically made by the Reid committee. I think these are questions that are worth asking.

          There has also been a watering down in respect of small business finance. In the speech that was delivered by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business this afternoon, he talked about the government accepting, in principle, the Reid committee's recommendation that the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman's scheme and the banking code of conduct should be extended from unincorporated small business to include small business which is incorporated. He also said:

           It would seem that none of that has happened. This is why I said a little earlier that, although there is a lot of in&amp;hyphen;principle acceptance of the recommendations of the Reid committee report, when it comes to the actual `where do we go next?', there is still to be a lot of talking and a lot of discussion with state and territory governments and no guarantees yet that they will agree.

           I would have thought that, in the four months that this government have had, they would have been out talking. I would have thought that they would have called a meeting of small business ministers—unlike the last one that Geoff Prosser went to when he excused himself because of his conflict of interest. This minister could have sat down with all his counterparts from the states and territories and thrashed this out. But it has not happened. The response today says, `We'll get to it later. We'll do it later.' Whilst it is fine and well to say, `We adopt all these ideas in principle,' actually putting them into practice might be a little bit more difficult for this minister than he envisages. We will certainly be keeping an eye on that.

           As I said a little earlier, in respect to many of these issues that were outlined in the minister's speech I think this government has done reasonably well. But there is some devil in the detail. There is a question mark over how some of these issues will be delivered down the track. For example, there are still some unanswered questions about access to low cost justice. It is all dressed up in here, but there are some questions about educational opportunities for small business people. What is being said is, `We are not going to duplicate what the states do, and if the states are doing something, we will not get involved.' But, again, no discussion has occur

We need to see all of that. We need to see that small businesses and micro&amp;hyphen;businesses are going to find a balance as a result of this government's response to the recommendations of the Reid committee report.

           From our perspective, I say to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business that he has done well to get unconscionable conduct provisions and changes to the Trade Practices Act through his caucus and his cabinet. He has done well to talk about the issues of franchising with similar messages. He has done well with respect to the oil industry. He has done well with respect to misuse of market power. He has done reasonably well with respect to small business finance, although most of it depends on jawboning, and there is no compulsion in any of the elements in a lot of those areas.

It is all dressed up in nice glossy documents with the faces of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business splashed all over them. There are a few press releases to go out to regional areas of Australia and there are a few little glossies about what is going on.

          —by leave—On 15 October last year I made a statement in parliament about establishing the Defence Efficiency Review. The DER reported to me in March this year with a set of 70 recommendations and findings proposing a radical Defence overhaul.

         The purpose of the program is to free financial resources for re&amp;hyphen;investment in training, operations and equipment.

         Before I talk about the reform program's implementation, I want to outline the reasons why we undertook such a major task. The first reason was that there was a pressing need to improve the speed and quality of decision making within the Defence Force organisation and to reduce the size of bureaucratic structures which had developed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second reason was that, over the last decade, Defence funding has been under great pressure. In that period it has declined as a percentage of Commonwealth outlays from 8.8 per cent down to 8.2 per cent. At a time when spending in the areas of health, education and social security have significantly increased, Defence spending declined from 2.6 per cent of gross national product in 1986 to 1.9 per cent in 1997. These factors have made it enormously difficult for Defence to maintain high levels of operational and training activities, and to buy and modernise equipment.

The problem would have peaked after the turn of the century when our need to address that block obsolescence for major equipment across the services far exceeded the levels of resources likely to be available. The Defence Department was drifting towards a point where the only choice was to cut capability. Of course that is no realistic choice at all.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The previous government and the Defence organisation itself had been making attempts to reform, mainly through the force structure review and the commercial support program. The commercial support program in particular had made an important breakthrough in proving that the Defence Force could rely on the wider community to provide a range of support activities. The previous government also reduced Defence personnel numbers—some 15,000 between 1990 and 1996. None of these changes, however, was sufficiently far reaching to bring about the level of savings to overcome the problem I have described. They also did not address the need for major structural reform, and to reshape the organisation to focus on its key roles and functions.

         The Defence reform program is designed to overcome these limitations.

In particular we recognise that maintaining and developing combat capabilities is uniquely the role of the Australian Defence Force.

         The ADF will, of course, continue to put a high priority on peacetime activities such as high level strategic dialogues, regional defence cooperation and peacekeeping. But our capacity to do these things comes from having a credible military force—one our friends and allies know is highly capable—and that depends on being able to pay for it. The performance of each area in Defence is now directed towards and assessed against its contribution towards achieving this mission.

          Defence has put a great deal of effort into assessing the cost and savings estimates in the Efficiency Review. The department identified some small areas of double counting of potential savings. However, these reductions have been offset by increases in the estimates of other efficiency gains, especially in relation to speeding up the commercial support program. Overall, the Defence reform program is still targeted to achieve one&amp;hyphen;off savings of $500 million, and mature ongoing annual savings of at least $900 million. So the department's own costing of the DER recommendations already shows that we will considerably exceed the review's original estimate for recurring savings, which was $770 million. Depending on the final outcomes of market testing initiatives, these annual savings could be as high as $1,000 million a year.

         I must say I am delighted to see the Defence reform program given some form here in this debate. For two rounds of Senate estimates committees the minister left the senior officers of the department swaying in the breeze in an effort to try to define for the Senate what it is that the Defence reform program was about. There was some embarrassment in watching senior Defence personnel simply unable to answer questions about what the DRP was. Although the minister had made many press statements about the issue, none—until today—sought to give it any form or definition. Belated though it is, I am pleased to see that the government has now tabled a document which gives some form to the concept of the Defence reform program.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is necessary to go back and identify the genesis of the Defence reform program, which was the Defence Efficiency Review, that the minister announced following the election of the government. When that Defence Efficiency Review was announced in this parliament, I rose and, with some qualification, supported the establishment of the review. As I indicated, there is a shared view between the government and the opposition that it is important for resources to be allocated efficiently in Defence. It is a big organisation. It consumes about $10 billion a year from Treasury, and it is important that those funds are properly allocated.

My concerns were highlighted by the composition of that committee. That committee of six consisted of only one person with any military experience and military knowledge. The committee consisted of an executive in the AMP Society, an executive at Western Mining, two Defence bureaucrats, one military person and even one failed National Party senator from Queensland. That is not the group of people whom I would recommend to make the sorts of judgments that they were required to make.

         Nonetheless, at that time I lent support of the opposition for the establishment of the review because I thought it was an appropriate thing to do in assessing efficient application of resources. There are aspects of the Defence Efficiency Review, now the DRP, which I support and which go to improving the efficient use of the money. But there are a number of things in the DRP which the minister has referred to today that I have grave concerns about.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me set a few of the myths clear at the outset. In talking about getting resources to the sharp end and improving capability, we should understand that the DRP, the Defence reform program, will actually reduce the number of full-time soldiers in Australia to its lowest level since 1961. In fact, the total number of full&amp;hyphen;time uniformed troops in the ADF—that is, Army, Navy and Air Force combined—will be reduced under this program to its lowest level since 1963. We need to understand up&amp;hyphen;front that the rhetoric about capability is actually mirroring, or hiding, a very substantial reduction in full-time troop capabilities, and that is in addition to the reductions that were in the last two budgets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The last two budgets cut out in the order of 2,000 full-time military positions. In all, we will see about 5,000 full-time troops—military personnel, not civilian personnel—cut under the DRP on top of the 2,000 or so that were cut in the last budget and the one before. This is not a statement about expanding military personnel; this is a statement about reducing them.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I want to repeat also the context in which this review occurs within the defence debate. It occurs at a point in time when, for some 18 months now, we have seen a raft of uncoordinated decisions that, in spite of the minister's claims today, have rocked morale. What we have today is an effort to turn that raft of uncoordinated, unconnected decisions of the last 18 months into some sort of plan.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister announced today that, having cobbled those decisions of the last 18 months into a plan now, after the event, we will soon have a strategic review. In the context of defence planning, that strategic review amounts to the goal. That strategic review is your statement as a government of a nation as to how you see your defence strategic circumstances in the region and the world. Any sensible appraisement of how this business should have been done would have put those in the reverse order. The minister has got it all back to front in dealing with that. There should have been a clear, concise, strategic analysis followed by a force structure review. That should have then been followed by the decisions necessary to implement it. That was the model that was followed by Labor in office. It is the model, I might add, that is followed by like governments around the world.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am not aware of an example anywhere in the world where a government has set about this sort of efficiency review on this sort of scale without already having determined its strategic review. If you look at the case of the United States, when it went through a massive downsizing a few years ago it did precisely what I just recommended. It did precisely what the former Labor government did. It identified its strategic circumstance in the world. Having done that, it then set about scaling its troops down because it had reassessed its strategic analysis. This government has done it back to front. Some time later this year we will get a strategic analysis which will either be written to suit the decisions already taken or hopefully will coincide with them. In either case, we have had the cart before the horse.

           briefly want to touch on the issue of the service chiefs. When the changes were announced earlier this year to the role of the service chiefs, the position which the government and the minister put were more public relations spin than substance. That was not just borne out by political point scoring; it was borne out by the strongly held views of many people in uniform. It was borne out by the public knowledge, as it became, that the chiefs had a meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to express their view about the impending DER release, not least of all being their place in the situation.

           —I acknowledge the minister arranged for the meeting to occur. But the simple fact is that there was very serious concern only a few months ago that the chiefs of the services—of the Army, Air Force and Navy—were going to be sidelined under this new arrangement, sandwiched between a new and more powerful Chief of the Defence Force, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, Headquarters Australian Theatre, which had operational responsibilities for the actual tactical deployment of Army, Air Force and Navy combined.

          The chiefs do have an important contribution to make. I am happy to hear the minister reassure the House that the chiefs are in fact playing a greater role in the strategic policy formulation and advice which goes to government. Collectively, they—certainly all those that I have had the pleasure of being associated with in my time in this place—are people of outstanding ability and integrity and, possibly more important than that from the minister's perspective, they are people of great knowledge and skill whose advice should be sought and, more often than not, should be heeded.

          I am pleased that the minister has confirmed that that role for them is evolving. I might add that I think the changes do not of themselves do that. If anything, the changes run the risk of distancing the chiefs from it because it still relies on the CDF's determination as to the extent to which they participate. I do not think the changes gave them a greater participation, but if in fact in practice

What weapons do you put on them? I think it is code for saying, `We want to try to sweep submarines 7 and 8 under the carpet.' I think submarines 7 and 8 are important and they should be in that list of priorities.

          I would like to urge the government to revisit that issue sooner rather than later because time is running out. If we are going to actually get submarines 7 and 8, a decision has to be taken in a time frame of months, not years. If we do not do it in a time frame of months, we will lose some of the skills that are presently available in the organisation to acquire submarines 7 and 8 at the cost that we would want. If we take a decision after that, we will incur a cost premium, and that is not efficient management of limited resources.

          Troop capability is one of the areas that concerns me greatly out of the DRP. The proposals that the government is pursuing under the DRP are going to degrade, and at this time are degrading, the capability of Army. Full&amp;hyphen;time numbers are being cut now. They are being cut as we speak. They are being cut in this budget, they were cut in the last budget and they will be cut in the next budget. Full&amp;hyphen;time numbers are being cut now, but the reserve capability, which the minister rightly refers to as so critical, is actually going to take some years to reach the required levels.

           For the next few years, the plan that the minister and the government have embarked upon will, without doubt, reduce capability at least of the land forces. There is no sensible transitional plan that the minister has put in place for these major changes in the organisation of our land forces. So we have a circumstance where we take a couple of thousand full-time troops out of the system before we actually improve the capability of the reserves who are there in the system and who over time, it is argued, will fill that void. That is fine in the long term if it all works—and I want to say something about that in a minute because I do not think they have the prescription to make it all work either—but what is beyond doubt is that in the short term they degrade capability, and that is no way to do business.

           There are very important issues about reserves. Reserves do play an increasingly important role in the defence of Australia, and that is a position which the opposition supports. In government it was something that the Labor Party pursued and, in many respects, introduced to a new level. You cannot have reserves playing an increasingly important role in the defence of Australia unless you address the fundamental problems that individual reservists face when the Defence Force requires them to do more. Reservists have other things in their lives to do. Very typically, they have full&amp;hyphen;time jobs somewhere in the private sector doing things outside of defence. Like many others, they have families and other responsibilities.

           One of the most significant things that needs to be sorted out before you go down the track of getting rid of your full&amp;hyphen;time people is the civilian interests of reserves.

            this issue since August last year. If it is such a priority, and it should be—I have no doubt that is exactly what the minister has been advised because you cannot make the Defence Force work unless you address this problem, particularly under Army 21 and, more so, with the DRP pace of reform—why has the minister for personnel been sitting on a report for more than a year without giving a response? I would not worry about any action, I would settle for a response, but there is not even a response, let alone an outcome—an action. So much for it being, as the minister said, `a particularly important Defence initiative'. Yes, Minister, it is a particularly important Defence initiative and the sooner you get on with it the better.

           This situation has been made worse by the abolition of the Ready Reserve. I make no bones about my support for the Ready Reserve scheme.

           Again, the minister with primary responsibility for this is the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and the truth of the matter is that the minister has not actually announced an industry policy.

           What has happened is that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel advertised in the papers, asking anyone out there who has some ideas to let her know because next March she wants to announce a policy. Next March—two years after the government would have been elected and two years after she became minister—she is going to announce a policy, I assume, provided she gets lots of ideas from the public appeal for thought.

           I want to quickly contrast this with Labor's reforms. Under the Labor Party's reforms of the defence forces, we saw a gradual and measured way of getting efficiencies without destroying morale and without compromising capability.

           The minister is now proposing to make cuts which have a dollar value of more than twice that amount and to do it posthaste.

It cannot be done that way, and I think the minister would do well to revisit some of the Labor government's actions over the last few years and the way in which those savings were implemented by Labor. They were done without the sort of clumsy chaos that this government has created.

I am not sure the people working in Woolworths will be too keen turning up on the Army doorstep when the bullets are flying around. There actually has to be a wartime capability in this. You can take the CSP program, the commercialisation of Defence, only so far. If you take the commercialisation program beyond that, what you do is end up with a defence force that can fight a war for a week. The pace and extent to which the government is now proposing to go stretches those boundaries. It takes us to the limits where we will end up fighting a war for only a week.

          —On 28 April 1996, a tragedy occurred in Australia that is etched very deeply in the memories of us all. That was the day that we heard some 35 people had been killed and 20 wounded by a lone gunman spraying bullets around a peaceful part of Tasmania where, for years, tourists had gone with their families and friends. The youngest victim, Madeleine, was only three. Everyone knew someone—a wife, a daughter, a neighbour, a husband—who knew someone else who had lost a loved one in the massacre at Port Arthur. People became angry. They asked, `How could it possibly be that a man like that had access to that sort of gun and that sort of ammunition and was able to wreak that sort of havoc on innocent people?'

         The nation looked to our leader, John Howard, who, speaking as the voice of the people, made a commitment that this government would do everything possible to reduce the chances of such a tragedy ever happening again. He knew that there would be opposition. His resolve was tested to the full over the weeks and months to follow. In particular, he understood the impact on the law&amp;hyphen;abiding gun owners of Australia—the people who had fully subscribed to the laws and regulations of their states. In the case of Victoria, for example, gun owners were already required to have their firearms locked up and their ammunition separated, and they had to be licensed and registered.

He understood all of that and he did his best over those early weeks in the parliament to emphasise that, despite the impact on the law&amp;hyphen;abiding gun owners of Australia, it was essential that we had a regime across all states and territories that was consistent; that would ensure that every gun owner in Australia was checked in terms of their fitness and need to own certain categories of firearms.

Over $7 million has been paid in compensation to those 15,000 firearm owners. It does not mean the end of sporting shooting in the region. The state laws of Victoria, like the laws throughout the rest of Australia, allow sporting shooters to continue in sports with categories of firearms that are permitted, as long as they are shooting in a highly regulated, safe environment. In the small town of Kerang, with a few thousand people—the home of duck shooting in the state of Victoria—some 800 non-prohibited and 200 prohibited weapons were handed in. In return, some $500,000 was paid in compensation.

         As part of this new gun control program, our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) recognised that it was not just a case of removing prohibited firearms from the community. He also stressed the need for us to review the issue of gratuitous violence portrayed in videos which are accessible to our children and our young people. He also understood the need for any mentally unwell in our communities to be better helped and supported so that in times of distress or at times when they are less responsible for their actions they do not find themselves with a firearm in their hands.

         The editorial went on to say that the system:

         At the outset, I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) quite rightly did, and equally the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who obviously came under a fair amount of criticism during that period. The fact is that they had to persuade a number of more reluctant states to go along with the proposal.

        <para first-indent="16">
         However, if it is true that, if John Howard had not been the Prime Minister at the time, conservative forces in this country might not have had the courage to pursue this matter, it is equally true that they had the strong cooperation and support of the opposition. Historically, it is worth while referring to an article of 1 May 1996, written by John Cain about his experience in Victoria. In that article he commented:

         He also spoke about the aftermath of the New South Wales election, the Unsworth defeat, which I think less perceptive commentators took as a referendum on gun laws rather than

         So today we should again record our congratulations to the government on what they undertook but, equally, face the reality that if they had not had the support of the opposition in implementing those measures then quite obviously they would not have occurred.

         I support this motion, having a very passionate interest in this policy area. In my maiden speech in the state assembly of New South Wales in September of 1984 I cited an article by Frank Zimring, who has been one of the leading US writers on gun laws. I had the pleasure, earlier this year, of corresponding with him on these matters. In that speech—and this is part of the answer to those people who have various defences of gun availability—I said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Interestingly, Frank Zimring calculated in an article for the University of Chicago Law Review that in Chicago's homicide cases, victims and attackers were related as family, friends and acquaintances in 68 per cent of cases, while 82 per cent had altercations—domestic, money and liquor—where intentions are frequently ambiguous and there is usually a lack of planning. Incidentally, he also indicated that over half the situations involved an offender or victim who had been drinking.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I further noted:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Returning to Zimring's work, he noted that 52 per cent of homicides involved the gun and yet there was a rate of 2.3 more serious knife to gun attacks—as determined from surrounding circumstances and nature of wounds. This meant that there was a five times greater death rate from gun than knife attack. He also provides convincing evidence for an understatement of knife attacks in police figures. These statistics are vital when one considers the prevalence of ambivalent intentions in many homicides. The effectiveness of guns as murder instruments leads to a higher proportion of success.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is part of the reason that we seek to tighten up gun laws in this country. In a

          in 1995, Zimring again returned to the lethal nature of guns in comparison to other instruments. He noted:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What is novel in the recent past is the clear priority that life&amp;hyphen;threatening violence has assumed in public concern about crime and its control. Until the 1990s, the focus of concern was with crime and criminals. Lethal violence was, of course, the worst case of crime that inspired community fear, but the larger problem was crime generally.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A more specific concentration on lethal violence leads to a greater emphasis on the role of firearms for a number of reasons. One is the question of relative prevalence: guns are known to be used in less than 5% of all index crimes in the United States, as the National Rifle Association is quick to remind us; but guns are involved in fully 70% of all criminal homicides. A shift in emphasis from crime to lethal violence makes firearms appear a much more important issue. A focus on lethal violence also steers attention to firearms because it concentrates attention on death as an especially problematic outcome; this helps direct attention to circumstances of attacks that might increase the chances that death will result. The rationale for special attention to homicide puts emphasis on factors that influence the death rates from assaults.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . as previously mentioned, there is ample evidence that gun use is an important contributing cause to the high lethality produced by American violence. The serious assault rate in the United States is about 30% greater than in England. The homicide rate is 530% greater. Guns are an important part of the problem of lethal violence in the United States.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That does demonstrate the major reason for the need for licensing, registration and a general policy of restrictive availability—the fact that the gun is more lethal. Clearly, the statistics in regard to gun offences, suicides and accidental deaths show realities such as the fact that, whereas crimes in this country are far less prevalent in rural areas, coincidentally, in areas of higher gun availability and use—that is, rural areas of this country and of the United States—this is the one offence, the one problem, that is far greater in smaller communities. The fact of life is that the availability of guns has a clear correlation with young people suiciding and accidental shootings. Dr Arthur Kellerman, another expert in this field, in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          US News and World Report
         </emphasis>
         of 15 August 1994 said:
        </para>
        <break page="8792" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Most gun homicides occur in altercations among family members, friends or acquaintances. In a heated dispute, few carefully weigh the legal consequences of their actions. They are too busy reaching for a weapon. If it's a gun, death is more likely to occur.
         </para>
         <para>
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          So this is the other relevant aspect that we really have to put strongly in this debate. It is also the reason why the government has acted in this way. The fact is that most of these deaths are not the result of the action of some armed criminals, and those against the restriction would say that these criminals would still obtain guns. Most of these deaths occur when neighbours become aggravated with each other and when there are domestic disputes in a household where a gun is easily available. That is the reality of where the gun is used most fully.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, that is not to deny the sad reality of the pattern in the United States. Gun availability has reached the stage where it clearly has such a prevalent presence in the culture. That same
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           US News and World Report
          </emphasis>
          of August 1994 reported that 35 per cent of Americans commented that guns in their very neighbourhood were a serious problem. A further staggering 47 per cent of respondents to that survey indicated that they thought the presence of guns was a serious problem in their local schools. It was also interesting that 37 per cent of people could comment that they had actually heard guns go off in their community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The reality is that, if we do not do something about it—I think it is overdue; I think there should have been far more political courage far earlier—we do face that spiral evident in the United States, where there is a clear connection between gun ownership and people's attitudes to guns. There is a variety of surveys that show a clear connection between people's support of lax laws, no restrictions, and their ownership of weapons. So, as more and more people gain possession, you get a more and more entrenched group of people who are very determined to stop any kinds of changes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the situation in the US where, as early as 1994, there were 260 million guns in the American marketplace—double the level of gun ownership as recently as 1970. A very
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           large number of the people surveyed said they needed guns for self-protection. I, for one, question whether that is a good enough reason. In fact, 45 per cent of those in the United States who possess guns say that it is for personal protection. We do have to question a society which has reached the stage where vast numbers of people say that this is a significant social problem in their local communities and in their local schools. As it happens, more and more of them feel a need for self-protection, and more and more of them feel a need to obtain weapons. The spiral goes on, and it then impacts on people's attitudes toward the very need for restrictions.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another one of the claims is that guns do not kill people, individuals do. That ignores a statement of 2 May 1996 by Philip Alpers, who did a survey of the variety of mass killings in Australia and New Zealand. He noted in that survey that 73 per cent of the killers are now known to have had no previous history of mental illness; 87 per cent of the killers had no previous history of violent crime; two-thirds of the killers were licensed gun owners; 64 per cent of the victims died in a shooting where a military style semiautomatic was used. So in those 14 mass shootings over a period of 10 years in Australasia—which, unfortunately for those involved, involved the deaths of 124 people—there was no prior indication of the nature of the people. So to say that we can essentially have a policy which relies simply on weeding out a few of the more worrying individuals is not really the answer.

We do have an opportunity here to ensure that the whole gun culture of the United States is not repeated in this country.

           , dated 12 June 1996, David Nelson noted that 10 per cent of adults lived in households with firearms that were always or sometimes stored loaded and unlocked. An estimated 6.2 per cent of households with children had firearms that were loaded and unlocked, and about 40,000 children lived in these households. Over 4.4 per cent of adults carried loaded firearms in the past month. Rural residents, males and those with less than a college education were the ones living in those households. So that is some indication of the degree of so-called preparedness of people who are involved with guns—which are, supposedly, to ensure protection of their own families—and the control in the household as to the storage.

As the member for Murray highlighted and as the member for Reid agreed, it was really the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that made it possible. He stood firm throughout the process of negotiation of uniform laws at times when uniformity appeared almost impossible.

         Also in this connection I would like to commend those members and senators who were faced with the most significant opposition. They were mainly either members who were representing rural or regional electorates or senators who had their bases in those areas.

         The negotiations of the uniform laws took a number of months over a variety of different meetings. From my recollection it involved not only all the police ministers of the jurisdictions—the Commonwealth, the states and the territories—but also all the premiers and chief ministers as well as the Prime Minister. At the Police Ministers Council meetings, of which there were a number during 1996, there were significant contributions made by police commissioners and by senior officers of the different governments.

          The firearms buyback draws to a close today. In the end, it is the Australian firearm owners to whom the community must be grateful. They have responded in an overwhelmingly positive manner to the new laws and have worked hard to make the buyback scheme a success. As the member for Murray pointed out, as of this morning more than 600,000 firearms had been handed in and more than $292 million had been paid to firearm owners. They are not the final figures in either case. It is anticipated that there will still be a significant number of firearms handed in as of today. Many will be surrendered on a contingent basis pending a licence application for category C or D being dealt with. It is anticipated that there may be rejections of some of those applications and, on that basis, the numbers may be even greater than they presently appear to be.

          In addition to the money paid to firearm owners as compensation, an amount of $63 million has been paid to implement the buyback scheme and the accompanying education campaigns. This has been a necessary adjunct to the buyback scheme because without it the structure would not have been there to receive the firearms or to educate firearm owners in the need to comply with the rules.

          Dealers have been the subject of special consideration. As yet there is a great deal of work to be done in compensating those dealers whose business has dropped in value as a result of the uniform firearm laws. Their applications will be processed in the coming months and it is anticipated that it will take until the middle of next year for them to be completed. It will be only then that we will know how much of the money raised by the special Medicare increase from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent in the course of the last financial year will be left over. At this stage it is not anticipated that there will be a great deal.

          The member for Murray mentioned the independent research conducted by Newspoll on behalf of the government. This has clearly shown that the buyback has been a success in removing the bulk of the now prohibited firearms from the community. It has shown also that there is a fundamental change in
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           community attitudes towards dangerous firearms. The research was conducted in June and July of this year and involved surveys of a statistically significant group of 2,400 people aged 18 years and over across Australia.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The research found that about three-quarters of Australians who had in the previous 12 months owned firearms which are now prohibited under the new laws had by then already handed in those firearms under the buyback scheme. For more than 18 months, firearm owners have regularly reported to Newspoll that they intended to comply with the new rules. The percentage of firearm owners who said that they intended to comply ranged from 70 per cent some nine months ago to more than 80 per cent towards the close of the campaign. The research shows that the vast majority of the 1.2 million adult Australians who do own a firearm now own a legal firearm.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The overwhelming positive result of the 1996 national firearm agreement and the amnesty buyback is in those respects a very positive one for the nation. Since 10 May 1996 each state and territory in Australia has instituted the most comprehensive reform of firearm laws in Australian history. The buyback has been successful in delivering the first step towards safe, responsible and legal ownership of firearms under clearly defined and strengthened laws across Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Prior to the May agreement, differing or non-existent registration and licensing laws meant that there were no accurate figures on the number of firearms in Australia. The Newspoll research shows that there are substantially fewer firearms than the four to 10 million predicted by some opponents to the new laws. The research indicates that there are approximately 2.5 million firearms in private ownership in Australia, that is, 2.1 per firearm owner for the 1.2 million&amp;hyphen;odd who own firearms. It represents a significant reduction in the number of firearm owners in Australia by more than 100,000.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The research indicated that there is an incredible awareness of the new laws; it is virtually universal, with 96 per cent of those surveyed being aware of the laws. Important
          <break page="8795" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           ly, the research indicated strong support for firearms reform. Seventy&amp;hyphen;eight per cent of all adult Australians statistically are in favour in the laws and 56 per cent of people are strongly in favour of the new laws. The removal of dangerous firearms from our communities and the establishment of uniform registration and licensing systems, together with the introduction of comprehensive conditions for firearm ownership, mark a significant turning point in our nation's approach to firearms.

          Following the end of the buyback campaign, the Commonwealth and the states and territories will evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. The Australian Institute of Criminology will be monitoring the effect of the new firearm laws over the next three years. Work has already begun on this project.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In identifying achievements, I think we can point to the removal of more than 600,000 of the more dangerous firearms from the community; the establishment of a national register with national education schemes, storage laws and rules relating to dealing; and, a subject mentioned by the member for Reid, the change of culture. You now must have a genuine reason for owning a firearm; personal protection is not an appropriate reason. If you want to own a more dangerous firearm in category C or D, you must have a genuine need for that particular firearm.

          In the future, we can look to the 400 to 500 firearm caused deaths that have occurred in recent years in Australia reducing. The bulk of those are suicides; homicides and accidental deaths are also contributory. But the availability of firearms has been reduced, and therefore the risk to the community of death or injury from firearms will be reduced.

The speech of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) was, of course, more predictable. His views are very much city based Labor views. It is characteristic of them that they should adopt this attitude. The member for Murray spoke with the sincere, passionately held ignorance that you would expect from Labor people in this area.

         The member for Murray talked about the  understanding of the Prime Minister. John Howard did not understand anything. It is quite clear that John Howard did not, in the beginning, know the difference between a self&amp;hyphen;loading and an automatic weapon. Many members of this House, to this day, do not know the difference. I believe that John Howard, desperate for a measure to elevate himself as a strong leader, grasped this on the advice of his Sydney PR people. While it has been said that this measure was popular across Australia, it is overwhelmingly much more popular in Sydney than it is elsewhere.

         This is what one would expect if one looked back in history and recalled that John Howard, our Prime Minister, is the man who set off across Australia an unjustified wave of revulsion against the French when they resumed nuclear testing when he knew, every media person knew, every member of this parliament knew, that there was not one scintilla of evidence of any risk at all to Australia or Australia's interests from French nuclear testing. It was that wave of revulsion that led to acts of violence in Perth, for which the Prime Minister ultimately must bear the responsibility.

         Let us analyse Martin Bryant. Martin Bryant was a lunatic—a certified lunatic. Even under Tasmania's laws he was not allowed to have a gun. It is alleged there were reports six weeks before Port Arthur of Martin Bryant indiscriminately firing a gun on his property—he was reported by neighbours. No action was taken. It is also alleged that gun dealers in Hobart reported him for trying to acquire parts for a machine&amp;hyphen;gun—probably the breech for a Bren gun. Again, no action
         <break page="8796" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          was taken. I do not think there is any doubt that Martin Bryant had access to a gun handed in during a previous police amnesty in Victoria.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us have a look at the history of guns. Since 1915, when records began being kept in this country, the incidence of gun related violence has continually dropped; it has been graphing downwards at a consistent rate. It was not a great problem for Australia. I think that, in the last year before this ban, 71 people were killed by guns in Australia. Far more were killed in many other ways. Far more, contrary to what the member for Reid said, were killed in Australia by knives and blunt instruments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) put his finger on it. He said most of them were suicides; they were—and most of them were in the country. With the exception of Martin Bryant's father, I do not know of anyone who has ever shot themselves more than once when committing suicide. So clearly an automatic weapon is not necessary. The reason for most of those suicides is stress caused by economic pressure; pressure put on farmers mainly by the actions or the lack of action of governments. This House is ultimately spending half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money on this PR exercise. I suggest that, had that money been applied to an interest rate subsidy or debt reconstruction, it would probably have achieved a much greater reduction in suicides.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We must also look at the facts. A lot of the guns that came into this country and that were causing consternation were automatic military weapons, for which I hold no brief at all. They are not much use for sporting. They are, in fact, designed and only used for shooting people at close range—the AK47 from China being a classic case; a cheap close range weapon.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These weapons were coming into Australia by the container load with the full knowledge of both the Labor Party when in government and the present government. They were distributed mainly from Queensland, with the full knowledge of the governments concerned. No attempt was made to stop them when they could have been stopped at source at the time,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          as they should have been stopped. I was talking to one gun dealer in Sydney who said that one of his main sources of customers were the Vietnamese. It is very unlikely that they have handed in their AK47s. Why would they, when they know very well that the government cannot protect them from crime within their own society? A complaint that I have often had from Asian migrants is that we do nothing to protect them from crime within their own society; we would rather say that it does not exist.

         The history of guns in the United States shows that, unlike the situation in Australia, gun related violence is rising. It occurs at about twice the rate that it does in Australia and it is rising. But again, if you take out of the calculations five United States cities—New York, Washington, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles—the actual rate of gun related violence in America is significantly lower than it is in Australia. In those five cities, it is mainly the socio&amp;hyphen;ethnic violence which is causing this mayhem. In some of those cities, the gun laws are prohibitive. It is virtually impossible to legally own a gun. That demonstrates how little effect this measure is going to have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, it has to be understood that many people who have handed in their guns have simply used the money to go and buy another gun—a gun which can be just as lethal if used incorrectly. There was an absolutely laughable suggestion about shotguns; here again, our Prime Minister did not understand that by choking a shotgun down to a two&amp;hyphen;shot you had basically the same as a double&amp;hyphen;barrel, but it took much longer to load it. The experience is—as anyone who deals with guns knows—that you can discharge far more shells from a double&amp;hyphen;barrelled shotgun than you can from a self&amp;hyphen;loading because of the time it takes to reload the gun.

         The laws in Western Australia were already very severe, but since these new draconian laws we have seen that the police have permission to enter your house and search it if they believe that you have a gun; there is no need for a warrant. This will be abused; it has already been abused; and, of course, it is going to be abused on an ongoing basis. We have gone further than this now. If you erode people's freedom a little bit, you might as well do so a bit more. Following this legislation, the police have the power to enter your home and take you away for a 60&amp;hyphen;day psychiatric assessment if they think you are mad.

The French have recognised the right to self-defence in one's own home. It is now obvious that the Frenchman's home is his castle.

          Madam Deputy Speaker, fair trading is one of the key elements of this government's strategy, outlined in our 1996 `New deal for small business' policy statement, to provide an economic environment that rewards business for good commercial decisions to invest, innovate and employ. Already those outcomes are being delivered, through our fiscal and monetary policies and through the fundamental program of reform of small business regulation announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the

          Although not limited in its analysis, the committee was asked to have particular reference to the position of small business retail tenants and franchisees—areas of industry where repeated calls for action against unfair conduct had been made.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee found that small businesses were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. It found that much of the unfair business conduct arises from inadequate disclosure of information and the imbalance of bargaining power between parties prior to making an agreement. `New Deal: Fair Deal' deals with these concerns. It represents the strongest message ever from a federal government to small business that fairness in the commercial relationship is critical to a buoyant business environment. Small businesses now have a national government that has listened, has understood and has acted.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business, and to provide to small businesses that are unfairly treated adequate means of redress. The government has accepted these conclusions and, through `New Deal: Fair Deal', is acting on each of the seven areas of reform identified by the committee, namely, unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice and education.

           That is why I have introduced this legislation into the parliament today. This government is strengthening the Trade Practices Act 1974 to better protect the legal rights of small businesses, to ensure that small business can confidently deal with large firms in the knowledge that the rules under which they are operating are fair, and that there will be proper redress available when those rules are broken. By adopting these measures the government will achieve the desired outcomes without unduly impacting on the operation of the open market, compromising the basic principles of contractual relations or creating undue commercial risk, concepts which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy.

           In this context, a series of information packages will be developed for small businesses. Small businesses should be aware of their rights and responsibilities leading to and in the course of contractual arrangements. The government places high importance on improving the quality of information, education and training available to small business about business conduct and fair trading issues. Notwithstanding the government's commitment to strengthened legislation and enforcement mechanisms, the adage of prevention being better than cure remains true—especially for small businesses with limited financial resources.

The government's approach will strengthen the substantive legal rights available to small business against unfair business conduct and, as well, improve enforcement of rights and access to remedies for small business. The government will achieve these objectives through legislative amendment of the Trade Practices Act in four areas:

            This bill will provide a new substantive legal remedy for small business against unconscionable conduct in the Trade Practices Act. The government has accepted the principle that small business people are entitled to a legal protection against unconscionable conduct which is comparable to that accorded to consumers. This is an approach which has been recommended by a parliamentary committee to previous governments, but not acted upon.

            Accordingly, the government will mirror for small business consumers, in a new section of the Trade Practices Act, the legal rights available to consumers in section 51AB, and incorporate a range of additional matters, set out in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report, in order to ensure that the new provision achieves its purpose of protecting small businesses.

As with existing section 51AB, the commencement of legal proceedings in relation to a contract or transaction will not, of itself, constitute unconscionable conduct.

            This measure also will provide an avenue under the Trade Practices Act for some small and specialist retailers to pursue remedies where retail leasing contracts or conduct by retail landlords was unconscionable. It will be particularly beneficial to retail tenants as it allows a court to have regard to the relative strengths of the bargaining position of the retailer and the landlord in determining whether the conduct is unconscionable.

            Notwithstanding this, the government would expect that the vast majority of commercial transactions would not be challenged under the new provision.

Following the introduction of the safety net arrangements, the states and territories held discussions with the industry and have agreed to a revised level of taxation.

         Let me set the scene in broad terms for honourable members. As part of the restructuring for some years now of the wheat industry and the marketing of wheat and as part of the overall reform of agriculture was a decision of the former Labor government that growers become much more involved in the marketing of the product and become much closer to the customer so that they could be more responsive to market trends and more involved and more informed about the various issues involved, including the financial arrangements in underwriting $2 billion worth of the wheat stockpile and the marketing of that both on the domestic and international markets. Prior to that, the operation was conducted by the Australian Wheat Board and underwritten by a government guarantee where growers grew their wheat and the Wheat Board guaranteed to buy it and it then became the responsibility of the Wheat Board and the government to sell it. Like many other areas in the Australian economy, this has been changing.

         In arrangements negotiated by former ministers Kerin, Simon Crean and Bob Collins, the former government set up the process which has led to the model that has now been presented in this House by the minister.

         That culminated in the Senate taking a decision three weeks ago for the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee to conduct hearings into the bill with a closing date of 23 October, as it now is. It was going to be 2 October. There was sufficient discontent on the part of a number of growers and participants in the wheat industry for the Senate—and not just the opposition in the Senate but also the government members in the Senate—to approve the standing committee having a look at the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill and bringing down a prompt report dealing with a number of these issues.

         Quite frankly, I thought that the government had decided to postpone consideration of this bill in the House pending the report back from that committee. It conducted its first hearing in Canberra last week. It is only conducting two hearings. It is a rapid inquiry. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), one of the better informed members of the government in relation to the wheat industry, made representations to that committee. I had assumed that the government was postponing consideration of this bill in this House while that committee went about its task and reported back so that we could all have the benefits of its consideration before this debate was brought on, which has happened tonight.

         In the restructuring of the wheat industry, in particular the Australian Wheat Board, there were always issues involved in moving the government guarantee out of underwriting the funding of the cost of the Australian wheat pool. There were also issues about who would actually be on the new body which would actually oversee what we call the single desk. One of the things that has been adopted by the government and continued to be supported by the opposition, myself included, is the notion of the single desk—that is, collecting all of Australia's export wheat together and marketing it through a single marketing authority that operates on the international market on behalf of Australian wheat growers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Formerly that Wheat Board was a body consisting of people appointed by the minister. Now it is being transformed into a grower owned company. Within that structure, or underneath it, we formed a body—I guess you would call it that—called the wheat industry fund, which has been funded since 1989 by grower levies. It now has something in the vicinity of $440 million in it. That is growers' funds that they have been compulsorily depositing in it with the view in mind, first of all, that it would provide some financial support at the time that the domestic market was deregulated and it became open selling within the Australian domestic market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It went past that phase and has now become the capital base that will underwrite the capital structure of the privately owned company that will take over from the Australian Wheat Board. It will have substantial equity in the vicinity of $550 million, which means that the grower owned body will have its own capital that growers have been saving towards, if you could use that term, since 1989. That was the structure that was envisaged by us and it is all falling into place.

But they may make a decision at the point at which they fully control it themselves to list it as a public company, which means institutional investors will then be able to buy shares and they may in fact buy out the shares of growers, if they want to sell them.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of issues that then arise out of that structure. If, for instance, institutional investors become shareholders of the future grower owned company, the shareholders, by law, have a very direct responsibility and the directors have a very direct responsibility. That responsibility is to maximise the return to the shareholders.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          But if that same company has a second objective, and that is to maximise the return to the grower, you may well have a quite direct conflict of interest because the only way you can maximise the return to the shareholder is by squeezing the returns to the grower, thus increasing the profit of the company and therefore the dividend to the shareholders. While the grower and the shareholder are the same person, that does not matter very much but, if it seeks to list on the stock exchange, if it opens itself up to being a corporate body in that sense, these are issues that have to be resolved and have to be determined.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the issues that also has to be determined by the government is that, during this period of growth of the wheat industry fund, the capital value of the shares of the growers that are held in it at the moment have actually improved quite substantially. When they finally come to be listed as publicly traded shares, or as internally traded shares, whether it is just growers selling to other growers and the sale of those shares is drawn back in, are they subject to capital gains tax? Having been required contributions by the government to underwrite the equity of the pool, when the grower actually gets his or her money back and has made a capital gain on them, are we
         <break page="8805" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          now going to say that they have to pay capital gains tax on those shares? That is one of the issues that is yet to be resolved.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So a number of people are putting to the government and to the Senate committee that they have quite serious concerns about the process that is being undertaken by the minister. The minister has brought in what we call the first tranche of the whole package. He has brought in the  Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 , which sets up the transition stages from the Wheat Board through to the new grower owned company, but the bill does not provide any of those answers on those issues that will really have to be answered and resolved during the next 18 months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many people saying now, `Hang on, you're expecting us to buy a pig in a poke. Why would you bring in half the show now? Why do you have to rush through half the legislation now? Why are we being forced to accept this model without our having a real picture of what might be the second half of the model?' So those concerns are now being quite strongly voiced—particularly by Western Australian grain growers, who are responsible for a substantial part of Australia's export wheat.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not very often that I find myself here in the House quoting from the comments of the member for O'Connor. There are not all that many things in policy terms that he and I have in common, but I did see something like that in his evidence to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 15 September. He said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first question to arise is whether the Wheat Board is ever going to be the same operation. Why are we rushing into this particular legislation, years before the full privatisation is proposed when the Wheat Board can continue to operate in its present form, while all the outstanding issues are resolved?
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So a significant player in this issue on the government side is asking the same question I am—that is, why are we rushing into this? He also raised the question of the conflict of interest of shareholders. I quote again his words:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . you get elected with a responsibility to the people who then own the shares—
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         assuming that an outside institution or private investor has become a shareholder in this company; if that happens:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the law provides you must look after the shareholder. That means you maximise the profits of the Australian Wheat Board. To some extent, you can do it by your skill in marketing, but primarily you will do it by reducing returns to wheat growers.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So the member for O'Connor made exactly the same point that I am making now. This potential conflict of interest comes through the structure the minister is proposing and because he is presenting the first tranche of the legislation without giving us a look at the finer details of the next stages.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is another issue that concern is being expressed about—that is, the future holdings of growers in the wheat industry fund. This model is requiring that the $500 million not be accessible to growers at this point, and it will not be accessible for another two years. The member for O'Connor has again made the very valid point that, with a number of growers on the east coast of Australia facing long-term climate changes, they need to be able to access some capital.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At this point, the money in that fund is government guaranteed and can be used, for instance, as security if a farmer goes to a bank or someone else to borrow against  future crops. Many farmers would actually like to be able to withdraw their equity in the fund, and on average that amounts to up to $200,000. They would like to be able to draw on those funds.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we established this model back in the late 1980s—and I have had some discussions with some of the farmer organisations about this—interest rates in Australia were much higher than they are now. We had not put into the economic structure of the nation the long-term patient capital base that is now there in the form of $400 billion worth of superannuation funds. Now you find in Australia that there is quite a different investment climate and quite a different pool of capital available. It may be that growers ought to be able to exercise some choice about withdrawing their funds from the WIF because, with interest rates having declined to the levels that they
         <break page="8806" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          are now, it may no longer be necessary to have this degree of grower owned equity in the company or this degree of leveraging that we felt back in 1989 would be desired in the model.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not giving a definitive answer on this. What I am saying is that things have changed. There are calls by some growers who want access to their funds now because what they invested in was a government guaranteed and controlled fund with no risk. They always knew they would get their money back dollar for dollar, full value. Now their fund is being transformed into a free enterprise risk structure and, while I would say at this point it is quite unlikely that there would be any diminution in their capital value, the fact is that this legislation does provide that the new holding company can have access to funds from the WIF to do some of its tasks during the next two years. If the new holding company performs badly, it is possible that it could run down the capital value of that equity in the wheat industry fund. It is also true that, with government underwriting being withdrawn, the wheat industry fund, the Wheat Board and the holding company do not have the same access to three-star, AAA rated, government backed funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there is a commercial risk. Of course there is. We are transforming this whole thing into a grower owned, private sector operation with a government sanctioned export single desk, but that carries with it the normal commercial risk. Some of those growers are saying, `Hang on. I didn't put my money in for it to be that. I put it into a government guaranteed and operated monopoly. I would like to take my money out now.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am personally quite relaxed about that. I believe there is a case to say that we ought to be rethinking this restriction on their access to the funds because I do not think the circumstances warrant that it be locked up in that form any longer. A number of issues on the table before the Senate committee really require a little bit of extra consideration before we make a final decision on this bill in the House.

I think it is fair to say that, without that action by the honourable member for Grayndler, this legislation on the part of the government would never have appeared before this House.

         The legislation establishes a cap of 80 movements per hour on the operations of Kingsford Smith airport, subject to certain exemptions relating to matters such as military needs, emergencies and the like, none of which the opposition has any complaint about; it provides for Airservices Australia to monitor the compliance with the cap and also
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          establishes a slot system to ensure that there is a more diffuse distribution of aircraft movements than currently applies at the moment; it provides for fines of up to $220,000 for infringements of the cap and slot arrangements; it establishes a framework for allocation of slots but provides that the detail for that process will be in regulatory arrangements that presumably will be put before the parliament in due course.

         It is based on an IATA model, although there are some variations which are worth noting at least. Firstly, I am pleased to say that there is protection for the interests of regional airlines, which is critical to the economic and social existence of many parts of rural and regional New South Wales, and which ensures that the slots available for regionals cannot be interfered with or diminished. Secondly, 50 per cent of the unallocated slots will be available for new entrants, which thereby ensures that there is an encouragement to greater competition in aviation services, which I am supportive of. Thirdly, there is a strict compliance regime, as I indicated, with fines and compliance—courtesy of Airservices Australia—which also are clearly necessary in order to make sure that this regime works.

         Having said that, I point out that the Labor Party very strongly supports the notion of a cap at Sydney airport and also the current curfew arrangements. It is critical that relief is provided to people living in the immediate vicinity of Sydney airport. I ask honourable members who are a bit cynical about Sydney airport issues—and there are some—to go and visit places like Sydenham, to stand there, to visit people in their houses, as I have done, to actually experience what it is like to live immediately under that flight path with the ever increasing level of aviation traffic. It is an extraordinary experience.

         The suffering that many people have to go through because of the massive increase in the use of Kingsford Smith airport is not going to change. The projections tabled by the minister in recent times—the projections associated with the EIS into the proposed Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy alternatives for a second Sydney airport—indicate that there will be a steadily mounting level of aviation traffic for Sydney. Commonsense suggests that that is precisely what is going to occur. If that continues to occur at Kingsford Smith airport, life for many people, which is already very difficult, will just simply become unbearable.

          It was interesting to note on the last visit that I made to the area that there is a degree of backsliding by the government with respect to insulation matters. For example, one place that I visited was the Stanmore Baptist Church. It was originally promised insulation and has been engaged in something of a tug of war with the minister since that period, trying to get proper insulation for what is a desperately needed requirement, that is, to be able to do basic things like conduct church services, weddings and funerals without having to interrupt them every two or three minutes as a plane flies over. That is literally what has to happen.

          Can you imagine what it is like on your big day—your wedding day or the day when you are farewelling a loved one at a funeral—when the service has to be interrupted every few minutes because the noise of an overflying plane is so severe that it is impossible for anybody in there to be heard? That is what people have to put up with in that church.

          We have had a ludicrous response from the government that they will insulate one church building. Apparently, according to the government, all churches are the same: they have one major building where people worship and any other buildings associated with it really are nothing to do with worship.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In this instance, there are two major buildings, both of which are used for worship purposes, both of which do need insulation. There is also a third building which probably should have it as well. But it would appear that, in the government's view, only one is qualified for insulation. They should stand firm with respect to the commitment that was made previously to insulate both buildings at the very least.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Another matter, where the government does not deserve any blame, is the diabolical consequences that have been suffered by the businesses in Sydenham. It is an issue that has gradually unfolded—I referred to it a moment ago—and has really hit a peak in the term of office of this current government, although it did emerge in the latter period of the former Labor government. Something like 13 businesses—ordinary businesses like milk bars and newsagents, hardware stores and
          <break page="8810" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          There is the anomaly where people living above their businesses are deemed not to be in residential accommodation and therefore do not qualify for insulation or purchase, even though the location would otherwise qualify them. So there are one or two people in that situation in the businesses as well. Their situation is an appalling one. I urge the government and the new minister to look very carefully at trying to do something to assist those businesses. Through no fault of their own, their economic hinterland has been laid waste. The local base from which they drew their custom has been destroyed, and most of them have closed down. It is a tragic situation and one that really does deserve some assistance from government.

          It is worth commenting on the situation with respect to Sydney airport more generally. As far as the opposition is concerned, the new long&amp;hyphen;term flight plan that has been introduced by the government is totally unfair. It is designed primarily to relieve the burden on the electorate of Bennelong, the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which, prior to the last election, he was a bit nervous about losing. In the past we had what was referred to as the Bennelong funnel. We now have, courtesy of the new arrangements, the Bennelong triangle—the place where the aeroplanes disappear.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When you actually look at the maps, when you see the flight paths that are now proposed or are now operating, you will see that they head off in a triangular sort of pattern: north of the airport there is a gap that opens up and it just happens to consist of the electorate of Bennelong—the electorate of the Prime Minister. That is the primary objective of the Sydney airport long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan—to relieve the pressure on the electorate of Bennelong.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There have been a variety of features of this plan which I think are worth referring to. The first is the use of the concept of aircraft movements as a basis for determining the distribution of noise. That sounds, superficially, a reasonable proposition, but it is not,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           because not all movements are the same. Take&amp;hyphen;offs are quite different from landings because take&amp;hyphen;offs involve more noise; but take&amp;hyphen;offs are more flexible in where they can head, once you get a few kilometres away from the airport, than are landings which, by definition, have to come in both low and straight. Secondly, in terms of impact, there is a difference between the movements of major jumbo jets—for example, 737s, 767s and so on—and small commuter aircraft. Yet these are all defined as movements.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is by no means an accident that this is occurring. The proportion of take-offs—the most noisy, intrusive form of movement—by major planes over water, over Botany Bay to the south, has been significantly reduced. Again it is not an accident. It has been reduced. The number of landings from the south has been increased. The reason is that, when you have take-offs to the north, it is easier to avoid the electorate of Bennelong because they can, and they do, head off to the left and to the right. But they cannot do that with the landings. So it is all about protecting the Prime Minister's electorate, the electorate of Bennelong. That is exactly what is occurring. It is very blatant when you actually look at the detail.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is interesting to note that this also involves significant breaches of election promises. There was a promise that there would be no northern take-offs from the third runway. Do we remember that promise? That promise has been abandoned. Also, there was the promise that there would be no additional aircraft noise for Lowe. That promise has been abandoned. Guess where the planes are heading? The inner north-west is copping a beating as a result of the new arrangements, and the eastern suburbs around Coogee and Randwick are copping a beating because the northern take-offs from the third runway are doing a hard right 30&amp;hyphen;degree banking turn to head in an easterly direction in order to ensure that the Prime Minister's electorate does not cop the brunt. I might add that that includes the rest of the North Shore, which is represented by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), at the same time.

           Not only is this unfair but it also raises significant safety questions. The experts will tell you that it is perfectly safe to do the hard banking right-hand turn, but it does raise a question in your mind along these lines: if there is an emergency at that particular point, isn't there a risk that the chance of avoiding disaster is less than if the plane is level? A significant question that this government has to address is whether or not there is a diminution in safety—it may be only slight—as a result of the insistence on the hard banking right-hand turns on take-offs from the third runway.

           It is ironic that the former minister, Mr Sharp, who introduced the long-term operating plan, became a victim of it in May. He discovered that one of the consequences of the long-term operating plan is that it causes planes to bank up in a queue. Planes have to circle in the sky for quite some time, waiting in a queue. On 17 May this year he was in a small plane waiting to land, and he got a bit frustrated. So he rang them up on his mobile phone. The pilot did not contact the control tower. It was not the pilot. No, it was the minister, the passenger, who rang the control tower. He did not ring them via the radio—the normal open line which other pilots can hear. Why? Because he knew other pilots could hear. He rang on the 1800 number—the private line. That private line is there for another purpose, which is for pilots to ring in to lodge flight plans before they leave the ground.

           It is also worthy to note in the context of this debate that this government—committed, supposedly, to the notion of a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek—decided after the election, having said nothing about that before the election, that it was going to consider Holsworthy as an alternative site. There is a whole range of possible reasons why this was added. Of course, the electors of Hughes and other surrounding electorates were not informed of this prior to the election. According to the government, that is a minor detail, but they were not informed.

         The 1.5 million people in the Sydney basin whose lives are affected by aircraft noise are better off as we progress through the delivery of the policy that we promised prior to the last election. That policy had a number of components. The first component was to reopen the east-west runway—the one the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) closed some time ago in order to punish the people of Marrickville, Sydenham, Leichhardt, Drummoyne—and I note the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) is here; he is always representing very vigorously the views of his electorate.

What we are doing now is delivering the legislation that we promised prior to the last election. And we are delivering lock, stock and barrel. It is more than what people bargained for because we are delivering a slot system, which Mr Albanese's bill did not have in it, which is going to ensure that the cap of 80 movements per hour is feasible. Secondly, we are ensuring that a certain number of slots are reserved for regional airlines. Thirdly, we are ensuring that, basi

That is a plan that has gone through enormous community consultation over the last few months.

         In the 1995 budget, Mr Brereton, the Labor Minister for Transport, had allocated a total of $762 million to the government's commitment to the airport's development at Badgerys Creek, including associated infrastructure. The funding was not delivered because of the then Liberal opposition opposing the leasing of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport which was to provide the funding for that project. If there is any doubt that the present government is aware that money had been allocated, on 2 June 1996 in response to a question by Glenn Milne in a

         In addressing the bill before us, I wish to note that the opposition supports the cap of 80 movements an hour. Indeed, we say it is substantially catch&amp;hyphen;up politics consequent upon the private member's bill introduced by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) on 4 May 1996. Be that as it may, it would be ungracious not to accept that this cap is a good thing. But the reality is that it is operating in a flawed, inefficient and unsafe system with the crossing runway configuration in such an extremely busy airport. I want to focus on those three issues: efficiency, safety and cost.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of the efficiency of the airport and why it is vital for the airport to operate efficiently, in answer to a question on notice the minister advised me on 2 December 1996 that in 1994 Australian exports valued at $6 billion go through Kingsford Smith—`35 per cent of Australia's total airfreight exports'. The `income generated from tourism through Kingsford Smith' is $13 billion. It generates eight per cent of Sydney's total work force; $3.9 billion is directly generated by Sydney airport to the New South Wales economy and that has a $7.7 billion flow&amp;hyphen;on to the rest of the New South Wales economy. The answer states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There are 35,000 jobs directly related to operations at Sydney Airport, with a further 33,000 jobs attributed to the flow&amp;hyphen;on from the airport.

        <para style="Para">
         In those circumstances you do not hamper the efficiency of an extremely busy and extremely vital operation. The Hume Highway to Canberra is a four&amp;hyphen;lane highway with two major strips of road. Of course, if you put an intersection across that major highway you are going to impede efficiency. But we are not talking about cars going at 110 kilometres per hour, we are talking about massive jumbo jets going at about 300 kilometres an hour before they take off—effectively without brakes. Of course that cross&amp;hyphen;runway impedes efficiency, and that was acknowledged in the minister's answer to me.

          Hence he said, effectively, that is why the east&amp;hyphen;west runway can only operate in the off&amp;hyphen;peak periods. The reality is that it is costing money, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) mentioned earlier. It is a cause of delay. The minister himself experienced that on 17 May this year when he was flying around Sydney because of the delays caused by the operation of the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. In fact, the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian
          </emphasis>
          reported on 12 August that Qantas Airways had lost just over $90 million from delays in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Qantas said that the departure delays at Kingsford Smith were 10 times worse than the average for Australian and overseas airports. That is a disgrace, and that has been caused by the inefficient crossing runway configuration.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Perhaps even more vital than that are the safety repercussions. In an answer dated 15 May, to me, the minister confirmed that there had been 161 incidents between May 1996 and 31 December 1996. That is about five safety incidents a week that happened, and no doubt they are still happening at Kingsford Smith each week. We are talking about a very serious situation in terms of the consequences of a very busy airport now running with a crossing runway configuration.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition to that, between January this year and 26 May there were 116 aborted take&amp;hyphen;offs.

          He was expressing objection to the fact that this minister is requiring planes to use the east&amp;hyphen;west runway when the crosswinds exceed the international standard of 15 knots per hour. Indeed, a

          This is in the context where the draft operating plan—the recommendation to the minister, recommendation 27—said that, as a precondition to implementing the long-term operating plan, it was necessary to have an independent safety expert from overseas, without connections to the Australian bureaucracy, conduct a safety audit of the proposal. That still has not been done, and I pity the incoming minister because a disaster is on his head because of the irresponsible acts of the former minister in not having a safety audit, nor, for that matter, from my constituents' point of view, any environmental impact statement procedure at all, despite the boasting about the EIS procedure which is happening at Badgerys Creek. What I am talking about is a very significant safety issue.

          I am a pilot operating large aircraft out of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. Last Sunday afternoon, when the wind was straight down the long north&amp;hyphen;south runway, the duty runway was the much shorter east&amp;hyphen;west runway.

          The reason for this ridiculous situation is the political desire to "share the noise".

          The former speaker, the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), was a lawyer. He knows that that constitutes notice. Having been forewarned, to ignore that warning would make those responsible personally liable for the consequences of a tragedy.

          I have this to say, regrettably: if the minister continues to allow public pressure from the electorates of North Sydney and Bennelong to dictate what happens to the efficiency of Sydney KSA and the safety of KSA, there unquestionably and regrettably has to be a serious incident at KSA. The new minister, regrettably, is going to cop the consequences of that because of the completely irresponsible attitude of the former minister. As the article in the

          . . . after all the ducking and diving over this issue, there is reason to suspect that the goal of winning votes—or at least of avoiding losing votes—has taken precedence over the goal of making the system work.

          That is unquestionably the case. The government is not interested in the safe and efficient operation of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Where it is coming from is completely and utterly poll driven from the point of view of the electorates it wants to win. The effect it is having on my electorate is devastating.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The first speaker from the opposition, the member for Melbourne, gave some specific examples. I can tell you that I have parents ringing me up and telling me that their children's education is suffering because of planes flying over between 11.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m.—bearing in mind that we are copping it all the time then because that is an off&amp;hyphen;peak period—and then between 7.30 p.m. and 11.00 p.m., when their kids are being kept up and become so fatigued at school the following day that their concentration is suffering.

          This facade of sharing the noise is simply that. It is a fraud quite literally because the minister has confirmed in that initial question on notice which I read that the east-west runway can only be used in off&amp;hyphen;peak periods. My electorate is literally copping a bombardment during those concentrated periods, together with the weekend period. In the great

          These are points that I would like the new minister to take on board—the safe and efficient operation of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. It is too essential to the economy of our nation and it is too essential to the lives of people who live around the airport to let political considerations dictate the operations when the experts are advising to the contrary. I hope the new minister brings to bear some  commonsense in this situation. To allow other speakers to speak in the time allotted tonight, I will conclude on that point.

           Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997
          </xref>
          before the House. Before I go into the major thrust of what I want to say, there are a couple of matters raised by the former speakers, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), that I want to make passing reference to. The honourable member for Melbourne tried to give the impression that no flights go over the electorate of Bennelong. That is absolutely wrong. In fact, all the northerly landings overfly Bennelong. What has happened is that there has been a very substantial reduction in the number of flights over Bennelong. That was just, and that was what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised in sharing the noise.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other matter I want to raise is in regard to the member for Barton saying that in the last days of the Keating government $600 million was provided in the budget for the building of the new Badgerys Creek airport. The fact is that it was not in the budget; it was in the forward estimates. That is quite a different story, as the member for Barton knows.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing it is important to draw to the attention of the House is that once again we have before us an opposition that is saying, `But if only we had one more year in government after 12 years we would have built a new airport.' When we came to government, and even prior to coming to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          government, when the matter of Badgerys Creek was raised, the first question everybody raised was: where is the full EIS? There was no full EIS. The last EIS done by the former government was about 12 years ago. That was not upgraded. So how can you talk about a new airport being fast tracked by the Keating government when you had not even done a full EIS?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That was why the $600 million was removed from the forward estimates. How could you put it in the budget when you have not made allowances for the EIS to be completed? The other thing the incoming Prime Minister said was that we were not going to sell off Sydney airport until the noise issue had been resolved. That was a promise made and a promise maintained.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill we are debating today is another commitment from the Howard government that is a promise fulfilled. I refer to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill which caps movements at Sydney's KSA at 80 aircraft movements in any one hour. In my view, an equally important provision in the bill is for the development of a slot management scheme that is intended to administer the movement cap at Sydney's KSA.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This means that regional airlines will be guaranteed slots thereby fulfilling the coalition government's election commitment to ensure services for the commuters of regional New South Wales to and from Sydney airport. This also means that no government in the future can play around with the 80 movements per hour cap by replacing the regional and non&amp;hyphen;scheduled flights with the biggest, heaviest, dirtiest and loudest of the jets so as to maximise the number of passengers. Of course, that can still be done by another government. However, the alarm bells would be ringing loud and clear and the one million Sydney residents would rise as one to fight against such a proposed measure which is unlikely to pass through both houses of parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An additionally important measure incorporated in the bill allows the minister to reduce the cap after consultation with interested parties. We are now almost at capacity at Sydney airport. In fact, during peak periods,
         <break page="8820" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the airport is already up to 75 movements per hour. It is also important to note that, when enacted, the bill includes very strict compliance requirements with penalties up to $220,000 per infringement for unauthorised flights. Repeated infringements could result in the airline losing an allocated slot.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This process will be overseen by a ministerially appointed slot manager whose role will be to administer a slot management scheme. The slot manager will be backed up by a compliance committee to develop and oversee the enforcement provisions. This now means that no-one should be under any misapprehension that the Howard government is anything but firmly and decisively committed to a new 24 hour international airport in the Sydney basin, and that is at Badgerys Creek. The die is cast. There is no going back. It is all systems go. Delaying tactics by anyone and/or by the New South Wales Carr Labor government are to be condemned by all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Howard government has developed the new long-term operating plan to share more evenly and fairly the burden of aircraft noise over Sydney and to maximise flights over water and non-residential areas. One million residents of Sydney have suffered aircraft noise and pollution for far too long. Tens of thousands suffered unbearable levels of noise and pollution under the federal Labor government, a torture that no Australian should have been subjected to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I well remember the closure of the east-west runway under the Brereton plan that saw the emergence of the Drummoyne corridor and the Bennelong funnel. All take-offs and landings were to the north of Sydney airport. The greatest winners were the constituents of the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), the then minister for transport, and Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In respect of the inner west of Sydney, where were the then federal Labor member for Lowe and the current state Labor member for Drummoyne? All we heard were some muted and reluctant criticisms but no action. There is one thing I am absolutely certain about with regard to Australians—that is, they have a basic and decent concern for their
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          fellow Australians. That is why they embrace the new coalition government's policy of sharing the noise and thereby sharing some of the discomfort. However, greater relief will only occur when a new international airport is built—a policy decision that was a model of procrastination and indecision under the former federal Labor government which stand condemned for not acting and not making a fair dinkum decision on this issue during the past 10 to 12 years.

         However, there were some promising signs exhibited by the Carr Labor government, especially the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, who repeatedly called for the fast&amp;hyphen;tracking of Badgerys Creek. I will not go through all the quotes that have been attributed to Bob Carr as the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has made very extensive reference to them. My general view is that these calls were much needed. Of course, when we came to government, the calls from the Carr government even intensified.

         Now that Badgerys Creek has been chosen; now that the Howard government is pushing ahead with Badgerys Creek; and since former minister Sharp made it public that there is nothing in the draft EIS to preclude Badgerys Creek from going ahead, the Carr Labor government has made a backflip of enormous proportions thereby stabbing in the back not only the million or so residents of Sydney but also his federal Labor colleagues, all for one sole objective—to save some of his western Sydney state seats.

         The Labor state members of parliament for the inner west of Sydney and their council colleagues were found wanting in the past.

Andrew Refshauge and Kevin Moss—could not be bothered to reply.

         Whilst Sandra Nori only gave very weak and qualified support for Badgerys Creek, I must say that the greatest disappointment was the reply from the Hon.

It is what it does not say in this bill that really counts for us. It is what it does not say in this bill that really hurts us in western Sydney. This piece of legislation at least proves that this Howard government is capable of being sensitive to the needs of Sydneysiders and their concerns. I am therefore left scratching my head and wondering, `What did we do wrong in western Sydney to deserve such opposite treatment?'

Why is this Howard government willing to cover the residents of western Sydney with increased levels of pollution, contributing to the already disturbing asthma levels our kids in the west are suffering these days, yet it is willing to cut down on pollution by capping aircraft movements for the people around Kingsford Smith airport?

         The people of western Sydney can come to only one conclusion as to why this Howard government extends the offer of an aircraft movement cap to people bothered by Kingsford Smith; why it quite rightly allows them to benefit from an airport curfew; why it listens to their concerns, yet why conversely it still refuses to take on board any similar concerns we have in the west—it simply does not think we are worth it.

         The Howard government is obviously more concerned about the people—or perhaps, I should say, the electorates—under the flight paths of Kingsford Smith than it is for those people who will be swamped by planes using Badgerys Creek, if it ever gets built there. These are the only conclusions we in the west can now draw, because the government has done nothing to convince us otherwise. The bill before the House, despite the good it may do, does nothing to change that belief. If anything, it merely rubs salt into our wounds.

         In the coalition's hands, the plans for the Badgerys Creek site—which were originally, I might add, for an overflow airport in support of operations at Kingsford Smith, with aircraft operations limited to 270,000 plane movements per year—were thrown out in favour of plans to build an international airport of enormous size, complete with 360,000 operations per year.

         Of course, what Senator Parer said prior to the election was that, if the EIS result proved negative, a coalition government would not—and I emphasise `not'—go ahead with the construction.

At 6 o'clock on the dot, the first plane came over, and every 90 seconds there was another plane. It was so loud you could barely hear yourself think. The windows were rattling. It was extremely noisy and disruptive, particularly for young families. There were some people outside who were in tears.

         —for the benefit of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who seems to have some short&amp;hyphen;term memory problems—published the policies of the respective parties on the Sydney airport management. It is worth reminding the House that Labor promised the following. There would be no reopening of the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. They would retain the narrow flight corridors which unfairly and cruelly concentrated noise. Under Labor, there would be a capping of aircraft movements to an average of 85 movements per hour. That means that for some hours of the day you might have 40 to 50 movements but for other hours of the day you might have 100 to 110. In other words, not only were they prepared to continue the inhumane treatment of people along that northern, concentrated flight corridor but they were actually prepared to make it worse for some parts of the day.

         Government is about fairness. It is not about picking favourites. It is not about doing the things that serve the particular interests of certain electorates that you want to hold. It is about governing for all people, whether they be people in a relatively privileged part of Sydney, such as my electorate, or whether they be people who live in electorates such as Werriwa, Barton, Banks, Prospect, Lindsay and seats in the outer west.

         Labor also said that the second airport would be open—and please do not laugh as I say this, Mr Deputy Speaker—by at least 2001, it would be a 24&amp;hyphen;hour airport and construction would be reliant on airport privatisation. All this from a party which I understand has had, and continues to have, great difficulty with the concept of privatisation. The reality in relation to the second

But as Mark Riley said in the

         It is obvious to anyone who has been to the site that the only thing that has happened quickly is the growing of grass. There is also an information hut, a cyclone fence, the odd drain and a few bemused cows. The problem with the paralysed Keating government on this issue was that it did not want to take a risk. All it sought to do was give the appearance of action, of protecting residents from any environmental problems, as the cows, fence and growing grass were `fast tracked'.

         In the same way Labor deceived people in Sydney's west on tolls, they deceived people on the second airport at Badgerys Creek. The slot controls to which this bill gives effect should underpin schedule reliability, which should improve the confidence of business travellers getting in and out of Sydney airport on time.

         As the airport is already handling up to 75 movements an hour during peak periods, slot controls will also help manage anticipated demand on Sydney airport. Each aircraft will need a specific landing and arrival time. Consistent failure to comply with the slot system will see airlines lose their slot allocation, or they will be fined and the size of the fine will increase exponentially after the first offence. Clearly, this is a superior piece of legislation to that which was proposed earlier last year by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese).

         The problem with the current system is that it does not prevent airlines from scheduling a number of flights at the same time, and we end up with cluster scheduling, which is one of the principal reasons that many business travellers and members of this House spend so much time circling around in the sky in a holding pattern, waiting to get into Sydney airport.

           If I were to give the Labor Party just a little bit of advice on how to restore its electoral fortunes, it would be to actually listen to people, to listen to their everyday concerns—to not impose upon them, without adequate consultation, mobile phone towers, overhead aerial broadband cabling, aircraft noise and all sorts of things which make people feel that they have no control and no say over the things that are happening to them in their lives.

           In concluding, I would like to pay tribute to some people in my electorate who are everyday people. These are not wealthy silvertails; they are people who are working, trying to raise families—I know that most are struggling with fairly substantial mortgages. I just name some of them. There is a lady called Vicki Riddy. The first time I met her she was pushing a pram with a young baby, and she had a toddler with her. She was in tears. She lives in Turramurra in my electorate, and she was exasperated. I do not know what her politics are, but I do know that she had not always been a supporter of the Liberal Party. All she was looking for was someone who
           <break page="8829" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

           I also mention: John Clark, who lives in West Pymble and has represented my electorate on the Sydney Airport Community Forum; Valerie Bray, previously with the Ku&amp;hyphen;ring&amp;hyphen;gai Think Tank and an acoustic engineer who did some outstanding work in measuring the extent of aircraft noise throughout our electorate; Derek Frere, who has had numerous meetings with Airservices Australia officials, with the minister's chief advisers and with me; and Terry Insley, from the North Shore Aircraft Action Group.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I would also like to recognise, in particular, the former minister, John Sharp. I always found him to be someone who was prepared to listen to a reasonable argument. Despite his extremely busy schedule—and, despite my best efforts, the very secure margin of Bradfield in terms of returning a Liberal member—he was even prepared to see individual members of my electorate who were concerned and on the verge of psychological despair over aircraft noise.

           I would also like to recognise Ernestine Gross, who did an enormous amount of work and regarded aircraft noise, under Mr Brereton, as `urban terrorism'. She wants Kingsford Smith airport closed for good. I do not know whether that is going to happen, but that is what she wanted.

         Coming from a rural electorate like Lyons, one of the major stumbling blocks to exporting for many of the primary producers is the transport of their goods. It applies particularly to perishables. I have seen for myself cartons of salmon sitting on the tarmac in the sun, waiting to be loaded along with a whole lot of suitcases. This works up to a point but, if something breaks down or there are delays, a shipment can lose its market very quickly and the goods are useless for sale anywhere else. Tasmanians could grow more and we could export more, if only we had a reliable and fast transport system from the farm gate to the marketplace.

         Dedicated freight services are not new to the world. Israel has one of the most efficient systems that can export overnight to anywhere and any continent. Australia can do the same, but we need to gear up to do so. Such a development cannot happen in a great hurry but, if we have the system, the world can be our oyster—if not have our oysters within 24 hours.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A system has to be reliable, it has to be fast and it has to be able to be tracked right from the door to any particular stage of the transport system. The less it is off-loaded, the easier it is followed in the process. The customer needs to know where their goods are at any point in time. This can be established electronically, provided the freight company has the vision to apply the quality assurance standards like other industries.

         So far, I am less than impressed with Australia's freight systems. I think I have already told the House that it took me more than six weeks to bring a carton of wine from Tasmania to Canberra. The whole time it was in transit, I could not verify where it was. Even the mail to Tasmania is slow. It takes three days from Canberra. So I can imagine the frustration of primary producers who want
         <break page="8830" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to catch early markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong or Jakarta. I know of one company which became so desperate that it chartered its own aircraft, but it is not an economic thing to do on a regular basis.

         I believe such a proposal as Avalon has these ingredients and could be the catalyst for Tasmania to become one of the major primary product exporters in Australia. We do a lot now, but we could increase our output tenfold, and later a thousandfold, if such a system can be developed.

         Why isn't Australia at the forefront? Indonesia is our nearest neighbour.

State governments must put aside their parochialism and start thinking together to develop a regional transport hub and put their energies into ensuring that the infrastructure is up to supplying such a hub. I would like to see an integrated system in Tasmania geared to this, using fast catamaran freight services, a dedicated aeroplane and train and truck transport system, and a link to a single port/airport with the primary task of moving freight fast and efficiently.

         Tasmania has a long way to go to sort out its transport system. I do not believe we will do that in a hurry. We have a lot of different systems operating inefficiently at the moment. United we can provide more jobs and a better service, and that is a worthy goal to pursue. I will be supporting the Avalon proposal in any way I can. I hope that Tasmania will be involved in the beginning of the proposal and that we will be able to reap the benefits as soon as it starts to operate in the near future.

         Mr Miskin believes that schools do their best to encourage the right sorts of values, such as care and concern for one another, respect for each other and the environment, understanding that with rights come responsibilities, strive to do the best you can do, and to give everybody a fair go. Mr Miskin points out that the adverse impact of the negative images resulting from this kind of advertising makes it very difficult for schools to do their job. Basically, I agree that what is happening is that the core values of our society are being undermined.

         I thought that in a few brief words I would draw Mr Miskin's comments to the attention of the House tonight. Regrettably, far too often television stations are showing many of the advertisements without any consideration of the general adverse impact that these advertisements are having on our society. Mr Miskin feels very strongly about this issue and he points out:

         Across the waterfront scene, the government is really trying to talk about the container terminals of Sydney and Melbourne. In the loading of coal, we have some of the most efficient handlers in the world. Constantly, visitors from across the world come to look at the operation of my own port of Newcastle in the Hunter region because it is so good and it is so fast. Similarly, in the handling of iron ore, sugar and grains we are at world standard or close to world standard.

         The government is really about trying to create political mischief in respect of the stevedoring industry. The stevedoring industry is, as I have said, really about the container terminals in Sydney and Melbourne.

         The problem is that along the transport chain to the waterfront there are vast savings to be made—in excess of $1 billion a year in true micro-economic reform. Small changes in matching hours, better documentation, electric commerce, better arrangements and shift working arrangements need to be dealt with by the suppliers, the warehouse people, the freight forwarders, the customs brokers and all those parties at the stevedoring terminal.

         Next to that is the work on the waterfront itself. There is room for improvement, but it is not going to be achieved by going about it the way we see this government doing—trying to beat up on people and label people. They do not really want a solution. As I said, go back to the

         of April 1976—I will give those interested a copy of it—and you can see almost verbatim the same language, the same words, being used by those opposite who are not interested in improving performance. Rather, they are interested in political slanging matches and the old story of blaming somebody, because it is much more difficult

         There is no better example of that than today. The coal companies in the Hunter region sell coal at a much faster rate than it can be loaded onto the ships so ships accumulate off the coast. Whom does the government blame? `It must be the trade unions.' It is the industry itself that is effectively paying people to take the coal away.

         To clarify the circumstances, Senator Sherry needs to answer the following questions. Has he stayed at Opossum Bay and claimed travel allowance and, if so, why did he specify in his claim forms that he stayed in Hobart? Of the 143 nights claimed for Hobart, how many nights did he stay at Opossum Bay and how many in hotels and motels that are genuinely in Hobart? If he stayed at Opossum Bay, then why didn't he specify that he was staying in a place other than a capital city, in which case he would have been eligible for $165 per night and not $320 per night? If accommodation occurred at Opossum Bay for the $143 nights claimed, a repayment of over $20,000 would most likely be required: 122 days at $145, which is $17,690, plus 21 days at $155 which is $3,255.

If a minister stands, the minister is the minister and he is a member of the Executive Council. Speakers have ruled here before that members of the Executive Council can have the debate extended to a later hour in the night if they want to, but they cannot participate in the adjournment as ordinary members. The member for Braddon is attempting to flout that rule. If he wants to drop a bucket on someone, get someone else who is capable of doing it.

          —Bankruptcies have risen to record levels, for the benefit of honourable members opposite. In any event, some of the measures announced by the small business minister are certainly welcome on this side of the House, which has been pressing both through the fair trading inquiry and through other means at our disposal—public rallies and the like—to force the small business minister to adopt these measures. So, many of them are indeed welcome.

         It ought to be said, however, that in the area of retail tenancies the government has squibbed what I feel to be one of the most important recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology Committee, and that is the adoption of a uniform retail tenancies code. Instead, the committee said, `We're going to take this issue back to the states. We're going to have a meeting of the relevant state ministers.' The committee talked about the constitutional limitations of the government and said, `Look, we can't legislate for this on a national basis.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is simply not true. The fact is that the corporations power gives Commonwealth governments the power to legislate in respect of corporations. It is almost certain that such a power would enable the Commonwealth to fix a uniform retail tenancies code with all the important provisions that such a code should have concerning disclosure, tenancy mix, the rights of retail tenants to form associations within shopping centres, and the like.

         I believe that it is regrettable that the government has not acted in this area.

         I would like to acknowledge a number of members of this House who have been members of the backbench subcommittee in this area, which has worked very hard over the last eight to 10 months to bring these measures to fruition. The members for Bowman (Mrs West), Forde (Mrs Elson), Capricornia (Mr Marek), Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and Richmond (Mr Anthony) are all present in the chamber tonight and have all played an important role in ensuring that those many hundreds of thousands of Australian families who have looked for something for the last eight years from the previous government have now seen a government grasp the nettle of this issue and start to address it. I would like to bring to the attention of the House a few of the issues that the subcommittee has looked at.

          First of all, I want to assure the House and Australians as a whole that this government ensures that people must have responsibility for the children they bring into this world. That is what we predicate our decisions on in this area. We ensure that there is accountability in this issue. We are deem

           ing that any parent who has a liability for child support, regardless of their situation—be they on unemployment benefits or some sort of pension—be required to make a minimum payment of $260 a year. We have also broadened the base on which people have been able to limit their liability for child support payments by having such things as investment properties where they have been able to lower their taxable income and, in turn, reduce their liability to their children. This whole issue is about the welfare of children.

         We have also increased the exempt amount of income for those non-custodial parents who we acknowledge are finding it very difficult in these times to be able to get ahead and to restart lives. Not only has the exempt income been increased by 10 per cent but also we have acknowledged that where there is shared custody of 40 or 50 per cent, those same parents can then have another addition to that exempt income, recognising that they have a life to get on with.

         —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) Registration fees for export abattoirs will not increase from $35,000 per annum to $122,000. Registration charges for small to medium size abattoirs will remain at their existing rate of $30,350. The charge for large abattoirs will increase to $70,700, while medium to large establishments will increase to $60,700 from $30,350. New categories of small, medium and large have been introduced to ameliorate the impact on smaller establishments in the industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The statement that small abattoirs face a huge per unit cost per sheep compared to larger abattoirs is not correct. Exercises conducted by AQIS on the impact of the reform of the meat inspection service, including fee adjustments, indicate that the AQIS cost per unit varies from plant to plant regardless of size. The relative efficiency of production at each establishment dictates the cost per sheep or cattle unit flowing from AQIS's fees and charges. For example, many smaller establishments actually have a lower cost per unit of production than larger plants.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) The costs per sheep unit will not increase significantly for either small or large establishments. It is important to note that the larger establishments will have considerable scope to reduce their costs, as they will require less inspection units due to the outcomes being pursued under the reform agenda.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (4) It is not true that the smaller export abattoirs are largely Australian owned and the large abattoirs foreign owned. Approximately 30 of the 73 export registered abattoirs are foreign owned. Of the top ten abattoirs in terms of volumes slaughtered for export, I understand that five are Australian owned and five are foreign owned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (5) The justification of the fee adjustments is that they are one component of the Government's reform agenda for AQIS meat inspection services.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Other reforms have already commenced and for many participants in the export meat industry their combination with the fee changes will result in net reductions in payment to AQIS. The reforms, including the move to company-based inspection, will deliver significant savings and flexibility for the meat industry which will ultimately assist small business.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (6) It is not the intention to eliminate small abattoirs, indeed the new fee structure will assist in maintaining the viability of the smaller operators within the industry. The fee adjustments will, in the main, affect larger abattoirs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (7) It would not be more equitable to impose the charges on a stock throughput or a per kilogram basis. The fees structure is designed to recover the fixed infrastructure costs through a registration charge and the inspection costs on a fee for service basis. All operators in the industry benefit from the inspection infrastructure in place to facilitate the export of meat, and as such, are required to contribute their share of the cost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (8) The reform agenda for AQIS meat inspection services is part of an overall betterment of the red meat industry. The Government is committed to delivering a substantial reform agenda for the industry, including substantial savings for processors through the restructuring of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC), Meat Research Corporation (MRC) and Meat Industry Council (MIC). The full package of reforms will ultimately enhance export competitiveness.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (9) The quantum of revenue collected by AQIS from industry in 1997-98 will not increase. The AQIS fee adjustments should therefore have no impact on prices being paid to farmers.

        A seasonal increase in LPG demand (and with it, price) has occurred in the last three years with the onset of the northern hemisphere winter as LPG marketers rebuild stocks for consumption during the colder months. The severity of the northern winter will also affect demand. With the onset of spring there is a reduction in demand for LPG and consequent easing of pricing.

        Prices are also affected by the value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar.

        Currently, Saudi LPG is priced at $US172 per tonne, down $US158 per tonne from a peak of $US330 per tonne in January 1997. International observers suggest that prices have "bottomed out" for this year and rises can be expected over the coming months as northern hemisphere traders rebuild stocks.

         (1) Employment protection is a major issue, with the potentially opposing interests of the Reservists, their employers and the ADF to be considered.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The proposals being considered by Government include: amending current legislation or, if necessary, introducing new legislation; reviewing Public Service Defence Leave provisions; and job discrimination provisions to enable Reservists to serve without undue impediment.

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Besides employment protection, employer support for Reserves is an essential element of the strategy to protect the civilian interests of Reservists who are called out or volunteer for service overseas on peacekeeping operations or humanitarian relief activities.

         A strategy is currently being developed which will include employment protection as well as employer support. This strategy will include input from Defence, employers, Reservists and the wider community.

         (2) Financial compensation to employers of Reservists is not being considered by this Government, apart from the members of the former Ready Reserve who have existing entitlements.

         (3) The existing legislative provisions in the Defence (Re&amp;hyphen;establishment) Act 1965, are generally ineffective and in need of major revision if they are to form the basis of future employment protection.

         The Government agrees with the need for legislation to protect Reservists' civilian employment, particularly in relation to call out, but also for voluntary service overseas on peacekeeping operations and humanitarian relief activities, and for continuous periods of normal peacetime training.

         (4) A discussion paper is currently with the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel for clearance, prior to distribution in 1997 to a wide range of interested parties, including individual employers and employer bodies, state governments and employee industrial organisations.

         An Employer Support Survey, is also being conducted, which will provide the Government with a framework of measures to encourage Reserve service and facilitate improvements to the availability of Reservists for training.

         Each of these initiatives, together with the legislative actions already mentioned, will be important inputs to the redevelopment, later this year, of a higher level broadly representative employer support organisation aimed at creating a cooperative and mutually beneficial arrangement between employers and their Reservist employees. It will enable each of the Services to plan with more certainty regarding the availability of, and the use of Reservists which is an increasingly important part of this structure.
