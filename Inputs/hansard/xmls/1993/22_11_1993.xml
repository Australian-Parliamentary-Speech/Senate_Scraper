In the context of this particular exchange, Mr Black said that he wrote about Dr Hewson's position that `this was not an issue with him and he was, in agreed phraseology, very relaxed about what our level of ownership would be in the event that he won the election'. So Dr Hewson's position, we are told, was to indicate very clearly to Mr Black that he would put no obstacles in the way and, in fact, would be `very relaxed' about an increase in the percentage after the election, regardless again of the balance or the fairness or the quality of the Fairfax newspapers.

         Mr Black has stressed repeatedly that Mr Keating did not seek partisan pro-Labor treatment. Certainly Labor did not get any such treatment from the Fairfax press, as the editorials during the campaign amply confirmed. The point about the increase from 15 to 25 per cent was very simply this: it was to give Mr Black a stronger commercial basis on which to commit the finance and the technology that were necessary to rebuild Fairfax—something that was in everyone's interest.

         It was not a question, when this was discussed between the two of them or when it was dealt with by the government, as it was in April this year after the election, of any political judgment being made, but an economic judgment—what was necessary to protect an investment that worked to everyone's advantage. That is the context, that is the background, they are the specifics, and that is the balance of this affair between the government's involvement through the Prime Minister and the opposition's involvement through Dr Hewson. Both of them had discussions with Mr Black about aspects of the issue. Dr Hewson's commitment to Mr Black, on the face of it—on the face of Mr Black's own account of those conversations—was a commitment that went much further than anything that Mr Keating or anyone in this government has been prepared to say to Mr Black at any time.

         Firstly, there was the mere holding of the meeting—the chemistry of its conduct which, on any view, on every account, was outstanding—and associated with that the decision to hold another meeting next year in Indonesia. Personal relationships and confidence building of this kind are a very necessary prelude to effective policy making. This simple aspect of the occasion, despite the cynicism which we are hearing already from those on the other side, simply cannot be overstated. In that respect, if nothing else, Mr Keating's judgment about initiating this would have been vindicated.

         The second point is the terms of the vision statement itself and the commitment that entailed—that explicitly embraced—to a collective, self-conscious role by what was described as `the community of Asia Pacific economies'.

         The fourth element was the commitment which emerged from all of the meetings to a very explicit and clear-cut trade facilitation agenda. A trade and investment framework document was agreed. A work program was agreed extending to the issues of standards, recognition of qualifications and harmonisation of procedures—especially in relation to customs—of addressing non-tariff barriers generally and addressing competition policy and its implications for anti-dumping. It was also agreed to work towards the establishment of a regional investment code.

         It is absolutely crucial that it be understood, in a way that many commentators have not understood, that this is the heart and soul of the activity that APEC is now embarked upon—the specific nuts and bolts trade facilitation measures that will have enormous implications for reducing costs and barriers to access in this particular region. It is crucial that it also be realised that this meeting represents a very big step forward from what has been the preoccupation, up until now, with simply information gathering, transparency information exchange and policy dialogue to specific action programs that will produce agreed results of that kind.

         Of course it is the case that governments will always have regard, just as oppositions will always have regard, to the quality of the news media.

That is highly unlikely ever to be achieved. It certainly was not achieved in the last election where, as I remember, every Fairfax paper came out against the government. Nonetheless, we made the decision that we did on 20 April to increase the stake because of the economic reasons and commercial reasons that I have mentioned which constitute a very clear-cut, very self-contained and very self-evident rationale for that particular increase.

         —I thank Senator McKiernan for his question about the important developments taking place in the development of an Australian space program in conjunction with the South Australian government. It is the aim of both governments to have a viable space program operating in Australia by the year 2000.

         With the existing infrastructure that is available at Woomera from the space program that operated in Australia in the 1960s and 1970s, Australia is well placed to launch light earth orbiting satellites, LEOs, particularly those satellites in low polar orbit, because of our geographic, climatic and political advantages. With the development of Woomera we will be able to provide interested countries and space programs with the ability to launch satellites from Woomera on a commercial basis—I emphasise `commercial basis'.

         It has been estimated by some commercial consortiums that the existing infrastructure at Woomera, left over from the space program in the 1960s and 1970s, at today's value is probably worth around $100 million. I have asked my department and the Australian Space Office to investigate what it would cost to bring these facilities up to standard to launch light earth orbiting satellites on a commercial basis.

         Irrespective of that study, there has been interest from overseas in using Woomera, particularly from Germany. Next year Germany will want to recover one of its scientific satellites in its express program at Woomera. I hope by February next year that Australia and Germany will have signed a treaty to enable the recovery of that satellite. Discussions are now continuing with the Germans to see whether it is possible for future express satellites to be launched from Woomera.

         These opportunities, collaboratively developed between the federal government and the state government of South Australia, are opportunities for the future. I remind the Senate that it was also a Senate transport and infrastructure committee report some two years ago that raised these issues. It is good to see that some honourable senators opposite acknowledge that. There are opportunities for us. I congratulate the South Australian government for taking up these initiatives with the federal government to develop a space program during the 1990s.

If she was in some doubt before, I advise her that it is an advisory body and decisions are made by ministers, as they should be in a representative democracy. The nature of its advice is not disclosed because it is advice in the normal decision making process for ministers. General policy positions are disclosed but the handling of individual companies' applications has always been treated as commercial-in-confidence and that commercial-in-confidence principle has also been applied in the normal course.

Philip Brass, from Pacific Dunlop, was there as a voice of Australian business. He participated in the business forum that ran alongside the meeting of governments. There will be, I understand from the leaders, a forum in which business leaders—two from each country—can now participate in the future to make sure that APEC maintains that business focus.

I would consider going to 25 percent, because his claim was that he couldn't run the business at 14.9 per cent; that he had just concluded that day, a meeting at the Opera House where he had been pilloried in running the business with 14.9 per cent, and I said, "Well, we'll think about it but we want a commitment from you that the paper will be balanced''.

That was the centrepiece of the Treasurer's assessment and understanding of the situation; it was the centrepiece of the government's assessment and understanding of it in cabinet, as I have just said; and it was the centrepiece of Mr Keating's assessment and understanding of it, as he, Mr Keating himself, said in Seattle last week.

         The budget for the forward period beyond the FFC contract—or any other, but, in this instance, where an agency is under review—requires that there is no budget allocation. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. Either he is saying that if he were leading a government the budget papers would contain figures even when they were under review, or he is saying that he would not have a review or that he does not know that a review is going on—it could be all three.

         There are a number of initiatives in the budget for the film industry, the most important of which, in my view, is the additional $3.5 million over four years to the AFC for script development and producer support. This year the Commonwealth will spend over $102 million on support of the film industry specifically, which is just over 30 per cent of the federal arts budget. It is inconceivable to me that any Australian government would not wish to provide assistance to enable the industry to flourish, to create jobs, to earn exports and to have the cultural as well as the economic benefits which would flow.

         I should also point out that with that commitment for $100 million, while I welcome the things that Dr Hewson said in his speech that indicated a generalised commitment to support the film industry, he should realise, as the industry does—the industry is not stupid—that someone who is proposing to slash outlays by $5 billion or $10 billion   cannot go round promising increases to everybody; the whole still equals the sum of the parts. My advice is: if those opposite want to build support in the arts industry, they should stop worrying about attacking us so much and try to develop a policy that somebody might actually be prepared to support.

The Commonwealth is very keen to cooperate with the states to ensure that this does happen. However, this does not mean that all logging in old growth forests should stop; it recognises that some logging in old growth forests and wilderness areas is necessary to meet industry requirements during the transition to regrowth and plantations. Some environmentalists have claimed this to be a moratorium on old growth logging, but that is not the case.

Now, all of the areas on the World Heritage List, such as the southern forests of Tasmania, are protected from logging operations. Similarly, areas which have been formally nominated for World Heritage status, such as Fraser Island, are excluded from logging operations. In this regard, it should be noted that under the inter-governmental agreement on environment the Commonwealth will consult with the relevant state for any future areas nominated for World Heritage listing. This is consistent with the cooperative approach set out in the national forests statement.

         With regard to the proposals in relation to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the cabinet has made a decision which indicates that we will get a better outcome in good science by the merger of both organisations.

The question was whether we could achieve a better outcome for nuclear science by a non-legislative route?

It found that there are major gaps in marine science research in Australia and that many areas that we ought to be involved in are not being covered. The inquiry recommended that these matters need to be dealt with if we want to ensure a positive outcome in the coming years to maximise the use of our marine resources in this country, especially in light of the declaration of the exclusive economic zone in the near future. This will mean that the marine resources of Australia will be in an area one and a half times the land mass of Australia.

In view of the government's refusal to contribute to wool promotion after 1 July 1994, which is essential for the demand driven industry that is now so obviously necessary, can the minister report on Minister Crean's attempts to get direct funding for IWS promotion from the IWTO? Can the minister deny once and for all that the export tax, which is rumoured to be back on the agenda, is not acceptable as a tax avenue for the IWTO's contribution to funding?

         The concerns that exist relate to two unregistered products imported from Europe under the special access scheme. These were brought in to treat a very rare form of haemophilia. It is treated by what is called Factor IX. The special access scheme allows individual doctors or institutions to bring in products which have not been approved by the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for the treatment of serious or life threatening illness. The use of such drugs is determined by the doctor and can only be supplied with the informed consent of the patient. This is particularly important because drugs brought in under the SAS scheme are essentially experimental, and the Commonwealth can give no assurance as to the quality, safety or efficacy of such usage.

         The TGA has been assured that, of the two products imported from Germany, the first, Fibrin, was not manufactured from the contaminated plasma. Two batches of the second product, Immuno Factor IX, were prepared from plasma supplied by UB Plasma, one of the companies involved in the use of the contaminated blood, although there is no evidence that contaminated blood was actually used in preparing these batches. It must be emphasised that the possible contamination of blood products with HIV is considered very unlikely, particularly in the use of Immuno Factor IX, because the preparation of that product involves heat treatment and filtration which should ensure the product is virus free.

I think all honourable senators would agree that it is particularly tragic that families should suffer the loss of young children travelling to and from school.

         Unfortunately, a common thread runs through these accidents and this indicates how completely avoidable they are. While there has been, I think rightly, a focus recently on the safety of school children while in a bus—that is, we are focusing on, for example, fitting seat belts to buses—the statistics show that without question the greatest dangers faced by school children are not when they are in the bus but when they are approaching or leaving it.

         A report that has just been released by the Queensland parliament's travelsafe committee indicates how appallingly high the tragic loss of young life is when children are travelling to and from school. This report reveals that in the state of Queensland alone between 1986 and 1991 there were 54 fatalities involving school age children travelling to and from school—54 deaths of school kids in five years. A school bus was involved in 10 of those cases in which a child was killed, but only one of the fatally injured children was actually an occupant of a bus at the time of the accident.

         Two recent fatal accidents—one in Sydney, where two children were hit, and, unfortunately, one only a week or so ago in my home town of Darwin—had the common thread of children running around the front of the bus before the bus had left the bus stop. Such children cannot be seen by traffic that is coming from behind. From personal observation, I can attest to the fact that both children and drivers seem to have a total disregard for the safety problems that occur at congested times of the day when children are arriving at school in the morning and leaving in the afternoon.

         There are two common factors that contribute to this unnecessarily high number of kids being killed. The first is that children run in front of the bus after they get off. The second, often related to the first, is that the parents or the carers of these children wait on the side of road opposite the bus for the children to get off. There is often a combination of the kid running in front of the bus to the adult who is waiting on the opposite side of the road.

         Tragically, a lot of these deaths could be avoided if parents would simply wait on the same side of the road as the bus for their kids to get off. This would avoid the problem of the child running in front of the bus in the first place and running to the parent. That child has eyes only for that parent and is completely ignorant of the traffic coming the other way. I hope this review will be completed in time to allow it to be considered by the transport ministers conference that will be convened early in the new year.

        This inquiry is long overdue. We were saying long before the election that there should be a full inquiry into the income and assets test, and we welcome this inquiry.

We are very pleased to see that a number of those concerns were addressed and that those terms of reference have come back in an altered form. However, we have not been totally assured that this does not preclude an examination of the income test on realised gains on shares and managed investments and we would like that assurance.

The government should take this in the spirit in which it is meant and try to address the issue as broadly as possible and, as I said before, reduce any stress or anxiety that it may cause pensioners because they already feel very threatened and confused by the changes that have taken place. We feel that as much as possible the issue should be addressed in a way that allays their fears.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to questions without notice asked by Senators Parer, Alston and Panizza and the leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot), this day, relating to the level of foreign ownership of newspapers.

        What we have seen today is yet another example of this government's willingness to say or do anything to justify itself and disguise the sordid nature of its political decision making. Anyone who was in Seattle—indeed, I would have thought anyone in this country—would recognise, as Laura Tingle who was there, and Lenore Taylor who was not, said in the

        Mr Conrad Black might be allowed to lift his stake in John Fairfax . . . the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said yesterday, and admitted he had demanded "balance" in Fairfax political reporting before Cabinet's approval earlier this year . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Those, I would have thought, are incontrovertible facts. That is why it is extraordinary that Senator Evans should come in here today and go through this absolute charade and pretend that somehow this decision was made on the basis of management issues. I can understand why he would want to do that. On 13 May last he was at great pains to answer a question from Senator Hill about why the FIRB advice should not be tabled when Mr Black had consented to it. He went on to explain how the decision had been made and how the government took account of national interest pertaining to social and cultural values. He then talked about financial and managerial commitment and said that that was the context in which the decision was made. Later, on 27 May, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government's decision and the reasoning behind it have already been clearly articulated in the Treasurer's press release of 20 April.

       <para>
        What those press releases and that answer—that utterly disingenuous answer—were saying was that somehow there was some high principle involved in this decision, that it was somehow to do with the national interest. In fact, what we got from Mr Keating in Seattle was the naked and shameless admission that this was all about a conditional promise. In other words, there would be a willingness on the part of the government to lift the level of foreign ownership if Mr Black's newspapers behaved themselves. Mr Black's newspapers were, therefore, on probation.

         In the event that Mr Keating judged that they had delivered, he was prepared to grant that increase. He is prepared to do precisely the same thing again. That is why this is a matter of current concern. It is bad enough people like Senator Evans coming in here devoid of any shred of integrity when it comes to understanding the difference between proper decision making based on the national interest—

         Those opposite have no understanding. I know the New South Wales Right was always devoid of political morality and prided itself on pragmatism, but to think that the infection has spread south of the border to people like Senator Evans, who no longer understand that there is anything wrong with the Prime Minister saying, `I will be the judge of what is fair. I will make very significant commercial decisions that affect the interests of media proprietors and all those who serve with them on the basis of our perception of fairness', when this bloke has a reputation for belting up on journalists at the drop of a hat, has no compunction about ringing people and abusing them and has no compunction about complaining whenever he sees an article which he disagrees with.

         It is one thing to say that everyone is entitled to take the point and take up the issue with the journalist or the editor; that is fine. But to say that a national interest decision in relation to foreign ownership should be entirely based on `whether we think you have done the right thing' is an utterly shameless situation and indicative of the low point of political morality that we have reached in this country. There is not one word in what Mr Keating said in Seattle that in any way talks about the national interest or the need to take into account other factors. He said:

I would have thought that at least Senator Evans would have had the decency to come in here and admit what the Prime Minister was forced to admit. Quite clearly, he felt that he had no choice but to announce to the world that he had made an utterly repugnant decision. I am sorry that Senator Evans cannot do the same.

         Now we see this disgraceful apology for a government, this disgraceful apology for people who are supposed to be running this country, come before us and say, `Look, Mr Keating was doing a great job because he was trying to ensure balance'. He was not trying to ensure balance. What Mr Keating was trying to do was ensure that he got the media coverage that he liked. If Mr Keating did not consider that the coverage was balanced, then the message was very clear: Mr Black would not get his increase in media ownership. For the Labor ministers who have spoken in this debate to say anything other than that Mr Keating was going to be the judge of whether it was fair or not and that, if Mr Keating did not like it, Mr Black was not going to get his media increase, is a bald faced lie—and that is well acknowledged in this place.

         The idea that Mr Keating can be a judge of any sort of sense of fairness, any sort of sense of balance, is a joke. This is the same man who, if you happen to write a story about his piggery for the

He makes grossly offensive personal remarks, and that is what the journalists get if they write a story that Mr Keating does not like—even though that story turned out to be vindicated 100 per cent. That is the sort of man who is presuming to sit in judgment on what is balanced media coverage in the Fairfax papers. That is great! If Senator Schacht is happy with that, I congratulate him—but, frankly, he would have to be a dill to be satisfied with that sort of test of fairness and balance.

         A number of questions were asked that went straight to the point of whether there was some sort of a deal made prior to the election, that if the coverage was not balanced—and that is what the Prime Minister said; he talked about balanced coverage—if it was biased towards the Labor Party, the deal was struck and delivered on after the election. In fact, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made a decision in respect of Mr Black's ownership on advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board that was based on the question of the investment that Mr Black had made.

         The outcome of tomorrow's poll will not alter the challenges facing Australia in the final years of the 20th Century. In essence, these challenges involve managing profound but necessary change, change that is likely to reshape—is already reshaping—the nation. For all the talk that the 1980s was a decade of greed, selfishness and waste, it was nevertheless a time of transition when it became clear that the old ways of doing things could no longer be sustained. It became a matter of national consensus that if Australia was to remain a prosperous liberal democracy with rising living standards offering a brief future for its young people, Australians would have to embrace change. Rising living standards were not a national birthright. The notion that we could rely on commodity exports to finance the protection of inefficient manufacturing industries that were there to provide employment had proved to be a costly fantasy.

         To its credit, for much of its decade in power, the federal Labor Government understood all this. It recognised the need for sweeping changes in the way the Australian economy was structured and that these changes would amount to nothing short of an economic revolution. Paul Keating will be judged well by history for the dominant part he played in that process. The deregulation of the financial system, the floating of the dollar, the opening up of the banking system to foreign competition were all designed to sweep away the idea that Australia could somehow isolate itself from the rest of the world and remain an economic backwater with its living standards maintained by selling stuff we dug out of the ground or grew on top of it. The steel-industry plan, the car-industry plan and the program of tariff cuts—among other reforms—were all part of an attempt by the Government to open up the Australian economy to what was clearly a new and, in some ways, harsher international economic environment. The Government also deserves credit for the tentative and often painfully small steps it took to reform the industrial relations system even though it did not do enough. For much of the `80s, there was a general consensus between Labor and the coalition that change was necessary. There was even agreement on the direction of that change. It was the means rather than the ends over which the parties differed.

         The recession, with its toll of more than a million unemployed, ended that consensus. Since he became Prime Minister, Mr Keating has been much less committed to the program of reform than he was during the years when he was federal Treasurer and the intellectual driving force of the Government. The recession brought about a loss of nerve, an uncertainty about the direction in which Australia should be headed. In a sense, the watering down of Mr Keating's commitment to change explains why he has, throughout this election campaign, been a Prime Minister neither able to defend his record nor map out the direction in which he wants to take the country. Instead, he has fixed his sights on the coalition's proposed goods and services tax and has sought to invest it with a sinister and wide-ranging significance. The GST, according to Mr Keating, will be a cancer on Australian society. It will fundamentally change the Australian way of life. It is a malevolent, evil tax. Quite frankly, this is nonsense. The irony of this election campaign is that the GST is really in no way a vital ingredient of the coalition's Fightback proposals nor, indeed, would it be vital to any reform program. While the GST will allow some restructuring of the tax system, it is a change we could have done without at this time. If the coalition loses tomorrow, it will be because  a minor part of its reform proposals became the main issue of the election campaign.

         In fact, it is the proposed changes in Australia's industrial relations system that are central to Fightback, for it is in this area that Labor has proved to be most timid and in which change is now most urgent. Whatever the benefits of the Accords I to VII between the Government and the ACTU since 1983, and these are arguable, the industrial relations system remains outmoded and rigid. Enterprise bargaining, for all the lip-service given to it by the Government and the trade unions, remains the exception rather than the rule. We believe the coalition's proposed changes in industrial relations are sensible and necessary if the goal of making Australian industry internationally competitive is to be achieved. The move away from a centralised wage-fixing system to a system of individual contracts between employers and employees will probably mean in the long term that workers with skills that are in demand will be better off, while those with few or no skills will be worse off. But there is no real alternative that will produce what we now desperately need: more productive workplaces. Labor, with its ties to the trade union movement, is never likely to be able to force through these sorts of workplace changes. On that basis alone, we believe the coalition ought to form the next government.

         There is another major reason why the coalition ought to win tomorrow. Changes of government should be a regular occurrence in any liberal democracy and, after a decade in power, Labor has, despite Mr Keating's best efforts, become a Government that has lost much of its appetite for reform and renewal. There are echoes in the choice facing Australians tomorrow of the choice a previous generation faced in 1961 when the Menzies Government, after 12 years in power, and in the middle of a recession, scraped home by one seat basically because of the shortcomings of the then Labor leader, Arthur Calwell. In retrospect, it probably would have been better for Australia had Labor won that poll and been given the chance to implement some of its reforms then. Instead, it sat on the Opposition benches for another decade and, when it came to power, set about making up for its 23 years of frustration by trying to transform Australia in a matter of days. The failures of the Whitlam Government can in part be attributed to that extra decade of debilitating powerlessness that Labor experienced on the Opposition benches.

         Australia needs a government in the `90s that will maintain the momentum of change, that will continue the transformation of the economy begun by the Labor Government.

        Of the millions of words spoken during this marathon election campaign, none were truer than those uttered by the Prime Minister when he launched his policies. "When you wake up on March 14, whoever has won the election, there will still be unemployment. There will still be problems to solve," Mr Keating said. Throughout the campaign the Labor Party has been keen to play down the magnitude of those problems; the Coalition has often exaggerated them. Nevertheless they are real and none of the parties has convinced us they have all the answers. The question confronting voters tomorrow is which of the parties is the more likely to have the conviction to tackle those problems. And, just as importantly, which is more likely to possess the occasional humility to admit that policies proposed in Opposition or in the heat of an election campaign are not necessarily appropriate when confronted by the harsh realities of the government.

         In answering these questions, Australians have cause to take heart. This has been a contest between two very intelligent and tough-minded men. Both have shown they are not the sort of leader who will shirk tough decisions. Mr Keating has already served Australia with distinction as Treasurer, as a guiding force in Mr Hawke's Government and as Prime Minister. If he loses on Saturday, history will certainly acknowledge the role he played in forcing his party to confront the realities of the broader scale, he has commenced the vital task of convincing Australians of the opportunities to be gained from becoming a more  competitive country. Floating the dollar, the entry of foreign banks, reform of the taxation system, a controlled reduction in protection—these are just some of his achievements. And their significance, in the context of the traditionally cantankerous Labor Party, cannot be underestimated.

         Dr Hewson, for his part, has united a party which had been debilitated for most of the past decade by the rivalry between the former leaders, Mr Howard and Mr Peacock. No-one can now argue, as was the case in the last few elections, that the Liberals stand for nothing. Fightback, an unmistakably Hewson program, has unified the party and has also cemented relations within the Coalition. Whoever wins tomorrow, we will have a Prime Minister who will lead, not follow.

         Strong leadership will be required to confront the economic realities facing Australia. While it is now clear that talk of a "double dip" recession is part of the hyperbole of the campaign, the economy is obviously stuck in a path of weak recovery. Economic growth must continue to be encouraged but extreme care has to be taken not to again overheat the economy. Real wages must continue to be restrained. The spark of new business investment we have seen lately must be fanned. Inflationary expectations must be kept down. The expanding national debt must be reined in. And the tangle of subsidies, tariff barriers and work practices, which impede the growth of our export industries, must continue to be dismantled. These are some of the problems about which Mr Keating spoke; regrettably neither party has been prepared to fully address them over the past five weeks.

         Indeed, the fiscal stimulus implicit in the policies of both Labor and the Coalition have been such as to alarm the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser. In an unprecedented intervention, he warned last week that economic growth was unlikely to be strong enough to reduce the budget deficit at a sufficiently rapid pace. The new government, Mr Fraser said, would have to rethink its spending and taxation pledges or face a substantial increase in interest rates which would wipe out economic recovery. It has been said, not entirely facetiously, that voters should endorse the party which is more likely to break its promises.

         Dr Hewson has insisted throughout the campaign that unemployment, not the Goods and Services Tax (GST), is the major issue of the campaign. As he rightly says, Labor has proposed no solutions which will help get the dole queues down quickly. The job creation projects of One Nation, about which Mr Keating has boasted, are certainly exaggerated and problematic. His central campaign pledge—to create half-a-million new jobs over the next three years—has been exposed as unlikely to make a dent in the unemployment rate. This is because the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the labour force will grow by at least this amount over the same period.

        But Dr Hewson cannot claim any magic answer to unemployment either. The Coalition's assertion that Fightback will create two million jobs by the year 2000 has always lacked credibility and it is no credit to Dr Hewson that he has continued to peddle this claim when he knows it has no econometric foundation. The Coalition is on firmer ground, however, when it argues that its commitment to a faster pace of structural reform of the economy and to deregulation of the labour market will make the economy more efficient and will boost jobs in the long run.

         While unemployment is the most pressing issue, it is the GST which has dominated the campaign. Dr Hewson's decision to give it such a high priority, at such a political cost, is puzzling. The Labor Government has undoubtedly exaggerated the impact that it will have on individuals. But the Opposition is also guilty of overselling its reform. The majority opinion of economists now appears to be that a GST, and the tax reforms that will accompany it, will have a small, beneficial effect on the efficiency of the economy. But it is no economic salvation.

         Fundamental labour market reform, for example, probably offers greater scope for economic efficiency gains. Labor's Accord was an important factor in restraining real wages during the economy's boom years. What is now needed, as Labor itself has acknowledged, is a means of continuing this restraint in total wages while also delivering sharp productivity gains. Properly handled, the strategy of encouraging voluntary employment contacts, proposed under the Coalition's Jobsback policy, seems far more likely to deliver these gains than the slowly-paced enterprise bargaining approach of Labor.

         Over the past decade, the Labor Party has overcome the traditional suspicion of the electorate and demonstrated that it can govern responsibly. Its legacy is impressive in many areas. It has been Mr Keating's misfortune to have taken the reins too late. Although he has tried hard to rejuvenate the Government, it is showing unmistakable signs of chronic fatigue. It is time for a change. Without endorsing all aspects of the Coalition's program, Dr Hewson and his team should be given the opportunity to tackle the many problems which will still confront us when we wake up on Sunday morning.

         —There are some very clear answers because any such link has been very clearly denied, not only by the Prime Minister but also by Mr Black himself. If those opposite need any proof of the outcome of the sequence of events they will find it in exactly what was tabled by Senator Collins in his contribution to this debate; namely, stark, clear, overwhelming evidence that, whatever the performance of the Fairfax papers might have been during the campaign, it was certainly not to favour the Australian Labor Party.

         The second matter in issue is whether Mr Keating had it in mind at the time before the election, and continues to have it in mind now, that there should be a balance in the way in which the media portrays political events or represents political points of view, particularly at election time. Of course, the
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        answer is yes. Mr Keating has been quite explicit that it is his view that the media ought to be balanced in that way. In that respect he is no different from Senator Alston, who has been on record on this matter, as Senator Collins just amply demonstrated. He is no different from Dr Hewson, who effectively made the same points in a series of responses he made to questions in various interviews last week. It is a point of view that Mr Keating himself expressed last week in Seattle in his doorstop interview on 19 November in the following terms. He was asked:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Do you think, for instance, that a Liberal Prime Minister might make a different judgment of balance as a Labor Prime Minister?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Keating answered:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I shouldn't think so. I mean, I don't think it is an unreasonable thing to require of a newspaper that it be balanced.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly the context in which Mr Keating has made his point in which he stated his preference for balance. It is not a partisan context; it is a context that is simply demanding a reasonable sense of responsibility from the newspaper proprietors of this country. It is a position that has been taken over and over again in public statements by people on Senator Herron's side of politics. It is a perfectly reasonable position, one that does not distinguish the opposition side from the government side and certainly does not justify the imputations that have been involved here.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third matter in issue here is what was the fundamental, underlying basis of the decision that was actually taken, foreshadowed before the election and taken after the election, to increase the Black stakeholding from 14.9 to 25 per cent. Here the answer is unequivocally clear. It is unequivocally clear in the text of the Treasurer's statement back in April; it is unequivocally clear in what I have said this afternoon in retailing what the basis of that decision was as a member of the government who participated in it; and it is unequivocally clear in what Prime Minister Keating had to say in Seattle, notwithstanding various suggestions earlier in question time that in Seattle the Prime Minister had done no more than refer to the balance question. In fact, it is abundantly clear that the Prime Minister did refer quite explicitly to the financial, economic and managerial considerations that were involved.

          Hansard

         one such passage in an interview he gave last week, on Thursday 18 November. In retailing his conversation with Mr Black, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I would consider going to 25 per cent, because his claim was that he couldn't run the business at 14.9 per cent; that he had just concluded that day, a meeting at the Opera House where he had been pilloried in running the business with 14.9 per cent. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Again in Seattle, the following day, last Friday 19 November, the Prime Minister said in answer to a question:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I mean, Mr Black made the point that it was very hard to manage the newspaper with 14.9% of the stock and it's a pretty reasonable point to make. We've given him 25% and 25% is nowhere near a commanding position in terms of the equity but it gives him the authority to manage it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There it is clearly and unequivocally on the record. On both occasions when Mr Keating addressed this issue in Seattle, he referred specifically to the economic, financial, managerial and business justification for this decision. That was clear at the time, it was clear in Mr Keating's original conversations, it was clear in what was said publicly, it has been clear in what has been said publicly since, and notwithstanding the assertions of people in the opposition here today, it was clear in exactly what Mr Keating said in Seattle.

       I will explain that. Mr Hill was going on at very great length to explain why an ABC advertisement had called for a rural reporter of a specific ethnic origin.

They asked, `Why did your advertisement, in breach of the equal opportunity rules, specifically mention a particular person of a particular ethnic origin?'.

He said that a certain number of people in the community were Anglo-Celtic and that he wanted that percentage on the ABC; there were a certain number of women in the community and he wanted that percentage in the ABC.

I said, `I'll bet you they're not', and I will bet that with anyone as I think it is a well-known fact.

The committee's report proposes to refer the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill 1993 to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which I am chairman.

          My concern is that this matter clearly comes under the  control of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. The matter comes under the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The minister responsible for this matter would be the Minister for Resources, Mr Lee.

          The committee has recommended that this matter be sent to a committee that now does not deal with energy matters. The reason is that earlier we formed a rural and regional affairs committee which deals with references that relate to rural and energy matters. It also deals with the annual report of the department and other matters. If we are to have standing committees that develop a corporate knowledge of the ministries they cover and if we are to have senators who become experts on particular areas, we should follow the guidelines that are laid down and have the committee that shadows that ministry—if I can use that expression—deal with the matter.

          The industry committee does not deal with those matters and has properly not dealt with them since the formation of the rural and regional affairs committee. I appreciate that from time to time a reference is not given to the standing committee that has that ministerial coverage, but I ask the committee to consider very carefully recommending the reference of a bill to a committee that does not have that ministerial coverage.

          If we are not careful we will end up with a situation where the caprice of a particular senator determines that a committee will deal with a matter. I think that would be unfair to a standing committee which needs to spend a lot of time on legislation. We should consider the reports, the other matters associated with a committee and the ministerial arrangements that are allocated to various standing committees.

         This is an extremely important report because, as mentioned in the report, the rate of growth of research and development expenditure by Australian business is one of the fastest, if not the fastest, in OECD countries. Nevertheless, we are still 17th out of 24 OECD countries—that is, seventh from the bottom—for our expenditure on R&amp;D by Australian businesses. The government's efforts to make sure we got further up the ladder resulted in the 150 per cent research and development tax incentive which was introduced for the six-year period from 1 July 1985 to 30 June 1991. There was a suggestion in 1991 that the rate should be continued until 30 June 1993 and then reduced to a rate of 125 per cent to apply until 30 June 1995. However, in August 1992 the government announced that the incentive would continue at the rate of 150 per cent in recognition of the fact that research and development is an important factor in increasing the export capacity of our industries, particularly in the area of innovation.

          This report is extremely disturbing because it addresses the effectiveness of this tax incentive. The recommendations disclose that currently we do not know whether this incentive is functioning or whether it is providing the increased expenditure by business. We do not know because the two bodies that are responsible for it—the Industry Research and Development Board and the Australian Taxation Office—do not have proper procedures in place to monitor and assess the benefit that Australia derives from this incentive.

I want to assure Senator Spindler that I and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Mr Griffiths, take this report very seriously, because we believe that the 150 per cent tax concession is a very important part of the development of Australian industry.

          Senator Spindler has noted, and it is noted in the report, that it is no longer a program that has a sunset clause on it. It is now accepted by the government as an indefinite program. We, and industry, are delighted to have it accepted as an ongoing program as a feature of our support for R&amp;D in Australia. We note that the report says that there is a difficulty in making a true assessment of the value of this program so far. All I can say is that in my time as Minister for Science and Small Business, going to many functions involving industry, small business and the scientific community, this program of 150 per cent tax deduction is very strongly supported. In fact, many industries now tell us that if it were not for the tax deduction they would not have increased the level of R&amp;D. They tell us that, as a result of this concession, they are able not only to increase their R&amp;D expenditure but also to get a commercial outcome as a result of their R&amp;D expenditure that leads to extra goods and services being produced in Australia, extra income for the economy and jobs.

The ATO believes that providing the information that DITARD officers would like to have to properly assess the scheme, providing transparent information about its success and about improving the scheme, could be in breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act's secrecy provisions.

          This matter relates to the scandal currently before the Australian public identified by the Auditor-General in his audit report No. 9 into the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program. That is the program administered by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Honourable senators will recall the findings of the Auditor-General in relation to that program when he had the opportunity to have a look at it. He was particularly concerned that, on the evidence available, he was unable to determine the basis upon which grants were made to particular beneficiaries.

           We are talking about a lot of money here. It was a program of some $30 million. In November of 1992, the reallocation of funding for projects originally announced in the One Nation statement resulted in the government allocating an additional $18.75 million to the program. When we talk about those grants that were made in November of last year—that is, just a few months before the federal election—we are talking about an allocation by the minister of many millions of taxpayers' dollars to benefit certain sporting or cultural or recreational clubs in relation to their facilities. That, on the face of it, might not seem extraordinary. The question is the basis upon which Mrs Kelly chose one applicant over another.

           What has come out in very recent times as a result of the Auditor-General's findings is that, extraordinarily, it was Labor seats, which accounted for 53 per cent of the House of Representatives, which received 73 per cent of the number of grants and 66 per cent of the value of those grants. Also, on average, the total value of grants to a Labor-held seat was $257,000 and, to a coalition seat, only $141,000—almost  half. On average, the total value of grants to a marginal Labor-held seat was $326,000 and, to a marginal coalition seat, $163,000—again, almost double the grant went to the Labor-held marginal seat.

What we do know is that she signed the letters for those who were successful; the department signed letters for those who were unsuccessful. We know the department sent her a schedule, divided into three, of those applicants who were more demanding than others, but the department was then not told of the basis on which she made the final decisions.

           As the Auditor-General said, the public of Australia has the right to know the basis upon which applicants were deemed to be found successful or unsuccessful. The most appropriate body in this parliament to get to the bottom of this mess, on the basis of historical experience, is the estimates committee of this parliament. It did not consider this particular matter because the Auditor-General's report came out a few days after the closing date for notice that would have got the matter before the supplementary hearings of Estimates Committee E. It therefore seems to be sensible that that committee is now able to reconvene and question the minister and the bureaucrats on the basis on which these grants were given and why one applicant was successful over another.

At no stage under repeated questioning last week in the House of Representatives, again today, and in a further debate today, has she even been able to produce the documents.

           Minister Kelly is unable to answer any of the questions; she is unable to answer any of the questions that have been put to her by the Auditor-General as to what the decision-making process was. The simple point is that the report also stated that there was insufficient consultation; that the projects were not monitored systematically; that certain administrative procedures left the program open to fraud; that the program fraud control was out of date; and that there was poor performance information. This is the report of the independent Auditor-General on this incompetent minister who cannot for some reason find the documentation on which these decisions were made.

This is not the first time Mrs Kelly has been proven to be incompetent, it certainly will not be the last, but what is she hiding from the parliament on this occasion? If the Liberal Party had not brought this to light when Senator Baume, as the then shadow minister in this area, asked the Auditor-General to find out the basis on which these decisions were made, nothing of this would have come out. Yet here we have again this Labor Party trying to defend the indefensible. Let us face it, it has used taxpayers' money to try to win its way back into government.

           Firstly, it is most disappointing to hear honourable senators reflecting on a House of Representatives committee. Surely, we should see this as part of the process of leaving it firstly to the House of Representatives committee, which is up and ready to go—Mr Langmore has given an undertaking that it will indeed be starting this year—and giving it the chance to collect the documents and talk to people, as it is planning to do. Then those who go into estimates next year will be well and truly armed with all the material they need if there are still further questions to be asked. I reject the idea that it is all a matter of numbers on the committee in the House of Representatives. I believe that the information will speak for itself; indeed, much of the information that is within this report speaks for itself.

           Having been rejected a fifth time by the Australian electorate, those opposite have gone from a position where they had in Fightback chapter, verse, clause and footnote on everything to a situation where they do not have a policy on anything. They do not have a policy on Mabo or industrial relations. They sneer at APEC. They said the Cambodian peace initiative could not succeed.

           —I rise to support the motion for the suspension of standing orders moved by Senator Hill and to urge this chamber to recall Estimates Committee E to consider, in particular, the very serious matters that have been raised in the Auditor-General's report. What we have before us is yet another case of how this government rorted its way to an election victory. It is hard to find people who admit that they voted for the Labor Party. One of the reasons is the rorts that were going on; one relates to the electoral system, which we are uncovering in a committee at the moment; another is the outrageous lies that the government told in lying its way to the election; and here we have an example of blatant pork-barrelling right around the Commonwealth.

           The government has actually given a new meaning to the term `triennial grants'. It granted $29.5 million to this program just before the election. Guess what happened in this budget? It disappeared totally. People were saying what a great program it was earlier on. If it was such a great program, why has it disappeared? I predict that it will come back in 1995—in time for the next election.

           What happened before this election was that in November all the grant applications were due and in February—surprise, surprise—they were all allocated. Labor seats received 73 per cent of the grants. Marginal Labor seats received double that received by the coalition seats. Labor marginals received $326,000; coalition marginals received $163,000. If anyone wanted to investigate this, there is some factor operating there. Why is it biased one way and not the other?

           Let us look at an example. Logan City is an example of how this bias worked in a particular way to favour Labor in the election. An amount of $96,000 was given to the Logan City workers, rugby and sporting club. One might ask: what is wrong with that?  At the time the grant was made the so-called club did not have a playing field and did not even have a team, yet it got $96,000. I was listening to Mrs Kelly today in the other chamber. In response to a question from Dr Hewson, she said, in terms of the guidelines, that it must be for the upgrading of existing facilities. If one does not have a playing field to start with, one has a massive upgrade to do. This is an example of blatant pork-barrelling by this government before the election.

           If we look at what the Australian National Audit Office said in relation to this sort of blatant pork-barrelling, we see that it brings out some areas of very serious concern, which Senator Loosley was trying to sweep under the carpet. Indeed, in the other chamber Mrs Kelly spent most of her time going through the objectives of the program and the procedures that were followed. The Australian National Audit Office said:

         I move this motion in the hope that the Senate will now agree that the most appropriate method of financial accountability—the tried and tested method, the estimates committee—be permitted to be utilised to get to the bottom of this very serious concern that has been uncovered by the Auditor-General.

          I was astounded that the attitude of the Australian Democrats in the previous debate, on the suspension of the standing orders, appeared to be that they would not support the reconvening of the estimates committee. This is the party, of course, that said that it was here to keep the bastards honest, which we always presumed meant the government; yet when we move in this place to allow the Senate committee—the most appropriate committee—to simply hold a day's hearing to examine these very serious revelations of the Auditor-General, the Australian Democrats say, `No, we won't permit you to do that. We will not permit the Senate to look at these very serious concerns raised by the Auditor-General in his report'.

          I turn to the problem which was raised by Senator West as to the reason why the committee did not look at this matter when it met a few weeks ago. Of course, as I indicated, the reason was that the Auditor-General's report was put down a few days after the closing of the time by which we would have had to give notice of this line of questioning. So this is the first opportunity we have had to enable and facilitate the committee to meet its responsibility; that is, to be called and, in turn, to call the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the bureaucrats to get to the bottom of this very serious matter—and it is a very serious matter.

          I understand that since this scheme was established there have been some four allocations of money. We are talking about some $60.3 million of taxpayers' money that has been disbursed to sporting, cultural and recreational bodies at the apparent discretion of the minister. That is a very large sum of taxpayers' money. All we are seeking to do is to take up the challenge of the Auditor-General and to try to find out the basis upon which the minister has allocated the money to certain applicants over others.

          I put to the Senate a few minutes ago when speaking to the motion to suspend standing orders the fact that, coincidentally or otherwise, it seems that these grants that were made just before the federal election were biased very much in favour of applicants from Labor Party electorates—almost to a ratio of two to one in dollar terms.

          That, not surprisingly, was regarded with some disquiet by the Auditor-General, who then sought the documentation which was the basis of the minister's decision regarding allocation. The minister then referred the Auditor-General back to the department. The Auditor-General had already seen the documents in the department and, therefore, advised the Australian public that there was nothing on the record in the department that indicated why the minister chose one applicant over another.

It would not need any longer. It would meet next week and, as we say in the motion, it would report to the Senate on 6 December. On the first sitting day in the next sitting week, the committee could report to the Senate and the Senate would then be able to address the questions that were left unanswered by the Auditor-General.

          The argument that cost is a barrier simply does not stand analysis. Senator West argued that point. The argument that the Senate should have looked at it earlier is also not an argument because, as we found out, the Auditor-General's report was, in fact, put down thereafter. The argument that a committee of the House of Representatives is also looking at this matter does not really stand scrutiny because that does not excuse us from our responsibility in this place.

          The government will certainly be opposing this motion. Minister Kelly herself has indicated that she has commissioned a comprehensive review of all of these matters with her own department—the program, of course, comes to an end at the end of this year, in any case—but also a reference has been given to the appropriate House of Representatives committee. The chairman of that committee has already made a statement saying that the committee will deal with the matter expeditiously. Why the Senate needs to duplicate that—the minister of course is in the House of Representatives—is a strange indictment of the capacity of the opposition members who are on that committee.

The government has a majority on both the estimates committee and the House of Representatives committee. That has never prevented the proper scrutiny of these affairs, which will stand or fall on their own merit, I might add, irrespective of what report the committees bring down. The opposition members of those committees are quite capable of bringing down dissenting reports, which is their wont, but all of the issues will be canvassed publicly and that is the key issue. No matter what the report says, we are dealing with the question of public accountability. That will happen in that House of Representatives committee.

That is what is required in this parliament, because the way in which they are used in this parliament is a scandal. Ninety-nine per cent of the questions that are pursued on Senate committees on the estimates are never followed up.

          A reference has been given to a House of Representatives committee on which I hope the coalition is well represented. There will be a committee in the House to investigate the minister involved. I have no doubt that endless opportunities will present themselves at that committee for all these affairs to be laid out to the public gaze and for a full public account to be given. In terms of the workload and the commitments that we already have in a much overtaxed committee system, as badly as it is used in the Senate, there is absolutely no need to duplicate that process here.

          If we are to start discussing the issue here, rather than leaving it to the committee, perhaps I can make one comment. The defence that it was all being done on the basis of need really does not hold up when we look at marginal electorates. It may hold up when looking at safe seats, because they are quite different in their socioeconomic base. We could understand where there would be some possible differences if we were looking at it on the basis of need.

          But when we come to seats that, by their very nature, are marginal and where there is a broader cross-section of Australians, some questions have to be asked. Certainly some questions have to be asked about the seats in my state of South Australia. So the Democrats will wait with interest to see what is brought out by the House of Representatives committee.

          I remind senators again that the estimates will continue next year. Whatever the minister's feelings about the estimates, we cannot stop them. They will go ahead next year. By the time we get there, we will have even more information on which to base our questions and reopen any questions that need reopening. So, as we approach the busiest time of year for the Senate in terms of the amount of legislation we have to deal with and the number of committee meetings that we all have, let us leave the House of Representatives to do some of the work. We will pick up this issue again once its job is finished.

          Why is it that, in a bicameral system, suddenly it is okay for the Democrats to say, `It's all right, let the House of Representatives handle it'? It is absolutely and utterly outrageous to suddenly say, `It is okay to divest ourselves of all responsibility in this matter and put it over to the House of Representatives'. It is quite amazing for the Democrats, who are not represented in the House of Representatives, to be quite happy to abrogate their responsibility to members of a chamber where they are not even represented.

Those two intelligent senators opposite—and I ask the Senate to pardon my abuse of their ability—do not understand that the Democrats cannot possibly be represented on a House of Representatives committee because they are not represented in the House of Representatives. I have absolute and utter faith in the members of the coalition parties who are going to be on that committee. We have the ability to be able to question the government in the committee hearing. But that still does not say that we in the Senate should not have the same right to question, through the whole parliamentary system, at an estimates committee. That is exactly what we are seeking.

          One might ask: how many of these grants that have been made in this typical pork-barrelling by the Labor Party have been made to associations close to the Australian Democrats? That is another question that probably needs to be asked. Why can it not be cleared in an estimates committee hearing? Why do the Australian Democrats want to collude with the government to prevent Estimates Committee E from reconvening to discuss this whole issue in detail? That is all that we are seeking.

          We all know why it has been done. Let us face it, it was most successful in many areas. Yet a little while ago Minister Schacht asked how we could claim such rot when some of the money went into formerly marginal Labor seats and Labor lost them? Well, well, well. Is that not just hysterical! In other words, Labor did not put enough of the taxpayers' money into those electorates. It is one thing to get public funding for political campaigns and so forth. This is another way in which the Labor Party has been doing it to benefit various interest groups in various portfolios, right across the board.

As Senator West also knows but judiciously failed to mention, even when it was brought to her attention—if she had not been bright enough to know it herself before she got to her feet—this Auditor-General's report which is so critical of Mrs Kelly's performance and that of her office was not even released by the time of the last hearing of Senate Estimates Committee E.

I think it is fair to begin by making the observation that former Senator Lionel Murphy was a great political mind and at the end of his political career he was a great jurist on the High Court of Australia. He was an outstanding Australian for whom I had enormous regard and for whom I continue to have enormous regard—more so as I read much of what he wrote in judgments. That regard covers his endeavours as a policy maker, a parliamentarian, a legislator and later on the bench as a jurist.

          Senator Murphy was the founder of the Senate committee system which we have inherited two political generations beyond his presence in the chamber. Senator Murphy designed an estimates committee system that was almost a perfect vehicle for genuine forensic parliamentarians from both sides of the political fence. I refer in particular to people of the quality of former Senator Walsh and former Senator Peter Baume in those roles.

It is appropriate from time to time that the House of Representatives actually take on a little more of the parliamentary workload. The estimates committees give the government a majority. The House of Representatives committee presumably will have a government majority, but otherwise all the procedures are virtually identical. The skills are the same in both houses presumably and given the workload of the Senate between now and Christmas it is entirely appropriate that the House do a bit more work.

          In terms of being called to account, I find the debate to date absolutely amazing. Speakers from the other side, with the exception of Senator Loosley in his last three or four minutes, did not address any of the substantive issues at all. We had a great diatribe from Senator Collins, who wasted our time for 20 minutes talking about wasting time on estimates committees, yet I well remember back in May sitting through an estimates committee hearing until 2 o'clock in the morning in which Senator Collins would not allow any of his public servants to answer questions on pay TV. He took every question himself and then refused to answer the questions. He talks about wasting time. He has wasted so much time of this chamber—not only in estimates but in here—that a special

What we had before us was the program performance statements and brief explanations. Anyone who has looked through those documents knows that what they do not do is reveal; what they do is coalesce a huge amount of information and hide the detail of specific programs. I would have to go back to the particular program, but this $29 1/2 million probably shows up as a one-line item. It is only when we get something like this Auditor-General's report, which carries out a sort of forensic examination of a particular department and its programs, that the truth comes to light. Boy, did the truth come to light on this program after our hearings finished on 5 November. One would wonder—perhaps Senator West has an answer to this—why this Auditor-General's report happened to be tabled on 15 November, after the estimates procedures had finished. I have looked into this matter on a number of occasions with other departments and I found that they could have tabled things months before they did. It is interesting that it came out at the end of estimates so that we could not ask the questions that needed to be asked on this matter.

Senator Ferguson did do his work—did it very well—in estimates, but nobody else from the opposition did. He was left there at one stage for five hours to do the questioning and nobody came near him. Some people had other committee commitments. However, when our schedule of sittings came out in July and August of this year, for the weeks starting 1 November and 8 November, we were told that it was time that was available for supplementary estimates hearings. Yet other people chose to go off with other committees elsewhere. That is a decision that they have to make, but they do not need to come back in here at a later date and say that they want to reopen something because they chose to do something different.

What honourable senators choose to forget is that these grants were allocated on an electorate by electorate basis. Maybe it is important that those people who have electorates are actually the ones who look at how it is distributed—not us, who have statewide boundaries and who can afford to sit back and pontificate, gaze at our navels and think of all sorts of nice woolly wonderful things.

The amount of money per Labor seat was $257,000, whereas for a coalition seat it was $141,000, clearly showing that these grants—which are allocated by the minister herself and not by the department, not by any committee—had a clear preference for the Labor seats.

         the local capital works projects—66 per cent of those handouts just before the election went to Labor seats and only 72 per cent of those grants went to coalition seats. So here it is yet again in a different field. We are talking about grants for sports and cultural organisations. I am talking about the local capital works projects that went to councils just before the election. Again, that magic figure, 66 per cent of grants went to Labor held seats and 32 per cent went to coalition seats. It is interesting to do the figures on the table that Mr Simmons tabled in the parliament. The amount of local capital works projects that went to Labor electorates was $6,227,000-odd. For coalition electorates it was $3,364,000.

There we are—$14.6 million for the seat the Labor Party had to win back; $6.2 million on average for every Labor Party electorate, and $3.3 million on average for every coalition electorate.

One could almost wonder whether the Democrats have something to fear. Perhaps the Democrats are concerned that if we open up the estimates committee hearing into the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, we might start looking more closely at what sort of grants went to conservation groups which are aligned to them. Maybe the Democrats do not want those sorts of things investigated. Maybe there has been a deal between the government and the Democrats on who gets the money that is shovelled out. It may be for this reason that the Democrats are opposing it.

          We do know that the Australian Democrats is a party of hypocrisy. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that the Democrats as a party was always solid in its support of the United Nations, except when it came to Kuwait. It again showed its hypocrisy by one year arguing very viciously against the forced creation of mega-unions and the next year arguing equally vociferously in favour of it. The Democrats is a party of hypocrisy in claiming to support the transport industry and then voting against the abolition of sales tax and fuel tax, and supporting increases in sales tax and fuel excise which added millions to the costs of the transport industry.

          The Australian Democrats showed their hypocrisy by pretending to be the party of human rights and then siding with the Labor Party to ban electoral advertising—to ban free speech—in this country. They showed hypocrisy by calling for environmentally friendly power supplies and then opposing the cleanest form of power around—hydro-electric power. That sort of hypocrisy is what the Australian Democrats have become known for. It is no wonder that the Democrats, which again have a chance to support us in keeping the government honest, have chosen to continue their line of hypocrisy by opposing this opportunity for scrutiny.

          I think the scrutiny of public expenditure has sometimes been hindered. Senator Schacht, who appeared before us in Estimates Committee E, agreed that the lack of information in program performance statements sometimes leads to an inability, certainly on the part of public servants, to provide answers on the spot. Many of the program performance statements contain only one line. We ask questions; and public servants are required to give the answers. But they do not have the information because not enough information is put into the program performance statements. We are unable to scrutinise properly the spending. Certainly, in many cases they are unable to answer the questions that we put before them.

          Senator West, or it might have been Senator Collins, made a comment about public servants coming from all over Australia. I think both Senator West and Senator Collins ought to acknowledge that we made every effort, particularly during the supplementary estimates hearings, to accommodate on the agenda those public servants who were travelling long distances. On almost every occasion they were able to leave early or we were able to make sure that we finished their program so that they would not be an added cost to the country by being kept here overnight. It would not hurt the government to acknowledge the fact that we made particular reference to this at estimates hearings. We made sure that, wherever possible, public servants were not kept waiting for their program to come up.

          Minister Kelly may have said in the other house that she would deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible. But the only place where this can be dealt with properly, where the Democrats can have an input if they wish and where the whole of the expenditure can be reviewed, would be before Estimates Committee E. Estimates Committee E should be recalled in just the same way that Senator Schacht recalled the estimates committee when he had further information that he wanted to put before it.

I was unable to be at the estimates because I was at the European Parliament on the first occasion and I was overseas again, but ever so briefly, on the second occasion. On both occasions I asked whether the hearing dates could be changed. I do not think it was a problem for anybody on our side of politics, but it was a problem for the minister.

         When the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation goes back to the President, we will be moving an amendment to the effect that the matter be referred to the committee for inquiry and report on the first sitting day in October 1995. That report will be about the operation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal for its first 12 months, whether the tribunal was adequately meeting the needs of the superannuation fund members, and whether an independent superannuation consumer advice service should be established and supported by grants from consolidated revenue.

         It appeared to be a not unreasonable request from the parliamentary secretary, Mr Johns, that this innovation—the tribunal which was set up and designed to meet consumer interests—be given a reasonable chance of operation. So, in a sense, during the tribunal's first 12 months the superannuation committee will be monitoring its operation as to the manner in which it assists consumers in their difficulties in relation to superannuation. We believe that this is a not unreasonable approach under the circumstances because the tribunal will be very conscious that a parliamentary committee, in the form of the Select Committee on Superannuation, will be monitoring its actions, at the end of 12 months will be conducting an inquiry, and by the first sitting day in October 1995 will be reporting back to the Senate in the terms of the three issues that I have put before the Senate.

         I turn to the issues that were of concern to the members of the select committee when they made a recommendation that perhaps there was a need for a consumer legal service. I think we have to acknowledge that some of the members who advocated that have since moved into other positions. There will be a monitoring and an oversight of the need for a consumer representative service in this area. Therefore, I will be moving an amendment when we are considering that the report of the committee be adopted. I thank the Senate and I thank all the officers who were involved in this exchange.

         —It was with some reluctance that I considered the Australian Democrats' position on this matter. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), who is at the table, how we are going to maintain the independence and the right to representation of consumers. Sure, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is going to do its best, and it will have 18 people, but it is under the umbrella of the ISC, which is the government's Insurance and Superannuation Commission. How will we ensure that consumers can be dealt with fairly? How is the tribunal going to balance its responsibilities to both the government and the consumers at the same time?

         I am disappointed that the government wishes to bring this amendment back to this chamber. I just do not accept that consumers will be best served by a rejection of our amendment. It is true that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended the legal centre's approach as a cost-effective alternative to expanding the rights of representation. We are being asked to monitor the tribunal for a year. I accept Senator Watson's argument that it is better for the Senate select committee to monitor the tribunal for a year. My problem is: at the end of that year, how do we get the government to do anything about it? It is a fine notion to say, `Let's monitor it for a year'.

         We cannot deny the fact that we are talking about $169 billion in funds, we are talking about 70 per cent of Australian workers, and we are saying that the government is not prepared to look at something like $660,000 in the short term, because we were prepared to put a sunset clause in here and say that this gives time for government and industry to work together. It is a very weak compromise and I am disappointed that the coalition has had to review its position on this amendment. I am waiting to hear Senator Sherry's answer as to how the tribunal, even with the best will in the world, can fairly represent both government and consumer.

If we were even able to defer this bill for just one more day, we might have been able to get an indication of the types of concerns that superannuation consumers actually have.

         As for the first point that the ISC leans towards the funds, I do not agree with that. If Senator Kernot means it leans towards the funds in the sense that it is tolerant of mistakes that are made by the trustees of funds often in ignorance, I believe that to be the case. For the trustees, for example, to change the rules of the fund—having been a trustee myself—is not an easy thing to do. There have been many changes to the law that were applied retrospectively, so I think the ISC is tolerant of those sorts of problems that a fund encounters. It is tolerant of that also because it is dealing with, in a sense, lay trustees and it has not been easy during this transition period of improved regulation over the last years for fund trustees in some cases to cope with that change in legislation.

         I do not accept that the ISC leans towards the funds in the sense that it is tolerant of trustees not taking into account the legitimate concerns of the members of the funds.

At the moment we have a voluntary code of practice where the companies are supposed to—and I think in a significant number of cases do—respond to complaints of members of the funds.

         Finally, Senator Murphy has just reminded me that many of the funds over the last year or two have established the practice of setting up their own independent offices within the fund. So there is another mechanism. That will be required under this legislation, but many of the funds have been establishing independent offices to handle the sorts of concerns that members have if the trustees do not respond to their complaints in a satisfactory manner.

         The tribunal, in the initial stages particularly, will ensure that there is, in a sense, a balance of advocacy power before it. If it takes the view that there should be no professional advocates and it wants to hear the cases—some workers compensation tribunals are able to do this—it will be able to say, `We do not want any professional advocates. We want to talk to the parties directly'. That is not necessarily a disadvantage, particularly in the early days of development. I think that will be a satisfactory start.

         It is early days. This involves a very major change to the superannuation environment. It is not often that any government appoints a new independent semi-judicial body to handle an area of law. We obviously did it with the family law and industrial relations areas. I cannot think of too many other areas where we deal with consumer issues in this way. So it is early days. That is why the government has asked for time to see how the details of the caseload work out, and that is why it prefers the approaches that will be reflected in the motion to be moved by Senator Watson.

         —On Friday, when we were last discussing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993, I made a point about the islands seeking self-determination. At that time, I was speaking about the Cook Islands, which the chairman of the Torres Strait Island Coordinating Council wishes to use as a role model. As I said, already the Cook Islands legislates on matters of income tax and immigration, and it is moving into areas of foreign affairs with the New Zealand government. It regularly updates its statements of international personality which allows it to join such international forums as the food and agriculture organisations of the UN and the South Pacific.

         New Zealand really acts only on its request in matters of foreign affairs and defence. In the late 1980s, when New Zealand signed a medical agreement with Australia, the Cook Islanders were also invited to be part of that reciprocal arrangement, but they declined.

         As a sign of its growing independence, the Cook Islands will be establishing a high commission in Canberra next year.

         While sympathising with the islanders who wish to do more for themselves, we must find a way that does not put at risk Australia's security and international arrangements. We must find a way that does not create more financial and economic burdens for a community which could not feasibly support itself for some time to come. We must find a way that ensures that the interests of other Queenslanders living on the Torres Strait who do not originally come from the islands—some 20 per cent, according to Senator Ray—also have their needs met.

         As the islanders are claiming that the Mabo case strengthens their call for self-determination in the form of free association from Australia, the government must clarify whether, if a right to their land is not extinguished by the accession of British sovereignty, the right of self-government also survives. The point also should be made that even if the Torres Strait were to be constituted as a federal territory, this is no guarantee of greater political or economic autonomy to Torres Strait Islanders.

         I have been to all the territories in my position as shadow minister for territories. Norfolk Island almost has self-government and autonomy. The Norfolk Island Act gives Norfolk Island a responsible legislative and executive government to enable it to run itself as much as possible. The federal government makes a contribution of only about $1.15 million a year. That is a totally different situation from that which applies to the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, both of which have administrators. I believe that those administrators run those islands with very little input from the constituents of the islands. Having been to the Torres Strait a number of times, I think that it does have local self-government.

         The bill we are debating now gives the Torres Strait Islanders their own important commission. It creates a separate Torres Strait regional authority—something the islanders have always wanted. I would say that they would possibly have as much as or even more autonomy than do the two territories of the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island.

         The point should also be made that, even if Torres Strait Island were to be constituted as a federal territory, it has to be very careful that what it will get is more autonomy. Section 122 of the federal constitution allows for the Commonwealth to make laws for the government of any of its territories, which may or may not include self-government legislation. Bipartisan support is therefore necessary if this were to be the route to self-determination.

         I cannot help but feel that the islanders have been led up the garden path by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who cannot possibly have cabinet support to endorse self-government by the year 2001 in these terms. In the Queensland state parliament last Friday, Mr Goss, when asked about self-determination for the Torres Strait, said:

        I think it is absolutely irresponsible for Mr Tickner to tell the islanders that self-government by the year 2001 is an option when, in fact, it would have to have the support of the Queensland government to go through.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The minister, by not ruling out some of the demands, encouraged the islanders to believe they are feasible. To be master of one's own destiny is granted to a very few. Most of us do the best we can with what we have, and Australia has plenty. Any Queenslander who feels they want to have self-government and retain free association with Australia must carefully consider what they would be giving up in terms of social, economic and political aspects and ordinary security and support.

         The issue of self-government in the Torres Strait raises a number of questions which I believe the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) who is at the table should answer now. How far are the state and federal governments prepared to go with regard to self-determination? We have heard from Premier Goss and he has given it no encouragement. Therefore, I ask the parliamentary secretary to advise how far the federal government is prepared to go.

If Mr Tickner has received the go-ahead from federal cabinet, this government is obliged to make that decision clear.

         —The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to make a range of amendments to the ATSIC act. Many of the suggested changes arise as a result of the review of ATSIC carried out under the principal act to mark three years of ATSIC's work. I had some questions relating to the changes to general funding powers and to budget drafting processes which have partially been answered and which, no doubt, will be clarified by the minister during the committee stage.

         In looking at the overall thrust of the bill, I could not help but wonder whether all the accountability changes will see ATSIC so bound up in accountability that it will not be able to deliver services on the ground. As these changes go so much to the heart of ATSIC, it seems odd to foster them. For this reason, the Greens will not be supporting the thrust of the opposition's foreshadowed amendments.

         When concerns about ATSIC's accountability are raised—as, for example, in Senator Panizza's inquiry—it is relevant to put on the record the reasons why the Greens are not supporting these changes. I will summarise them because they also apply to the opposition's amendments.

         —I am sure that we will. I am sure that we will keep that option open. I will summarise the reasons why greater scrutiny and new processes being introduced to ATSIC are not favoured at this time by the Greens. Clearly, we are not saying that the agency is perfect. We can all point out areas in which money could be better spent or saved. In that regard, ATSIC is by no means unusual. There are some specific reasons why the Greens do not favour these changes. The chief amongst them is the forthcoming ATSIC elections which will be held in the next few weeks. We believe that an inquiry could dissuade some Aboriginal people from exercising their right to vote in the elections, thus making the regional councils less representative than they should be. As a number of criticisms of ATSIC seem to revolve around complaints of a lack of adequate representation by various communities and groups, such an effect would be counterproductive.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Secondly, I would be very concerned if the incoming councillors and commissioners were thrown straight into a major inquiry when they should be settling into doing the best job they can for the Aboriginal communities which elected them as their representatives. Also, the inquiry would absorb a great deal of the agency's resources at a time when they are needed in other areas.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third reason that I have given for not supporting Senator Panizza's concerns has also, I believe, been addressed by ATSIC's own review of its first three years of operation. The results of that review are expressed in this legislation. An inquiry could duplicate a lot of the work that has already been done.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, an inquiry is possibly premature, considering that ATSIC has not yet reached its fourth birthday. We agree that there is room for improvement but, because of the atmosphere that would be generated, we do not believe that either a parliamentary inquiry or the opposition's suggestion of increased accountability and procedures of greater scrutiny would be necessarily, for the reasons I have cited already, the best means of addressing the issues which have been raised.

The alternative that we suggest is that the newly elected representatives of ATSIC be given a chance actually to put into action the kinds of procedures that are already established. They should be given the opportunity to truly represent their regional councils. Senator Panizza said he will be here next year. If there is a need for an inquiry or further accountability procedures, then that may well be an appropriate time to look at them. The Greens do not feel that now is that time.

         We support the aspects of the bill relating to the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The major concern of the Greens revolves around part 8, clause 18, on page 12 of the bill, in respect of the minister's involvement in making appointments relating to ATSIC. I foreshadow that we will be presenting amendments at a later stage. These amendments have the same effect as the government's proposal contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1993. As honourable senators will remember, the government's proposal was rejected by an amendment moved by the opposition and supported by the Australian Democrats.

         At the time, I supported the government's proposal but was in no position to influence the decision. Since then I have received a strong lobby from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia, including the ATSIC commissioners themselves. These people believe that it is only appropriate that if ATSIC is to be, and is to be seen to be, a vehicle for self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, then all the commissioners who head this organisation should be elected.

         It is in the interests of the government and of the parliament that ATSIC be fully empowered to set its own course in determining what is best for its constituency. Naturally, all the normal accountability functions will remain, and so they should when any government organisation is spending considerable amounts of public funds.

         The amendments that I have circulated would come into operation from I January 1994, so they would not in any way affect the current round of ATSIC elections. In fact, the first time they would be used would be to elect the new commission in 1996-97. This is a full three years away—almost the same length of time as ATSIC has existed. During that period the organisation would have as much time to mature as it has since its inception.

         Secondly, I understand that the Democrats have some concern about the number of elected commissioners. They feel that, rather than there being 17 commissioners, the number should be raised to 19. I would like to assure them that if they wish to change the numbers, that essentially will have the support of the Greens as well. However, in this instance the particular proposition I am foreshadowing will be to make sure that election is the method by which the commissioners are chosen. This will add to the self-determination principles that the Greens support.

         —The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 is the third and final part of the changes made to the ATSIC act. As we have heard, the impetus for these changes was the report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) arising from the commission's review of its operations. How healthy it is that the commission should be prepared to review its operations at the end of its first term and how healthy it is that it should be willing to implement significant and meaningful changes as a result of that review.

         The bill puts in place additional provisions for evaluation and audit procedures which will significantly improve accountabilities at all levels of the commission. The government's bill amends the ATSIC act to strengthen annual reporting provisions for regional councils, and guidelines are set down for the preparation of draft budgets which are to have reference to regional plans.

         The bill marks the beginning of a new phase for ATSIC and an opportunity to cement the vision of reconciliation and indigenous self-determination which the commission embodies. I believe strongly that the establishment of ATSIC has been one of the most important developments in Aboriginal affairs in recent times. It is clear that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are determining their own future.

         ATSIC, through its system of elected regional councils and policy making board of commissioners, provides a means of empowerment and self-determination.

         I think it is wonderful to note that there is a record number of nominations for the regional council elections of ATSIC to be held on 4 December. A total of 2,001 candidates have nominated for the 573 positions. This is an increase of 400 since the last and first election. Numbered among the candidates, interestingly enough, are many who have previously been very unsupportive of ATSIC. ATSIC has obviously proven its worth as a representative structure for Aboriginal peoples. These people now want to be part of the action. Three years ago, many people, including many from Aboriginal communities, doubted that ATSIC would survive. But now they realise that ATSIC has established itself as a forceful and independent political voice with real economic power.

         Since 1990—and I remind honourable senators that ATSIC has been in existence for only three years; one term—ATSIC has been streamlined, with a reduction from 60 to 35 regional councils. This bill will put in place the final stage of that streamlining process and it dictates the new roles and responsibilities the elected councillors will have.

         The Australian Electoral Commission has noted that the much greater interest in this round of ATSIC elections has had one beneficial side effect—that is, it has increased the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the electoral roll. It is estimated that an additional 6,000 indigenous Australians have enrolled to vote. I think it is also pleasing to note that of the 2,001 nominations for the elections, 700 are women. This represents an increase of 35 per cent over the 1990 figure.

         Regional and national Aboriginal politics are unlikely to be fully representative of Aboriginal aspirations until they are able to reflect the extent of female influence within the Aboriginal population. Despite the outstanding accomplishments of ATSIC's current chairperson, Lois O'Donoghue, media attention to high profile Aboriginal spokespersons might suggest the dominance of males in Aboriginal politics. But it is the women in many Aboriginal communities who become active at the grassroots level to address concerns about housing for their families, the health and education of their children and employment opportunities.

         As is the case with most political structures, the broader collective objectives of higher levels of Aboriginal political activity—whether national, state or even regional—are often seen as being too distant from the day-to-day struggles of people concerned with immediate needs and the allocation of those resources which might be available to satisfy these needs. ATSIC's emphasis on regional representation stands a real chance of overcoming this problem, perhaps more so than our state and federal parliaments. It is in this regional representation that we can increasingly see the position of Aboriginal women reflected in local communities.

         The bill also provides for the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, which will supersede the Torres Strait Regional Council and will have powers and functions similar to the commission.

I assure Senator Boswell that I have noted the arguments he put this evening and I will consider them.

         The principle is that indigenous organisations and representatives should be able to shape policy for their people and not simply manage government programs. They should be able to run cooperative enterprises and administer local government functions for communities which happen to be indigenous. That is what self-determination has come to mean. But it is a political term with no guaranteed legal content. The concept of self-determination must be considered broadly. Indeed, subject to the constitution and laws of the Commonwealth, self-determination ought now to be seen as a non-controversial statement of the legitimate and recognisable aspirations of Aborigines seeking maximum community independence while remaining part of the nation state.

         To this end, it seems appropriate that the enabling act of the commission should include a preamble which outlines the raison d'etre for the commission and provides a framework for its mission. The original ATSIC bill had one. I revisited the history and I know that the Democrats had a role in having that preamble removed. I want to rectify that this evening. That is why I wish to add a further amendment to the government's bill to include such a preamble. The addition of this preamble is not intended to change the overall operation of the act. The preamble I propose takes into account the High Court's decision on native title and acknowledges the indissoluble link between recognition of the rights of indigenous people and the process of reconciliation.

         I congratulate ATSIC on its pivotal role in achieving positive outcomes in the negotiations on the native title bill. This role has demonstrated, as nothing else probably has, that Aboriginal politics have come of age. While there is still much to be achieved as ATSIC goes through an important and next transitionary stage towards becoming even more effective, it is important to acknowledge that it is moving forward all the time. The future of ATSIC, as a force in indigenous affairs, depends on strong community support through the regional councils structure.

         The Australian Democrats support this bill as a continuation of our longstanding commitment to ATSIC as the representative body for indigenous peoples. As I have said before, I think the attacks on ATSIC from indigenous and non-indigenous Australians are basically very unfair. ATSIC has had one term. It is unfair for us to expect a monolithic political view of indigenous people. We do not expect that of ourselves; we are here in our various political parties. I think it is unreasonable for us also to impose on ATSIC higher accountability than any other statutory authority.

Part 28 of the ATSIC bill relates to the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, which will replace the Torres Strait Regional Council.

         Australia has set very high environmental standards relating to the protection of our waters and the marine, animal and plant life contained in those waters. These are standards that we should uphold at all costs and, where necessary, seek to improve and strengthen. Therefore, I am concerned to ensure that if a marine native title claim is successful in either of these areas, which I understand is a distinct possibility, the owners of that marine native title would continue to be bound by all the environmental protection laws and conditions which currently apply in these very sensitive waters.

         I would like to say at the outset that I am definitely not implying that the owners of any marine native title in the Torres Strait or in the Great Barrier Reef area do not or will not share these objectives of upholding our environmental protection record. There is no doubt that people of Aboriginal and Islander descent care very much for our environment and have a great affinity with the land and our waters. However, I am concerned about equality before the law of all Australians.

         In the light of the ambiguous and confusing answers that I have received through the estimates process, I am concerned that a different set of environmental protection laws could apply to holders of marine native title.

         At the first hearing of Estimates Committee E on September 21 I asked: if the Torres Strait Regional Authority is established, who will have the ultimate responsibility for environmental controls in the Torres Strait, particularly in the event of a claim for marine native title being accepted? The answer that I received via the Attorney-General's Department was:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The existence of any marine native title could have implications for the exercise by the Torres Strait Regional Authority of functions in relation to environmental and other matters. In particular, powers in relation to environmental matters would have to be exercised in a non-discriminatory manner. That is, any native title holders would have to be accorded the same rights and procedures as those accorded to any other interest holders in the area. Further, the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority would also need to comply with any requirements in relation to dealings with native title areas that are contained in the Government's proposed legislative response to the High Court's Mabo decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the receipt of this answer, on 4 November I sought clarification as to this advice and asked which environmental powers of the Torres Strait Regional Authority the Attorney-General's Department was referring to. In an answer provided on notice by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, I was advised that the functions of the authority, as set out in the bill, would not extend to controls currently in place with regard to the environment and fishing and would not entitle the authority to act inconsistently with the environmental legislation administered by the department. But while this is encouraging, on the very next page the clarification I sought from the Attorney-General's Department states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If environmental functions were to be conferred on the Torres Strait Regional Authority then, irrespective of the source of any such powers and functions, their exercise by the authority in respect of any marine native title holders would have to be non-discriminatory for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Once the proposed Commonwealth Native Title legislation commences operation, they will have to be exercised in accordance with it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whether a particular environmental law applied to any marine native titleholders would depend on the terms of the particular legislation. If in its terms it did apply, then to be valid it would need to satisfy the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph. Assuming that it did, then any native marine titleholders would have to comply with the law.

         On the face of it, I think that this answer from the Attorney-General's Department raises more questions than it answers. While I understand the issue of traditional hunting and fishing and other similar issues where indigenous Australians are allowed to continue, within limits, traditional hunting of endangered species—like dugongs, for example—I am concerned that this answer from the Attorney-General's Department implies that other laws, like those relating to pollution controls, might not apply if somehow they were seen to be discriminatory against indigenous Australians under the Racial Discrimination Act.

I will be seeking further information and advice in the coming months. I certainly would have liked more time to be able to examine this advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The answer was delivered to my office only some time on Friday so I have not had time to examine it any further. However, I will be pursuing this issue along with other information that I have received through the estimates process relating to marine native title, environmental controls in the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the discussion regarding self-government in the Torres Strait. I believe that these issues are of concern to all Australians. I simply wish to place on record my interest in this area.

I think it was Senator Kernot who mentioned that we want to put on ATSIC a higher degree of accountability than we put on someone else, but she did not put forward any argument as to why she believed that. I have never proposed putting a higher degree of accountability on anyone than I am prepared to accept myself. As I have said before, Senator Kernot and Senator Chamarette will have their chance next year, but they should not accuse me—or my colleagues, for that matter—of trying to impose a higher degree of accountability on ATSIC than we impose on anyone else.

         —I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill that is currently before us. I do so because this evening on the channel 7 news there was a very important feature news item in the section called `Money Matters' that related to the implications that could flow from the native title Mabo legislation and also the current situation with regard to the various audits that are being very properly conducted into the operation of the Northern Land Council and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in the Northern Territory. In the context of that interview this evening, the director of the Northern Land Council, Mr Darryl Pearce, made a number of comments that very specifically addressed the issues of audit.

         I was also interviewed in that particular program. I alluded to the fact that it had been necessary very recently, arising from the considerations of the Senate estimates committees during this year, to refer a very important audit reference to the Auditor-General with regard to a number of very unsatisfactory financial arrangements of both the Northern Land Council and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account.

         During this year, Walter and Turnbull, consultants to ATSIC, have now made two very significant audit reports to ATSIC on the implications of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account which concern me greatly because they affect many constituents in the Northern Territory. I am sure that Senator Collins would share my concerns about the operation of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in the last few years, particularly the issues that have been addressed in that fundamental report of Walter and Turnbull where millions of dollars that is directly the property of Aboriginal people have gone in funny ways and not been properly accounted for.

         The Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, whilst it flows through consolidated revenue, is really the accumulation of mining royalties that are very properly the private ownership of the Aboriginal traditional owners. Because a certain proportion of those funds flows to the land councils in the Northern Territory for their administration, it is concerning when the auditors then identify that, because of either lousy administration or perhaps more serious considerations, millions of dollars of funds are, in effect, siphoned off and are not then available to the traditional owners directly or for the operation of Aboriginal communities specifically in the Northern Territory.

         I had early discussions with the Australian National Audit Office as it was setting in place the preliminary audit and I know the range of issues it will be addressing. I am very hopeful that the Auditor-General's report will be tabled in this parliament before we rise in December. As I said earlier, that report is fundamental because it goes to the core of millions of dollars that are not flowing properly for the individual benefits of Aboriginal traditional owners and Aboriginal communities for grants.

         In addressing this legislation specifically, I look particularly at page 5 dealing with amendments relating to the functions of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. I am well aware that my colleague Senator Troeth will be moving a number of amendments to beef up this area so that the specific areas of audit should embrace those that relate to a regional council. This is most important. I would like to have seen the whole section go much further, particularly with regard to the audits of the land councils that operate in the Northern Territory under the provisions of the Aboriginal land rights act and also to the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account itself. Unfortunately, at this stage it was not appropriate to move that as an amendment.

         I would certainly urge Mr Pearce, the Director of the Northern Land Council, and Mr David Ross, the Director of the Central Land Council, to very carefully take note of the functions that have now been added to the Office of Evaluation and Audit under ATSIC, to be very mindful of those powers and, in response to the Auditor-General's report that will be tabled here this year, to consider further legislation that may be necessary. As I said in my opening remarks, I was concerned at the exclusive and proprietary interests that Mr Darryl Pearce attempted to take tonight in the debate. I do not think there is any need for any Aboriginal leader or person to get precious on this particular issue particularly where issues have been identified, through the process of audit, as being of very major concern.

         —I will address briefly a couple of substantive concerns that were raised by Senator Boswell and Senator Ferguson. Senator Boswell raised the question of the government's position on a potential form of self-government for the Torres Strait Islands. I can assure Senator Boswell that the government has not taken a policy position on what that might be. I would imagine that a great deal of discussion and consultation with the communities in the Torres Strait will have to occur before the government moves to a position on that.

But it should not be confused—and I am sure Senator Boswell is not confusing it—with any proposition to provide a form of self-government for the Torres Strait Islands. The government does not have a position on that at this time.

         In respect of the very important question that Senator Ferguson raised of conservation laws, I did not note anything inconsistent in the advice that Senator Ferguson read out. In fact, that advice confirms my own understanding of the primacy of these laws. The reference, of course, to not being applied in a discriminatory way in respect of the Racial Discrimination Act is correct; that is, that conservation laws which apply to all people in Australia will apply to Aboriginal people in a non-discriminatory way. So the RDA does not have any impact on that. I can assure Senator Ferguson that native title rights to hunt, gather and fish will be subject to normal conservation restrictions. I have provided, if not the Senate then a committee of the Senate, with that advice previously. That is the case.

         —The Racial Discrimination Act does not have any particular application to conservation laws. The RDA simply says that one cannot discriminate against a group of people in a way which is racially based. Providing that the conservation laws apply to everyone else in Australia in that same way, they will apply to Aboriginal people. That will not be a breach of the RDA if that is the case. If a conservation restriction applies to Aboriginal people, providing that that restriction applies in precisely the same way to any other group of people in the Australian community, it will not offend the RDA.

         The one thing I would say in conclusion on that point, though—and I do not think a lot of people realise this yet—is that there will be a raft of consequential legislation required to be passed by the states and territories following the passage, which I hope will be speedy, of the Native Title Bill through the parliament. There are a number of laws that will be immediately and obviously affected, a classic example being the Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. Others include the deeds of grant and trust legislation in Queensland; the Pitjantjatjara lands legislation in South Australia; the sacred sites legislation, and so on. Legislation will need to be examined by all states and territories—and the Commonwealth will certainly be encouraging them to do so; not that I think they need any encouragement—and the Commonwealth also, over the next one or two years, will be examining all of its own legislation to ensure that that legislation also is brought into accordance with the provisions of the native title act.

Mr Holding quite rightly pointed to the raft of legal cases and generations of lawyers enriched by the provisions relating to interstate trade in the Australian constitution.

The original bill, which I have read—I have not caught up with the amendments yet—then goes further to make it clear that that right, so-called, is subservient to any other interest in the land. Then, to top it off, just in case people think that is giving Aboriginal people too much of a fair go, at the end of that division, it gives the minister the right to even extinguish completely those rights of Aboriginal people in accordance with `for any purpose' under any law of Western Australia simply by the publication of a notice. With the greatest respect to Senator Panizza, what the Mabo legislation in Western Australia says is that Aboriginal people have the right to walk around the place until somebody says they should not, and then they cannot. It is obnoxious indeed and does not, I am afraid, provide the simplicity that Senator Panizza thinks it does. In my view, it will be successfully struck down by challenge to the High Court, which means it does not give anybody the certainty that they are looking for—which the Commonwealth bill does.

         But, to return again to the substantive question raised by Senator Ferguson—and it is an important question—the Commonwealth will be reviewing all of its legislation and the states and territories will have to review all of theirs over the next one or two years to ensure that those acts are, so far as possible, consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act.

         I concur with the views expressed by Senator Kernot and probably also by Senator Chamarette, although I regret that I did not hear what Senator Chamarette had to say. I congratulate ATSIC on what I think has been an impressive record in its first term of office in administering the portfolio that it administers on behalf of Aboriginal people of Australia. I think it has done it exceedingly well. I believe, along with other senators in this chamber, that the passage of this last package of amendments to the ATSIC legislation will help it to do that a lot better. I know that there will be more intense interest in the ATSIC elections this time around than ever before, as other senators have mentioned. That is something we should all welcome.

But I think the amendment which has been moved by Senator Kernot has picked up some of the drafting difficulties we discovered in Senator Chamarette's amendment earlier today, and I am sure that Senator Chamarette will be quite relaxed about having her amendment not supported in favour of Senator Kernot's amendment.

I guess we all do from time to time on things like the republic and we attach that to the year 2000 as well. It seems to be a handy year to attach all sorts of things to. The only thing I know for certain about the year 2000 is that I will be considerably older than I am now, if alive. I am not certain on anything else about it.

         In general terms, the question is, with respect, premature by a long way. There are a host of constitutional and legislative procedures that would need to be examined.

         For example, whether the matter needed to be addressed by referendum would depend on whether the decision taken by the government at the end of the day had any constitutional implications. At this point there is no reason to presume that that would be the case. In fact, my own view—for what it is worth, and it is worth as much as Mr Tickner's at the moment, considering that the matter has not come to cabinet—would be that the government would be very loath to propose any solution that would require constitutional amendment. I will tell the Senate what grounds I have for saying that, I think, with some authority.

         When the Christmas and Cocos Islands elected to become part of the Australian community, constitutional considerations prevented those territories being incorporated into the state of Western Australia. I do not remember the detail of the constitutional advice but I certainly saw it at the time. It was a matter of constitutional convenience that the territories had to be incorporated for electoral purposes into the territories of either the ACT or the Northern Territory.

         The first amendment is that this second part will take effect from 1 July 1996. Senator Chamarette's original amendment took effect from the beginning of 1994. This would have affected the coming December elections because the last stage of those elections, which is the election of the zone commissioners, would not have happened until February 1994. It was not intended by Senator Chamarette, I think, that this should take effect until the next round of elections in 1996.

I would particularly like to ask members of the board how to deal with the problem of the reduction of numbers because I know, in consultation with ATSIC, that we have not found an easy solution to the situation in which when the chairperson is elected the zone from which he or she comes will not have its zone commissioner. Therefore, it is desirable to have a by-election or a casual vacancy so that the chairperson can be an ambassador at large for ATSIC and then the zone from which the chairperson comes will still be represented by another commissioner. We could not arrive at an agreed upon position whereby, if the chairperson were to retire halfway through his or her term, the person filling the casual vacancy may come from a zone different from the next elected commissioner. That is something that I want to take up with the new board of commissioners when it meets next February. I am moving this amendment now, in November, when I was intending to move it in February next year.

         —As I said during the second reading debate, the government is as concerned as the opposition about accountability for ATSIC to the point where I think more scrupulous accountability provisions have been provided for ATSIC than have been provided for many other organisations. The difficulty we have with the proposal of Senator Troeth is not so much its accountability ramifications but its unworkability. Frankly, I did not think the opposition would press this amendment because of the horrendous implications that it involves in terms of administrative unworkability and, I might add, sheer cost. It is just out of all proportion to the alleged benefit that would be received.

         Clause 1 of the amendment deals with regional councils. I make the obvious point that regional councils are not actually in receipt of grants from ATSIC. They consider how those grants are to be spent, but apart from their own relatively small operating budgets, the regional councils themselves are not recipients of these grants. They are simply conduits for the grants to be sent out to the recipients and clause 2 of the amendment covers all of those people.

         The government proposals currently before the Senate allow the minister—a power he does not currently have—or the commission to request the Office of Evaluation and Audit to evaluate or audit the activities of grant and/or loan recipients. That already exists in what the government is putting to the Senate. What the opposition's amendment does is make those audits from the Office of Evaluation and Audit mandatory. I see Senator Troeth nodding in agreement.

         There is a difficulty with that. ATSIC currently provides around 6,000 grants or loans a year to approximately 1,500 organisations, all of which are subject to financial scrutiny. In fact, the grants cannot be provided unless the organisations are subject to financial scrutiny. Every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation is required by its incorporating legislation to have its books of accounts audited every year. Those organisations are required to provide a copy of their audited financial statements to the commission as a condition of the grant. Unless they provide proper audited accounts, they do not get the money. Organisations which do not comply with the requirement cannot receive any funding until they comply.

         The Office of Evaluation and Audit, which Senator Troeth wants to visit with this responsibility, currently has a staff of about 20 people, and utilises external consultants. With that staff of 20, and utilising external consultants, during 1992-93 the office was able to conduct about 40 audits and complete eight evaluations of ATSIC programs and offices. I might add that this is an additional audit. The organisations themselves, I stress again, have to provide proper audited statements or they do not receive the grants in the first place. But the Office of Evaluation and Audit, with 20 staff and external consultants, did carry out 40 audits and eight evaluations of ATSIC programs and offices.

         If the office was required, as this amendment will ensure that it will be, to conduct an additional 1,500 audits a year, whether they were needed or not, it would require in the order of an additional 200 staff to be employed, plus infrastructure, costing in excess—I think this has been a conservative estimate—of $15 million. The proposed coalition amendment, therefore, is clearly impractical. It is unworkable and unnecessary. That is why I am surprised that it is even being pressed. The current government proposals allow the minister to call in that office and request an audit to be done where necessary, on top of all the arrangements that are currently in place, as I have said. It makes no sense to expend this enormous amount of additional money or employ these additional people on the requirement of mandatory additional audits by this office to what literally would be hundreds, if not a thousand, organisations.

         The amendment currently before the Senate is already a major enhancement of the accountability of ATSIC funded organisations. The OEA cannot at present audit the activities of any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation and the government proposals ensure that that can be done when it is necessary. Concerns about individual organisations can be, and are, raised from time to time in the Senate, the House of Representatives and the committees of either house of parliament. If these concerns are raised with the minister and are given public scrutiny and the minister believes that to involve the office would assist in the clarification of these issues the minister can do that.

We are awaiting—I can assure Senator Tambling with as much interest from me as from him—the report of the councils which will be lodged, I hope, in a couple of weeks time. To require by rote, as this amendment does, those additional audits where they are not necessary would, as I say, require the expenditure of around $15 million of public money totally unnecessarily and the employment of a further 200 people.

         Under the government's proposals, any organisation which accepts ATSIC funds will henceforth be obliged to agree that it may be subject to OEA audit if either the commission or the minister have cause for concern. I might add, in conclusion, that I think the way that has been carefully constructed, with the greatest respect to the desire of the opposition, which we share—that is, to ensure the most scrupulous accounting requirements—involves ATSIC in a significant degree of initial responsibility in that under the government's proposals for optional audit by this office, ATSIC has the power itself to ask for these audits to be carried out without the minister even requiring them to be carried out.

         —I agree with Senator Collins that the opposition's amendments are unwieldy and unnecessary. I will take a couple of minutes to quote from a very illuminating speech by Mr Fred Chaney, entitled `Accountability in the Aboriginal Domain', in which he sets to rest some of the claims that members of the opposition are frequently making about the need for greater accountability in Aboriginal affairs generally. He expresses the view:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Community concern about accountability is on the rise, expenditures on Aboriginal programs are large and, usually in public administration these days, rising. Outcomes are widely criticised by the media, by politicians, by Aboriginals and by taxpayers and other members of the public. At the same time significant moves are being made both within and without ATSIC for increased Aboriginal control of the agenda. There is a new group of very competent Aboriginal people who along with veterans like Charles Perkins, are determined to use government programs and funds to create a long term independent economic base for Aboriginal Australians. The Federal government of the day, through its establishment of ATSIC and annually increased funding allocation to it supports the self management of Aboriginal persons, in its rhetoric it acknowledges their right to self determination as well as recognition of their indigenous cultural heritage. Self evidently some of these commitments lead into uncharted and unpredictable circumstances from an administrative viewpoint. But at the same time ATSIC commits itself to "ensuring the highest possible standards of accountability for the administration of public funds, (2) a commitment which the most cursory examination of its procedures shows it takes very seriously indeed. And even if it did not want to do so, what choice does it have with the vast array of checkers looking over the metaphorical ATSIC shoulder, each ready to condemn any failure.

        It should be stressed that there is nothing new in this trend towards greater accountability. Over a long period in parliament a number of people, but particularly Senator Grant Tambling of the Northern Territory, have raised a series of allegations about maladministration in the old Department of Aboriginal Affairs and in Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) during the 1980's. The Fraser Government having established the Aboriginal Development Commission in 1980 with a very significant reduction in the extent of ministerial control and oversight—

        the then Minister, Gerry Hand, told the parliament "There is no other department or statutory authority in existence in the Commonwealth which will be as accountable as ATSIC".

       <para>
        Well, I think the challenge remains. Who on the opposition side can meet that challenge today? Where is there any organisation under this government or any other government which will be as accountable as ATSIC? The last part that I will quote is whether we:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

States receive all manner of special funding to meet the needs of their disadvantaged Aboriginal citizens.

         I have seen a number of projects where the money was impeccably accounted for but was a complete waste of taxpayers' money. I have been on the receiving end myself. Some years ago, I suppose 19 years ago—nobody in this chamber will remember it—I was accused of losing $55,000 of funding for training and education. I did not lose it; I invested it. I was not prepared to see that money expended because I knew that there was another program of trade union training. It was state government money. Muggins that I was, I saved it; I invested it for the state government in order to acquit it at the end of the year.

It seemed to me that maybe it was not appropriate for the minister, as well as ATSIC, to determine when an audit should take place. That may put a question mark in some people's minds about a particular scheme which may be running quite well. Having heard what the minister said about that—we have no alternative but to listen to and consider what the minister says, particularly as to the cost involved in any amendment that is put forward in this place—we probably have to consider whether, whilst the intention is perfectly legitimate, the cost of this particular exercise will far outweigh the benefits.

        This is an improved version of the preamble which was removed from the original ATSIC bill. Some of the main features of this preamble are that it recognises the role of the Commonwealth government in making special laws for people of Aboriginal race. It talks about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were the inhabitants of Australia before European settlement and how they were progressively dispossessed of their lands. It makes mention of real and lasting reconciliation and overcoming the disadvantages of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to facilitate their enjoyment of their culture. It is consistent with the aims of self-management and self-sufficiency. It makes mention of ensuring maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of programs.

         The preamble also makes mention of enabling Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to increase their economic status, to promote their social well-being and to improve the provision of community services. It refers to Australia's international standards for protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other standard setting instruments. I am pleased to move that this preamble, which was not able to be included in the original bill, be included in the amending bill.

For example, presentations were recently made to a delegation from the National Congress of Chile which had an interest in Australia's anti-money laundering and anti-drug measures and to a visiting delegation of the Directorate of anti-Mafia Investigations (DIA), Italy.
