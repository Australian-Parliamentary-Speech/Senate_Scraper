         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the government's part backdown on the pensioner shares issue in the face of the protest of thousands of Australia's senior citizens. Do the minister and his government not understand that the government's latest policy position will still discourage the elderly from investing in shares?  How can that be in the interest of pensioners, or in the national interest, when national savings are so low?

         —When one looks at the claims that have been made over the course of the last year as to the profound effect on sales of shares that the government's decision would have, one has to say that those profound effects simply did not occur. The number of people who were supposed to sell simply did not. It does not mean that some did not, but the extraordinary claims that people in here were making as to the rate of the sell-off were never attained.

         What it now means is that pensioners will be able to look at a whole range of investments, including the buying of shares, which will be treated in exactly the same way. The government has always been of the view that that is equitable. There has always been a problem in being able to invest in the kind of investment that has shares as part of a portfolio and have it treated in one way and then having an opportunity to buy shares directly and have them treated differently. What the decision last year sought to do was to make the treatment of shares consistent in every respect. It did, in fact, achieve that.

         As a result of the representations that have been made to the government—and they were made, as I said yesterday, by many people in the caucus who expressed their views on it, not simply this week but over the course of time—the government made the announcement last night that shares acquired before 18 August 1992 will now be exempted from the measure. I think that that decision more than adequately addresses the concerns of those in the caucus that have been expressed over the last 12 months. As far as the government is concerned, the matter rests there.

In doing so, by the end of this financial year we will have approved some 8,000 people from former Yugoslavia coming to Australia under a special humanitarian program. We have been able to do that with the support not only of all sides of this parliament but also the broader community, particularly the community that represents the interests of those people from former Yugoslavia.

         We have also recognised that once people are in Australia there is a need for culturally sensitive torture and trauma counselling. We do this not just for people from former Yugoslavia but for refugees from whatever part of the world they come. In this particular instance we can see almost nightly the sorts of devastating experiences that the ongoing conflict in former Yugoslavia is presenting and the particular need of those who come to this country resulting from those experiences.

         As a consequence, at a meeting in June this year with the state and federal ministers for immigration and ethnic affairs, I reached an agreement with the New South Wales minister, Mr Photios, to provide additional funding on a matching grant basis to assist the New South Wales service for the treatment and rehabilitation of torture and trauma survivors, STARTTS. The aim of the offer was to provide bi-cultural counselling for victims of torture and trauma from the Bosnian region in particular.

         The offer was also available to Victoria. The parliamentary secretary to the Premier, Mr Honeywood, indicated at that meeting that Victoria would be interested in taking it up. As a consequence, the offer on the table from the federal government was that both STARTTS and the Victorian equivalent—the Victorian Foundation for the Survivors of Torture Incorporated—should, on receipt of a detailed application, receive a one-year special grant of up to $35,000 each to assist survivors of torture and trauma from the Bosnian region of former Yugoslavia. That comes on top of other funding we make available—some $400,000 to the national torture and trauma network, under grant in aid and migrant access project schemes, as well as some $900,000 to the 19 grants in aid that are provided for community based organisations to assist those who come from former Yugoslavia. We recognise the acute need of those from the Bosnian region; as a consequence that offer was on the table.

         As I said, New South Wales has indicated that it is ready to provide the additional service. However, I am disappointed that some two months after the ministerial meeting, despite the interest of his parliamentary secretary, the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, has still to agree to provide a matching grant to this most deserving service. I find it very hard to understand Mr Kennett's difficulty in taking up this particular offer. My officers tell me that, reportedly, he feels that since the states do not decide who is allowed to settle permanently in the states—in this case the state of Victoria—the Victorian government should not be responsible for meeting the settlement costs that follow. I find this quite a stunning response, particularly when we take into account the fact that the amount of money we are talking about is much less than the cost of the reintroduction of silver service in the Victorian parliament.

That remains the case, and it has been reiterated by Mr Brereton to the ACTU this morning. Those opposite who are enthusiastically waiting for us to institute a change that will allow wage cutting and the slashing of working conditions of Australian workers will have to wait a long time.

Their task is to conduct a comprehensive and independent assessment of the complex issues arising from the review's wide-ranging terms of reference.

         Australia is not the only country to have legislation similar to that in part X and an appreciation of overseas experience also is an important part of the review. I have encouraged the review panel not to compromise the thoroughness of its report by feeling obliged to strictly comply with the six months time frame originally envisaged for the review. Whilst this is likely to put back slightly the 31 October reporting date to later this year, it reflects the degree of participation there has been in the review by the shipping community and its vital interest in its outcome. I urge anyone with an interest in Australia's international shipping services to make his views known as soon as possible to the review secretariat, if he has not already done so.

         The statistics that are available do not make it possible to be precise about the absolute dollar value of private sector support. However, corporate sector sponsorship of the arts in 1992, excluding film production and heritage activity, has been estimated at about $57 million, with an additional $3.1 million being spent on the acquisition of art works. Of course, there is private sector support in areas like investment in film and television, bequests and loans to public galleries.

         One of the significant things we need to look at which is a cause of some concern and which policy makers—private and public—need to consider is that of the $57 million corporate sector sponsorship, nearly $15 million went to music, but less than $1 million went to literature. That is important for us to consider in terms of the development of the partnership between ourselves and the private sector. There are various ways we can respond to that. We do not have a particular policy intention at the moment, but I think it is a very important issue to flag. It does have consequences for the distribution of funding to the arts in Australia because if it were solely private sector driven, we would get a substantial redistribution towards some art forms and away from others.

         Some companies in Australia have taken outstanding initiatives. I recently had the opportunity to relaunch the Australian Art Foundation for Moet and Chandon, which has been very supportive in the visual arts. It has extended it in time and broadened its scope in a way which I greatly welcome. This sort of private sector support for the arts is encouraged by the government through tax deductibility, through the Film Finance Corporation and through indemnity schemes, et cetera. As a result of this budget and two more of the election promises which we kept, we will be introducing legislation to provide tax deductibility for major donations, for bequests to galleries, museums and libraries and for private owners of heritage listed buildings.

         I have also seen some very interesting figures recently. A large amount of understandable passion has been generated here about the decline in the consumption of wine since 1986. As I recall, the figure is alleged to be 14 per cent. However, what has not been cited is that the overall consumption of alcohol in Australia has gone down by 14 1/2 per cent in that time. Perhaps this is due to the switch towards low alcohol formulation. It is hard to see the correlation between the decline in consumption of wine and any increase in sales tax. The correlation does not seem to be established.

         The logic that one can extrapolate from and say that those will be the consequences for the wine industry is hard to establish. Even Senator Short—because he is a little more economically literate than some, although perhaps not as much as he wishes—was acknowledging yesterday that one of the impacts of the changes in tax on wine would be a substitution effect rather than a reduction. The logic of that position is that if there is a substitution effect there will be offsetting increases elsewhere.

         Clearly, there will be some market pressure to encourage people to shift from cars using leaded petrol to ones using unleaded petrol. Senator Coulter said in his question that 20 to 25 per cent of the cars on the road would still be using leaded petrol; I do not know whether that means immediately or whether he is talking about in a few years time. I will certainly try to get some more information about the projections for the percentages of cars using leaded petrol over, say, the rest of this decade.

This $10,000 increase in the cost of freight will add around $3 to the average trolley load of groceries throughout Australia.

         A lot of work has been done over the last few years on freight cost increases in the various regions because of the original recommendations that were made by the Inter-State Commission in respect of vehicle registration charges. I am sure Senator Boswell will remember that exercise. The Inter-State Commission found, I think correctly, that there was a significant oversupply of freight capacity in the road transport industry, principally because of the relatively low capital cost of getting into that industry, and attempted to redress that situation by providing fairly high levels of vehicle registration charges.

         I have not had time to do any precise calculation region to region because it is quite a complicated job. But, from my own examination of that original research work, I would estimate that the increase in freight costs as a result of the full cost of the excise increases would be in the order of 2.5 per cent. On average, across Australia freight comprises about 5 per cent of the total cost of goods on the shelf. So the eventual impact will be 2.5 per cent of 5 per cent. The Treasury estimate is that as a result of the budget measures there will be, in the first instance, an increase in the CPI of about 0.2 per cent and then finally of about 0.5 per cent.

Yes, I am aware of the reports about the development of a process, as the result of collaboration between CSIRO and a company called Peptide Technology, that may slow the ageing process in human cells. A substance known as carnosine is present at high levels in human tissues, particularly muscle and brain, but its function is unknown.

         As I said, the function of carnosine is largely unknown. However, it appears it prevents what is known as crosslinking of proteins to sugars. It is this crosslinking which is implicated in many ageing process, including skin wrinkling, hardening of the arteries and other degenerative diseases.

         There has been reference to sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act. That certainly is a section where restraint of trade actions can be taken if boycotts or secondary boycotts occur.

         Indeed, sections 45D and E are fairly poor transcriptions of what existed as civil law remedies anyway. The entrancement that members opposite have about that section of the Trade Practices Act is an entrancement because they invented it. Whether it works efficiently is another matter and, as I say, an impressive body of legal opinion has it that it does not work all that effectively and that the civil law would be a better remedy.

         The notoriety of that particular avenue does not mean to say there would be no remedies. It that avenue were repealed and industrial relations taken out of the Trade Practices Act, as this government believes they should be, it would not mean that if restraint of trade actions were being taken which involved industrial actions, there would not be legal remedies. There would be. Because of that, the government feels able to say that we do not support the trans-Tasman accord. The repeal of sections 45D and E is consistent with that statement and, should actions be taken, the rights of companies that may feel aggrieved are at large and can be pursued.

         As I said in answer to an earlier question from Senator Jones, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round would mean to the global economy something like an income boost of $200 billion a year and to the Australian economy an income boost of $2.5 billion a year.

         To confuse the rules under which trade should be conducted fairly, openly and transparently with what are the appropriate standards of environmental protection, the appropriate standards of labour regulation or the appropriate standards in any other field of social endeavour, is to try to apply to a set of rules which ensure the game is played fairly a set of subjective judgments about the quality of environmental conditions which those rules do not involve. To distort trade by using environmental arguments which result in one country applying to a sovereign other country its idea of what is a reasonable standard, not only violates, to some extent, the sovereign rights of the second country, but also, in the classic way in which this is used, gives force to greater protectionism and prevents freer trade.

         This is a government that has a high reputation in terms of protection of the environment. It is a reputation from which we in no way resile. We intend to maintain our standards of environmental excellence in this country, but we do not confuse that by imposing those standards on someone else for a trade benefit to distort free trade flows. I am quite happy to consult widely; I always do.

The Australian advanced air traffic system project will provide a fully integrated national air traffic control system for the first time in this country. The CAA has taken steps to ensure that local companies are given every opportunity to participate in the TAAATS project and to establish longer term arrangements with the successful prime contractor. Australian industry involvement is one of the four major criteria against which the two contactors' proposals for TAAATS will be evaluated.

          That document, which I now table, is an opinion dated 12 August 1993 from Mr George Witynski of the Office of General Counsel in the Attorney-General's Department to Mr Keith Byles, the Senior Assistant Parliamentary Counsel of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. That advice was in response to a request from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel as to whether an amendment to section 6 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of tax would be a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the constitution.

          In tabling this document, I want to make just a couple of points clearly for the record. Firstly, I am told that, apart from Mr Rose's opinion, there is no other advisory documentation in existence that was prepared in the context of the present bill. There also is no documentation in existence on other questions that the committee may wish to consider—for example, whether the various complex provisions of this bill could constitutionally be combined.

          The fact that this is so is simply because, I am told, such advice was not considered necessary, the OPC regarding the applicable law is quite clear. If the amendment to section 6 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act was not a bill imposing a tax—that is to say, the particular matter in respect of which it did seek advice—the question in its mind of the legality of combining the provisions simply did not arise. As I explained to the Senate at the time, Mr Rose's opinion was written in anticipation of the Senate committee and designed to bring conveniently together the various principles that have been accepted and routinely applied by the Attorney-General's Department and the OPC in the drafting of revenue legislation.

          The second and final point I make is that the tabling of this advice should not be taken as a precedent binding the government henceforth to comply with requests to table documents of this or, indeed, any other kind. We will look at any such case on its own merits, having regard to the appropriate principles of confidentiality and public interest immunity. In this case, taking into account that there were no issues raised by this document other than the technical legal questions at the heart of the Senate committee's inquiry, I make no objection and table the document accordingly.

         I do not want take up the time of the Senate unnecessarily, but I think a confusing element has just arisen out of what the minister has just said. I have called for a copy of the opinion of Mr Rose that was tabled in the Senate the other day. As I recall, he said that that written opinion was further to his previous preliminary advice. In the first line of Mr Rose's opinion, he said:

         I have been asked to provide the detailed reasons for my preliminary advice . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         That was advice relating to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. I therefore find it surprising that the minister said that there is no other written advice and that there was no advice sought on the constitutionality of this bill before it was put before the Senate. Therefore I can only assume that the preliminary advice that Mr Rose is talking about was some verbal advice given after the bill was introduced into parliament—after the budget was put down.

          I know this is not the time for asking questions, but it seems to me that it is important that we clarify what the minister is tabling because there seems to be an inconsistency between what he has just said and what Mr Rose stated in the first line of his previous advice. Pursuant to the motion I have moved, I wonder whether the minister will clarify that situation.

In short, my understanding of the situation is that there was no documentary written advice prepared by Mr Rose, or indeed by anybody else, other than the document I have tabled, in the context of the actual drafting of the legislation. When the question of the constitutionality of the bill, as introduced, came in issue, there was certainly quite a sequence of communication between the Attorney-General's office and Mr Rose seeking advice as to the state of play—if Senator Hill is interested in listening—on the various matters that were squarely in the public domain as a result of that bill.

There is no mystery about the process by which the bill was prepared and the advice that was taken into account while it was being prepared. No doubt the committee will have ample opportunities to explore that.

If this is regular practice, we would like an elaboration of it because, at first blush, it with would seem to be explicitly contrary to the express provisions of section 55. If it is not regular practice, is the minister suggesting to the parliament that this was simply an initiative taken by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel without any input from the government? In other words, is he suggesting there was no canvassing of the possible constitutional difficulties that might arise from this tacking exercise?

        It is very telling that Senator Richardson admitted in the chamber today that the Labor caucus has been expressing concern about the harsh, inequitable measure for 12 months. That is news to us. We have had three or four opportunities in this chamber when we have put up amendments to legislation and when a private member's bill went through here—I think Senator Harradine spoke on it and the Australian Democrats supported it—but not one murmur did we hear from the other side. Not one person from the other side supported or spoke on that issue. Yet Senator Richardson has the audacity to come in here and tell us that for 12 months the caucus has been expressing concern about it.

         Let me also say that the pensioners to whom we have been talking were not aware of it either. They could not see any support coming from it and the correspondence that they were getting was that there would be no negotiation on this and no change. It was very enlightening to have Senator Richardson tell us that this morning, because we saw no evidence of that at any time. We gave the government repeated opportunities to repeal this unjust legislation. The question should be asked: was the government really expressing concern over 12 months or was the expression of concern generated when the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs started moving around the countryside? We saw hundreds of pensioners turn out to those Senate hearings to give support to the issue and the concern that the coalition and the Democrats had expressed.

         I put to Senator Richardson that the Labor caucus has not been expressing concern over this measure for 12 months. Last night the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) announced his second partial backdown on this issue within the last month. Less than a month ago the minister announced that the rate of return on pensioner shares would be capped at 50 per cent. Now the government has decided that this inequitable measure will apply only to shares which have been purchased since the 1992 budget. This announcement is of absolutely no comfort to the thousands of pensioners and veterans who have sold their shares in order to escape the government's planned income test. We have the announcement being made three weeks prior to it coming into effect.

         —Senator Coulter is right: it is too late. These pensioners and veterans have merely followed the advice of the government. The minister's own parliamentary secretary, Mr Sciacca, has repeatedly told pensioners that the way to get around the income test is to sell part of their share portfolio. This was the advice of the Department of Social Security in its own submission to the Senate inquiry.

         These people who have done so have been severely disadvantaged. They may have to pay capital gains tax. They cannot reinvest in the share market without being caught up in the latest post-1992 budget revamp proposal. If they did what they were told to try to make sure their income was not going to be affected and now get back into the share market, they would be caught up in the system. It must be pointed out that the government's own senators on the Senate inquiry concluded in their report that this share measure was inequitable. They stated:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Overall, the Committee considers that there is inequity in the treatment of listed shares through this measure. It believes that such inequity would need to be addressed in a review of the income and assets tests, and in a review of the function of pension income relative to other income at different stages of life, or different types of need.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not the coalition; this is not other non-government senators—it is the government's own senators saying this. The question must be asked: if this measure is fundamentally inequitable, then how does restricting it to shares that have been purchased after a certain date remove that fundamental inequity, anyway?  It does not. All the reasons that have been given to show that this measure is inequitable apply just as much to shares that are purchased after the 1992 budget as they do to shares purchased before the 1992 budget. In fact, it could be argued that this latest revamp proposal is even more inequitable because it differentiates between shares that have been purchased before and after an arbitrarily decided date. So we have two groups of pensioners now.

         One must also ask whether the pensioner shares measure as it currently stands will derive sufficient savings to offset the costs entailed in setting up and administering the income test. The decrease in the amount of money pensioners will get hardly covers the administrative costs. I call on the government to look again at this inequitable measure and I tell the government that what it has done is not enough. All the government has to do is pass the Senate private member's bill that is sitting on the table in the House of Representatives and it will solve the problem.

        There is no doubt that Australia has been extremely slow in addressing the problem of lead in petrol and the consequences in terms of the intellectual development of Australia's children. Some estimates suggest that some 44 per cent of Australian children may have impaired intelligence development as a direct consequence of the intake of lead, and principally the intake of lead which comes from the internal combustion engine. We have been very slow in adopting much lower levels of lead, despite the fact that evidence has been available for some 18 to 20 years linking levels of lead in children with impaired intellectual development.

         The government has sought in this budget to introduce a price differential—again something for which the conservation movement has been pushing for a very long time—in an attempt to encourage those people who are capable of using unleaded fuel in their cars to make the shift. We would certainly support this move. However, we disagree totally with the government's intention simply to pass this price differential into general revenue. We believe that there is a marvellous opportunity here to more vigorously address this problem of lead in petrol.

         There is a very adequate alternative to the use of lead in petrol, and that is to use ethanol as an octane enhancer. The addition of 10 per cent ethanol to unleaded petrol of an octane rating of 93 would raise the octane level to 96, and the 96 octane petrol could be used in the vast majority—probably all—of those pre-1986 cars which at the moment require the use of leaded petrol.

         There are considerable advantages in going down this road. Ethanol is pre-eminently a renewable fuel. We have a large number of sources of fermentable material in this country which are currently going to waste. We already have an industry in New South Wales which is making quite large quantities of ethanol from wheat starch. We have an industry in Queensland which is also making ethanol from sugarcane and molasses. Alcohol from these sources is already contained in a very acceptable gasohol fuel in a limited number of service stations.

         Australia also imports some $3.1 billion worth of petroleum each year and, as everybody in this chamber knows, our balance of trade is, to say the least, totally unsatisfactory. More vigorous development of an ethanol industry in this country would not only provide a source of non-greenhouse fuel, a fuel which reduces the general emissions from internal combustion engines in terms of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and unburned hydrocarbons—

Despite what has been said by many government people, I believe that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases is the criterion by which we should judge that.

         I would press the government most strongly to use this opportunity when at long last the problem of lead in petrol is recognised. The government has recognised, hopefully, that there is a solution here because we already have service stations that provide gasohol. The government should recognise that with this budget it has an opportunity to bring these things together and to solve the problem of lead once and for all over the next two years, so that gasohol becomes the fuel which is used by all those cars that currently are running on leaded petrol.

I take exception to Senator Coulter's statement that taking action on leaded fuel will address the lead problem in Australia. As I understand it, a report from the National Health and Medical Research Council identified other sources of lead in our society. Raising additional revenue by taxing leaded fuel will not address the problem of lead in paint which nowadays is being stripped and sanded away and then disappears into the environment.

        I simply wish to bring to the attention of the Senate the conclusive findings of the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies. This is an independent report which finds that the wine tax will result in a loss in employment, exacerbate the economic depression, reduce international competitiveness of Australian wine on the export market, and reduce the profitability of the wine industry and therefore discourage investment. Senator Tierney has already made comment in recent days about the possible discouragement of a $5 million development in the Hunter Valley and I also know of a $3 million possible development in the Nagambie area in Victoria which very possibly will not go ahead because of this new tax.

In this industry there was a zero sales tax rate 10 years ago.

        This is from a government, fellow senators, that is trying to create jobs. Look at the destruction it has wrought by this ill-considered measure. It has cut a booming industry off at the knees. It deserves to be condemned by the Australian people and I call on the Australian Democrats, the Independents and the Greens in the Senate to stop this government with this last measure, to force it into a backdown because it is destroying jobs and it is destroying exports.

       Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations

      </para>

       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.

         The regulations provided for a number of discretions. Regulation 8(2) provides that a statement must specify matters in sufficient detail, while r.11 provides that a payment must not be made unless sufficient information is reasonably available. There do not appear to be any provisions as to who will decide whether matters or information is sufficient or reasonably available. There is a direct discretion r.8(3) to exempt certain statements from being endorsed, signed, dated and numbered. Finally, r.10(8) provides for an effective exemption of up to 10 years from an offence provision.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether the above discretions, the adverse exercise of which could have important consequences, are subject to review of their merits by the AAT.

         The Committee is also concerned at several provisions which may be unfair.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         First, r.10(9) provides that an employee will lose an entitlement if certain action is not taken within 10 years. We would be grateful for your advice on the reason for this period and why it is necessary to provide that the entitlement will be lost.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Secondly, r.12(2) provides that allowances are not payable to a person attending before the Commissioner in the capacity of employer, employee or person representing an employer. This suggests that a person representing an employee will be paid allowance while a person representing an employer will not be paid.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Thirdly, r.13(1) provides that an employer must notify the Commissioner within one month of a change of address of the employer or employee. However, r.13(2) then provides that if notification is not given within the month, then the old address is deemed to be the address for the purposes of the regulations. The Committee asks whether this will result in an employee being disadvantaged by the neglect of an employer.

         Sub regulation 8(2) provides that a superannuation guarantee statement must specify matters set out in the statement in sufficient detail to allow the proper consideration of the statement.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         An employer is required to lodge a superannuation guarantee statement if the employer has a superannuation guarantee shortfall and, therefore, is liable to pay the superannuation guarantee charge. Subsection 33(2) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 sets out the particulars to be included in that statement. Relevantly, subsection 33(3) specifies that the statement must be in a form approved by the Commissioner and lodged in accordance with the Regulations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Subsection 33(2), by listing in detail the items that must be included in the statement, provides an objective standard for whether the statement is in sufficient detail to allow proper consideration of the statement. If the Commissioner concludes that a statement is not in sufficient detail to enable proper consideration and the statement is not amended, the employer would not have "lodged a statement" at all because either:

         Not having lodged a statement as required, the employer would then be assessed on an amount of additional tax (subsections 59(1) and 62(1)). This assessment carries with it all the normal rights of objection and appeal, either to the AAT or to the Federal Court, that attach to any other tax assessment (section 42). The employer would, as part of that process, be able to have the Commissioner's conclusion reviewed by either the AAT or the Federal Court.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The employer would also have a right to have the Federal Court review the Commissioner's decision not to approve the form in which the employer lodged the statement under section 5(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.

         Sub regulation 10(9) provides that, if the request is not lodged with the Commissioner within 10 years, the employee's entitlement to the shortfall component is lost.

         The ten year period was fixed so as to give employees and the CSF ample time to arrange for the crediting of the shortfall component.

         However, this sub regulation represents practice that has been in force for a long time.

         Under the superannuation guarantee scheme the Commissioner's initial contact is with the employer. The employer provides the particulars relating to the employee.

        Very briefly, this report contains our examination of annual reports tabled in the first six months of this year, all of which happen to be on Aboriginal bodies within the Prime Minister's portfolio.

         Firstly, I wish to reiterate what we said in the report: the committee's view is that the Commonwealth Bank, like any other government company, is accountable to parliament. Secondly, I point out that the

         The most important issue that I wish to direct the Senate's attention to is what I regard as quite disgraceful behaviour. Mr Deputy President, you will be aware that there was a merger between the State Bank of Victoria and the Commonwealth Bank. The announcement of this merger was made in a press statement from the then Premier of Victoria, Mrs Joan Kirner, and the then federal Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, on 25 August 1990. I draw the Senate's attention to the assurances that were given in that joint statement by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating. The key paragraph said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Ms Kirner said clear undertakings had been received from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that there would be no compulsory staff retrenchments resulting from the sale of the bank.
       </para>
       <para>
        We put that issue to the officers of the Commonwealth Bank who came before the standing committee in Sydney, which Senator Coates referred to. There was some discussion on that and there was a follow-up response from the bank, which we received quite recently.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Bearing in mind what was announced in that joint press statement by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating, we now learn, in response to a question that was put to the Commonwealth Bank officers, that the bank has said that no assurances were given by the Commonwealth Bank regarding retrenchments arising from the merger. Well, there are assurances and they are the assurances that were given by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We have learnt that in Victoria the total job losses resulting from the merger are now in the order of 3,665 and may well rise to 4,000. Twice the number of people have lost their jobs in this merger compared with when the Nissan car plant was closed down. Its job losses were in the order of 2000. This is an enormously serious situation. We also learnt that there were some 423 compulsory retrenchments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The employees of the former State Bank of Victoria have been dreadfully let down. They have been let down because the promises that were made by Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner have not been kept. I believe why they have not been kept will be a matter for a further inquiry.

       <para first-indent="16">

         As far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned no assurances were given regarding compulsory retrenchments. I have heard from State Bank employees in Victoria that these compulsory retrenchments have caused, in some cases, great personal distress, as one would expect. I note that this is a matter that will not be allowed to rest.

         If the Commonwealth Bank did not give those assurances, we want to know why it did not give them. Did Mr Keating tell the Commonwealth Bank, having managed to have this politically driven merger, this negotiated merger, that the commitments that were given at that stage were no longer operative.

        In `Building On Strength' the government announced as part of its advancement towards a fairer Australia that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a seniors health card.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Soon after, the government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. This bill will meet the second part of that commitment by introducing a seniors health card from 1 July 1994 that will give certain older low income non-pensioner retirees access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and to hearing aid concessions. It is estimated that this initiative will assist 200,000 people.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The payment of pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for persons who had previously received prescriptions free under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At that time, the government decided that as an interim measure, certain persons were to be eligible for payment of advances of that allowance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government has now decided that the period in which advances of payment of pharmaceutical allowance will be payable should be further extended until 31 December 1994. This bill gives effect to that decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since coming to office in 1983, much has been achieved in assisting Australian families. For example, the government introduced the Family Allowance Supplement and later integrated family payments for children so as to reduce poverty traps, improve work incentives for low income families, increase the take-up rate of the family payment for low income families with children and help families to budget better. The government remains committed to protecting and enhancing the interests of families. However, it is important that this be achieved equitably and targeted towards those people who are most in need.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government is concerned that the use of taxable income alone might not be a reliable basis upon which to determine entitlement to certain social security payments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For example, some people receive benefits from their employer such as a car or rent-free housing but do not pay any tax on them because the definition of `taxable income' in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 does not include the value of such benefits. Instead, the employer is subject to fringe benefits tax.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To qualify for a family payment under the Social Security Act 1991, a person must satisfy an income test. Similarly, a person aged under 18 who applies for a job search allowance or a sickness allowance is subject to a parental income test. At present, both of these income tests are based on `taxable income' that is defined to mean the same as in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. As a result, these income tests do not take account of employer provided fringe benefits. This means that some people who have a high income in real terms, can still pass the income tests. This gives an unfair advantage to those people who receive income in the form of fringe benefits rather than as wages.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, the government has decided to amend the Social Security Act 1991 from 1 January 1994 to make sure that the income tests for family payment and the parental income test for job search allowance and sickness allowance claimants aged under 18  take account of certain employer fringe benefits. The benefits that will be assessable are employer provided motor vehicles, housing, loans, school fees and private health insurance. The value of the benefits of a person and the person's partner, or parent as the case may be, will be added together and anything in excess of $1,000 will be taken into account. If the combined total is less than that amount it will be ignored.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another example of where inequity can arise is where despite having similar levels of income, one family can be advantaged over another merely because the source of some or all of their income is overseas. The foreign income might not form part of their `taxable income' upon which entitlement to family payment is based. This can occur, for instance, because one parent works overseas and is not resident in Australia for the purposes of Australian taxation legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To that end, the Social Security Act 1991 is to be amended with effect from 1 January 1994 to allow certain foreign income to be taken into account when assessing a person's entitlement to family payment. This measure will not affect families receiving social security pensions or benefits or service pensions as they are exempt from the family payment income test.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many social security pensioners receive foreign income. That income must be converted to Australian dollars to calculate the rate of Australian pension payable. Currently, unless exceptional circumstances prevail, the foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 only enable the exchange rates used for this purpose to be changed four times a year. However, due to the needs-based nature of Australia's social security system, we must be more flexible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will amend the foreign currency conversion provisions in the act so that they will be more responsive to frequent or sudden movements in exchange rates. A new exchange rate for each nominated currency will be set every pension payday, based on the market exchange rate available at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on the previous payday. If there is no such rate for that payday, for example, because of a national public holiday, the rate used will be the market exchange rate that applied on the last working day immediately before that payday.

         —I wish to speak very briefly, recognising that the Senate estimates committees are about to sit. I wish to thank the Senate for the support it has just given to the motion I moved in relation to an inquiry into whilsteblowing in this country. When I had the responsibility of the shadow portfolio of defence science and personnel, over the years a number of people came to me who—in the national interest, as they saw it—had tried to report matters of maladministration or even corruption which needed attention. As a result of reporting these matters their careers suffered and eventually, in some cases, their health suffered. I was also made aware of somebody from the department of administrative services who was exposed to fraudulent contracting in relation to defence projects. That man gave information on what he had found and, at least partly as a result of that, prosecutions followed.

         The only trouble is that while these people have been doing their duty in the national interest, as they see it, organisations for which they have worked have felt threatened and the procedures currently in place—like the merit review procedures—do not appear to have given sufficient protection to people from harassment, intimidation or even sacking. We realise that this is a matter which is not easy to prove, but so also is sexual harassment in the workplace. This country still believes that it is appropriate to have legislation on the books so that, where such harassment can be proved, action can be taken to protect the individuals concerned. I would argue that a similar situation should prevail in the case of whistleblowers.

         I have had this concern for a long time. What finally moved me to take action was not a case in the public sector but a case in the private sector, in my home state of Tasmania. I will briefly set out what the problem is there. An article written by Terry McCrann in today's

         Back in 1990 Alwyn Johnson, who was one of the most senior executives in Tasmania's biggest bank—the state-government owned Tasmania Bank—raised the alarm on serious undisclosed financial problems within the bank.

         He did so by writing two confidential letters to the then Tasmanian premier Michael Field. This led to the premier calling in the external auditors to examine the bank's position and the subsequent departure of the bank's two top executives.

         The bad loan problems were `solved' in the old-fashioned way by merging Tasmania Bank with the state's other major local bank to form the now-named Trust Bank—in the process, removing the state's government ownership, as also happened with the State Bank of Victoria.

        I think that sums up why we need to protect people who act in the public interest. If people had acted in that way in other banks in Australia, we might have avoided some of the disasters that have been occasioned to this nation. The Commonwealth does have the responsibility to regulate banking and it has a regulatory body in the form of the Reserve Bank. It also has regulatory bodies in terms of the corporations of Australia and the air safety of Australia. People working in corporations or in the aviation industry could well have information which is in the national interest, but they hesitate to go to, say, the regulatory authority for fear of retribution.

         A number of public committees have briefly touched on the issue of whistleblowing. The most recent was a Senate committee in December 1991 which reviewed the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. That committee said that `there was an increase of the phenomenon of individuals drawing attention to what they see as misbehaviour by the organisations which employ them—a practice often called whistleblowing. In some cases such behaviour represents courage and a commitment to high ethical standards far beyond the normal. In other cases it involves stubborn persistence in error to an extent that is destructive of the complainant and damaging to the organisation subject to complaint'. I say that because there must be a recognition of the fact that there are often two sides to whistleblowing, and the organisation by which the individual is employed may also need protection.

         This is a complex issue and very appropriate for the Senate to investigate. One of the virtues of the Senate is the important role that it undertakes in investigating matters of national importance. This is one such matter and the response of the other political parties to my motion recognises this. I believe it is one reason why service in this chamber can be so rewarding and satisfying. I believe that the support across the board for this committee augurs well for the work that it is to undertake.

I refer to the visit, as one might call it, of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to the ACTU congress.

         I want to show how out of control this government is on this issue when it is changing position. In April the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) addressed the Institute of Directors in Australia, and said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We need to find a way of extending the coverage of workplace agreements from being add-ons to awards, as they sometimes are, to being full substitutes for awards.

       <para>
        Approximately one month ago the Minister for Industrial Relations brought down a statement in which he indicated that it was his intention to extend enterprise bargaining in total freedom to non-union workplaces. I emphasise—in total freedom to non-union workplaces. Only two days ago the Prime Minister changed his position. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are close to an agreement with the ACTU on a package of labour reforms based on a proposal by the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty.

       <para>
        This highlights the fact that the position adopted by Mr Brereton just over a month ago has been totally eroded and a position has been put in place which has been controlled by the Prime Minister and Mr Kelty; it is out of Mr Brereton's hands. It is worth noting two things about what took place yesterday. Today's

       <para>
        Obviously Senator McMullan is having some problem with this proposition. When I asked today whether the government was going to cave in to the position being put by the union movement, as enunciated by the minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Tickner, at the ACTU conference yesterday, he could not have given a much shorter or explicit answer. He said: `No'. There is an enormous amount of contradiction and conflict between the positions of the various ministers within the government, the position of Mr Kelty and, also, the position of Mr Ferguson as President of the ACTU, as to where industrial relations is heading.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is also worth noting that in his speech today Mr Brereton spelt out some intentions which—and he was booed and hissed at the ACTU Congress—we on this side of the chamber will certainly be opposing as we believe they represent an incredibly backward step in industrial relations in this country—the right to free trade, the right to free enterprise, the rights of the individual, and a measure whereby people by de facto means will be forced into compulsory unionism.

         The first point I want to make on this issue is that, quite clearly, the right to strike will be introduced into the legislation. The second point, which was also alluded to in an answer to a different question by Senator Cook here today, concerns the abolition of sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act. Once again, I believe that this is a backward step. It is certainly a step which—and we have been taking evidence in an inquiry into sections 45D and 45E—no employer organisation in this country supports. The third point I want to make concerns the unionisation of non-union workplaces by default. Of course, in effect this is all about compulsory unionism. This package, if implemented, will mean that Australia will be taking an enormous step backwards.

         The other point that I wish to highlight is that Mr Brereton's speech remains absolutely and totally silent with regard to how or by what means we might see the development of enterprise bargaining in non-union workplaces. That is notable for its absence. It is highlighted by what Mr Kelty had to say today. I quote from AAP as follows:

         I would like to make a couple of brief comments with regard to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. They have been consistently misrepresented by so many groups in this country in terms of what they can and cannot do. The first point is that sections 45D and 45E give quick, speedy and relatively inexpensive relief through an injunction to interference in people's rights to go about their business and to trade in a nonrestrictive manner.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The next point, which has been consistently misrepresented, is that the legislation can be used against people who take action in the workplace about their legitimate concerns—concerns about their pay, concerns about their safety and concerns about the conditions under which they work. In relation to people protecting themselves in the workplace, subsection 45D(3) of the Trade Practices Act precisely and clearly spells out that that is not the case. This has also been upheld in the courts. The most notable case was the MATFA v. AMIEU case in 1990 in Victoria which related to certain aspects of the accord mark 6. I will not go into the detail of that case, other than to put it on the public record that, when individuals in the workplace either singularly or collectively were concerned about those particular aspects, legitimate protection was given to them under sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I also want to touch on the much misrepresented situation with regard to civil liberties. This was spelt out quite clearly in the J-Corp case in Western Australia. In this particular case, interference by the BLF on J-Corp occurred by virtue of a picket line. But, even though damage occurred to J-Corp, because the principal target was the previous state Labor government in Western Australia and Homeswest, the court decided not to order an injunction against that action because the prime target was not the business that was being interfered with. So the civil liberties of the BLF in protesting against the Western Australian government were upheld. That was a very important case because it put an end to the lie which has been espoused around the place that sections 45D and 45E are used to prevent people from protesting in a civil form.

         This whole gambit of removing sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act will mean that once again Australian businesses, trade, shipping and transport industries—the lot—will be exposed to the types of things that occurred before 1977 without any proper recourse to the law.

         It is pointless for people to stand in this place and say, as we heard today, that there are common law remedies which are effective. There are common law remedies, it is true. But one can wait up to two or three years before it goes before the court. One has to deal with all the jurisdictions of the supreme courts around this country. One gets inconsistencies between judgments from supreme courts and the Federal Court. At the end of the day, the rights of people to trade in a fair and proper manner without interference is the issue. That is what sections 45D and 45E are all about.

         I want to highlight two points with regard to the proposal to put it under industrial law. Firstly, it will be restricted to those who are covered by federal awards. Secondly, because of the proposals outlined in Mr Brereton's speech, there will be a period in which the arbitration commission will have to deal with the matter. Of course, we know what happens then. Businesses cannot be held up for days, weeks and months waiting for an outcome in these particular circumstances because they will go broke. That is what was happening prior to 1977. That is why sections 45D and 45E were put into the Trade Practices Act—to give immediate injunctive relief from action while the matter was sorted out.

         Putting it under industrial law would be an enormous backward step for this country at this time, particularly when we have a compulsory arbitration system which operates here. I note that in Mr Brereton's speech he expressed no intention of doing away with compulsory arbitration.

         I leave my comments there. Once again, I highlight the fact that Mr Brereton was hissed and booed today; the conflict that obviously arose from the answer given by Senator McMullan to my question today in relation to the position of Mr Tickner yesterday; and the changing position of the Prime Minister and Mr Brereton. I emphasise that the Labor Party is in total disarray—probably in more disarray over this than with its budget—as far as a proper, fair and equitable industrial relations policy is concerned.

        (1) Electronic transfer and verification technology to date has not displaced the physical transfer of cheques. The time banks allow for cheque clearance relates not to the time required to transmit the details of a transaction from the bank where it is deposited (collecting bank) to the bank on which it was drawn (drawee bank), which is nowadays quite short, but to the time needed to cover the possible two-way journey of the physical cheque through the system.

        The cheque-clearing cycle involves time for the cheque to be sorted and sent to the drawee bank; time for that bank to decide whether to honour the cheque; and if the cheque is not to be honoured, time to return it through the system. If a collecting bank pays away on a cheque before it is verified and cleared by the drawee bank it runs the risk of loss if the cheque is dishonoured, for reasons including insufficient funds  or fraud.

        (2,3) The proceeds from deposits of cheques awaiting final clearance are usually at the disposal of the collecting bank which is able to invest them. Depending on the nature of the account into which cheques are deposited, customers are either paid interest on these proceeds from the day of deposit or they are applied to reducing overdrafts. In some countries the customer would not get the benefit of the interest paid (or saved) until the funds were deemed to be clear some days after the day of deposit.

        (2) The fees and charges levied by TGA were introduced in 1991 following the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Fees and charges were established through consultation with the IGCC against estimates of the volume of work likely to be undertaken. In the first full year of operation (1991-92) TGA raised $9.4M in revenue compared to a target of $17M to meet 50% cost-recovery. The first discussions with industry on the need to increase fees and charges took place in May 1992. The need to increase fees and charges was widely publicised in the "TGA News", a newsletter sent to all sponsors of pharmaceutical goods in Australia.

        (1) Is it correct that the taxation treatment of credit unions which exempts from taxation the interest earned from loans to members enables them to have an unfair advantage when compared with the taxation treatment that exists for building societies whose interest earned from loans to members is taxed.

        (2) In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government announced that the income tax exemption for credit unions with gross balance sheet assets of $30 million, or more, will be removed from the beginning of the 1994-95 income year. The income tax exemption for all other credit unions will be removed from the beginning of the 1995-96 income year. In addition, approved credit unions will be taxed at a concessional rate of 20 per cent on income, in the nature of interest, from loans to their (non-corporate) members until the beginning of the 1997-98 income year, at which time the rate will be increased to the corporate tax rate. The measure was introduced into Parliament in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 on 17 August 1993.
