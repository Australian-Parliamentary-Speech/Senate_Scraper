          —Order! By letter dated 22 October 1993, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has raised with me under standing order 81 a matter of privilege. The essence of the matter raised by the committee is that a witness who gave evidence before the committee may have been penalised in consequence of that evidence. The material placed before the committee indicates that a threat to deprive the witness of his employment may have been made, and the witness may have incurred the non-renewal of his contract of employment because of the evidence which he gave.

          Under standing order 81 and the privilege resolutions of the Senate, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over other business, having regard to criteria laid down by the Senate. Those criteria provide, in effect, that the Senate's power to deal with contempts should be used only to provide reasonable protection against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct the Senate or its committees and that the existence of any other remedy should be considered. I have indicated to the Senate in previous rulings that I give precedence to a matter if it is capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting those criteria.

          The privilege resolutions of the Senate, past reports by the Privileges Committee and past decisions by the Senate indicate that any suggestion that witnesses have been penalised in consequence of their evidence is regarded as a very serious matter. The matter raised by the committee is clearly capable of meeting the criteria I am required to consider. I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence in accordance with standing order 81. I table the correspondence from the standing committee and the attached documentation. The chairman of the committee, Senator Childs may now give a notice of motion.

The three people I referred to did not know that I had 98 per cent of the papers, which had fallen off the back of the truck, and I wanted the last two per cent. I could have got the papers under freedom of information, but I thought the government might have cooperated by letting me have them. Those papers dealt with questions regarding flexibility of ATSIC to spend its global budget, funding of public awareness of Mabo style claims, and a few other matters. I withdrew the motion because, as I said, I already have 98 per cent of those papers and they are quite sufficient to show that I was not given full and frank answers.

        Mr President, the forest and wood products industry is of great significance to Australia's economy, generating significant employment and economic activity. The industry employs around 40,000 people, mostly in regional communities of Australia where there are limited alternative employment opportunities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To date, the focus of the Australian forest industry has largely been on the domestic market where it has provided around two thirds of our consumption needs. Exports of forest and timber products have largely been confined to lower value woodchips and wood products which have undergone minimal processing. On the other hand, Australia is a significant importer of higher value pulp and paper products. Imports totalled some $2438 million in 1992-93, compared with exports of only some $775 million, resulting in a trade deficit of $1663 million. This amounted to around 11 per cent of the current account deficit for last year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is strongly committed to building competitiveness and expanding productivity of Australian industry, particularly our primary industries, whose contribution to exports underpins the economy. The Government's rural research policy is central to achieving this objective. The Commonwealth provides funding to encourage increased rural productivity and profitability through research and commercialisation of research findings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Already the Commonwealth provides significant support to forest industry research and development in several ways:  through direct funding to CSIRO Divisions of Forestry, Forest Products, and Wildlife and Ecology; to the Cooperative Research Centres for Temperate Hardwood Forestry and Hardwood Fibre and Paper Science; and through such programs as the National Pulp Mill Research Program and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation's Agroforestry Program. Research into forestry and forest products is also supported by the State Governments and the forest industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However,  there is no doubt that there is a need for an improvement in our forest and wood products research and development effort. This need has long been recognised by the Australian Forestry Council and by the industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, all major reports on the forest industry, including the Resource Assessment Commission's 1992 Forest and Timber Inquiry, the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the ESD Working Group on Forest Use, have echoed the urgent need for an enhanced, better coordinated and better focused research effort. This is essential if we are to increase productivity and value-adding processing in our forests and wood products industries and to manage our forests in an ecologically sustainable manner.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The message is clear. We need to increase the level of research and to ensure that the focus is on nationally important, strategic issues. This does not mean diverting current funding or duplicating existing work. We need to lift our game overall.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has therefore agreed, as a key initiative under the National Forest Policy Statement, to establish a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation in partnership with industry. The Corporation and its commissioned research will be funded from contributions from the Commonwealth and industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regulations have already been made establishing the Corporation from 1 January 1994 under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. As with other rural Research and Development Corporations, this Corporation will have a high degree of industry involvement and accountability:  it will not be just another arm of Government. It will be set up as a body corporate with day to day autonomy and flexibility to operate in a manner similar to many commercial operations. Its purpose will be to provide national strategic leadership to industry research and development and act as a catalyst to stimulate research and development within industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Corporation will identify national research priorities and assess research gaps. It will commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into a broad range of areas relating to wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Its charter will also include the ecological and environmental impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture and management of native forests and plantations. The Corporation itself will not actually undertake any research. Organisations currently conducting forest industry research will be eligible to tender to carry out research on behalf of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Industry, through the National Association of Forest Industries as the representative organisation, will be closely involved in the selection of a Board of Directors for the Corporation. Procedures for selecting a Board, which are established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, will ensure that the Board includes a broad range of expertise enabling it to address the full range of issues included in the charter of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Corporation will be required to prepare 5 year research and development plans in consultation with industry which will outline the objectives, strategies and policies it intends to pursue. It will also be required to prepare Annual Operating Plans for each financial year, consistent with its 5 year plan.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Corporation will also be required to prepare Annual Reports which will be tabled in Parliament and made available to industry for scrutiny. These will assess the Corporation's performance against the key elements identified in its strategic plans and contain sufficient information to enable industry to make a comprehensive assessment of the value of the research and development activities undertaken. The Chairperson of the Corporation will also be required to report directly to the Executive of the National Association of Forest Industries on an annual basis and be prepared to be questioned on the activities of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I repeat, Mr President, that the Commonwealth's intention in establishing the Corporation is to supplement the existing research effort rather than to replace it. There is a firm expectation that the existing research effort by the industry, both by private companies and the public forest management agencies, will be maintained or enhanced.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program under the Corporation, the forest and wood products industry has asked the Government to introduce a statutory levy on the domestic production of wood. The industry, including timber importers, have also requested a charge on imports of unprocessed wood and certain classes of primary processed forest products, including sawn timber, wood based panels, medium density fibreboard and hardboard.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I wish to emphasise, Mr President, that this is a charge on importers of wood and forest products, not on the overseas exporters. The Australian Timber Importers Federation, an affiliate of the National Association of Forest Industries, has recently expressed strong support for such a charge, recognising that importers, who stand to benefit from the research, should also contribute.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of direct relevance to importers will be economic and marketing research, an area which will be specifically identified in the charter for the Corporation. Importers will benefit directly from research and development into fields such as expanding the demand for wood products in Australia, new market and product developments, fire related codes and standards and the use of timber in multiple storey construction.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to ensure that imports are treated no less favourably than domestic production, the legislation provides that the charge on imports of unprocessed wood is to be set at the same rate as the levy on domestic production. The legislation also provides that a conversion factor between unprocessed wood and classes of processed wood, which has been agreed with industry, will be applied to the levy to determine a rate of charge for primary processed wood products imported into Australia. The conversion factors will ensure that equivalent rates apply between imports and domestic production.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To ensure that importers benefit from the research activities undertaken by the Corporation, the legislation provides explicitly that funds which have been raised from the charge on imports  must be directed to research and development which will be of relevance to the timber importing industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister for Resources has been assured that introduction of the levy is fully consistent with Australia's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with New Zealand.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth will provide $1 for every $2 from the domestic industry up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of the Gross Value of Production of the industry. The basis of the 1 : 2 funding arrangement arises from the structure of the forest-related industry. Half of the industry has a primary industry focus (tree production, small rural sawmills), while the other half has a manufacturing orientation. Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries. This is also in recognition that the Commonwealth already provides significant support to the other sectors of industry through other research programs. However, the Commonwealth will not match funds raised from the import charge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Operative rates of the levy and charges to be contributed by industry will be set by regulation on the basis of advice from industry. Under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, before the Minister for Resources makes any recommendation to the Governor-General on the operative rate of levy or to the classes of leviable products or changes to these, the Minister is required to take into consideration any relevant advice from any prescribed organisation, in this case, the National Association of Forest Industries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Industry is still consulting on the operative rate at which the levy and charges are to be introduced. The legislation sets a maximum rate for a class of wood of 0.5 per cent of its average value to ensure that no one sector of the forest industry bears a significantly greater responsibility for industry contributions than others, and indeed, that the industry overall is not levied excessively. The Minister for Resources has been advised by the National Association of Forest Industries that they expect to recommend a rate lower than this for some sectors. For every 0.1 per cent, the rate would be in the order of 4 and 6 cents per cubic metre of unprocessed wood.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will be up to industry to decide whether the revenue raised by the levy and charges, together with the Commonwealth's contribution, is providing the Corporation with the resources to increase the research effort to the appropriate level.

        This particular bill relates to the imposition of a levy on unprocessed wood which is delivered to a mill and will take effect from 1 January 1994. The bill provides that different levy rates may apply to different classes of wood. The levy will be payable by the operator of the mill to which the wood is delivered.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Industry has requested that different rates of levy apply to four classes of wood—hardwood sawlogs, softwood sawlogs, hardwood pulplogs and softwood pulplogs. These will be based on the average value for that class of wood. In the case of unprocessed wood which is produced in Australia and exported, a charge at the same rates as the levies imposed by this bill will be imposed by the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Bill 1993 when the wood is exported.

         Honourable senators would be aware that, as part of the budget, the government announced it would be modifying the pharmaceutical benefits scheme arrangements for general patients. Under present arrangements there is a two-tier safety net limit for general patients and patients pay $15.90 per script until the first threshold of $309.90 is reached. They then pay $2.60 a script until the second threshold of $361.50 is reached. Beyond this threshold, drugs are provided free of charge.

         Passage of this bill will mean that from 1 January 1994 there will be a single safety net threshold for general patients of $400—that is, 25 scripts at $16 each. Beyond this threshold, there will be a fee of $2.60 per script. That means that drugs will no longer be available to general patients free of charge. The increase in the safety net limit and the removal of access to free drugs is estimated to save $12.4 million in 1993-94, $32 million 1994-95, $33.4 million in 1995-96 and $34.9 million in 1996-97.

         While speaking about the matter of pharmaceuticals, I take the opportunity to raise a number of other important issues. Firstly, generic prescribing has come under increased scrutiny in recent times following a couple of items on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          7.30 Report

         The issue was the subject of considerable discussion at the 31 August hearing of Senate Estimates Committee C. What emerged from this discussion, apart from the questionable approach of the Health Insurance Commission in dealing with Mr Keene, was that the government has a minimum pricing policy which does not have the legislative support it deserves. This is obviously a very sensitive issue. Any changes in the area will need to be based on very widespread consultation. However, there is a compelling argument for giving patients greater freedom of choice when they receive pharmaceuticals from pharmacists.

         Unless doctors have clearly indicated that there is to be no substitution, pharmacists should be able to talk to patients about the choice available between a brand name and a generic drug, in the cases where a generic drug is available, with obvious due and proper regard for bioequivalents. As the law stands at the moment, this can occur only if the pharmacist rings a doctor seeking his or her permission to offer the generic drug.

         In additional material that was provided to me after the Senate estimates committee hearing that I referred to earlier, the government recognised that further action might be warranted in regard to generic prescribing. I find it fascinating that the government can have a minimum pricing policy which involves the use of generic drugs and does not put the legislative backing in place that will be needed if it is to be effective.

        Given the concerns of the medical profession and the fact that State law is important in this area, the Government's approach to encouraging generics via the 1990 policy change was the most appropriate way of progressing the use of generics at that time.

        I know that this is a thorny issue for the government to deal with, but I urge it to take courage. If it means anything by its minimal pricing policy it should get on with the job. I would be very interested in any further comments that the minister responsible could add to this summary, in particular in regard to what substantive action the government intends to take.

         Another important issue that relates to the question of pharmaceuticals is the role of pharmacists, which I believe is evolving and will evolve even further over time. Community pharmacists have traditionally been regarded merely as suppliers and dispensers of medication. It is pretty apparent to anyone in contact with the pharmacy profession that their training fits them with skills to make a wider contribution to community health.

Having formerly been a shadow minister for the aged, I am well aware of the problems of pharmaceutical use by the elderly—both those living in their homes and those in institutionalised care. Elderly people today are often faced with a bewildering array of drugs and there are problems of both non-compliance and over prescribing. I have recently raised these matters with the AMA.

         I know that the AMA shares concerns about the over-medication of the elderly. I hope that action can be taken by the professions, including the pharmacy profession, to improve the quality of prescribing and the control over prescribing in some of these areas where, clearly, it is a bit out of hand. I believe that a community pharmacist could make a valuable contribution as part of a team of health professionals responsible for managing the care of our elderly in nursing homes. I am not suggesting that the doctors concerned should not be involved. In fact, I often think the local GP is not as involved as he or she might be in the care of an elderly patient who becomes resident in a nursing home. But the professions together have a shared role here.

         I think it is time that the government addressed itself seriously to this issue. The House of Representatives standing committee report has been available for 10 months. This issue is part of the broader one of the medical and other professions working more closely together. As I said earlier, there are a number of ways in which this could occur. One very practical way would be to establish computer software prescribing packages for doctors. There are software packages for pharmacists which demonstrate the prescriptions made available to a patient over several years so that, when a new prescription comes in, a flag comes up on the computer suggesting where there is likely to be a problem between scripts.

         By the doctor producing scripts electronically, the job of the pharmacist would be much easier since there would be no difficulty in reading scripts and, thus, the safety of the patient would be guaranteed. In addition, the doctor would have a record of other patients' previous pharmaceutical use, so that any future prescribing could take this history into account. The system we have at the moment does allow pharmacists to pick up a problem, but it is important that the doctor who does the prescribing should know of the contraindications before a new script is issued.

         Proposals of this nature have so far been the subject of relatively little public debate and certainly deserve greater attention. I commend them to the minister, who I am glad to see is now in the chamber, for his attention. This is an issue which is of great seriousness to the wellbeing of patients in this country as well as being an issue of importance to revenue. I hope that, in the interests of good medical care, more leadership might be taken by the government in this area of prescribing, the role of the pharmacy profession and the interrelationship of the pharmacy and the medical professions. As I said at the outset, the opposition is not opposing this bill and we have no amendments to it.

         —The sole purpose of the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 that is before us today is to alter the structure of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme safety net for non-pensioners. At present, the PBS safety net for non-pensioners, called general patients, has two levels. After spending $312.30 on pharmaceuticals, a general patient is entitled to pharmaceuticals at the concessional rate of $2.60 per prescription. This continues until a further $52 is spent in a year. A general patient then qualifies for the pharmaceutical benefits entitlement card and is entitled to free pharmaceuticals.

         This bill abolishes the two-tiered structure and fixes one safety net at $400 a year, after which a general patient becomes eligible for a safety net concession card and can receive drugs at the concessional rate for the rest of that year. The pharmaceutical benefits entitlement card is abolished and general patients will no longer be eligible to receive free pharmaceuticals after this bill is passed.

         The current two-tiered structure was introduced in the 1986 federal budget and, at the time, the government said it was changing the PBS in order to protect people suffering from some sort of chronic health problem. In November 1986 in this chamber, Senator Grimes, representing the Minister for Health, talked of the government's desire to provide specific assistance to those deemed to be most disadvantaged—the chronically ill, the high drug user or the family with one or more chronically ill members.

         Similarly, the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, said the new scheme was being introduced to protect the chronically ill by imposing a limit on what they must pay for their pharmaceuticals. In short, the government made a good deal of fuss six years ago about how wonderful and caring it was to think up and introduce this structure.

         Answering a question on the changes in November 1986, Senator Grimes gave the example of a family with two asthmatic children requiring five prescriptions monthly for each child at the then cost of $600 a year. He pointed out that, under the changes the government was introducing, the same family would pay about $183 to reach the 25 prescriptions threshold, then nothing for the remainder of the year, a saving of over $400. Senator Grimes went on to say that this example was `quite typical of the disadvantaged family group who will be protected under this new scheme'.

What did she have to say about its effect on low income families? She was particularly vocal back in 1986. She supported very strongly then the putting in place of the safety net. In September 1986, speaking in the chamber on the bill which introduced the safety net, she said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        People can bear very considerable costs if they have a chronic illness, or because of the stage in their life cycle. For example, families with young children may need a quite considerable number of prescriptions in a year.

       <para>
        She went to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Essentially the Government recognises that the principal problems with pharmaceutical benefits charges are suffered by people with chronic illness. It has recognised this by building in a safety net . . .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So I have to question what Senator Crowley is saying now. What has changed since 1986?  Does the government no longer consider that the brunt of charges for pharmaceuticals is borne by people with chronic illness?  Are people with chronic illness suddenly using fewer drugs?  Has their need for pharmaceuticals magically reduced?  Of course not.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What has changed is that the government has now decided that the safety net is costing it too much money and wants to cut back on PBS expenditure, regardless of the impact on people with chronic health problems. This is just another cost cutting exercise in this budget. I would like to hear Senator Crowley try to justify it.

         The government says that it has had to take this action because of a blow out in 1992 in the number of prescriptions to general patients under this free safety net. It says that there has been an increase of more than 150 per cent over the previous year. The Democrats do not dispute that there are problems with ever increasing PBS expenditure. I agree that something needs to be done to rein it in. But this concentration on the costs of PBS means that we tend to overlook the significant benefits which flow from it.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The PBS is certainly expensive, but let us not forget that it has been highly effective in controlling drug prices. Without it the national drug bill would be considerably higher because, in effect, the PBS stands as a very necessary intermediary between consumers and the very powerful pharmaceutical industry.

         What concerns me about this bill is that once again the government seems to be unable to see any way of addressing increases in PBS expenditure other than by hitting the chronically ill. The Democrats have always opposed moves to reduce the PBS expenditure by tackling the problem from the consumer or patient end of the chain. We have taken this approach for three reasons. Firstly, the demand for drugs is essentially inelastic. That is, it does not respond to price signals. People either need the drugs to make them better or they do not need the drugs. They are not an optional extra or luxury which people just tend to take or not to take, to elect to purchase or not to purchase, depending on whether the price is right. In other words, all that happens when fees are introduced, or access to free PBS drugs is restricted, is that low income earners end up spending a higher proportion of their income on pharmaceuticals.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, there are strong arguments to support the notion that the issue of polypharmacy cannot be resolved by increasing patient contributions. Thirdly, there is convincing evidence to suggest that the demand for drugs is primarily driven by the promotional activities of the pharmaceutical industry and the prescription practices of medical practitioners and not by the patients themselves.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For example, the minister in his second reading speech says that there has been a considerable stockpiling under the safety net with more than 70 per cent of the annual number of prescriptions being supplied in the last two months of the safety net period. But it is not the patients who are writing these prescriptions. Surely, if this sort of stockpiling is occurring, the government should be looking not only at the behaviour of the consumers—are they stockpiling prescriptions somehow that the doctors have written over a period of time without any medical supervision whatsoever?—but also at the prescribing practices of these people's doctors.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Even aside from these three concerns, I still do not understand why, if the government is so concerned about expenditure increases under the free safety net by general patients, it could not look at some sort of means test to ensure that at least the chronically ill people on low incomes can continue to be protected. A cost of $2.60 per prescription probably does not sound very much to some of us, but we are talking about chronically ill people who have already spent $400 in that year on drugs. This rate of expenditure suggests that these are people who are likely to need several prescriptions a month, if not a week.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let us take Dr Blewett's example of some six years ago:  the family with two children with chronic asthma who require five prescriptions per child per month. Under this new scheme, that family, which would have received drugs free after reaching the safety net, will now be paying out an extra $26 a month for drugs. That is perhaps not a lot for a family with a reasonable income but it is potentially quite a burden for a family which is already struggling to make ends meet.

         I really question the basic fairness of making chronically ill people pay more for their drugs, especially when those people are living on a low income. I do not see why the government could not have looked at putting some sort of means test into the free safety net. Surely it would not have been too difficult to do. At least it would have ensured a measure of protection for people on low incomes with chronic health problems. I would like to know—perhaps the minister can tell us during the committee stage—whether or not such an option was considered at any stage and, if it was considered, why it was not adopted.

         Over a number of years the Democrats have also called for a full independent review of the PBS because of our concern that reform measures adopted by the government continue to be directed almost entirely at the issue of price, rather than addressing the range of other factors which are crucial to PBS expenditure. Some of those factors include: the role of doctors, particularly GPs, in dispensing drugs; the role of promotional advertising within the pharmaceutical industry in relation to cost effectiveness of prescribing by doctors; the general lack of consumer awareness about pharmaceuticals and limited access to independent medications information; the limited specialist medical knowledge about geriatric prescribing; and alternative forms of therapy. Indeed, what is there that we can do without relying constantly on drugs? What other community services are required to reduce the reliance of people on medication? It is time that the government seriously addressed these issues rather than continuing to put the onus back on the patients.

         Over the past few years the government has introduced three major measures to rein in PBS expenditure: increased patient contributions, such as this bill; pensioner co-payments; and the minimum pricing policy. The net effect of these measures, at a time of chronic economic recession, has been to transfer a substantial part of increased pharmaceutical costs directly to the consumers. In short, the government's strategy is to cut back PBS expenditure and focus almost exclusively on the consumer, either through the introduction of some sort of price signal or by way of education programs which urge patients to be wise, responsible and vigilant consumers. Very few government strategies are focused on the prescribing practice of GPs or the often aggressive marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies.

The Democrats do not think the measures outlined in this bill before the Senate do anything positive for the health of Australians and we will not be supporting this bill.

         In respect of the contribution of Senator Lees, I think she was primarily talking about elasticity in demand and was saying that demand was inelastic. Unfortunately, I think she also undid her own case by quoting from the second reading speech. The figure that she used that in 1992 more than 70 per cent of the annual number of prescriptions for general patients are being supplied in the last two months of the safety net period does suggest that demand is anything but inelastic.

With an ageing population and the development of new drugs, the costs of operating the PBS are going up at, in my view, quite frightening rates every year. In 1992-93, for instance, costs increased by 25 per cent over the previous financial year to around $1 1/2 billion.

Even having done that, we are still seeing significant increases in costs every year.

         In relation to the charge of $2.60 after the $400 limit, Senator Lees says that that will be a lot of money for families and she quoted Dr Blewett's example of six years ago. By the way, any GP looking at the latest Asthma Foundation booklet on asthma management would not have the same prescribing practices, because asthma management has changed dramatically in that six years and will, I hope, continue to change. But that is only a debating point because chronic illness is not only asthma and, obviously, $2.60 for families is a struggle. We have to understand that, in that whole argument of containing costs, if the average cost of those drugs is approximately $19 then at $2.60 the taxpayer is still giving a very heavy subsidy. In fact, it is an extraordinarily heavy subsidy.

When that happens, access to drugs will not be as easy as it is for Australians today. It is going to get more and more difficult.

         I think it is worth noting that as at December 1992 there were 5.6 million card holders in Australia. That number increased by a further 200,000 from 1 July with the changes that the government made to the seniors card, which Senator Lees would be aware of, in respect of incomes and assets testing. That there are 5.8 million card holders—that is, a third of Australia is able to access the cheapest pharmaceuticals—is evidence that we have a means test that works extraordinarily well. The government would not plan to change that.

         It was acknowledged during the last election campaign—and even before it—that over time the number of people holding seniors cards is more likely to increase. I think there will be further measures down that route as funds permit. In the next few years I think there will be further changes, especially if the economy takes off in the way that we all hope. While the government is not planning any new or special measures in respect of means testing, I think the ones that we have and have extended work pretty well.

The concerns of the Australian Democrats rest with many people in rural Australia who do not qualify for any pension or benefits at all, yet have incomes that, in many cases, are negative. We also have a concern that those people who move off unemployment benefit and into casual or low paid employment and then lose their entitlements will face difficulties, particularly if there is chronic illness in the family.

Firstly, relating to the 150 per cent increase that was mentioned, does the minister have a specific breakdown of particular types of drugs?  Where is the blow-out occurring? Is it right across the board or only in specific areas?  Secondly, in relation to the 70 per cent increase in the number of annual prescriptions in the last couple of months of the safety net period, does the minister have a breakdown of the drugs?

         Part 3 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 amends the Health Insurance Act: to ensure that not more than one pathology authority controls a pathology laboratory, so that there can be no Medicare benefit double dipping; to require pathology authorities, in circumstances where practitioners leave an authority, to retain request forms for pathology services; to impose penalties on pathology authorities for providing pathology request forms which are different from the approved forms; to ensure that a pathology authority which is partly or wholly owned by a state, territory or public authority is not an approved pathology authority; to allow the minister to review, after a period of 12 months, a determination allowing an approved pathology authority to operate additional collection centres—another amendment extends to an authority a right of review of the minister's decision; and, to make a minor change to the way in which licence fees are reimbursed to an authority if permission to operate a collection centre is cancelled. These are all technical amendments and are not contentious. The fact that they are before the Senate today is a reflection of the rushed nature of previous legislation in this area.

         I turn now to the most substantial parts of the legislation before us, those making changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act. Among other things, these changes will facilitate the introduction of complementary state and territory therapeutic goods legislation, the first of which may be in place early in 1994; give effect to an international convention on the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, which allows for mutual exchange of manufacturing information, thus removing the need for overseas inspections by the importing country; extend the definition of `authorised person'—persons called on to assist the Therapeutic Goods Administration in investigating breaches of the act—to include members of the Australian Federal Police; and allow the Therapeutic Goods Administration to evaluate goods which, under transitional provisions of the 1989 act, were listed or registered without evaluation.

         I wish to place on the public record my strong reservations about two of the changes I have just outlined. The first is the framework being set up for complementary Commonwealth-state legislation. The coalition strongly supports the proposal that the Commonwealth and the states work together to produce complementary therapeutic goods legislation.

         We saw the consequences of a failure of Commonwealth-state cooperation highlighted in Victoria a couple of months ago. I refer to the case of the woman registered as a beauty therapist in Victoria who injected silicon into the noses, faces and breasts of women. Because this woman was not trading interstate and was not incorporated, she was slipping through a legislative loophole. The federal Therapeutic Goods Act essentially deals with the importing and exporting of therapeutic devices and their supply and manufacture.

         Since the business of the beauty therapist is not incorporated and she trades in one state—and unless she is found to be importing silicon—the Commonwealth is powerless to act against her. In the end, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has finally been moved to recommend that injectable silicon be classed as a poison. However, the situation could have been dealt with more quickly and more effectively if adequate, complementary Commonwealth-state legislation had been in place.

         In the meantime, the consequences of the actions of that beauty therapist have been serious.

Since that meeting the Commonwealth has moved on and developed the federal legislation that we have before us today.

Many nutritional food retailers are sole traders and unincorporated companies. They are obviously very interested in the form that the complementary state legislation will take.

         The second concern I wish to place on the public record relates to changes to the evaluation of goods under the transitional arrangements of the 1989 act. In recognition of the enormous number of products already on the market when the Therapeutic Goods Act was introduced, these products were grandfathered into the register. The volume of goods already on the market when the act was established meant it would have taken years to evaluate each good.

         Apparently, the Australian Government Solicitor's Office has suggested that, despite a proviso contained in the second reading speech of the Therapeutics Goods Bill 1989, it is open to a court to read that each and every product on the market at the commencement of the act was required to be evaluated or assessed before it could be entered into the register as a grandfathered product. My concern is that there is no indication in the legislation of the guidelines which will be used by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in deciding why a particular good will be singled out for evaluation. It effectively confers a significant discretionary power on the Therapeutic Goods Administration.

         This could potentially be used as a revenue raising activity since full evaluation fees will be payable by the sponsor of the good as a means of singling out a particular sponsor for unfair attention. Under the act as it stands, grandfathered goods can already be singled out for evaluation. I have been informed that an evaluation would take place in the event that, for example, adverse reports about a grandfathered product are received, or, if, in the course of dealing with an application by a sponsor of grandfathered goods to amend its product in some way, it became apparent that a full evaluation was necessary.

         The bill makes a number of mainly technical amendments to several bills within the health, housing and community services portfolio. Part 2 makes several amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 and it is clause 4 in this part which is of concern to us.

         Clause 4 amends section 14J of the Disability Services Act. Under 14G of that act, the minister can make a declaration stating that an organisation which is eligible for government funding is not meeting the standards under the act and is, in effect, in breach of the conditions of its funding grant. The declaration can be made only after a fairly extensive and exhaustive review process.

         Section 14J then says that, once a minister has made such a declaration, he or she can make it available to the public in any way he or she thinks fit. In other words, the section provides a way for the minister to announce publicly the withdrawal of funds from an organisation which has failed to meet the standards as set out in the act.

         I really fail to see the point of the inclusion of this provision in the Disability Services Act. I understand that Senator Tambling will be going ahead and describing this in much more detail later. It seems to me that this inclusion would be largely unnecessary because statements made by the minister under section 14J are already privileged under common law. Beyond that, why should the minister be protected from defamation actions if he or she goes further than a straightforward statement of the facts and actually does defame an organisation. For example, an organisation could have gone through the review process, be found to have breached certain standards, the panel may have recommended its funding be terminated and the minister may have agreed with that recommendation.

         But let us say that, in the course of making his or her statement under section 14J, the minister includes details of the alleged physical abuse of the organisation's clients by several staff members. These allegations may be new, may not have been raised with the review panel and may have been rejected by the organisation. Surely that organisation and the individual staff members concerned have the right to take action against the minister for defamation.

         Obviously, this sort of situation will not arise very often. Ministers are usually very careful about the sorts of public statements they make in such circumstances. But, even if we are talking about a very rare occurrence, I cannot see a valid reason for completely closing off this avenue of action and for giving the minister any additional legal immunity other than that already provided by common law.

         I have to ask: what exactly is the government trying to do here? It seems as if it is trying to close the door very firmly on any recourse to legal action a disgruntled organisation may have once the minister has decided to cut off funding. It is really trying to leave absolutely no avenue to such an organisation. Although I do have some sympathy with that desire—especially in this area where a few organisations have been fighting tooth and nail against coming into line and fulfilling their requirements; indeed, some seem determined not to conform with the Disability Services Act—I really do not believe that this measure is necessary or fair.

         I also make the point that, once again, the minister responsible for this amendment, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, is introducing yet another idea with absolutely no consultation with the organisations most likely to be affected. It is little wonder that these organisations, once they found out about this amendment—because they had no prior warning—were very highly suspicious of the government's motives. Accordingly, the Democrats will join the coalition in opposing clause 4. We do not have any other concerns about this bill.

         I turn now briefly to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1993, which also fits in with part 8 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). Part 8 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains a series of amendments which are designed to facilitate the introduction of complementary state and federal legislation in the regulation of therapeutic goods. Essentially, the Commonwealth government wants to set up a uniform national system of control over the quality and safety of therapeutic goods. These amendments will come into force once complementary legislation is in place in the various states.

         That seems to us to be a sensible path to take, although, as Senator Richardson knows, an agreement on uniform national legislation and the actual appearance of complementary state legislation are two vastly different things. We had yet another demonstration of this only recently in the area of uniform information on tobacco products. The Commonwealth achieved the agreement of the states on national legislation only to find that Victoria backed out on the deal; it changed its mind and, at the last minute, moved away from tougher warnings on cigarette packets. Senator Richardson should not be counting his chickens before they have hatched when it comes to uniform therapeutic goods legislation. But, in spite of that proviso, the Democrats support the concept and amendments in part 8 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993.

         The Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1993 follows up on these amendments by giving the Commonwealth the power to collect charges in relation to registrations, listings and licences of therapeutic goods where those activities are carried out on behalf of the state pursuant to its complementary therapeutic goods legislation. As with the part 8 amendments, these changes are subject to the establishment of complementary state and territory legislation. I note that the government is anticipating the first complementary state and territory legislation early next year. In conclusion, all I can say is that I wish the minister the best of luck.

         —I appreciate that, in light of the impending suspension of the Senate, my speech will probably, by necessity, be interrupted. Today we are addressing the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which amends a number of acts. They are: the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Hearing Services Act 1991, the National Health Act 1953, the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992, the Nursing Homes and Hostels (Legislation Amendment) Act 1986 and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.

         It is part 2 of this bill, clauses 3 to 5 inclusive, which amends the Disability Services Act 1986, that I wish to focus on. The coalition is very concerned—and I am pleased to note that that concern is shared by the Australian Democrats—about clause 4 of this part. In the other place, the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Dr Theophanous, stated that the amendments to part 2 were of a minor nature. With respect to clause 4, which amends section 14J of the principal act, the speech contains the following statement:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment will make it clear that the statements which the minister is permitted to make under the section regarding funded organisations' breaches of prescribed standards under the act will not become the subject of a defamation action, nor will any person who fairly reports or summarises the statement be liable for defamation. This amendment restates the common law. The provision should save litigation costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been advised that statements by the minister as authorised by section 14J of the act presently enjoy qualified privilege under common law because the statement is made in accordance with an established law. It would therefore seem unnecessary to restate the common law. This has not been deemed to be necessary at any time until now. The second reading speech gives no explanation as to why this restatement is now necessary. This is a quite unprecedented section and therefore raises a number of serious concerns and naturally invites the suspicion, as Senator Lees has already referred to, of the various disability peak organisations.

         The coalition wants to know whether the government wishes to claim any precedents for this clause. Our investigations have revealed none. It was interesting to note the two precedents that the parliamentary secretary, Dr Theophanous, used in the other place: firstly, sections 91 and 92 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which provide for immunity in relation to the publication of material which may be defamatory—this is very important; and, secondly, section 89A of the Public Service Act 1922, which provides specific protection from defamation action in relation to referee reports and work assessments. In response to these precedents, the honourable member for Tangney, the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams, made a number of comments, which I would like to quote. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

What truth is there in reports this morning that the government's $130 million, four-year population initiative for developing countries announced in the budget has been suspended on the basis of pressure from Senator Harradine? Does the government no longer agree with this objective, announced by Minister Bilney on 7 September, to significantly increase aid expenditure on population? Does the government also no longer agree with Mr Bilney that the proposed expenditure would help cut infant and maternal mortality in developing countries, give women greater control of fertility and reduce unsustainable population growth?

         Since 1989, purchasing policy at the federal level and the procedures associated with it have undergone significant reform and, in the main, those reforms have received bipartisan support. That mainly occurred while Senator Parer was the shadow minister. We thank him for that. We did not agree entirely, but there was substantial bipartisanship on issues of value for money—taking care of the taxpayers' dollar, competition and support for Australian and New Zealand industry. A range of initiatives have been taken to implement those policies. Those policies having now been in place and developed over the past four or five years, it does seem appropriate to review the pluses and minuses to see how we build on the strengths and what we do to accommodate any weaknesses that may occur.

On that subject and the related more general matters to which he refers, I am advised as follows. In the Queensland case, the original violative carcass was from a mob of 46 animals sold last month at auction and sourced from a single property. Three Queensland export meat establishments purchased stock from that auction and have been required to trace and retain suspect product for further testing. Testing has indicated that meat from other animals in the mob contained residues of DDT.

         A small amount of meat suspected of having DDT residues may have been distributed for domestic consumption prior to regulatory action to retain and test all suspect product, but given the safety margins in establishing maximum residue level in foods, the risk to any consumer who may have consumed suspect meat is assessed as negligible.

         As to the more general policy reaction of the government to these concerns which Senator Bell has been expressing for some time, we have had an integrated action plan in place for the control of organochlorine residues in beef for the past five years. Under this plan, more than 800,000 cattle have been tested and the organochlorine residue risk status of 130,000 properties has been determined. This plan has ensured that Australia's organochlorine residue violation rate has remained below 0.1 per cent for the past three years. Control measures for at risk properties continue to be administered by the states and territories, rather than the Commonwealth.

         After a thorough process of evaluation I am pleased to announce that the Chief Defence Scientist has decided to adopt the in-house proposals for both functions ahead of a range of external bids. These in-house proposals put together by the staff at Scottsdale were assessed to be superior against the technical criteria and also offered significant cost advantages. I emphasise that these were objective advantages that the current work force was able to demonstrate over the bids from commercial bodies already working in the food science and production fields.

         The circumstances were quite simply that hulls were available to AMSA from ships of precisely the type that AMSA needed. The companies involved in building these ships overseas had defaulted on contracts and these hulls were being made available at bargain basement prices. In fact, representatives of the Australian shipping industry told me that in those circumstances AMSA would have been mad—that was another expression used—to take any decision other than the one it took. At the time that AMSA was considering a replacement vessel for attending navigational aids, a unique opportunity was available—a one-off opportunity—to AMSA because the hulls of precisely the type it needed were available to it at a bargain basement price. This was as a result of financial difficulties in the company that had been manufacturing the hulls overseas.

         The important question that Senator Watson raises is whether there are likely to be additional taxes or penalties on taxpayers. That is, I think, the key issue of concern. I know there was some media speculation that there might be. The situation is that there will not be a fine for late payment imposed upon people because of any activity caused by the industrial dispute.

If yes, is that country the United States? Would the sale of uranium to Taiwan contravene the conditions normally applied by Australia to its uranium sales if the sale were made directly to Taiwan? Is the government seeking a circuitous route for these uranium sales, so as to circumvent the conditions which it maintains to the Australian public guarantee the safety of these sales and does it indicate a higher priority being given to commercial profit than to matters of longer term safety?

         The basic difficulty is that because of its unique international circumstances—which I guess I do not need to more fully describe now—Taiwan is unable to meet all the normal requirements of Australia's uranium export policy. There are three conditions. Firstly, a customer party must be a party to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the NPT: Taiwan, in fact, is a signatory. Secondly, it has to have accepted NPT full scope safeguards administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Taiwan has not satisfied that condition. Thirdly, the party in question must have concluded a bilateral government to government nuclear safeguards agreement with Australia which, again, for technical reasons I have described, Taiwan cannot and has not.

         Canada has reached an agreement with the United States on the application of safeguards to Canadian uranium exports to Taiwan. The Canadian uranium would be processed in the US and re-exported to Taiwan under the coverage of American nuclear safeguards agreements with Taiwan. Officials have discussed with the US the Canada-US-Taiwan supply agreement, and American policy and practice on the conclusion of similar agreements. These discussions imply, however, no commitment that Australia would eventually conclude an agreement similar to Canada's.

         The key issue is whether and on what basis any sales of Australian uranium to Taiwan would be able to satisfy Australia's stringent nuclear safeguards necessary to ensure that uranium was used only for peaceful purposes. The government's overriding concern will be to satisfy ourselves that any arrangements entered into would provide a fully satisfactory safeguards regime consistent with current policy and would thus enhance important nuclear non-proliferation objectives. If there were any doubts on that point, there would be no possibility of uranium sales to Taiwan proceeding.

When Senator Macdonald asked his supplementary question—which was, to say the least, confused, if not gibberish—I said I would attempt to come back with more information once I had had some time to work out exactly what he was asking.

         Of course, that did not stop Senator Macdonald immediately rushing from the chamber and issuing a press statement all over Queensland which said that, because I was going to get more information, this meant that I had not ruled out a new tax or the fact that the tourist industry on the reef was at risk and so on. I suppose in politics one should never be surprised at the tactics of the opposition—certainly the tactics of Senator Macdonald. As I have mentioned before in this place, he distinguished himself greatly in the election campaign by trying to explain the GST three different ways in one day.

         The proposed native title legislation gives certainty over validated titles. It will allow the states and territories to validate freehold, pastoral, residential and commercial leases. Of course, they are the ones which generally underpin tourism operations. We will confirm the existing rights enjoyed by these property holders. This has been confirmed by the Prime Minister in his statement of 8 October and will be in the legislation which is to be introduced into the parliament shortly.

Unless Senator Macdonald is aware of any Aboriginal community maintaining such a link with the two islands in question, he should desist from raising such unnecessary concerns.

As the Minister for Justice has recently announced, it is being addressed in a comprehensive way. He has recently released three discussion papers containing proposals for further major reform of the bankruptcy law. That reform will build on the reforms the government made to the law last year. The proposals are aimed in particular at further improving and modernising the ability of bankruptcy trustees to obtain, for the benefit of creditors, money and property that a bankrupt may have sought to transfer to others in anticipation of bankruptcy. Secondly, we are looking at reforming the provisions relating to arrangements with creditors short of bankruptcy by streamlining them and dealing with areas open to abuse. Thirdly, we are looking at streamlining the administration of bankruptcy—for example, by providing a one-stop service for voluntary bankruptcy. The Minister for Justice recently released discussion papers on these areas. They have been distributed widely amongst practitioners in the field, from accountancy to the legal professions and from financial counsellors to major credit institutions. Advice has been sought.

Deadlines for comment range from 15 October for the first paper to 29 October for the second and 26 November for the third paper, which is on administrative arrangements. The government is keen to address the issues raised in these papers and the comment in response to them. We anticipate that legislation will be introduced in the second parliamentary sittings in 1994 for debate in what we hope to be the third.

        It is also a fact that this union, a deregistered union, is receiving federal government funding—that is, taxpayers' money—for its amalgamation campaign. The very newsletter from which I quoted is funded by the taxpayer. The foot of page 2 of this newsletter contains the statement:

        THIS LEAFLET FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

        So there we have it. The union itself has admitted that first it is deregistered and, secondly, that it is receiving federal government funding. One can only wonder what other activities of this deregistered union are being funded by taxpayers' money as a result of this federal Labor government's largess to a deregistered union. This is the federal government funding a federally deregistered union.

         The newsletter, which is funded by the taxpayer, is also engaging in party political campaigning by attacking the Liberal Party in South Australia dishonestly. It refers to changes to state industrial laws in several states which it says have resulted from the election of Liberal governments in those states. It claims that these changes attack workers' rights and conditions.

        This is grossly dishonest. The industrial relations policy of the Liberal Party in South Australia clearly spells out its proposals.

         Instead, the union movement and the state government have embarked on a grossly dishonest campaign of lies and deception by suggesting that the Liberals in South Australia have some hidden agenda and that the industrial relations policy that they have clearly spelt out and put in the public arena is not the real policy. That is not true, and it has not washed with the public either. It is a desperate attempt to save what is a doomed Labor government in that state.

         It may be the right of the union movement to campaign against the Liberal Party in South Australia, although we can question the dishonesty of such a campaign.

        In other words, this union is putting itself above the law. It does not matter what the community wants or what a democratically elected government might want; this union will ignore the wishes of the people and ride roughshod over them. This is typical of the attitude of many union heavies. The federal government is fostering this attitude with its IR package of legislation, due to be introduced to this parliament shortly, which further entrenches special privileges for unionists. It is also fostering it with grants of taxpayers' money to unions like this.

         So the government must stand condemned for this. The Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator McMullan, must stand condemned for being unaware that this union, the Australian Building and Construction Workers Federation, is a deregistered union that is nevertheless receiving federal government funds for its campaign against the Liberal Party in South Australia. As I said, that campaign certainly will not save Labor in South Australia in the election which has now been announced for 11 December. For a decade that party has presided over South Australia's demise, and the voters are simply waiting to throw it out.

         —At least in the penultimate sentence of his speech Senator Chapman got to the nub of his intent. It was an attempt to start a campaign for the South Australian state election, which was called today. I suppose that we will get a lot of this between now and 11 December, but at least it puts all that feigned righteous indignation into some perspective. It was simply an attempt to make a speech to those few people who remained listening after Senator Chapman started.

         To those few who remain, I will say some simple things. I said in answer to the question that, to the best of my knowledge, the South Australian branch of that union had never been deregistered. That is the case and has always been the case. Therefore, all the remaining branches of the BLF, to use its shortened title, are registered legal organisations operating within the industrial relations law of Australia and of the states in question, as is the CMFEU, the union with which it is seeking to amalgamate.

         Therefore, they are perfectly legitimate recipients of what is not only a lawful, but also a sensible and positive program of assistance in the amalgamation of unions. It is in Australia's interest to have fewer unions. In the building industry, in particular, there is a history of some conflict between unions. There will be much greater stability in the industry if those unions are amalgamated. It is, therefore, in the national interest that we should provide some assistance to do so.

         In April 1993 the CFMEU and the remaining state branches of the BLF reached agreement on a process to bring forward the amalgamation of the unions, and we welcome that. The process is continuing, with ballots either being held or to be held during the remainder of this year. That amalgamation, if it comes to pass, will be a significant contribution to stability in the building and construction industry and to enhanced industrial relations. Therefore, these bodies come within the normal ambit of the sort of assistance that is made available to unions in assisting amalgamation. It is a policy the government has had and articulated on many occasions and one which it continues to support. These are lawful bodies being attacked simply because there is a state election coming up and Senator Chapman thought that a bit of union bashing might get the campaign off to a good start.

         —The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) waxed lyrical this afternoon about the so-called involvement of the non-government sector and parents in the development of the accreditation procedures for child care. I would have to say, at the kindest, that the truth is that there was minimal consultation. A gun was placed at the head of the whole industry and it was told, `We are going ahead to have accreditation; do you want to consult or don't you?'. People who were dead against the concept were involved to the extent of finding out what was going on. Since the new council has been established to implement the accreditation, there has been no parental involvement at all and I understand that the representatives of the non-government sector are effectively not representatives at all. That is the first thing about which the minister was misleading the Senate.

         The second thing is that, because this is a very ideological issue with some elements of this government, and certainly with the department, we are effectively getting a compulsory accreditation system which the government is denying is compulsory. It is truly compulsory. I cannot think of anything that is much more compulsory. When the government says in its delegated legislation that fee relief will be payable only to parents whose children attend an accredited child-care centre, what message does that send? Effectively, parents who cannot afford to pay all their child care will be compelled to send their children to a centre which has been accredited. The opposition supports voluntary accreditation. We certainly support quality of child care but, above all, we support the right of the parents to decide what is best for their child.

         I am concerned that today on ABC radio the minister, Senator Crowley, said that the government was also looking to move the accreditation process to the family day-care schemes. I take this opportunity to warn other sectors of the child-care industry, especially those involved in family day care, of the secret agenda of Senator Crowley and the government. This is simply another big sister tactic which is going to limit the parents' right to the choice of child care.

         We have seen quite clearly that the government believes that child care is too important to be left to parents. We have to ask: what is going to be the next step? Will the neighbour or the child carer who is brought into the home, if there are several children, be compelled to come under the government's bureaucratic wing and apply for compulsory accreditation? I think that will be very easy for the government to organise. After all, it is going down the line of making child-care cash rebates available to people using child care in the informal sector. Sixty per cent of children in child care are cared for in the informal sector.

Senator Crowley let the cat out of the bag this morning when she gave a bit of an indication about which way she is going. It looks as though the people in her department who have never been very sympathetic to the informal child-care sector are heading down the line of crushing it. I am afraid that the government's long-term plan is to stamp out all parts of the industry, except the unionised, formal, government-funded long day care centres.

         Let us get another detail straight. Today the minister suggested that the non-government, private and not-for-profit child-care centres which are not receiving funds were getting funding. The truth is that parents are getting funding in those centres through fee relief. We are concerned about the fact that the only people who are really supportive of the government's moves are those people in the unionised sector who receive capital funding to establish the child-care centres in the first place and who receive operational funding to continue to keep it high cost child care—Rolls Royce child care—and funded pretty well entirely by the government.

         It is amazing how much more value for money parents are able to achieve in the informal child-care sector and in the private child-care formal sector. It is astonishing that the government, which claims to be concerned about providing more child-care places for children, is not prepared to encourage these sorts of child-care areas, knowing full well, despite the minister's disclaimer, that regulations in every state require a high standard of facilities for children. The minister is trying to involve parents and staff in the management committees of small businesses. It is incredible. Local and small businesses would not wear it; why should child-care centres?

It is very difficult to understand exactly what Senator Newman's argument would be.

The Australian Federation of Child-Care Associations is now divided and the coalition of private child care in Victoria is not unified on this matter at all.

         I think the last lines of Senator Newman's speech give us a clue. She said that some of the private child-care organisations regard themselves as small businesses and do not want parents on their committees of management. That is more or less what Senator Newman said. What an extraordinary thing to say. It is a presumption of one of the outcomes. It is also a presumption that the parents and coordinators implementing the accreditation process which the private and public child-care providers and users worked out themselves should now be rearranged and misconstrued to suggest that the parents might be wanting to take over the small business.

        Today Senator Schacht was simply parroting an inane, puerile and inaccurate answer given by the Minister for Resources, Mr Lee, in the other chamber. I asked a question yesterday about the very serious effects Aboriginal claims on Green Island and Fitzroy Island would have on investment in the tourism industry. Senator Schacht and Mr Lee seem to be suggesting that I have made up and raised unprovoked the question of Aboriginal claims on these islands. Anyone who can read the paper—I suppose that is why Senator Schacht and Mr Lee are having problems—will have seen reported in yesterday's

         The question I asked yesterday was not answered by the dorothy dixers today. Does the minister not understand the uncertainty that these sorts of claims are bringing to the tourism industry and to investment in the tourism industry? In far North Queensland, in fact all along the Queensland coast—Australia's premier tourism region—there is a lot of concern about these claims and the effect that they will have on investment in the tourism industry.

Mr Lee, in his answer, has drawn some comfort from reports attributed to Daikyo and its Managing Director, Mr John Gayler, who stuck up for his mate, Mr Hawke, and got shafted by the rest of them in the ALP.

There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever—the government and its legal advisers will admit this if they are pressed on it, and Senator Richardson knows it—that those leases are not immune from claims.

         There is no certainty over any of those leases, which cover about 40 per cent of Australia and some of the best tourism country in Australia, including Broome in our own state, Mr Deputy President, and Green Island in Senator Ian Macdonald's state. The government legislation does nothing to return certainty to these leases. Until certainty is returned, investment in those industries will be a major concern. That is the point that needs to be understood by everyone in Australia. The government has not resolved the question. It is seeking to pretend that it has resolved it. As the facts become clearer, the Mabo mark III package will unravel as just about every other package that this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has brought down on any other subject.

        The essence of the answer was that the Senate should congratulate—that we all should congratulate—the staff of the Scottsdale materials research laboratory which achieved success in a tender process to allow it to continue operating virtually as it has been. As part of his answer, the minister said:

        It was very nice of the minister to say such a thing—it was pretty smarmy political stuff—but the direct inference of that statement is that any proposal to remove the facility would have had a negative economic and social effect on the community.

         However, there was no such failure on behalf of a considerable number of representatives of Tasmanian electorates. Senator Newman, who is in the chamber now, was at the forefront in recognising that that deleterious effect would have occurred if Scottsdale's materials research laboratory had been removed, which was the plan of this government and the administration which first perpetrated it. It was also opposed by Senator Harradine, by me and by any number of state politicians from Tasmania with support from the academic research community throughout Tasmania. There were numerous petitions and notices of motion given on this matter trying to tell the minister and his department that this was a wrong move.

        In the limited time I have available to me I would like to remind the Senate of some of the pre-election rhetoric from the government on Medicare and on the health system of Australia because it is easy to forget what was said just a few months ago. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in a press release on 22 February, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have a simple, affordable system of universal health care. It means no-one is denied medical treatment because they can't afford to pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then on 24 February, at the government's policy launch speech at Bankstown, the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We will open Medicare up to the private hospital system, so that it can purchase an estimated 10,000 private hospital beds per year for people on waiting lists.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 5 March he said that the funding in Medicare was working. He was very explicit. Also, in an interview with Alan Jones just two days before the election, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That's where Medicare is fair as it pushes out the private doctors and private insurance. They'll rip the sick apart.

        That is the Prime Minister of this country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the things that I am concerned about, too, is this question about the admittance for elective surgery. The Prime Minister said on 25 February:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We've got half a percentage problem in hospital admittance for elective surgery, therefore we should wreck Medicare and put in basically a private health insurance system. I mean, it would be an absurdity.

         On another occasion a few days earlier he said that only about 2.5 per cent of patients were on the waiting lists. The current Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) has revised those estimates of the Prime Minister. The minister for health at the time, Mr Brian Howe, said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the average waiting time for elective surgery in this country is one month, there are some people waiting longer for particular types of surgery, such as hip replacements . . .

        But he was going around talking about this one-month nonsense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr Howe talked about extra funding to help with the waiting lists. He said that this extra funding would help shorten waiting lists. Of course, what he did not tell the Australian people—and we have been told since by the new minister—is that there is no real way of measuring the waiting lists. He said that the states did not actually collect those figures and others calculate them in different ways.

         The then minister for health emphasised strongly that there was no crisis in the health care system and that these waiting lists of 100,000 people were really just playing with figures, effectively, and that it was all some awful political plot against the government. Of course, the reality is that in came a new Minister for Health and he acknowledged that this was, in fact, a serious matter that needed addressing. But the Prime Minister and his Minister for Health in the months leading up to the election tried to convince the Australian people otherwise.

         Much of this discussion is about waiting lists and I think we should start to put it in perspective. Even if we accepted the extraordinary figures that the opposition used during the election campaign, and in particular Dr Bob Woods—if anyone can remember him; he was the one who was slaughtered in Lowe—one would have to accept that today 97 per cent of Australians who turn up at the doors of a public hospital in Australia get treated promptly, get treated well and are satisfied. There can be some delays with some three per cent of Australians.

         When we talk about waiting lists and efforts to try to reduce them, the first point to make is that there must be waiting lists. There ought to be waiting lists. Senator Herron as a surgeon would know that one does not treat everybody tomorrow afternoon. Every surgeon and every specialist wants to know what he or she is doing in the months ahead and will plan a schedule. That is quite normal. Every hospital in the country, public or private, has to know what is going to happen in its operating theatres in three months time or six months time. They will always need to know that.

         In looking at health costs in Australia, it is important to note that we have hovered between eight and 8 1/2 per cent of GDP for some years. That is a very, very healthy figure for Australia to be at. It is higher than the figure in the UK, but it is nowhere near the US where it is currently 14 per cent. Only a few weeks ago papers released by the Democrat administration announcing its reforms suggested that the figure may blow out to some 20 per cent during the next decade. Those massive blow-outs must not occur here. In a country like Australia we have other things to spend our money on. If we are going to develop as a nation in the way that we need to, we have to make sure that we have some kind of hold on health costs.

         The only way that I would consider recommending gap insurance to the party of which I am a member would be to make sure that it also effectively capped doctors' fees. That would mean that funds will have to contract with private hospitals and doctors to determine the fees in advance of the procedures being carried out. If they can keep doctors to whatever gap is allowed, then those funds will stay in business.

What Senator Herron has to understand—and there are many things he does not—is that, even according to the private health industry, up to 40 per cent of those who drop out claim the reason they did is that they get hit by huge bills by some of his mates when they go to hospital. They think they are covered for the lot but they do not get it because Senator Herron and his mates charge too much. I should not say that, because there are those who tell me that Senator Herron is a very fair man—I would not ever want to accuse him of not being fair—but, certainly, there are too many who charge too much. At some point Australia must address that issue. I know that those opposite have a vested interest in never addressing it, but we on this side of the house do not have that vested interest and we will never let it guide us or rule us. We just will not. We will not accept anything like an uncapped, unlimited gap insurance that will just blow health costs right out of the window. We never will.

         I return to the question of bulkbilling, which I am definitely going to get out. In the last election campaign, when those opposite sought to abolish it, they made some terrible mistakes. Firstly, they tried to reduce the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. What they did, of course, was create a tremendous disincentive for doctors to bulkbill. So great was that disincentive that there is no way they have even been bulkbilling for pensioners or for the unemployed. We were going to get to the stage where up-front out-of-pocket costs were the order of the day. If doctors chose to charge an up-front fee, low income earners, who currently pay nothing when they visit a GP—when they are ill they can go in and come out without paying anything—would have to find the AMA price of $32 before they could claim any rebates. If the rent is due, or the budget is tight, or a couple of the kids are sick, those kinds of up-front out-of-pocket costs simply cannot be met.

We are constantly being told by this government that there is no room for inefficient industries in this country.

         If the issue is one of private insurance contribution to the Australian hospitals system, which is currently running at around $2 billion a year, why does the government not simply move to replace that contribution by raising the Medicare levy and making it much more progressive to ensure that higher income earners really pay their way? Increasing the Medicare levy by one per cent would more than cover the current contribution from private health insurance.

         Let us just look at the industry itself. It carries on all the time about how people are leaving private health insurance as though it is some sort of great government conspiracy. The simple fact is that people are deciding not to take up private health insurance because they know it is not cost-effective for them. For example, for an average family of two adults and two children, the average cost of private health insurance has been calculated at $50,000 more than the value of the benefits received over the lifetime of the parents. That information comes from a Health Issues Centre research paper of September this year.

         In other words, if one family put its health insurance premiums in the bank and used that money to pay for its health care costs as it required it, it would be $50,000 better off than the family that took out private health insurance. That is certainly efficient for the health insurance companies, but not for the paying customers.

         There are other interesting facts about the private health insurance industry which hardly ever see the light of day in debates such as this. The minister has many more options that he acknowledges he should be considering. For example, the Commonwealth subsidises private funds to the tune of at least $500 million a year. This comes about because a significant proportion of public hospital beds are occupied by private patients and the full cost of the occupancy of a public bed is not recovered from the private insurers. This subsidy disadvantages the private hospitals.

I have to ask him again why issues such as that are not on the table.

I think he should take another look at where his advice is coming from and at who will actually benefit from the reforms that he is suggesting. I do not believe the ultimate beneficiaries will be ordinary Australians who simply want access when they need it to quality health care. No, I think the ultimate beneficiaries will be the private health insurance companies and some doctors.

         Why do we have so many Australians, on the one hand, in our hospitals who should not be there and, on the other hand, people wanting to get into hospital who cannot? I have spent the last eight months visiting a wide range of hospitals. Basically the answer comes back to a lack of community support services. It comes back to the fact that in rural South Australia at 1 a.m. a `kind policeman' does not lock up a drunk and disorderly person; the policeman sends that person to hospital.

         It comes back to the fact that, in places like rural South Australia—particularly on the west coast—mental health problems are largely ignored. There are virtually no community services; there is only one psychiatrist outside Adelaide. So what happens? The brunt of the problem is borne by the public hospital system. I could go on to give examples of specific hospitals where one can see elderly patients with dementia in a four-bed ward with three surgical patients; that is not uncommon. I would suggest that the minister at the table, Senator Schacht, also visit some of those small rural hospitals in South Australia.

Why do we have to have 30 elderly residents before we can have a nursing home? Why do we have rural hospitals with whole wards shut—wards that could easily be converted into nursing home type accommodation? Government regulations and restrictions prohibit that from happening, so people have to share surgical wards in totally inappropriate accommodation options. It is certainly most distressing for nursing staff to have those sorts of difficulties facing them on a day-by-day basis.

But let us look at some of the specific problems as to where money should be spent now. It is very inefficient to end up with people in hospital who should not be there. It is probably the most expensive option for someone suffering from dementia or for someone who has a drug dependency problem. We should be looking at a whole range of community services across this country to take pressure off our hospitals rather than continuing this never-ending debate of public versus private.

        Dr John Paterson is the secretary to the Department of Health and Community Services in Victoria; he is a very highly respected member both of the bureaucracy and of the health department. What was said is not coming from an opposition senator; it is coming from a bureaucrat. I spelt all these things out in my maiden speech on 17 September 1990. It is a tragedy that everything that I forecast in that speech three years ago has gradually accelerated faster than I believed would happen in relation to our health care system.

         When I made my maiden speech, 61.5 per cent of the population was covered by private health insurance. The figure is now down to 40 per cent. It is decreasing faster than I predicted. It has done down by 21 per cent in three years. The premiums have gone up and people cannot afford to pay them. The rates have gone up over 100 per cent in the past five years; people are dropping out because they are broke as a result of the recession. Senator Richardson has now come up with a plan that he is going to tax the rich. The Australian Democrats always tax the rich, not the poor.

He does not know, for instance, that less than 40 per cent of people in Australia actually pay any Medicare levy. Surprised?

         Some people pay a Medicare levy of $50 a year. They say, `I'm entitled to Medicare; I've paid my Medicare levy'. The fact that health care costs $1,800 a year per head of population in this country is immaterial. On the other hand—this is where the lack of logic comes in—the minister talks about the exorbitant medical fees. He says, `We've got to cap the fees of the doctors'. What happened? The minister is already claiming that in the last 14 years eight per cent of gross domestic product has been spent on health care and it has not increased. The minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that the government has been successful in controlling health care costs for 14 years when it is now going to cap them.

         If the minister's logic was correct, why did the percentage of GDP spent on health care not escalate with these exorbitant fees? Fees only account for 18 per cent of the expenditure. If the government put fees up by 25 per cent, it would increase costs by 4.5 per cent; if it decreased fees by 25 per cent, it would decrease costs by 4.5 per cent. So there is no logic in it. Forget the logic; it is just ideology! The Labor Party ran a dishonest campaign in the last election in relation to Medicare. We have never said we were going to abolish Medicare.

         There is a simple answer to all of this, which ideologically the Labor Party cannot cope with. The answer is to encourage low and middle income earners into private health insurance and into the private hospital system. I am not talking about the rich ones. The rich carry their own insurance. Any private hospital will tell us that between 10 and 15 per cent of people who go to private hospitals pay their own way. They are not covered by Medicare; they just pay their own way. In some instances it is probably cheaper to do that with insurance premiums up to nearly $2,000 a year. If one is well and fit and carries insurance over 10 years, one has $20,000 saved up which can pay for something that at the maximum might cost $4,000 or $5,000. There is logic in it.

         As Senator Richardson has said, people do not have to wait for emergency service. The existence of waiting lists for elective surgery is not an indication of the failure of the public health system. Rather, booking lists and waiting lists are essential planning tools. From memory, which goes back many years—more than most people in this place—such lists have always existed and will always exist with or without Medicare. The non-existence of lists could indicate a serious oversupply of hospital resources, which perhaps should be allocated elsewhere.

         Waiting lists relate not only to bed supply but also to the availability of specialist doctors, for example. There are growing numbers of procedures available now that were not available in the past, such as hip replacement, which has been mentioned today, and major heart surgery. Those procedures were not available to anyone when I was younger. Therefore, there were no waiting lists because there was nothing to wait for. The real issue is whether patients have to wait longer than is clinically acceptable. Senator Richardson has spoken about what has been done to increase bed capacity.

         I return to the quote from the budget papers which said that `palliative care funding will also help reduce waiting lists'. Senator Lees said that particularly in country hospitals many beds are being occupied by people who would be more appropriately cared for in other sorts of facilities—for example, people with a psychiatric illness could be occupying hospital beds—including palliative care facilities. What most people would prefer if they were in need of palliative care is to be at home with intensive palliative care assistance. The measures in the budget will help to make that possible.

         Personally I am a wholehearted supporter of Medicare, without private cover, who would be happy to pay a much higher levy as long as I still had Medicare cover. I do not have a great deal of faith in the private hospital system for good reasons, which I will not go into here because they might be defamatory.

         I do not know where the figures that Senator Herron quoted came from. I have no doubt that they were valid figures but I do not know what the figure was that he was multiplying to come to that result. It would all depend on the proportion being paid.

         Such a scheme would not only maintain the present funds for Medicare but also allow its cover to extend to other health areas, such as clinical psychology which is dear to my heart. As a psychologist I have had to refer people to a psychiatrist knowing they would get more appropriate treatment from a clinical psychologist. This is due to the fact that there is no Medicare cover for that and, therefore, there is no alternative but to send them to a psychiatrist. In a similar way more money could be released for preventive health measures of various sorts as we saw in the budget with the provision for dental treatment for health card holders. I urge senators to oppose this urgency motion.

         I rise to speak on this important efficiency audit by the Australian National Audit Office in relation to the Department of Social Security's data-matching program. Honourable senators will well remember that the necessary legislation to facilitate the introduction of this program passed through the Senate in December 1990. Considerable concern was expressed by both the coalition and the Australian Democrats in the months leading up to the passing of this legislation about the privacy implications of this initiative and the assumptions underlying the estimated savings to be derived from the program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          At that time the government claimed that the data matching would be a central element of its fraud control strategy. According to the Labor government, its introduction would conservatively result in savings of at least $300 million per year. In addition, the parliament was assured that the technology that had been earmarked by the bureaucracy to undertake this program would ensure that the intrinsically intrusive nature of this fraud control method would be minimised.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We were also informed that the success of the program depended directly upon a significant extension of the tax file number. People will remember that when the tax file number was introduced the previous Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), promised Australia that it would never need to be extended for any purpose other than taxation. But he broke another promise by extending it to the social security system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In the end, the Labor government secured the passage of this legislation by way of the not too subtle technique that it usually uses of a gun to the head of the coalition. The coalition was told that, if it opposed the bill, it would be branded as supporting people who deliberately fraud the social security system. When I suggested that we change a word, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, wrote to Dr Hewson claiming that changing a single word in the bill would result in lost savings of up to $150 million a year.

          This audit report not only shows that the government's loaded gun was not loaded at all; it also clearly demonstrates that virtually every one of the concerns expressed by the coalition was entirely valid. As I said, the government claimed that the savings from this program would be $300 million a year. The auditor has concluded:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The downward variation in payments, which were the basis of the original estimates, represent only 17 million dollars of the 1992-93 savings.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is a damning indictment of the assumptions that were used in the calculation of the original savings estimates. The minister and his bureaucrats were claiming that their savings estimates were conservative. Now we find that a mere six per cent of these savings are being realised. We were told that $150 million would be down the tube if we changed one word.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          A year ago, I highlighted to the Senate how the Department of Social Security was camouflaging this embarrassing saving shortfall. In its answers to questions that I put in Senate estimates committee hearings, the department had continued to claim that the annual savings from the data-matching program were in excess of $70 million during 1992-93. But a closer examination of these latest claims shows that some $40 million of these savings are a direct result of the so-called deterrent factor and not directly related to data matching whatsoever; that is, when people found out that there was data matching involved or that the tax file number would be taken, they decided to declare their real income, to withdraw from applying for social security or whatever else they decided to do.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          A further $13 million was attributable to identified overpayments which were also not included in the original savings estimates. In effect, this means that the department has changed the basis upon which it calculates its derived savings after the commencement of the program. Worst of all, it has quite deliberately tried to give the Australian parliament the false impression that the savings from this program are higher than they actually are. The Auditor-General's report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The DSS saving estimates available at June 1993 contained changes in methodology from the previous estimates, which should be clearly indicated. The ANAO considers that, when reporting to Parliament, the detailed basis on which DSS calculates estimates of savings from the program needs to be more transparent, with changes in methodology explained.
        </para>
        <para>
         This matter is central to the concerns expressed by the non-government parties in 1990. At that time it was necessary for senators to make an informed decision as to whether the financial savings to be derived from data matching warranted the introduction of such an intrusive method of fraud control. In effect, we were asked to undertake a cost-benefit analysis that entailed an assessment not only of the financial costs and benefits but of the privacy repercussions as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is disturbing to see that the department has not seen fit to undertake its own cost-benefit analysis of the program, despite the fact that analyses are a requirement of the program protocol that was passed with the data-matching legislation. The Auditor-General found in his report:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The full range of costs incurred by the data-matching program are substantially in excess of those previously quantified by DSS in their reports on progress.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is estimated that the annual costs entailed in the data-matching program are about $14 million. This means that a program that entails matching the confidential financial and personal data of up to 11 million Australians on an ongoing basis is being legitimised on the basis of net savings that may be as low as $3 million per year. This is a long shot, and way out from the estimates trundled out by the government less than three years ago.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The auditor has suggested that the department conduct detailed cost-benefit analyses to assess the cost-effectiveness of the program more fully. It must be noted that the department has moved quickly to respond to this recommendation and included an analysis in its recently tabled report, which unfortunately I did not have the chance to speak on because I dashed down to the chamber to find that it had already gone through. However, it is quite telling that it had not seen fit to do so until it received this, what I would see as, not so gentle a reminder from the Auditor.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There can be no doubt that the data-matching program was and is technology driven. Three years ago a number of officers from the department went overseas to acquaint themselves with a new technology that would allow the automatic matching of millions of pieces of data in a relatively short period of time. The fact that this program is technology driven is recognised by the Auditor-General, who states in his report:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A key factor justifying the data-matching program was information technology developments which allowed millions of matches to be undertaken automatically resulting in the confirmation of voluntary compliance by clients in a great majority of cases.
        </para>
        <para>
         However, the Auditor-General's report also reveals that the department has not been administering this technology driven program in the most efficient way possible. For example, it has been shown that a massive 85 per cent of the so-called matches that are identified through the data-matching process are not actually matches at all.

          In some ways I wish Senator Powell were still here to have seen this Auditor-General's report. In fact, I feel inclined to post it to her. We sat through that committee hearing and we heard the officers from the department telling us that there would be 100 per cent accuracy. They told us that when we got a `hit', when it was a match, it would be definitely a positive hit and it would be somebody who was not giving the correct information or who was giving information to Social Security about their income that was not the same as the information in the Taxation Office.

          We were told categorically that a match would be a match—that it would be a `hit' was the word they used. And what do we find?  We find that 85 per cent of the reviews that are undertaken to resolve the data-matching results do not reveal an incorrect payment. They are wrong 85 per cent of the time. We match data on millions of people in Australia who are not defrauding the system. They get pulled out of the system, they get examined in much more detail and they have not done one single thing wrong. We were told categorically—Senator Richardson would remember; he was sitting there listening to it and he heard Mr Trevor Murphy say to us over and over again—`When we get a hit it will be right; we will be spot-on. Someone will be in receipt of an overpayment'.

          Mr Murphy was wrong. Somehow the department now is examining 85 per cent of those matches which do not reveal an incorrect payment. But not only that; these 85 per cent represent some 64,000 clients whose financial and personal arrangements are subjected to departmental review without good reason.

          The auditor has highlighted the fact that annual labour saving costs of $2.9 million would result if 46 cent or 30,000 of the unsuccessful matches could be eliminated. So we would have made savings if the department had got it right, if a hit was a hit, as it was called. But no, we find that 85 per cent of those people indicated as hits have not been in receipt of an overpayment. If we could correct 46 per cent of those, if we could eliminate those incorrect ones, then there would be approximately $2.9 million worth of savings.

Fortunately, the data-matching act does not allow the department to stop the continuation of a benefit as a result of data matching. Can you imagine all these people having their social security reduced or cut out because we had found these `hits', that were going to be so right as Mr Murphy said?  Benefit does not stop, because they have to receive a section 11 letter; it has to be sent to the client first. This means that the review of the so-called match can be undertaken before a person's benefit is put in jeopardy. So we get these hits and the department then checks them. When the department has checked the match and believes that there has been an overpayment it sends out a section 11 letter.

          Unfortunately, the auditor has found that a high proportion of section 11 letters are successfully disputed by clients. This means that the department is drawing inaccurate conclusions even after it has reviewed the so-called matches. So it does the matches, they come out of the computer, they are checked—these were the matches that were going to be 100 per cent right—and the department sends out section 11 letters, and still gets it wrong in 11 per cent of the cases. They have to provide evidence to the Department of Social Security.

          These are not the only data-matching related inefficiencies that have been highlighted by the auditor. He has recommended that the Department of Social Security distribute the costs incurred in data matching with the other government agencies that benefit from it. I am not sure but I think I also asked that question somewhere along the line. It is also recommended that greater emphasis be put on analysing the cost-effectiveness of each of the 70-odd projects that make up the data-matching program.

          The auditor also concludes that variations between Department of Social Security officers are wider than necessary and recommends that it, and I quote because I do not like to use this word, `prioritise a reduction in the variability of the performance between offices, building upon the national quality assurance results'. Significantly, the auditor has concluded that up to $12 million in savings could be achieved by investigating clients whose benefits are either cancelled or voluntarily surrendered as a result of not providing their tax file numbers.

          Finally, this audit report cannot be allowed to pass without making some comments about the extension of the use of the tax file number. I just said that the previous Treasurer, our now Prime Minister, promised us that the tax file number would not be extended. We were told that it was vital and necessary for this intrusive data-matching program that we should extend the tax file numbers. We were told that it was an integral part of the program. The distinct impression we were given was that, without the use of the tax file numbers, the data-matching program would be rendered largely unworkable. In stark contrast, the auditor has found that no identity frauds have been detected from data-matching projects like invalid or inconsistent tax file numbers that are used to identify personal identity data discrepancies.

Other identifiers may be able to be used for the purposes of income matching and alternative strategies are being examined for handling personal identity discrepancies.

           We were told that we needed to extend the tax file number to make sure that we could catch people who were defrauding the social security system. We were told that the government would make $300 million of savings, and that was so far out that it is a joke. We were told that when a match was made, when data came across and was matched with the social security data, people plucked out of the computer would in fact be in receipt of an overpayment. The government was wrong, and it has been wrong on so many of these issues.

          There we were, the `unrepresentative swill' as we are referred to by the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister, in that Senate committee, without the resources of the department, asking questions about protecting the privacy of millions of Australians. We asked pertinent questions about protecting many people who are not even involved in the social security system, such as people's spouses whose tax information is matched—millions of people who are involved in this data-matching process. With hindsight, those questions were absolutely spot-on. The department knew less about it than we appeared to know from examining the situation very closely.

          I urge all senators, who have to make a decision within the next 24 hours or so as to whether the sunset clause that applies to the data-matching program should be removed, at least to read the summary of the Auditor-General's report. In particular, I ask the Green senators, the Democrat senator responsible for taking social security legislation through, and Senator Harradine, to read this summary and to decide for themselves whether we should let that sunset clause go. Should we say, `No; we still want to have a sunset clause to say that there is a period after which we may not accept this data-matching process'?

Those amendments went through the Senate to ensure that the Senate would be fully informed about what I believe is a very intrusive investigation into people's personal financial matters.

They have lifted their game in the recent report because of the not so gentle reminder from the Auditor-General. I call on honourable senators to read the summary of this report. I commend it to them, especially given the decision that we have to make in the chamber in the next day or two.

        —I was addressing this particular legislation this morning before we were required, as a Senate, to deliver the address-in-reply to the Governor-General. I was drawing attention to the response in the House of Representatives to the precedents that had been highlighted by and commented on by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams. Mr Williams commented on those precedents and assertions in the following terms:

       If one looks first at the Public Service Act provision, it can be seen that this is a provision which protects a person in the preparation of a report in the course of employment where it is done in good faith. It is not a provision that relates to the publication of a report; it relates to the preparation. One might want to argue that, in that respect, it merely restates the common law. To that extent, it might be suggested validly that it constitutes a precedent, but it is not in any way relevant to a situation where, a report or statement having been prepared in the ordinary course of the work of a department, the minister then elects to make it public.

        If one looks at section 91 of the Freedom of Information Act, one finds that this also does not relate to the publication of a document at all except in a very narrow sense. It provides that no action for defamation or other specified forms of action lies against the Commonwealth, an agency, a minister or an officer by reason of the authorising or giving of the access to a document pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

        Given that there are no precedents for this action, why does the government claim that it is now necessary in this case? What actions have been taken by the minister in the past against this clause? Neither of these questions has been adequately answered by the minister or by the parliamentary secretary, and I am hoping that the minister in this chamber may be able to shed some light on this particular matter.

        The second reading speech refers to the fact that this amendment will save litigation costs. Of course, if people are barred from suing, litigation costs are saved. It has made us curious as to just how much litigation has been incurred by the minister when carrying out his duties or attempting to carry out his duties in relation to this area.

        Finally, this is not a case of what has happened in the past. It is a case of what the minister anticipates or contemplates will happen in the future. Does the minister expect to deal differently with relevant organisations in the future or does he know something about the intentions of certain organisations or individuals towards him and about legal action that might thus be precluded?

        We certainly have the right to be very suspicious of the unprecedented and unnecessary actions that are currently being proposed under clause 4 in this particular piece of legislation. The second reading speech claims that an effect of this clause would be to save litigation costs. At least it says it should save litigation costs. There is a difference between `does' and `should'. Litigation costs are saved if the action is won. Under the present law as it relates to defamation, if one is sued unsuccessfully by someone then one can claim costs against that person. On the other hand, if a person's suing is successful, then it is open to that person to apply for an order for costs.

        I do not see the justification of the argument for the need for this clause as being to save costs. Persons save costs if they are in the right. If the minister is acting properly under the act and he is authorised to do a number of things under the act, then that should not be a problem. However, if this clause is intended to extend the ability of the minister to behave in certain ways which would otherwise lead to defamation actions, I fear that this could lead to a very substantial and serious reduction in rights that are available to Australian citizens now.

        I have received representations from some very concerned organisations in the disability portfolio area. Minister Howe has not consulted with the organisations representing people with disabilities about this clause. They are extremely concerned that the minister may well use this particular clause to his own advantage and that it will lead to serious reductions in the rights of disability organisations and their members. To date, neither I nor the disability organisations that I have consulted have had any information from the government to convince me otherwise.

       To make that just a little more intelligible, the heading under which this section appears in the act is `Information about Minister's declaration may be made available to the public'. Section 14G, which is referred to in section 14J, appears under the heading `Failure to meet applicable standards in the provision of service'. So it has to do with the withdrawal of funding from those organisations that are not meeting the applicable standards. Section 14G allows the minister to make a declaration stating that the eligible organisation is not meeting the applicable standards in respect of the provision of the service and, consequently, is in breach of the conditions of the grant. That all seems quite reasonable and we have not objected to that in the past.

        Section 14G, however, goes on to say that the minister must provide a copy of the declaration to the eligible organisation concerned. Section 14H says that the minister must not make a declaration under section 14G unless a disability standards review panel has been established; that the requirements of the orders have been complied with; that the minister has complied with the guidelines in force under section 5 that relate to the making of such a declaration; that an eligible organisation has applied under the orders to the panel for a review; and that the minister, in making the declaration, has had regard to the recommendations made by the panel. That spells it out a little further and shows that the minister has a fair amount of latitude. Section 5, referred to in section 14H, states:

        The minister has a lot of power to decide just what he wants to have happen, which is right and proper. Governments ought to have that power. However, if the minister is of a mind to withdraw someone's grant, then that organisation also has some rights which relate to the disability standards review panel. The minister, however, must only take regard of the recommendations of the panel. He is not bound by them. He can still go ahead and decide not to extend the grant or renew the grant or whatever. He may also make public certain information.

Those rights are now available in the case of malice, for example, but presumably would disappear once we take away the right of action for defamation. I would like to point out to the minister what Dr Theophanous, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, said at the end of the committee stage in the House of Representatives. He said:

The best course of action is for the matter to be further examined. There are obviously contrasting legal opinions in relation to this issue. Our advice is different. I am not suggesting that the information given by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) is incorrect; I am just saying that there is a difference in legal advice in relation to this matter. However, I will have the matter further investigated. In the meantime, the best way to proceed is for this clause to be proceeded with.

I am not sure whether the opposition would be prepared to accept the whole thing if the words `in good faith' were also added to paragraph (a) of the proposed subsection. That is a possible compromise. If not, I think all these suggestions need to be referred to further when the minister examines the issue and the Attorney-General's Department gives further advice. As I said, I will recommend to the Minister that the question be further considered in the Senate in relation to this particular clause but at this time, it is our intention to proceed with it.

There is no justification; neither the questions I raised here nor those raised in the House of Representatives have received adequate answers.

        First, the points raised by Senator Newman went to comments about the TGA. She raised two main points. The first one was a concern about the failure to sufficiently consult the states, particularly Victoria, about the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act to take account of the matching legislation that could be introduced in the states to correspond with this legislation.

        I am also a little disappointed that Victoria should make the points that it did, particularly through Minister Tehan, suggesting that it was not fully consulted. Indeed, Victoria has assisted the federal government very much with this matter because it is the Victorian draft legislation that has been circulated as proposed prospective draft legislation for states and territories to use as part of the complementary legislation that goes with this bill. Indeed, when the current version of these amendments was being discussed with the federal Office of Parliamentary Counsel, an officer from the Victorian Health Department attended that meeting. So it is perhaps a comment that goes to insufficient consultation within the Victorian department, but it is very difficult for the Commonwealth to accept that there was not adequate consultation or adequate information. So I cannot accept those comments from Senator Newman without making my remarks by way of refutation.

        Senator Newman also expressed concerns about the grandfathered goods under the TGA. These provisions have been in place since the principal act was put in place, and the amendment contained in clause 52 clarifies but does not change the existing arrangements. Senator Newman really wanted to know exactly what would happen to all the items listed under the grandfathering provision.

        The TGA is behaving sensibly in this matter. First of all, it intends to evaluate those grandfathered products if there is a matter of a public health interest. For example, if there were any reported adverse reaction in Australia or even overseas, the good or listed item would be evaluated or a case argued for it to be evaluated by the TGA because the TGA would be concerned to protect the interests of the public in Australia. Secondly, this would also occur if any sponsor of any such good asked for an evaluation by the TGA—indeed, for example, to enhance the status, and perhaps the export potential, of its product. So, apart from that, the TGA will not see its way to moving through every grandfathered good. If grandfathered goods are not covered by a public health concern or if a sponsor does not apply, they will be considered to be listed. So I think that should answer the concerns Senator Newman raised about this matter.

        Finally, it is important to note that if a sponsor objected to an evaluation of a grandfathered good, the Senate should know—and, indeed, this legislation makes clear—that the TGA can only enforce such an evaluation through actions under part 3 of the principal act. Decisions under that part of the act are subject to two levels of review: firstly, by my delegates—that is, the people approved to do that on my behalf; and, secondly, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am absolutely sure that the TGA has no inclination to misuse its discretion, but I am also equally satisfied that there is a formal accountability process in place should there be that kind of objection.

        I believe that Senator Newman raised the matter of silicone injections. The TGA has acted to see that that product has been listed before the drugs and poisoning scheduling, and it is now recommended for listing as a poison. In fact, that means it is listed as a poison. That should allay the people's concerns—particularly Senator Newman's but also certainly mine and others'—that the women of Australia might have been subject to injection by silicone not knowing the negative effects of it. But, in fact, the more concerning matter is that very often they were not advised that it was a silicone injection.

        The other matter raised in this place by Senator Lees—and I did not have the opportunity to hear all of her contribution—I believe goes very much to the same issue that Senator Tambling raised; that is, clause 4 of the bill. Let me make it clear that what the government was trying to do with the original paragraph was to make clear on the face of the legislation the immunity which the minister already enjoys. It was not the intention to extend the immunity that the Minister might enjoy, but to make explicit that he does have an immunity under the law as it is. That immunity has been confirmed by the Attorney-General's Department.

The amendment that the government is proposing has been circulated to honourable senators.

        —Senator Tambling cannot keep insisting that publishing facts about a centre—particularly if the review panel's analysis and examination conclude that it is insufficient or not up to standard—cannot be taken, on the face of it, as defamation. What is of concern is that if there is no protection for that information to be made more widely known, then families of a disabled person may not be able to assess whether or not that service falls short of accepted standards. They would be denied access to the information. Anyone else who publishes the minister's statement about the service may be liable to defamation action.

         —The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) in her closing remarks referred to the fact that I would wish to oppose clause 4 and therefore delete it. Alternatively, the minister proposed that the government would subsequently move an amendment which only picked up part of the effect of what my action would achieve; that is, the removal of the clause in toto. The minister made a number of statements that I do not believe fully understand the issues that were raised by Mr Daryl Williams QC and Mrs Sullivan in the House of Representatives, nor the concerns that we expressed here.

         Whilst I accept that the government's circulated draft amendment may well improve the drafting and may seek to address some of the issues that we have raised, in effect the minister has not answered any of the series of questions that we put to her with regard to the need for the clause and the issues relating to why a minister under this particular legislation should have any more protection from defamatory action than any other minister of the Crown. The chamber will recall that the original justification for this clause was a very unusual provision to protect the minister in this particular case. It was very much a matter of special protection. We did not get any indication of the types of statements that could be made, said or subsequently published.

        In her closing comments the minister also referred to a number of issues with regard to subsequent publication. But that takes us back to the point of irony, the very point of intent—that the minister has initially made a statement that may well be defamatory and the fact that the original statement is of itself defamatory and is then requiring this subsequent area. Regarding the replacement clause the minister is proposing, she said:

        I accept that that is something the minister should be conveying and something which should be done, but it need not be done in a manner that is defamatory. It is inherently consistent and proper for the government and the minister to ensure that it is not done in a process that just protects a government that does want to take that licence to bag and to proceed in that area.

         We need to look very carefully at the issue that the minister referred to in the area of precedent. The precedent the government is arguing and quoting from for the replacement of clause 4 is subsection 134A(4) of the National Health Act 1953. The coalition certainly remains concerned with this precedent. Subsection 134A(4) refers to actions taken under sections 33, 35, 95 and 133 of the National Health Act 1953. It is interesting to note that sections 33 and 35 have now been deleted from the original act. Section 95 of the National Health Act allows that, after investigation and report by the appropriate committee of inquiry in order to reprimand a medical practitioner, the minister may publish particulars in the gazette. Quite clearly, both sides of the case are heard, that of the government and that of the medical practitioner.

         Section 133 of the National Health Act relates to a medical practitioner, dental practitioner or approved pharmacist being charged before a court having committed an offence against the National Health Act. There is a very big difference between the defunding of disability services that are being provided and this argument—they relate to two different issues. A medical professional charged before a court has all other rights of appeal, similarly with an investigation and reprimand of a medical practitioner. But there are certain rights of appeal that are not available in the process that is proposed for this legislation for the disability review standards.

         If we look closely at the Disability Services Act 1986, we see that there is a fundamental flaw in this legislation. It would appear that under this act the Disability Standards Review Panel meets to review the funding situation of the disability service organisation. However, once the review panel meets and makes its recommendations on a disability service, provided there is no right of reply for the disability service provider to defend itself against the review contained in the Disability Services Act, the minister can make a statement without the right of reply from the disability service provider. This is also unprecedented. The minister is protected, anything that is published is protected, and the disability service provider has no right of reply. I fail to see how this can be considered fair for the disability service providers and their organisations.

It does not go to the heart of the concerns that are being addressed by the disability service provider. Therefore, we cannot support the amendment proposed by the government. In fact, we would argue that the only way to properly achieve the proper outcomes—the equity, the fairness and the justice to all concerned—is to support my motion that the clause be opposed.

They have not been approached—we have not had time to approach them—with the government's subsequent proposed amendment. My reading of those letters, and our discussions and advice, lead me to believe that the government's amendment basically covers the concern that while the minister did not really need any extra powers at all, anyone who wished to comment on or publish what the minister had said did need some support.

Unfortunately, we do have an act that allows for facilities to be closed down as a last resort. Unfortunately, we do have facilities that are not meeting, or certainly in the past have not met, the very basic human rights provisions and basic standards that we deem to be necessary.

If it is more appropriate to first vote on the amendment that is under discussion and then ask my questions, that is fine. As I understand it, this is my time and if I do not say anything, I will lose it.

         —In summary, the procedure for goods to be marketed in Australia entails a complex series of processes. The sponsor of a therapeutic good, device or pharmaceutical makes an application to the TGA, and the TGA examines literature and research, et cetera, to make sure that it can satisfy itself as to the quality, safety and efficacy of goods for the purposes for which the application has been made.

         Clause 25 on page 23 of the Therapeutic Goods Act deals with this procedure. I wonder whether it might be better to offer a more comprehensive briefing to Senator Chamarette outside this debate about the processes of the TGA. I would be very happy to provide that. Once a good is approved by the TGA, it then has to be submitted to the Australian drug evaluation committee, where evidence put to it is further examined. It may then be approved for marketing. From there, it may well proceed to, for instance, the pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee, if it is a pharmaceutical product. There are different processes if it is a good or a device. I suggest that we could be here for a very long time if I took Senator Chamarette through the full process. I wonder whether she would be happy to accept instead an offer for a very detailed briefing about the functions of the TGA.

However, I did want these questions to go on the public record, because I believe that there may be an instance here requiring the further scrutiny of the process by which these goods are listed. That is especially so since the clause that is under discussion in this bill makes no provision for the liability of the Commonwealth, the secretary or any delegate of the secretary in respect of loss, injury or damage through the use of these therapeutic goods.

         My final questions relate to the procedures. What measures are in place to ensure the ongoing quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods listed on the Australian therapeutic goods register? Is there a requirement for the regular monitoring and review of goods in the light of current and new research in the relevant field? Rather than giving me a long briefing, perhaps the minister can tell me whether there are monitoring procedures in place and what kind of access is available to new information and research on particular products? I know that the minister will be particularly concerned, because silicone implants for breasts are listed on the therapeutic goods register and, of course, there has been some controversy about the research findings in relation to them.

         —There are two ways in which products are subjected to ongoing monitoring. Senator Chamarette has nodded because she would know what that involves. Firstly, any reporting of adverse reactions to medication or drugs is brought directly to the attention of the TGA through the adverse drug reaction advisory committee. Secondly, there is the random monitoring of goods that have been registered and approved, particularly to see that they maintain manufacturing standards, et cetera. Perhaps we should offer a more comprehensive briefing to Senator Chamarette and take her through the process.

         She asked whether a further inquiry is needed. I am sure that that question has just sent a massive shiver through the TGA representatives, because the TGA is not long out of a very comprehensive inquiry conducted by former senator Peter Baume. I take this opportunity to commend that inquiry by Peter Baume. It covered the sorts of questions that Senator Chamarette is asking and reviewed many of the TGA's processes.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The most important outcome was Peter Baume's recommendation, which has since been adopted, for the timeliness of the testing of therapeutic goods. In times past, there has been a long lead time, which has been a cause of frustration. That has been changed as a result of the Baume inquiry. A second recommendation provides the opportunity for the TGA to make use of research and information provided about any of the products brought before the TGA from overseas. So it is not entirely a process of reinventing the wheel. It is about making use of information that is available to allow the process to be speeded up while in no way jeopardising the safety of those products or the reliability of the TGA's testing.

         I believe that we can be fairly sure that Australia offers very good protection in the whole therapeutic area through the processes of the TGA. Certainly, I suggest that there is no immediate need for an inquiry. All but two recommendations of the Baume inquiry have been implemented. It was a very recent inquiry and it has blown the winds of change through the TGA. The timeliness of the procedure is clear evidence of those new processes being put in place to the benefit of the people of Australia.

         —I make it very clear that we will oppose the clause. Whilst I can accept that it does achieve certain objectives, there is a very important point of principle in this matter that needs to be addressed. Senator Crowley argues that the new clause 4 that she is proposing is better drafted and that areas are improved. It may well achieve some of those objectives, but it runs very contrary to the entire principle of the argument that it is totally inadequate, is unnecessary and is unprecedented. On that basis, we will oppose the Government's amendment.

         —The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is just another law and justice legislation amendment bill. Like all others, it is an omnibus bill that seeks to make amendments to a variety of other substantive bills. Most of the amendments in this case—and I suppose in all others—are an attempt to bring one or more bills into line with others to bring some sort of consistency to the manner in which we deal with a particular subject across a range of bills. That is not always done at one time. When it is not done at one time, the bills that have not been made consistent are brought up on another occasion in an amending bill, such as the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill.

         These omnibus bills are also used to make minor technical amendments that are not judged as being meritorious or important enough to have a bill of their own to take up the time of the parliament. So they are just tucked into one of these amending bills. This bill has some of those minor technical amendments as well.

         They also inevitably have what are politely referred to as drafting errors. I suppose that is what they are in substance. This omnibus bill is no exception, as there are a number of so-called drafting errors to be corrected. I would like to spend a couple of minutes referring to some of those drafting errors. It is an opportune time to do so while the parliament—both the Senate and the House of Representatives—is considering new procedures for how we conduct our business. The debate has been not so much raging, but at least it has been occurring and this issue has been raised in that debate.

         The quality of the work that we do in this place—not just what we as senators and members in the other place do, but what we expect of the Public Service—fits a timetable which is, by and large, decided by executive whim. It is widely acknowledged that as a consequence of our failure, collectively, to set up sensible arrangements for dealing with legislation, mistakes are made. Sometimes they are not mistakes that necessarily more time would have picked up, albeit we would like to think more time, if it had been allowed, would have allowed those mistakes to be picked up.

         I use as an example the recent changes to the Bankruptcy Act which occurred in the last session, when I think there was unanimous agreement to some changes in order to get at the assets of bankrupts who stash assets away in one way or another. Such was the political climate at the time that everybody wanted to get stuck into these people; a bill was rushed through this place and was later found to be unconstitutional.

         When the unconstitutional aspect was pointed out, a number of people said, `Its as clear as a bell; anyone could see that'. Perhaps if we had had a bit more time, anyone would have seen it. The Public Service that drafted the bill might have spotted it; the executive to which the bill was given might have spotted it; the opposition, which had some opportunity, albeit limited, to look at it, might have spotted it, as might the Democrats, Senator Harradine and the Greens. But it did not happen, so we had to rush through a separate amendment.

         That is not the category of mistake that has been made in this bill. These drafting errors are not brought about by and large through incompetence—although I suppose some might be unkind enough to say that—but by incapacity to run this place properly and to set aside enough time for the Public Service to do the job it wants to do and can do. We could all be idealistic and say that we hope one day that that is the job that the House of Representatives would like to do rather than it just being the house of the executive. Certainly the job that this chamber and its committees would like to do is pick up these sorts of drafting errors. That will happen only when we have more time and a more sensible arrangement is arrived at for the reference of bills to committees.

         The practice has developed to refer to committees matters that are a bit complicated. I sometimes wonder whether senators who do not have a heavy committee load put their minds at rest and think that an all-seeing, all-knowing committee will be looking at the particular matter. Perhaps those committees would if they had the time.

         We send these bills to committees in the hope of getting a better assessment of both the policy impact and substantive detail of the bill. The system we use to send bills to committees is very good: not only does each bill get additional consideration that it otherwise would not; it is a means whereby members of the public and particular interest groups can put their points of view as well. I do not mean to be completely negative about the process of sending bills to committees; but it does not always work because we do not allow enough time.

         A collection of bright sparks get together on a Tuesday and decide that a bill will be referred to a committee and it will be considered on the following Friday. So on Wednesday, if we are lucky, or Thursday morning someone hops on the phone and rings around and says, `Do you think you can whiz up to Canberra on Friday?'. That is basically how it works. Members of lobby groups based in Canberra can drop their morning tea and cinnamon cake and pop over. But not everybody that the parliament might like to consult lives in Canberra—much to some people's surprise—and consequently the very limited time frame on reporting back means that not all the groups who would like to have a say can.

         Having used this opportunity to get that off my chest, I will refer to the drafting errors that are contained in this bill. According to the explanatory memorandum, clause 20 of this bill rectifies a drafting error of the amendment of section 36 in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Act 1992 to remove the requirement that an acting race discrimination commissioner shall not continue so to act for more than 12 months. I am a bit suspicious as to whether that is in fact a drafting error or a change of policy. I need not make a point on it. Sometimes it is very convenient to call things drafting errors when in fact they are not.

         Clause 22 rectifies a drafting omission in the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992. Clause 22 will amend the reference in subsection 13(2) of the act from section 28 to section 28B. I think that is because there is no section 28 and the bill needs to read 28B. It thereby restores the exemption from the sexual harassment in work provisions for employees of a state or a state instrumentality. That amendment will be taken to have commenced in January of this year, which is the date the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Act actually commenced. That is nothing other than a drafting error. Someone was meant to put in 28B and did not.

         I have not had the time to look, but London to a brick the person who did that was working under time pressures, did not mean to make the mistake and was not an incompetent idiot; the person simply was not given the right opportunity to do the job. We may say, `So what? It is no big deal; why go on about it?'. I do not mean to go on about the substance of the errors, but I simply say this is another example of things not being done properly because people are not given the proper time to do their job properly.

         Equally, clause 23 will rectify a drafting error to renumber subsection 14(4), inserted by section 2 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Act 1992, subsection 14(3A). This amendment is necessary because subsections 14(4) and 14(6) were inserted. They are the three drafting errors that I have picked up and perhaps there are others.

         It is worth mentioning also that I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has a cost of justice reference. The cost of justice issue has become very popular and is one that is discussed over any cup of coffee or any dinner table. The most fashionable entry to that discussion is to get stuck into the legal profession. Very rarely do I hear my colleagues such as Senator Bolkus—

         But we in this place very rarely like to turn our minds to the fact that we contribute to increasing costs. A good example is a poor law clerk in a firm who is given the job of drafting an opinion in relation to one of these bills that has the wrong numbering. That clerk would spend some time on that. Those opposite might say that 20 minutes is not a long time and that the poor dope should have rung someone more senior and had it checked out more quickly. Do those opposite know who pays for the 20 or 30 minutes or hour of that law clerk's time that was spent chasing up something because we messed it up?

These amendments seek to take out section 7(a) and to insert a new definition of `class member' in section 7(b). We will be voting against clauses 10 and 11.

         —That properly explains what the Greens would like to do. It is notionally quite attractive to put a cap on these things, but if one had bad faith or was simply a bit incompetent, one might easily draft a request, the expense of which would be so far in excess of $100 that charging that amount would be a waste of time. I think there needs to be some sensible charge. That charge needs to have some reasonable correlation to what is being asked for from government. One cannot expect to have as of right access to any amount of information that one would like at the expense of other taxpayers. In my view, it should not be thought of as the government paying. It is other taxpayers who will pay if extraordinary requests, to be acquired for a fee of only $100, are acceded to.

         That also has some quite immediate attraction for parliamentarians, no doubt flowing from this government's continual policy of depriving members of parliament of as much information as it possibly can. I remember back in 1987 when the Prime Minister, probably on the back of a table napkin, developed the Priority One program to assist young Australians. I had to pay a significant amount of money to get access to that information. We should not have to pay huge amounts of money to get information. I am not saying we should we have it for nothing; after all, it is at taxpayers' expense. But we do need to find a way to ensure that parliamentarians can get the proper information so that they can make proper decisions in this place.

This bill addresses a number of minor amendments in the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Privacy Act and the High Court of Australia Act. The Australian Democrats will be supporting these amendments which, in part, correct drafting errors, as has been said, and which, in part, streamline the procedures which already exist for enforcing in the Federal Court determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

         A substantive amendment that gave us some reason to pause relates to the extension of the 28-day time limit which the respondent is given to apply for review of the determination in exceptional circumstances. We have no objection to this amendment, as the complainant is afforded the same rights of review of an unfavourable determination by the commissioner under section 11(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. That was not immediately apparent and there was some concern that the respondent was being afforded a right which was not available at the same time and in the same way to the complainant.

         However, there is another concern. Following a determination by the commission in favour of the complainant under any of these four acts, the respondents can continue to offend with impunity until the normal period for application for review has passed, in other words, within the 28 days, or until any review proceedings which were initiated are either completed or terminated.

         While the grant of such an effective amnesty is clearly defective, it seems to have arisen as an unfortunate by-product of the government's need to circumvent the possible unconstitutionality of the provisions. As it is unconstitutional for the commission to exercise judicial power, the determination of the commission cannot be regarded as binding until it has been registered in the Federal Court and the optional period for review has either transpired or been utilised. Unfortunately, it would seem that it is therefore impossible to cure the defect of the `amnesty' provided to the offender by amending these procedures.

Even a small request could result in a charge of $500-plus.

I noted that Senator Vanstone's remarks were mainly related to the second part of my foreshadowed amendments. Perhaps the first part of my amendments also requires consideration, that is, who gets the final say. Should it be the government or should it be an independent body based on fair and understandable rules that everybody knows about? So in foreshadowing the amendments, I ask the opposition to also look at the first part of the amendments, which is separate in its application from the second part of the amendments.

         —The government opposes Senator Vanstone's foreshadowed amendments and, in doing so, goes back to the history of this provision and class actions and the whole debate about whether one adopts an opt-in or opt-out proposal. It is a debate that we have had on a number of occasions in the past. It was a debate that was running hot when I was Minister for Consumer Affairs. The government was then considering what sort of approach to take—an opt-in or opt-out approach. We went for the opt-out approach.

         I think Senator Tate, when he was minister, was responsible for legislation going through this parliament on this aspect of legislation. We opted for an opt-out approach because it was much more preferable on grounds of equity and efficiency. It allowed access to many more Australians to assert their rights and was most efficient.

         It is a debate that in previous times probably would have generated much more heat and would have had all sorts of groups on either side arguing which of the two options was the most preferred. We took the deliberate policy decision. We felt that legal access to redress of rights—particularly for those who are disadvantaged and less educated, those who have less access to the legal system—was more likely to come through an opt-out proposal which, at the same time as enhancing the access to justice of many, still protected those who wanted to drop out of a particular court action by allowing them to remove themselves from that representative complaint before an inquiry had commenced. Those people were able to commence separate individual complaints if they wished to do so.

         In essence, the history of these sorts of actions is that it is a simpler and cheaper process to run if there is an opt-out process. But, more importantly, when it comes to those in our community who do not have access to law—those who have extra barriers towards that access because of language, education or, most importantly, because of resources—an opt-out class action approach is much fairer and enhances their rights of access.

To the extent that we go through the opposition's package of amendments, we are reliving once again past debates. I do not think we should take all that long canvassing it now, given the fact that our history has indicated that massive economic dislocation and massive cost to the economy was going to occur if we went down this road. All those threats and predictions of doom have not eventuated. We have in place a much fairer opting-out process, and the government sticks with it.

         —The point was about providing people ways to get access to justice and overcoming some of the costs involved in the system. It is not a fresh debate. When we canvassed this particular aspect before the Senate last time there were competing views as to opting in or opting out. The government's view was that an opting out process allows more people to have access in the first instance to a particular cause of action and they get the direct result from that. I think that has been the effect of these sorts of provisions throughout the world.

The danger that a person who should be covered by a class action is not included, if the opting in proposal is being used, is far greater than the converse. There is also provision, of course, that people may, if they wish to pursue their own individual action, opt out. The Australian Democrats believe that that is the best way to run a representative action and we shall not be supporting these amendments.

         In 1982 this parliament passed the Freedom of Information Act after a protracted and difficult gestation. Honourable senators who were involved will probably recall the difficulties. Those of us who were not involved can see the evidence in the committee reports and the speeches made in support of freedom of information, particularly that of the then shadow Attorney-General Gareth Evans.

         Despite the best endeavours of all concerned, the Freedom of Information Act that was produced was a flawed creature. It is said that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. This act was not even a camel since a camel is a particularly useful creature in some circumstances. Senator Evans remarked that there was a battle not between the parties in parliament, but between the parliament and the bureaucracy, and the parliament lost.

         I turn to the instrument by which the bureaucracy won the infamous internal working documents exemption. I understand that there may be some circumstances in which documents of that class may contain information that should be exempt from release, but these are few and far between. The real hump in this section was the possibility of the issue of a conclusive certificate. This is purely a means of preventing the release of embarrassing material.

         To paraphrase what Senator Evans said on 8 April 1981, this is not a freedom of information act, it is a freedom from information act. Section 36, the internal working documents exemption, is the main buttress of this freedom from information. Senator Evans did, in fact, move the very amendment which I am now proposing. It was unfortunately lost, but I am certain that with his support, it will receive a better fate.

         The other area in which there needs to be urgent amendment is that of fees and charges. The majority of applications for documents do not attract fees and charges. These are requests for documents relating to the applicant. The requests that attract fees and charges are those for policy documents. For these there is not only an application fee of $30, but also search and retrieval at $15 an hour and decision making at $20 an hour. If ever there was inducement for a bureaucrat to prevaricate and procrastinate, this is it. Not only do applicants not get what they wanted, but also they have to pay for it as well.

         In a recent freedom of information request of which I have been made aware, the charge for 200 pages, not all of which were released, was $2,000. That is ludicrous. The entire object of these charges is to deter citizens from applying for access to documents which their taxes have already paid for. Members of the opposition were well aware of this when they prevented the increase in charges by means of regulation in 1987, though they later agreed to the increase when the measure was introduced as part of the budget bill. It is not possible to determine how many people are deterred from lodging requests or how many withdraw their requests after being informed of the charges. This is perhaps a prime example of freedom from information.

         I also add at this stage that I know the opposition has stood up strongly for independence for the audit office from the government. On the same principle, freedom of information should act independently of government or ministers being able to intercede to disallow information from being available.

         It might be contended that the cost of limiting charges is not borne out by the benefits conferred. However, in 1991-92 the cost of freedom of information was $12.7 million and the amount received in fees was $414,448. It is unlikely that even half of this revenue would be forgone. It is also unlikely that there would have been an explosive increase in the number of requests.

         I certainly hope that there will be an increase as this is the object of the amendment, but no matter how many there are, they will not strain the resources of the Commonwealth. Indeed, if freedom of information were used properly to uncover inefficiency and error, it would probably result in an effective increase in the revenues of the Commonwealth. Regardless of the benefit to the body politic of increased access by the people of Australia to the information concerned, the running of their country outweighs any minor increase in outlays.

        Amendment No. 1 specifies the principal act as being the Freedom of Information Act. The second part of the amendment,  relating to the repeal of conclusive certificates for internal working documents, is the one to which I was referring in relation to the fact that the current means of gaining information is to first of all make an application. What happens then is, basically, if an exemption is called, a person can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A conclusive certificate can then be given. This certifies that a document is exempt and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal cannot review merits of decision. It is restricted decisions on whether the issuing of the conclusive certificate was reasonable.

         As I mentioned earlier, if documents really are exempt because of material in them, the AAT will find that they are exempt. A conclusive certificate only serves to protect documents which are not really exempt; that is, such things as legal advice, issues of national security and personal privacy, which are protected elsewhere. The AAT should be the one deciding on the merits, as Senator Evans said in 1981. I have moved this amendment on the basis that it is better that an independent body, acting by the rules that we all understand, is the one to decide whether or not information is available to people in Australia.

         The review is extremely limited. It is limited to whether the public interest is well served by the minister's decision. It is not possible for contra-arguments on the issue of public interest to be advanced in that review. This means that the balance of public interest which, in such a matter, should be properly addressed, cannot be addressed. We believe that it is not justified to restrict in this way information concerning the process of government that citizens are entitled to. Very clearly, it is one of the principles of democratic government that the process of government is transparent, whereas this provision is clearly designed to make it opaque.

         Over those 12 years we have seen restraint shown in the use of certificates. We have seen that a minister has the imperative of reporting to parliament when not following AAT recommendations to revoke certificates. But, more importantly, in 1987 a Senate committee reviewed the act and rejected the concept of abolition of conclusive certificates.

         We understand where honourable senators opposite are coming from, but we also have the experience of 12 years, together with that 1987 Senate committee report, to indicate to us that a balance has to be maintained. The conclusive certificates have been used only as a last resort in the most sensitive cases. That was a view that was adopted by the Senate committee; it is a view that should be taken by this place when making a decision as to how to handle the amendment moved by the Greens.

         —Amendment No. 2, circulated in my name, also refers to the `Principal Act' being the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The purpose of the amendment is to limit fees—to make the process freedom of information, rather than freedom from information—to a maximum of $100, because we have already paid for this information in our taxes. As I also mentioned before, the way fees are structured encourages procrastination on the part of the bureaucracy. The second part of the amendment will ensure that members of parliament can access such information free of charge, so that it can be available to the people of Australia. I commend amendment No. 2 to the chamber. I move:

         —There is very little to add to the arguments that the Australian Democrats have advanced on this issue for a number of years. We simply say that fees should not be used as a bar to people obtaining information to which they are entitled. Clearly, it is not being used as a revenue measure because in the last year 33,000 requests were made at a cost of $12.7 million. The retrieval figure was only half a million dollars. It is being used to bar or contain requests for information. The Australian Democrats will support the amendment.

         —It is worth repeating, very briefly, the points made at the second reading stage. It is not that the coalition thinks the Freedom of Information Act is working perfectly. It does not. But we believe a $100 cap is simply unrealistic, given the extraordinary cost of some requests. We also do not believe that, with all the other access parliamentarians have to information, we should necessarily have—as a right—free access under freedom of information. For those reasons we will not support these amendments. It does not mean that at a later stage we will not work with the Greens and others to improve the operation of the act.

         If those opposite take that view, we might as well abolish the parliament. This is a cost to the taxpayer, yes, but one of our main functions is to audit and control the actions of the executive government. How can we undertake that function if we are kept in ignorance—if individuals such as myself have to pay considerable amounts for freedom of information material? Not only do we have to pay considerable amounts for election campaigns but once having got here we would also have to pay considerable amounts for freedom of information requests. We cannot afford to do that and so we leave it to go by the board. Or we ask questions in estimates committee hearings and departmental officials make us fish in other pools. That is what happens.

         —I rarely speak on a third reading of a bill, but I do so on the occasion of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill because I feel very strongly about the matter with which we have been recently dealing in the committee stage. As you know, Mr President, I have raised with the Library Committee the need for access to departmental file titles through our computer system. I am not asking—I make the point very clear—for detailed information which is of a confidential nature, such as security files and so on. But it would be very important for the exercise of our proper functions for us to know what files are available in various government departments.

         For example, a lot of work is done in government departments on particular policy issues which are not necessarily the policy issues of the government. It would save an enormous amount of time and expense on behalf of the members of parliament, and the parliamentary library, if at least we knew what file titles there were in the various government departments. An arrangement between the parliament and a number of government departments enables those departments to access the information contained on the parliamentary database system. Why can we not have their file titles?

         I raise this matter specifically on this occasion because, although we have been nobbled from getting freedom of information as a result of the rejection of Senator Margetts's proposal, at least it would enable us to identify certain files. It would save a lot of time and money for us and for the various government departments if we could identify the files and say, `These are the matters that we need from those particular files'. Honourable senators who may be interested in this subject ought to have a look at the questions that I have asked on notice on this matter, the questions that I asked on notice last year and the answer, for example, from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

         The worst aspect of the minister's answer was the suggestion that the consumption of the meat involved would have had negligible effect on the consumers. The minister cannot be certain of that. It is an opinion. Even if it is somebody else's opinion, I think it is not a responsible action for the minister to take to relay such opinions as if they were fact.

         What is wrong with this whole area is that opinions are expressed, such as `this matter will not hurt you', `that substance will not hurt you' and `you can consume that without any significant harm'. These are opinions, and they are based on short-term experience with a herbicide or a pesticide. The fact—not the opinion—is that DDT has been prohibited in Australia since 1987, and for good reason. Extensive tests have identified it as a carcinogen. That is not an effect which is necessarily or immediately apparent. Unqualified people would be readily able to say, `You can digest that stuff. Look at me, I've had some of it pass my lips and it hasn't hurt me'. That is the sort of thing we hear.

         As a carcinogen, of course, the effect may be 20 or 30 years down the track. Those instant experts may become less apparent on our landscape—in fact, they may be underneath our landscape—as a result of their opinions, ignoring the facts. The fact is that DDT has been prohibited since 1987, and with good reason. The use of DDT has been prohibited, and rightly so, without qualification.

         If currency is given to the idea that small amounts will not hurt us, the grazing on contaminated lands will be extended. The other thing that will be extended is the opportunity for people to be affected by consuming affected produce. That is an important aspect, and that is why I wanted to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the minister contributed to the myth that the consumption of small amounts will not hurt us. That is why I will persist in raising this matter and asking for proper action to recognise the threat that such a flippancy brings to the success of our rural industries.

         The imperfections, the residues and the chemical traces that are in our produce are the very matters which other countries use to prohibit the importation of Australian produce. This is the very matter which we should guard against. We have the capacity to understand exactly where contaminated lands are. We have the capacity to manage our agricultural activities so that those contaminated lands are not used for grazing. Even though on 8 September the new chair of the National Registration Authority, Professor Ben Selinger, warned that land which had been used for canegrowing should not be used for beef grazing and that it would have the very effect which some 10 days later was identified in Queensland, the minister's reaction was `a little bit doesn't really hurt you; it doesn't matter that much'.

         I endorse the warnings of Professor Sellinger and I urge the government to take notice of the chair of the National Registration Authority, the very body which should have the capacity to advise government to take care in these issues. I will not delay the Senate any longer. I just wanted to raise this matter. I could go on and quote extensively from the media material which has been around this particular incident but I am sure that those honourable senators who are interested in it will take the trouble to read the transcripts of the media reports of the matter.
