        . . . there is a whole series of precedents in regard to revenue measures in recent Budgets which the Australian Labor Party has voted against in both Houses, without anyone raising cries of inconsistency, hypocrisy or constitutional impropriety. For example, to take just the 1978-79 Budget, the ALP opposed the income tax surcharge, the increased tax on long service leave, the abolition of the tax deduction for home loan interest, the removal of tax exemption from Commonwealth post-graduate awards and the increased excise on beer, spirits and cigarettes. As well as all those items in that Budget, we have voted against other items in other Budgets. . .

         Of course it is the case that from time to time in the past we have opposed particular revenue measures when in opposition. The record is there. It speaks for itself. That is no news to anybody. If those opposite have just discovered that, they are even weaker at doing their research than I thought they were. The point is that when in opposition we never at any stage mounted this kind of headlong assault on the basic strategy and integrity of the budget. The truth of the matter is that any given package of revenue measures has to be passed in order to pay for the budget as a whole. That has always been the case in the past and that is the way in which we have approached this budget structure on this occasion.

         The problem is that tax cuts have to be paid for. And they can be paid for only by either revenue measures of the kind that are at issue here or draconian expenditure cuts of the kind that we saw proposed by the opposition in its Fightback package. The budget strategy that we have put to the parliament is one that depends for its whole integrity on those particular taxation cuts being matched by similar scale revenue measures taking effect over the life of the budgetary measures in question.

         We are talking about the whole package of measures, including the second tranche of the wholesale sales tax increases, all of which are necessary to bring about the situation of revenue neutrality over the longer haul and to achieve what we are committing ourselves to achieve, which is a responsible overall budgetary situation by 1996-97 of one per cent of GDP.

         Minor marginal tinkering of the kind that occurred with particular measures in the past may or may not have produced the results that we are talking about. In practice, on any kind of analysis of what happened in the past, it did not produce the result of mounting any kind of systematic assault on the fundamental integrity of the budget. That is the difference between what happened in the past and what is involved here. That is why it is absolutely crucial that this package of measures be passed in its entirety—not just on the taxation cuts side, but also on the revenue side. Unless the opposition comes up with some alternative strategy that is equally economically responsible, it simply does not deserve to be listened to.

         I did have occasion last week to say to my friend and colleague Andrey Kosyrev, the Russian foreign minister, that his country seemed on occasion to adopt a somewhat unorthodox approach to democratic process. But, of course, President Yeltsin's decision on 21 September to hold elections for a new parliament in December this year, followed by early presidential elections next year, was entirely consistent with the development of Russia's democratic institutions and I made that point to my colleague. What will happen as a result of that decision is that a new legislature will be enabled to consider a redrafted constitution, eliminating the manifest inadequacies and inconsistencies of the current Soviet era constitutional model which is not, on any view, a foundation for a democratic system and has not, on any view, produced in the past a democratic legislature.

         What happened then was that on 3 October the leaders of the opposition to President Yeltsin's reforms, apparently emboldened by his continued willingness to negotiate, called on their supporters to storm the Moscow mayor's office, Moscow's television tower and other media outlets. Honourable senators have seen the consequences that followed from that. Having exhausted all avenues for peaceful resolution and faced with these attempts to seize strategic facilities, President Yeltsin had, in our judgment, no alternative but to act to disarm those elements which were threatening the stability of Russian society.

         In August two years ago the White House became the symbol of the Russian people's commitment to a new order and a rejection of the old. The fact that it became a bastion of opposition to democracy and a workable economic system does underline the extraordinary difficulties the Russians are now facing in managing the transition. I guess setbacks in that quest are only to be expected. We certainly regret, as the Australian government, that it did become necessary for the Russian government to take the measures that it did to disarm its opponents, but we certainly understand, as I have indicated, the government's reasons for doing so.

         The report is based on extensive consultations throughout Australia. It is a substantial document, thorough, very highly professional and will certainly provide an excellent foundation for public debate on this particular subject. I certainly thank now, as the Prime Minister has done in the other place, Malcolm Turnbull and his colleagues on the committee for the great dedication, great energy and great persistence under fire that they have brought to this particular task. The report canvasses a range of practical options for an Australian republic and has the unanimous endorsement of the whole committee.

         While recognising that the issue is a complex one, the report clearly demonstrates that Australia can become a republic without in any fundamental way changing the current system of government. The government does not have a timetable for a republic, but it does hope to see, of course, a republican structure in place by the turn of the century. It is essential that people have time to consider the issues. The report is now being made available to the public to provide a factual basis for community debate which must precede any change—for, of course, in the end it will be the people who decide whether Australia does become a republic.

         We as a government will be studying the report carefully with a view to developing a considered position on the central issues. To this end, the Prime Minister is going to establish a small working party of senior ministers to consider the issues and to develop a paper for cabinet in the first half of next year. That working party will consist of me, Kim Beazley, Michael Lavarch, Graham Richardson, Ros Kelly and Frank Walker.

         The Prime Minister made it clear that if the Democrats choose to take from that bill—bill No. 3—the linkage clause that is a technical and irrelevant measure because linkage exists, whether or not the Democrats wish it to be so, or whether or not the Senate resolves that it is so; it still remains the case that we cannot responsibly carry the measures to reduce the revenue without making the hard decisions that increase the revenue. We cannot have the soft without the hard; we cannot have the good without the bad. That is the linkage and it exists whether the Senate resolves it should be so or not.

         —There has been a great deal of publicity about the announcement made a couple of days ago by the AMA of a number of fees that will be increased. It is worth noting that Medicare will increase its fees by just over one per cent from 1 November this year. It is also worth noting that, irrespective of what the AMA may list as its recommended fees, around 79 per cent of all services are billed at or below the Medicare scheduled fee. In fact, over the last year, usage by general practice has gone up by two per cent, taking it well over 70 per cent. The truth is that the great majority of doctors simply ignore the AMA fees, in any event.

         The problem does arise because, with a number of specialists, there is a very large gap between what is being sought in the medical benefits schedule and what is being sought in the AMA fees. Some specialists, of course, charge even more than the AMA fees. Australia will have to look at this problem and work out just what we think we can afford. It is worth noting that, by the time of the last election, when Dr John Hewson was defending doctors in a debate with Paul Keating on
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          60 Minutes,
         </emphasis>
         that was when the worm turned its highest for Paul Keating. Sadly, I think, in recent years there has been a tendency for the AMA to look like the greediest of all trade unions and to give Norm Gallagher a good run for his money. Unfortunately, that is what is happening again.

         No-one disputes—least of all me—that specialists in particular are highly trained, highly skilled people who take many years to get to the top of their profession. For that reason, they have a shortened working life. I have no doubt that they should be remunerated accordingly. But it is worth noting that the top quartile of ophthalmologists, obstetricians and ENT surgeons, earn respectively $536,000, $439,000 and $529,000. They earn that every year from Medicare alone—just from Medicare. That does not take into account what they earn as VMOs in the hospital system. It does not take into account what they earn in compensation cases which, for many of them, is a very extensive amount indeed. Nor does it take into account any work they may do for insurance purpose.

         The legitimacy of the security council really does depend on its perceived representativeness so far as the other nations in the United Nations are concerned.

We still have a UN Security Council not very much larger than it was back in 1946, and with still only five permanent members, but with now over 180 members of the United Nations. It is obviously the case that the balance of the security council does not reflect in its membership—in particular its permanent membership—the character of the world as a whole or the UN as a whole.

         There is an emerging consensus that there needs to be change. My own judgment of where that consensus is presently poised is that it is very much in the kind of direction that Australia has indicated support for; namely, an increase not of a large number—maybe from 15 up to 20 members—of the security council, with an additional five permanent members of the council added to the existing five but without there being any additional veto power conferred on those new five members.

         While I was away there was some speculation in the press suggesting that Australia was embarked  upon some new adventure in this respect and that we are espousing a somewhat unique, innovative, and perhaps a little peculiar policy. It is a view that is shared by a great many other members of the UN that it would be inappropriate to extend the veto power any further. Historically, Australia, through Dr Evatt, opposed the allocation of the veto power to any member of the UN. I think that considering the way the organisation was so deadlocked for so long, the wisdom of that initial judgment is well made out.

         The evolution of the security council's collective security role has over the years been somewhat diminished because of the operation of the veto power. Misuse of it now or in the future could further hinder the effective decision making process. We would regard the extension of the veto power as inconsistent with the kind of diminishing use we have seen of it in the much more cooperative atmosphere that now exists for collective security decision making. We would not want to see the power extended in that way.

         Finally, a lot of the argument about reform of the UN has focused on the question of the security council. In my own judgment that is really almost a second order issue, as compared with some of the reform priorities which are necessary elsewhere, including restructuring the secretariat, resolving the funding problems of the organisation, and in particular, on the security side, in improving the management of the peace operations and giving a much greater priority to preventive diplomacy and peace building, rather than after the event clean-up action of one kind or another. These are themes that I was at pains to spell out last week, and I think it is fair to say that they have had a very positive response.

          Nirimba

         This proposal offers considerable opportunities to the western suburbs of Sydney. It indicates that defence is willing to dispose of property which will have great social utility in highly urbanised areas. We have begun discussions with the New South Wales government, the education minister, Mrs Chadwick, and her officials, to clarify some of the issues that relate to the operation of the educational precinct. There is strong interest by the New South Wales government, and substantive discussions between defence and New South Wales officials are planned to commence almost immediately. If we can get this project up, it will be of great benefit to the people of western Sydney, who would be using facilities that taxpayers have previously invested in for other purposes.

         Under the simplified rules for assessing managed investments introduced in March 1993, income is assessed at the rate of return on the investment based on its performance over the previous 12 months.

         Before March 1993 some managed investments were assessed at a minimum rate of return of nought per cent and a maximum rate of 11 per cent. This meant managed investments were not always assessed in line with their actual performance and that no allowance could be made for losses. The new rules are fairer because they more accurately reflect what is happening in the marketplace.

         In the case mentioned by Senator Patterson, the minister has had the rate of return on the two investments checked and they are basically correct. They reflect the strong performance of these investments over the previous 12 months and, therefore, improved pensioner circumstances. Should this performance not continue, clients can, at any time, request that their assessments be updated using the most recent rate of return. Additionally, the department automatically updates these assessments every three months.

         Under the managed investment rules, the same rate of return is applied to all clients holding a particular investment. This ensures that clients with the same investments are assessed in the same way. If the income assessment were to be based on the price at which the investment was purchased, clients with the same investments and the same ability to provide for themselves would receive different amounts of pension. The 12-month period used to calculate a rate of return allows for some smoothing of the rate of return to remove short-term fluctuations, while not stretching this smoothing effect to the point where it bears little resemblance to the current situation. It is the period most used in the financial industry for assessing and marketing rates of return.

        As I indicated in my response, the Government is aware that recent statistics show an alarming imbalance in the ratio between infant girls and boys in China. I am now in a position to provide the following additional information.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The statistics vary significantly from one province to another, and even within provinces, and some demographers have questioned their reliability; but even so, the implications are chilling.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I and other members of the Government share Senator Harradine's concern, indeed, revulsion that in some parts of the world, a preference for sons results in the abandonment of infant girls, or their deaths because of inadequate care or in some cases, infanticide.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But I do not agree that this is brought about because of what Senator Harradine has described as China's target driven one-child per family policy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The situation is no less serious in some other parts of the world where population policies are less clearly stated, and in some cases, even greater imbalances are apparent, particularly among third and fourth births.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The problem occurs because of a preference for male children that has its roots in long-standing cultural and other traditions which deny women their proper position in society. Unfortunately these attitudes are unlikely to change overnight.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        China's efforts to encourage smaller families is obviously a contributing factor and the impact of government policy is clearly greater among Han Chinese in urban areas (approximately 40% of the population) who are under pressure to accept a one-child per family norm.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, preference for male children is also seen in some rural areas where, despite official acceptance of two  or, among minority groups, three children per family, male children are more highly valued.

        Australia has invested considerable effort in developing a constructive dialogue with China on a range of human rights issues, with discussions at ministerial and officials level and visits by two delegations of the Australian Parliament.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In my answer to Senator Harradine's question on 30 September, I indicated that it was my understanding that my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, had taken this issue up in recent discussions with the Chinese Foreign Minister.

        I am now advised that this is not in fact the case; however it was raised by AIDAB officials during the visit by China's Vice-Minister for Public Health, Madame He Jiesheng on 20 September.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Earlier this year, AIDAB officials conveyed the Government's concern on this matter in discussions with senior State Family Planning Commission, and family planning workers at state, provincial and local levels in China. The question was also raised  in discussions with the All China Women's Federation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On each occasion, officials, academics and family planning and health workers acknowledged that the preference for male children was a problem.

        They confirmed that infanticide and provision of information on the sex of an unborn child are illegal, but explained that the preference for boy children is deeply rooted in socio-economic and cultural traditions which will take time to change.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore, as social controls are loosened and privatisation of services, including medical services accelerates, it is more and more difficult for the Chinese Government either to enforce its family planning policies or to prevent illegal practices.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator Harradine has often criticised the Government for its support for family planning activities in developing countries on the basis that our involvement condones human rights abuse.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I and the Government take a contrary view. The fact that abuses continue to occur provides compelling argument for our continued involvement in order to protect fundamental human rights not only through population programs but also in promoting targeted health and education or literacy programs to protect girl children and enhance the status of women.

        The increasing availability of more advanced technology is also a contributing factor—but this is true throughout the world, not only in China.

        Ultrasound technology is used in a wide range of medical services.

Under section 63(8) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, the minister, before approving estimates referred to him by ATSIC, is required to consult with the commissioner representing the Torres Strait Regional Council with respect to the revised 1993-94 ATSIC estimates. The formal consultation process is yet to be completed. Nevertheless, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has determined that he has no objection to my tabling the ATSIC 1993-94 revised estimates that have been forwarded to him for consideration, and I do so now.

        There is something dangerous about this Prime Minister, Mr Keating. A Prime Minister who is prepared to undermine the confidence in the democratic system to seek to gain some short-term political advantage is somebody who I think is inherently dangerous in that office, and that is exactly what this Prime Minister has sought to do.

         If one goes back in history, one will find that, year after year, the Labor Party, when it was in opposition, did exactly what we are seeking to do on this occasion—that is, vote against certain taxation bills. Did we ever suggest that, in doing so, it was undermining the democratic system? Did we ever suggest that it was trampling on the basic principles of the democratic system of government in this country? Of course, we did not. There is room for a political debate, but the Prime Minister has a responsibility that goes beyond the political debate—a responsibility to stand up in support of the democratic system and the accountability of the executive to the parliament. That is what he is not prepared to do.

         The parallel with 1981 is really incredible. In 1981 Senator Evans came into this chamber and said, `We're going to vote against the government's sales tax bills, firstly because they have no mandate'. At the very least, as I put in my question to him, Senator Evans said, `The government should have gone to the people and indicated that it was going to increase indirect tax; because it had no mandate, we are going to vote against them'. It was exactly the same situation.

         Secondly, Senator Evans said, `We're going to vote against these bills because they are regressive'—exactly the same situation here. They are regressive; they hurt particularly the less well off in our society. That is the way those opposite structured the bills and it is legitimate for us to vote against them in those circumstances.

         Thirdly, Senator Evans said, `They are not in the current circumstances in the national interest'. We of course say the same thing. To impose a new wine tax and increase the cost of fuel, transport, carrying through to small business, when there are nearly one million people out of work in this country, is not a taxation decision that is in the national interest. We, therefore, have the right to vote against it.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Fourthly, Senator Evans said, `They are not vital to the budget because they are only a relatively small proportion of budget revenue'. That is again exactly the situation that we find ourselves in today, because the tax bills that we have said we will vote against amount to only 1.4 per cent of government revenue.

         So, back in 1981, it was legitimate for the then opposition to do it and it was regarded as part of the normal political process. But when we do it, those opposite say that Dr Hewson is undermining the democratic principle of government in this country. For that Mr Keating should be condemned; he should be embarrassed and should apologise. Furthermore, he should have the guts to stand up in the House of Representatives and be prepared to answer for it. For him to walk out today is a further worry to those of us who actually think democratic principles are important.

         The scale of the assault that is now proposed on this budget ought to be fully understood because it is really very dramatic. The sales tax that the opposition proposes to vote against as to its first tranche is $600 million. Its second tranche, when that comes into operation, is another $600 million; it is not just one-off, it is $600 million per year. If we add to that what the opposition is proposing to do with the petrol tax, what it is proposing to do with the annual leave taxation proposal, and what it is proposing to do with the wine tax proposal, we are dealing with a massive hacking at the core of this particular budgetary strategy—not only the balance this year, but the balance every year to 1996-97.

It is not just for one year—not just to get through a particular situation in one year—but to craft a medium-term budget strategy which will win the confidence of the world's financial markets and the world's investors, on whom we so crucially depend to haul ourselves out of this particular economic difficulty in the post-recession cycle that we have been in.

We are talking about a system which has worked well for this country for many decades and which has not been subjected to the kind of frontal, systematic assault involved in this situation. It is the kind of situation which, accordingly, needs a very fundamental rethink so far as the opposition is concerned and as far as those who might be minded to follow it down this particular path are concerned. We urge that upon the opposition today. We will continue to urge it every day until this debate concludes.

         —Senator Gareth Evans has come a long way. If we went back 15 years or more we would find that, when he was not organising student rebellions, he used to earn a living—if one could call it that—giving constitutional law lectures at Melbourne University. He was a great one then for spelling out in copious detail what the powers of the chambers were. He always made it clear that he was very much in favour of abolishing the Senate—until, of course, he ran for preselection. Prior to that, I am sure he would have endlessly bored his students by explaining carefully to them—

         Nonetheless, the concern I have is that if ever a government did not have a mandate it is this government. Senator Gareth Evans seemed to be saying, `Because we did not say we would not do something before the last election, we therefore have a mandate'. No-one in the community for a moment would believe that in any shape or form the government was out there promising to increase the cost of fuel and cigarettes, put up the fringe benefits tax, punish credit unions, whack on a de facto GST and in all sorts of ways increase the burden. It then gave a derisory little rebate back to a few low income earners and found itself forced to increase it because of pressure from this chamber. Now all of that seems to be somehow unacceptable to the government because it is the result of compromise. But not for one moment in 1981 did it ever suggest that this chamber did not have the power, or indeed the duty, to negotiate on bills.

         As we have shown many times—and we have not had any response—the precise level of objection is exactly the same now as it was then. That is why it is so utterly hypocritical for Senator Gareth Evans to try to draw his phoney distinction, describing what the Labor Party did as some sort of marginal tinkering and in the same breath pretending that we are the wreckers and vandals.

         The reality of the matter is that this chamber has the power given to it by the founding fathers. The numbers in the Senate are as they are because of the government's total inability to persuade the Australian people that it could be trusted with the numbers in this place. As a result, all those people elected to this chamber have an obligation to carry out their duties. If Senator Gareth Evans does not accept that, he is in pretty much the same league as his cowardly leader who was not even prepared to allow full debate to take place in the House of Representatives. I hope that when Senator Gareth Evans studies that list he will realise that.

When the Senate pressed requests for amendments to certain bills, the House of Representatives, under the Liberals, was so concerned about the proper processes that it said that it would not even consider the requests because its view—and former Senator Durack's view—was that the Senate did not have the constitutional power to press a request more than once. I am assuming that everybody here will be consistent and that the opposition, having made a request once, would not seek to press it again because it would not wish to be seen to be inconsistent.

         There is certainly something particularly dangerous about this Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It follows that the people who support the course of action he chooses to take have something equally dangerous about them. It is a matter of great amusement to me that this Prime Minister markets himself in the community as being pro-republican because, under the real meaning of the term `republican', republicans want to take absolute power away from the executive and spread it to parliament through the representatives of the people.

         Mr Keating confuses the term `republican' and seems to think one is a republican simply by wanting to enter into a debate about changing our head of state. But the real meaning of the term `republican' implies someone who wants to give more power to parliament over the executive. We saw in Mr Keating's actions in the other place today that he does not want to give more power to parliament over the executive. He wants to say—and in this he is supported by Senator Gareth Evans—that parliament's capacity to question the executive is a privilege granted by the executive.

Will government ministers simply not show up for question time? One wonders whether they will even bother coming to parliament and simply do everything by executive fiat. Of course, you, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, know the answer to that. A committee of which you are now a member has recently reported that the strength of parliament, in its funding to both itself and its committees, needs to be restored and improved to give parliament that power over the executive.

         For the Prime Minister today to go into the other place and cut short question time after 25 minutes because its continuance did not suit him is a classic indication to the whole community that this man is not a republican who is about giving more power to parliament over the executive; he is after absolute power. In a sense, that puts him in the category of the sorts of people who would like to revert to the days of absolute monarchies. What a disaster they were. Most people agreed that life under absolute monarchies was a disaster. We have constitutional monarchies because we needed to develop a parliamentary system to keep some sort of check on the executive.

         The recent election might add more information and give us greater guidance as to why this chamber—and the other one, combined as a parliament—needs to exercise its right and responsibility to keep a check on the executive. As members opposite know—I am sure that members of the public in the gallery also know this—this election, which my party lost in March, was fought by government members on the basis that there would not be any more taxes.

         We now find a government that lied before, during and after the election wanting to impose more taxes. It wants to increase the petrol tax and a whole range of other taxes about which it was silent during the election campaign. It would have the people in the gallery believe that we should sit here meekly and simply let those taxes be passed because those opposite happen to have a majority in the other place. That is manifestly rubbish.

         Our parliamentary system contains two houses, each of which is given its role under the constitution and each of which not has only a right to exercise those powers but an obligation to do so, and to keep a check on the executive. This executive represents a party which, as I said, lied before, during and after the election. The people in the gallery, who are representative of millions of others around Australia, expect people on both sides of this chamber to act as a proper house of review and to use the powers that we have.

         It is manifestly inconsistent for government members to take one tack in 1981 and say that it is all right for them, but then, when they are in government and the same thing is tried on them, to stamp their feet like children not getting what they want at a shop, storm out of question time and say that they are no longer responsible to parliament, that they can do what they like and that question time is just a privilege granted by the executive.

         The opposition at that time decided that it would oppose a particular measure of the then Fraser government. That measure was defeated. I want to outline to the Senate what the situation was then and how it is different from the situation which faces us now. In my first year in parliament, the Labor opposition had no opportunity by itself to defeat legislation. Mr Acting Deputy President might remember that 1975 was not a particularly good year for the Labor Party. When I came into this place, there was a majority for the Fraser Government not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate as well.

         The Labor Party decided to oppose a particular measure of the Fraser government. It was not a budget measure; it was a fiscal measure which was separate from the budget process. This measure related to the dropping of funeral benefits. We opposed this measure. The difference on that occasion was that sufficient Liberal members crossed the floor so that the measure was defeated.

         The coalition parties so far have been quite content to let the minor parties take the running. In other words, the coalition has been trying to let the public think that it is the minor parties which are going to do the damage. Without the 36 members of the opposition, there would be no possibility of having the budget measures defeated. So it is now time that the Liberals and Nationals were flushed out. For the sake only of opposition, the opposition is using its numbers to attack the government's budget strategy.

        (3) The GOSRV's policy of oppressing religions has, since 1945, applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members and, most seriously, to the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith and spiritual life of 80% of 72 million Vietnamese.

It is the sole legitimate umbrella Buddhist body in Vietnam despite the GOSRV's unsuccessful attempt, in 1981, to disband and forcibly replace it with the State-run Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), and instrument for the GOSRV's propaganda purposes.

This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.

         This report deals with the operations of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills during the 36th parliament from May 1990 to February 1993. It contains statistical data and analytical discussion of the scrutiny that has been carried out during that period.

          The report should prove particularly useful to senators, ministers and their advisers as it contains an analysis of how the committee has applied the principles of scrutiny set out in its terms of reference. These are reproduced towards the beginning of the report. The report welcomes an increase in the level of ministerial response to committee comments that has taken place during the 36th parliament.

          The committee appreciates the setting out in the explanatory memorandum of reasons for a bill containing provisions that may be considered to infringe the principles. This practice greatly assists the committee and the Senate. Of equal assistance have been the ministerial responses which treat the comments of the committee as constructive, positive efforts to improve the quality of information available to the Senate.

          The committee has paid close attention to the use of ministerial guidelines and directions which result in an abrogation of the legislative power of parliament and of on-going parliamentary scrutiny of the delegated exercise of that power. In this regard, the report notes the committee's interest in the Administrative Review Council's report

           Rule making by Commonwealth agencies
          </emphasis>

          I place on record acknowledgment of the high level of service that the members of the committee have given to the work of scrutiny over the life of the 36th parliament. A legislative scrutiny committee depends to a large extent on the input of its legal adviser and its secretariat. The committee has been fortunate to have the services of Professor J.L.R. Davis of the Law Faculty of the Australian National University as its legal adviser, and of Stephen Argument and Jacquie Hawkins as secretary and administrative officer, respectively. On behalf of the committee, I wish to record our thanks to them.

          The scrutiny of bills committee is effective only when it receives support from both ministers and senators.

         This bill was originally introduced by my predecessor, Senator Jo Vallentine on 12 December 1991. Following my appointment to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Senator Vallentine in January 1992, I undertook a major rewrite of the original bill to take account of the criticisms that had been received. I then tabled this bill in the form of a discussion document in May this year. I now present this Whistleblowers Protection bill 1993 to the Senate for its consideration.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The object of the bill is to allow public sector employees and others to disclose, in the public interest, illegal, improper or corrupt conduct or acts that may be of danger to public health, safety or national security.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It seeks to establish a fully independent statutory authority called the Whistleblower Protection Agency, headed by a Commissioner, which will have powers to investigate claims of corruption within Commonwealth government or government agencies made by employees, applicants for employment in a government Agency or by any member of the public. Protection is also extended to consultants engaged by the Government or its agencies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The major functions of the Agency will be: to investigate allegations of wrongdoing within government and its agencies; to protect the interests of employees, former employees and applicants for appointment to the federal public service; to promote the ethic of openness and public accountability and to support the community perception of whistleblowers as responsible citizens.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agency will have the power to receive and investigate allegations about serious wrongdoing involving federal government employees up to, and including, the Prime Minister. Allegations to be investigated would include violations of law, gross mismanagement, gross waste of public funds, abuse of authority, substantial and specific danger to public liability or safety, or suppression of an expert opinion, finding or document.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whistleblowers will be able to obtain protection from harassment or discriminatory actions over appointment, promotion, disciplinary action, transfer, pay or other benefits that arise. Possible remedies will include re-instatement, re-location and compensation payment. These remedies will be available if the Agency is satisfied that the person had reasonable grounds for believing that the allegations were true on the condition that the allegations were found to be substantially true.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agency may approach the Federal Court for an order or injunction restraining a person from taking actions that are prejudicial to a whistleblower.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Whistleblowers Protection Agency will have the power to recommend disciplinary action or, for severe cases, criminal action against government employees responsible for the harassment or discrimination against whistleblowers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agency may bring evidence that a person has been guilty of an offence to the notice of the Attorney-General.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agency may also make reports to the Prime Minister who shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of this Parliament within 5 sitting days of each House. These may be separate reports or included in the next annual report of the Agency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also seeks to protect whistleblowers from any legal action as a result of the allegations they make to the Agency. This protection would be extended whether or not the allegations were disproved, but not if they were deliberately false or misleading. A complaint to the Agency will only be made public if it is found to be true. The Agency will publish a list of all complaints in its annual report that will be tabled in Parliament, however, only the full details of substantiated and true claims will be revealed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commissioner and persons acting under the direction or authority of the Agency will also not be liable to an action or proceedings taken against them for exercising the powers conferred by this bill.

        A Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Whistleblowers Protection Agency will inquire into and report on the activities of the Agency and other matters that the Commissioner has drawn to the attention of the Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill sets out the process for appointment and powers of the Commissioner as well as the administration of the Agency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In that regard, I wish to specifically point to several clauses of note in the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, the process of appointment of the Commissioner is unusual in that, while the Governor-General will appoint a person to the position on the advice of the Prime Minister, either House of Parliament may disallow the appointment within 10 sitting days after the instrument of appointment has been laid before the House. A similar process of suspension and removal of the Commissioner will be in force to protect the office of Commissioner from political interference.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commissioner will be employed on similar terms and conditions as are applicable to an officer performing the duties of an equivalent classification in the public service, however the Commissioner's remuneration will be determined by the Remunerations Tribunal and the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 does not apply to the office of Commissioner.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill is being introduced into the Senate, so I have been unable to include a particular clause because of constitution constraints. I would hope that section 43 of the finalised Act would read:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "All costs and expenses incurred by or in connection with the performance of the powers and functions of the agency are a charge on the Consolidated Revenue and are payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund without further appropriation than this section.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This would ensure that the agency would not be starved of funds by a hostile government of the day. I would like to point out that the operations of the agency would still be open to review by the Australian National Audit Office and would remain responsible to parliament for its expenditure through the Parliamentary Joint Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Royal Commission Act 1902, the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986 all contain some provision for individuals to make complaints about government breaches of ethical standards. However, none of these pieces of legislation were specifically intended to offer protection to whistleblowers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration report on the Management and Operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of December 1992 noted on page 56:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        ". . . the present system in the Australian Public Service, so far as there is one, allows for complaints to external agencies such as the Ombudsman, the Auditor-General, the MPRA or the AFP. Each review body has limited jurisdiction and complaints to any of them can fall through jurisdictional cracks or be reviewed in too narrow a context.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These comments affirm the need for an agency specifically designed to deal with whistleblowing. As can be seen from other comments made by the Committee on the same page there are further compelling reasons for the establishment of such an agency:

        "As the system currently operates, genuine whistleblowers are inadequately protected and their complaints may not be properly investigated but genuine, misguided and malicious whistleblowers alike are still able to secure repeated, often expensive, reviews by different bodies.

        and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "The absence of a comprehensive system for dealing with whistleblowing incidents probably increases the risk of improper behaviour by whistleblowers while reducing the likelihood that real malpractice will be reported. Unless there is a general perception that reports of malpractice will be competently and honestly investigated, some persons with concerns about administration will see publicity as the only way of having their concerns redressed and others will be deterred from raising them.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill has provisions to guard against claims that are made for personal gain, or which are frivolous or deliberately malicious. These provisions will include criminal liability for any person making a false claim to the Agency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In an article in The Australian Law Journal, Mr J.G. Starke pointed out: "the whistleblower must have reasonable grounds for believing that a crime or civil wrong has taken place or will take place; and there must be evidence of good faith on the part of the whistleblower".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill will complement the existing defences for whistleblowers under common law and will provide some protection for them legally. Our Government and public sector processes have been governed by official secrecy for over a century. Breaches of this secrecy have at times attracted criminal liability and, historically, no defence of public interest has been entertained. In Commonwealth legislation alone there are as many as 150 secrecy provisions which penalise the unauthorised disclosure of information. Possibly the most ubiquitous of these is section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which imposes a two year prison sentence for any unauthorised disclosure of information by a current or former Commonwealth employee.

        There have been moves to introduce some form of whistleblower protection through state based anti-corruption authorities in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia. Legislation is urgently needed at the Federal level because the community demands that government and bureaucracy should not be above the law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The considerable cost and damage and subsequent scandals relating to State government corruption in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia may never occurred had individuals been empowered to blow the whistle on corrupt practices. In all cases, some Government employees knew what was going on, but kept quiet. Had they felt protected by law, some of them may have been encouraged to tell the truth, saving taxpayers millions of dollars and preventing political and private sector practices from becoming so debased that the public, to a large degree, lost confidence in the political process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In Queensland, the Criminal Justice Commission and the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission have just finalised a report recommending state legislation allowing for whistleblowers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The former Corruption Commissioner, Tony Fitzgerald Q.C., drew attention to what he called an "urgent need" for whistleblower legislation. In his Report released on 3rd July 1989, on public administration and criminal justice in Queensland, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "It is enormously frustrating and demoralising for conscientious and honest public servants who work in a department or instrumentality in which maladministration or misconduct is present or even tolerated or encouraged. It is extremely difficult for such officers to report their knowledge to those in authority. Even if they do report their knowledge to a senior officer that officer might be in a difficult position.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the quote implies there may be no-one who can be trusted with the information. If either senior officers and/or politicians are involved in misconduct of corruption, the task of exposure becomes impossible for all but the exceptionally courageous or reckless, particularly after indications that such disclosures are not only unwelcome but attract retribution. Strong honest leadership is one step which is essential to a build-up of confidence. There is an urgent need, however, for legislation which prohibits any person from penalising any other person for making accurate public statements about misconduct, inefficiency or other problems within public instrumentalities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fitzgerald went on to argue, "It is necessary to establish a convenient means by which public officers can disclose matters of concern. What is required is an accessible, independent body to which disclosures can be made, confidentially at least in the first instance—and in any event free from fear of reprisals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Protection for whistleblowers should be an important element of modern government because this encourages employees to be a part of maintaining honest, effective and accountable government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Employees who blow the whistle on either a private corporation or government, although this legislation deals only with government, are often persecuted and eventually sacked, yet they have usually blown the whistle as an act of conscience with the greater good of society in mind. They are in fact, ethical resisters. By protecting whistleblowers we enable individuals to make an ethical choice between their responsibility to society generally and their obligations to their employers. To refuse such protection may be to require a person's complicity in activities which they abhor.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are double standards operating at present which condone whistleblowing in some circumstances yet, in other circumstances, see whistleblowers vilified and persecuted. For example, reporting a neighbour for defrauding the Social Security Department is regarded as laudable. If I inform the police of some criminal activity that I witnessed, I may even be paid money from public funds in return for demonstrating loyalty to the state. However, other whistleblowers may be variously ridiculed, referred for psychiatric assessment, sacked and possibly prosecuted because of their actions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present, the courts can do little to provide effective protection from harassment and intimidation to an employee who blows the whistle. What eventually breaks whistleblowers down, and deters others from supporting them, is the aversion and subtle abuse which they suffer on a daily basis at work.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation will offer extensive protection to the whistleblower, including protection for their physical safety and recompense for any harassment. Our system of liberal democracy should at least offer protection to an ethical resister who blows the whistle in the public interest.

        On the 2nd September 1993 Senator Newman moved a motion to set up a committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. The committee, which is to report on or before the first sitting day in March 1994, has been set up to inquire into whether the practice of whistleblowing should be the subject of Commonwealth legislation to enable the making of such disclosures in the public interest and, if so, what form the legislation should take.

          As I indicated earlier, there was a debate about this matter on Thursday, 30 September 1993 when I gave the notice of motion in association with the tabling of the committee's second report. Already Mr Greiner, a former premier of New South Wales, has given evidence to our committee. Mr Greiner indicated the way in which the Loan Council formerly operated and the procedures under which not only Victoria but also a number of other states clearly went outside the terms of the Loan Council.

           Exactly why they had gone outside the terms of the Loan Council is not at all clear. We know that Victoria most recently did so but we certainly know that other states have done so. I, personally—and, I am sure, other members of the committee—would like to know whether, for instance, it was the pressure being put on by the Commonwealth government in relation to restrictions in grants which made it feel it was necessary to move outside those limits. We need to get some sense of the overall financial management of this country with respect to the actual grants and with respect to the borrowings of the Commonwealth and the states.

           Contrary to what we have heard already from the government in this matter, I think it is necessary for the committee to round out the evidence it has heard so that we can be quite sure that the sorts of changes which have already been made to the operation of the Loan Council, and the sorts of changes which I am quite sure my committee will recommend be made as further changes to the operation of the Loan Council, will be adequate to meet the criterion that certainly I have been pursuing through this committee; that is, to make the operation of the Loan Council transparent and to make it accountable so that not only will the various members of the Loan Council, the states and the Commonwealth, know what is going on but also the public at large will have a clear perception of what is going on.

           I do not in any way agree with the government's charge that this is a political witch-hunt. I assure the Senate that it is not a political witch-hunt on my part at all. I think it is highly desirable that these people come before the committee, be answerable to the Senate, and allow the committee to make a much more rounded and much more comprehensive report to the Senate on which, one hopes, the government and the states will operate so that the Loan Council will become a much more accountable, much more responsible organisation and one in which the Australian public and, dare I say it, the financial sector will have some confidence, because I do not think they have had hitherto.

           It is true that from 1970 onwards the Senate, in seeking a role for itself, has sought to use the committee system to enhance the deliberations of this chamber and, for the most part, with some startling success in the last 22 years.

           We have set up various committees, the estimates committees being the most effective committees in the parliament. They are most effective when they stick to their role of being inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Sometimes they go over that line, sometimes they do not, but for the most part a degree of balance is kept. We also have an effective standing committee system which, in spite of probably too many references and too many inquiries, operates adequately. Those standing general purpose committees also have a legislative role which works, depending on the legislation and partisanship in this chamber, fairly adequately, meeting on Fridays.

           We also have available to us select committees. These are meant to focus on specific items that none of the other committees can particularly deal with. It does give the opportunity for the Senate chamber to gang up and get a non-government majority on them. Then we have the fifth sort of committee never envisaged in 1971 and that is the kangaroo court. That is the committee, the Star Chamber committee, that Senator Coulter now represents here with such honeyed words.

           Senator Coulter can say as much as he likes about getting a fair hearing and we may even believe him, but we do not believe that the three opposition members on the committee entered this with an objective stance. They entered with a closed political mind based on their prejudicial political position. Forget the terms of reference. Do those opposite really care about what the Loan Council is doing? They got into this for one reason and one reason alone, and that is to try to stitch up the federal Treasurer, John Dawkins. There is no other reason, and I will go through the details of that later. That is why we have this select committee. All the rest is dross. All the rest is window dressing to make it look respectable.

Ankle tappers would be a better description than headkickers. Nevertheless, they are put on there to do a political task. Not to be the independent senators assessing the evidence and coming back into this chamber and sharing their wisdom and knowledge with us; they were put in there to get a political result. That is why they voted for the committee to be set up in the first place. That is why they threatened a government majority on it. That is why Senator Coulter emerged as chairman—to be their patsy on that particular committee. That is the role Senator Coulter plays. He plays the role there as place seeker to serve their interests and nothing more, and nothing less. Whether he intended it that way, that is the way it has evolved and that is why this committee is an absolute disgrace to this chamber.

It was looking into the behaviour of a Treasurer. That will always attract publicity. The fact that it did not work out is neither Senator Coulter's fault nor anyone else's. Senator Coulter and his party got run over in the last federal election, not through a lack of effort or endeavour by Senator Coulter, as some Democrats would have us believe, but because they got rolled over in a polarised election. It would not matter who lead the Democrats; they were going to have difficulty finding a place in the sun, given that all the media attention was centred on two alternatives, and all minority parties suffered in the last federal election as a result of that.

That is a great ego boost to people sitting around here who have nothing else to do with their time. The enhancement of this chamber is an enhancement of their status in society. The more powerful the Senate is, the more powerful they are. Therefore, they seek constantly to push the envelope of Senate power out as far as it can go.

Maybe that reflected the three views of those opposite; I do not know. The meeting started at 12.25 p.m. to consider a final report of this committee. It was held in an Ansett lounge—first class, no doubt—in Melbourne.

           Then the record notes that the chairman departed at 12.38 p.m. The chairman was able to stay for 13 minutes. I thank Senator Coulter for being able to spend 13 minutes of his time on what he argues is a critical inquiry. He was willing to give 13 minutes of his time so that this enormous report could come down—coincidentally, two weeks before the election. So he disappeared. Obviously, he had not done his sums, because a couple of people were missing.

           Finally, Senator Short found himself in a minority. The majority report became a minority report because the chairman left after 13 minutes.

The finding of the kangaroo court was suddenly reversed because the other jury—which was probably equally politically biased, but at least it did not make a pretence about that—brought in a `not guilty' verdict, a different result. That could not be allowed to stand, could it?

Oops, not enough people have turned up. We don't have a quorum. Goodbye. We will have to call another meeting in a few weeks time, in Darwin or Port Kembla or somewhere else more conveniently placed'. But suddenly another member turned up, so a quorum was present.

Those opposite say that this is a serious inquiry and they were so impelled to get their decision in because of a Senate order. We have already had three motions today extending the lives of committees. It happens all the time; dates coinciding with elections are always extended.

Oh, gee whiz, I thank Senator Coulter for finding a political neuter, a moderate in politics who can use judgment and wisdom, such as Mr Kennett; I thank Senator Coulter for leaving it to him. I would hate Senator Coulter to find someone who was more fair, more generous, less of a political head kicker than Mr Kennett to make these decisions.

I do not think that certain remarks made by Senator Ray today can, in all reasonableness, be allowed to pass without comment. Senator Ray is quite correct that the coalition will be supporting Senator Coulter's motion. We will be doing so for one very good reason; that is, the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council has not concluded its activities and it cannot conclude its activities satisfactorily and adequately until the persons that this report recommends appear before the committee do so.

We have a Prime Minister who today is hell-bent on doing just that. He is hell-bent on a whole range of activities which include the total abolition of this house of the parliament, this Senate, so that we will not have a bicameral system which enables proper scrutiny of the work and policies of the executive of the day. The day that that happens, we cease to have a parliamentary democracy; we just have executive government. The events that have occurred under this present government, particularly under this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), should be of enough concern to each and every Australian—and I am sure that they are—to ensure that that does not ever, ever happen. That is, to a significant extent, what this motion is about.

           I would accept some of the points which Senator Ray made and which others have made about the actual operations of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council. In many respects, the Loan Council committee has not worked and functioned as well and as smoothly as we would have liked. For example, Senator Ray made reference to the meetings that were held in a rushed nature in airport lounges before the last election. The way he presented it, it sounded like a terribly clandestine, cloak and dagger operation. It was in fact nothing of the sort.

No-one has suggested that that is fully satisfactory. I certainly would not. I presume that Senator Coulter, the chairman of the committee, would not either. But to imply that, because the meeting was held there, there was something terribly wrong about the process is an absolute nonsense. If we talk about the coalition members of the committee usurping the proper role of the committee and its activities, one has to go back to last Thursday's debate on this matter when I had to respond to Senator Sherry who had been waxing vitriolically eloquent beforehand.

          I was one of the members of the committee—I was deputy chair at the time—who dissented from that report. This highlights the fact that the committee put out an interim report two weeks prior to the last election when we had heard from only one-third of the witnesses. Why did we put out a report two weeks before the last election, having heard so little of the evidence? I suggest to this chamber that it was for political reasons. It served two political purposes: it served Senator Coulter's purpose as then Leader of the Australian Democrats—I will return to that later—to get some publicity in the election campaign by attempting to embarrass this government and the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins; and it served the purpose of the opposition by attempting to create yet another issue in the election campaign.

           It is a gross misuse of the Senate's committee structure to bring down a report and to bring down conclusions, having heard so little of the evidence, two weeks prior to an election. It would be stretching the credibility of everyone in this place to suggest that that report was brought down two weeks before the election for any reason other than for political purposes.

           But there are other reasons of a more practical nature for opposing this motion. If officials, premiers and ministers who represent state governments are to have confidential dealings with the federal government, in future what is to stop a Senate committee from calling them before it because it suits the political majority of the time? What is to stop such committees demanding the attendance of state ministers or premiers? How can we have any confidential dealings between government ministers or premiers and the federal government of the day if there is a risk that they can then be called before a Senate committee, because the political majority is of a different complexion, and have to disclose all that occurred in those confidential negotiations? That is a very serious problem that could emerge from this process.

           We could also have the ridiculous situation where the Victorian state parliament, on the whim of the Premier, Mr Kennett, could attempt to require the attendance of Labor members. But I suspect that the Tasmanian parliament, where there is a Liberal majority, will be not requiring the attendance of Robin Gray, the former premier and treasurer, or Tony Rundle, MHA, the current treasurer. I do not believe that the Tasmanian parliament, which is of the same complexion as that of Victoria, will attempt to instruct or coerce the previous premier-treasurer or the current treasurer. Why not? First, it would regard it as outrageous that the Tasmanian government and the Tasmanian parliament should be pressured by the Senate in this way. Secondly, I would love to have Robin Gray and Tony Rundle here because we could attempt to expose the near bankruptcy that Tasmania was sent to by Robin Gray when he was Treasurer and Premier, a situation which Mr Tony Rundle, who was not Treasurer then, is attempting to rectify in some ways. I would love to have those two before us because I would grill them. That is what we should be doing but it is not the correct process or the correct form to do it in this way through the powers of the Senate. I think that is a very important principle.

I have never sat on a committee like this, and I am sure Senator Short has never sat on such a committee, but the behaviour was not all one way. I, as deputy chair, Senator Faulkner and another of our senators set out in a positive way to address the issues before this committee. But as soon as the election was called, it was on. Senator Coulter and members of the opposition were trying to score political points during the campaign. Why were we having meetings and handing down reports during the election campaign when we had not heard the evidence? The behaviour was quite appalling.

There were three government members, Senator Coulter and members of the opposition. The opposition had a report which it claimed was a majority report. The trouble was that three outnumbered two. On very short notice, this interim report was given to me. We turned up on the Saturday and the final draft of the interim report was presented to me on the Thursday prior—two days before. That was the first major indication that we were in for a political game from those opposite.

We were expected to go through a 60-page report in half an hour, which was an outrage. As it was, we sat around waiting for the chairman, who was running late because of the election campaign, and we finally got under way at 12.25. The chairman said, `Ratify this report now because I am off to catch a plane at 12.38'. That is the sort of behaviour we had to put up with from this committee. The chairman left. I will give Senator Short his due: he did stick it out; he turned up to the meetings; he put the arguments; he certainly made a solid contribution, if not disruptive, to attempt to drag another election issue up.

The chairman decided that we would have another meeting, but this time it would be in Sydney in the Flight Deck lounge. This meeting was set for 1 March in an attempt to overturn the earlier decision. It was quite democratically arrived at. I have never been part of a process in this place where a meeting is held at which there is a majority, and then two weeks later the minority, who are upset about the report, attempt to reverse it by holding another meeting.

We decided that this was a totally undemocratic process, so the committee was left without a quorum. A little later Senator Bishop did turn up but after the second meeting had lapsed. Senator Coulter informed us—and I believe quite incorrectly and quite illegally—that there would be another meeting in about 15 minutes.

Senator Faulkner moved dissent from the chairman's ruling to accept the motion from Senator Bishop to reverse the previous committee meeting's decision.

           In conclusion, this motion should be strongly opposed. It grants a major increase in the Senate's power that was not envisaged at the time of the writing of the constitution. Ironically, it is a usurpation of states rights and powers which is totally inappropriate. It will also bring about the situation where future ministers and premiers will find it very difficult to have any dealings in confidence with each other or, indeed, the federal parliament or the federal executive if they believe they may be called before Senate committees. That is a totally inappropriate way to behave.

           Very simply, to reiterate, this committee was established for two reasons. Firstly, it was established to look into the circumstances and reasons behind the failure of the Treasurer to disclose in the budget papers the fact that Victoria had breached the Loan Council guidelines. The Treasurer knew of it; that was disclosed in the evidence. We wanted to know why and how this happened, and how that sort of thing could be prevented in the future.

           To do that we believed there were several key people from whom we needed to hear. Firstly, we obviously wanted to hear what reasons Mr Dawkins wanted to put forward, but the Prime Minister said that he had to hide behind his skirts—he could not be a man and front up himself, he had to hide behind the skirts of the Prime Minister. So much for Mr Dawkins saying the other day that he and Mr Keating were a wonderful team working together. One wears the pants and one wears the skirts. We have seen Mr Dawkins being told that he may not appear.

           Secondly, we had the Labor Party caucus in Victoria telling Mrs Kirner and some of her former ministers that they may not appear, not because it was a question for the parliament to determine or them as individuals, but because the caucus—the people who really wield the power—said they could not appear. Thirdly, we needed to hear from other people who could give good evidence as to how the system of the Loan Council and the whole concept of keeping control on the total borrowings of public authorities in Australia could be monitored and kept in check so that the Australian economy as a whole would benefit. We needed to hear the opinions of people who were affected by those guidelines. So we heard from Mr Stockdale. We heard from Mr Greiner, who gave evidence which was useful in drawing those conclusions.

           That bears on the second important part of the committee, and that is to determine how in the future the mystique that has surrounded the Loan Council can be broken and how we can see quite plainly the way in which the system works so that we get that concept, as Nick Greiner called it, of a federal budget. The two objectives of the committee will be well served by this motion being passed today and by requests being made of other parliaments and other houses for those people to come forward and give evidence which can then be usefully assessed, not only by those people who sit on the committee but also by those people who read the evidence as well, so that Australia as a whole can benefit from this investigation.

           I simply say that this is a sensible way to move. The angst of the Labor Party and those who speak for the Labor Party is simply part and parcel of the frustration they feel because they have been diminished by the Australian people's vote to have only 30 senators in this chamber of 76. The opposition has 36 senators, the Democrats seven, the Greens two and Senator Harradine his own vote.

           It is the paucity of the representation that the Labor Party has been able to gain in this chamber which adds to its angst, to its anger and, indeed, if I might add, to the loss of control and outburst by the Prime Minister in the other place today where he shut down question time saying it was a privilege to be bestowed. With that sort of attitude, I am afraid it is well to ensure that this Senate acts in a responsible way which it will be doing by passing this motion today.

What was clearly being pursued, as demonstrated in point 2.72 of the report that was presented two weeks before the federal election, was that the conservative members of this committee, aided and abetted by the Democrats, had clearly made up their minds.

Senator Coulter has also said that he thought the entire Labor caucus in Victoria should be cited for contempt. That demonstrates a couple of things. In a sense, it demonstrates that Senator Coulter understands how the Victorian parliament really works—that with 60 votes Mr Kennett can pass whatever motion he wants in that chamber. It also demonstrates, in my view, a clear attitude about the Labor Party and the Victorian state caucus. That attitude does not fit very well with the image that Senator Coulter wants to present to us of him being an intellectual man, and a man concerned about rationality because, clearly, the course of action that he is pursuing is not a rational one.

           What we are talking about here is a political witch-hunt. We are talking about an attempt to use this committee as a device to test the powers of the Senate. I cannot see that particular clause anywhere in the terms of reference; I cannot see any attempt, with the approval of this Senate, to test the powers of the Senate by using this committee.

           In my view, there is no point in pursuing the question of various state members appearing because we all understand that the evidence is there. We have a clear view as to what has happened. It is quite clear from statements that have been made in evidence to the committee that opposition members have a clear understanding of what they believe has happened. They have a closed mind on the issue. We could just say, `Why don't they just appear?  What have they got to hide?' What has happened is that again and again this committee has behaved in a totally partisan, political manner. It has operated on the basis of a witch-hunt and, as a result, people should have no confidence whatsoever that they would be treated properly or fairly.

           The normal rules of evidence do not apply before a Senate committee. It is not a court. Despite the presumptions and the arrogance of certain senators in this place, this is not a court of law. The powers and functions of the Senate cannot be assumed to be those of a judge, as some would like them to be. We cannot assume that there is an inquisitional role for this Senate because in the Australian context that does not exist for our courts themselves. The whole question in my mind is fraught with legal difficulties.

I do not think that those opposite have given proper consideration to this either. I am not a states rights person but I do acknowledge that a constitution does exist at the moment. I do acknowledge that there are parliaments across this country and that the normal internationally recognised conventions of comity mean that the powers of the various parliaments have to be treated with some equality.

           Another example is when the Victorian Legislative Assembly had to face this sort of stunt back in 1971.

As I understand it, we are going to vote today on whether we will put certain investigative tools into the hands of a Senate committee. A Senate committee has even more powers than a royal commission or a judicial inquiry. Yet those bodies have all sorts of safeguards applied to them. First of all, they usually have judges sitting on them. And judges, no matter what the present climate is in regard to them, do have a greater capacity than most to act fairly and to administer the rule of law.

But I am saying that the judges who sit on royal commissions and on judicial inquiries have greater constraints placed on them than members of Senate committees. A royal commission or a judicial inquiry is usually directed to some specific topic. People are called not, as it were, to answer fishing questions but to answer something that can be of assistance to the inquiry and which those conducting the inquiry know about.

It is of considerable concern that a committee that should be going ahead with an open mind should be seeking to  get  its  political opponents  before  it  defenceless, as I gather they will be because there is no restraint on the sorts of questions that can be asked, to pursue a course which has been predetermined.

Given that stance, how can it possibly go about a calm and assured consideration of this very important issue, particularly when the chairman, a man I have great respect for and who I think has been a credit to the Senate, is in a position where a representative from the coalition side of the committee is able to put—and I am sure that Senator Coulter will nod acquiescence—some quite partisan political propositions?  Senator Coulter in no way tried to dissociate himself from that process. I am very concerned that that should be the position, particularly since, if I heard Senator Carr correctly, there is no precedent for this. In effect, this is making a request of the parliament of another country, because we must remember that for these purposes the states are separate countries and are not under this parliament.

           —I agree with Senator Sherry. It will be very interesting to see whether they comply with this. I think when they think about it they will be very reluctant to make any order—even those states, and perhaps particularly those states where the people sought are from a particular party. That parliament, dominated by a particular party, as it is in Victoria by the coalition in both houses, returned in overwhelming numbers at the last election, will be asked to offer up as a sacrificial lamb three of its political opponents to a house and to a committee which are political.

           This committee has become soured. I say that with great respect to Senator Coulter, Senator Short, Senator Sherry and Senator Carr. I am afraid that that is the assessment I have made of that committee. The committee has become quite partisan, which is not uncommon for a lot of committees. I think Senator Bishop once said that the only two committees that are not political are the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. It is a most extraordinary course to follow in those circumstances.

           —in reply—I am surprised at the length that we have gone to with this debate. I would like to correct some of the assertions which have been made, particularly in view of what Senator Cooney has just said. He seems to be implying that everything that is said in this chamber which is in any way odious or objectionable to some person should be picked up by the person next speaking and corrected. Of course, that would be quite impossible.

           —There are a lot of things that are said in this chamber from time to time that one lets pass simply because there are more important things to get on with. I think it is true that, given the sensitive nature of the investigation of this committee, the committee has become partisan—but that is as true of the government members as it is of the opposition members.

           Quite clearly in this case, where we are seeking to bring some members of the former Victorian government before the committee, it is the government members who find it objectionable and who are speaking out loudest against it. But that is not to say that those people who were members of the former Victorian government do not have very important evidence to put before this committee. For Senator Carr to say, `We have already had X number of people come before the committee and give evidence, therefore we do not need other people to come before the committee' is illogical. If we have key people who have evidence that is relevant to the committee and those people have not yet come before the committee, it is important for them to come before the committee. It does not matter how many other witnesses we have had. It is a non sequitur for him to argue that way.

           The fact is that since the first report of the committee, which was presented to the President in the lead-up to the election, we have had very significant evidence from the former head of the Victorian Treasury which bears very much on the need to bring the former Victorian Treasurer and the former Premier of Victoria before this committee if we can possibly get them. From my point of view, that is not to pursue them in a party political way; it is to find out precisely why they felt it necessary to behave in the way that they did, according to the evidence that we now have. Looking prospectively, it is to attempt, firstly, to ensure that it is not necessary for members of state parliaments to behave in that way in future; and secondly, to ensure that the operation of the Loan Council is so ordered that those people do not operate in that way in future. I am certainly approaching these matters from a very prospective viewpoint. However, it is necessary to get the evidence to find out exactly what happened and to make sure that it does not happen again.

It is a very significant matter that we are considering; that is, that the operation of that Loan Council be transparent to the other members of the Loan Council and also to the Australian public, and that the procedures be accountable.

           I briefly turn to the matter of the circumstances of the reporting during the election. I think that has been touched on by Senator Short. It is important to reiterate that the reporting date of this committee was set long before the election was called.

           From my point of view as, hopefully, an impartial chair of that committee, I point out to the Senate that I was in a situation where we had evidence in relation to the behaviour of the Victorian government and in relation to the behaviour of the federal Treasurer and the federal Treasury. What does one do? In that situation I had two choices. I could either report on the evidence that we had up to that stage—clearly, that would bring forth the sort of ire that we have heard this afternoon from the members of the government—or I could say, `Well, we don't have enough evidence yet. Let's roll over until after the election is over'. Quite clearly. one would have then copped the ire of the opposition, saying that to not report on the evidence the committee had before it at that stage was a partisan thing to do. On balance I thought, again on the grounds of openness and transparency, that we should put before the President of the Senate the evidence that we had at that stage and seek to go on after the election.

           In answering Senator Cooney, raising points made by other senators, that is precisely the reason why I chose to agree with the report as it came before the President in the lead-up to the election. As to the date, that was set before the election. As to the actual meetings, it is not at all unusual for Senate committees to meet in strange places. I have been on several other committees that have met in private meeting rooms in airports, if that was the only place where all the committee members could come together because it just happened that several committee members were passing through a particular airport at a time when they could meet in that place. There is nothing at all unusual about that. They were properly constituted meetings.

           In relation to the shenanigans—I think that was the word used—where the chair changed and I was briefly at a meeting, as Senator Robert Ray was pointing out, that occurred because, quite frankly, we had a draft report, I had spoken with the various members of the committee, those members were busy, we knew the meeting should be short and I thought we had an agreement that the committee report would be the committee report and that an understandably dissenting report would come from the Labor Party members which would be included, and that would be the end of the meeting. But the Labor members chose that that was not the way that meeting was to be conducted. Knowing that I had a very short time to be at the committee, they waited until I had to go on to the next flight and then attempted to hijack that committee and to put a different report down.

           As Senator Carr has pointed out, we are in uncharted waters, but I believe the report of this committee will be improved. The evidence will be more comprehensive if these people do come before the committee. Whether they will or not is unknown at this stage, but for Senator Carr to go on and anticipate what the committee might do if they choose not to appear is to move even further into uncharted waters. To hypothesise that we might take certain action is, of course, at this stage totally irrelevant. I commend the motion to the Senate.

But it is obviously of interest to honourable senators to know the order in which the government now intends to schedule these three packages. I think there are probably better options than that which I am about to outline, but I understand that the opposition's preference is to commence with Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) 1993, to then proceed to the sales tax package and then to deal with the two bills on which we are waiting for the committee to report.

A fundamental problem with this convention is that it has been challenged on the basis that the relationship between the rights of the child and those of the parent concerned has not been adequately defined, especially where they come into conflict with each other.

        , published in the Australian Journal of Family Law in August of last year, its authors, Otlowski and Tsamenyi, stated that, contrary to the assertions of opponents of the convention, it does not seek to define the rights of children vis-a-vis their parents, but rather to protect the rights of children and the rights of parents, exercising their responsibilities in respect of children, from state interference. Of course, that does not really accord with the cover of the report by the National Children's Bureau of Australia, which I have just mentioned, where we have a child confronting his parents over the convention itself. I think that there has been a matter of fundamental concern, certainly from the people who have communicated with my office.

        I think it is timely to remember the comments by Senator Bolkus to the effect that the convention would not affect domestic legislation, although there was a need to ensure that Commonwealth practices were in accordance with the convention. That means our domestic legislation will have to accord with the convention. If there is some problem in distinguishing the rights of the child as opposed to the rights of the parent, we in Australia could suffer a good deal of confusion in relation to our domestic legislation as a natural follow on from that.

        As I stated previously, Australia has indeed a very fine record in relation to legislation protecting children. I mentioned the Australian Family Law Act which states, among other things, that access is a right of the child and not of the parent; it also provides for separate representation for children and places heavy accent on the wishes of children in relation to custody and guardianship cases.

        When the matter is looked at in a practical sense, Australia today is well ahead of other countries in the world in relation to the rights of the child. I see no need for there to be such a declaration. We have signed the convention; that is sufficient. I do not believe that, as Senator Spindler said, not to allow this declaration would be to slow down the process of enhancing the rights of the child, because I believe that we are well in front of the rest of the world in any event. The old maxim that if change is not necessary why is it necessary to change is applicable here in this case.

        We have signed the convention; we have shown this country's concern for the matters raised in that convention; but I do not think we need take it any further in relation to a declaration by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I say that especially in view of the fact that so much community concern has been raised on this issue. One recalls that there were only some three years of deliberation in the ratification and declaration of this convention as opposed to some 11 years on the convention respecting religious freedom. I believe that such an important matter as this should have wide debate over a good period of time so that all sectors of the Australian community can have an input—an input which I believe may have been lacking in the past.

        Certainly the convention raises some very good points and the coalition does not oppose it as such.

To that extent there is no need to take that further step in the declaration that was made by the Attorney-General and I would urge the Senate to support a disallowance.

        This convention is about the rights of the child. What about the rights of the parent? It seems ironic that the United Nations, one of the most dysfunctional institutions in the world, will tell me and all Australians how to look after the welfare of our children. The United Nations is $3,000 million in debt as of September this year; it cannot even run its own organisation. Some 146 nations of the world are behind in their payments to the United Nations and that body seeks to tell us how to look after our children.

        Allowing this United Nations convention to become part of Australia's law will result in Australia's stand in this field being finally decided by an appeal to a United Nations committee of which people of other countries are the members. It could well include representatives from countries such as China with its one child policy and its infanticide of handicapped children, particularly female children; and countries such as Iran, with its muslim fundamentalist policy; countries such as India which, as we saw on television the other night, uses ultrasound to determine the sex of children so that female children can be aborted. These are the countries which are to determine how we will look after Australia's children. The words of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are so vague as to allow such a committee to decide that they mean entirely different things from what we in Australia consider them to mean.

        Australia is well served with its existing laws in this field and we wish this to continue without allowing these matters to be determined by such United Nations committees. That will occur if the rights convention is allowed to become part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act. It appears that by adopting such a convention the role of the parent in forming a strong family bond is secondary to the rights of the child. The family is the most fundamental unit in our society—in every society. By focusing on one part of the family unit, we will ultimately see the family's continued breakdown and its importance marginalised.

        So while accepting the need to look after the rights of the child, I believe the greater need is to protect the family. Even the United Nations states that the family is the neutral and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society in the state. But what about protection from society and protection from the state? That is what is occurring in relation to this convention. Society is crumbling and at present immorality is a growth industry. Public expenditure is spiralling; `commitment' has slipped out of the national vocabulary; and children are running amuck. Most of the reasons for the breakdown of the family stem from intervention from government and from society.

        The family is society's best social unit in which values, heritage and culture are transmitted from generation to generation. The family provides care, love and understanding. How any international convention can provide love and warmth to children is beyond me. With marriage breakdown at alarming levels—an increase of seven per cent last year, in fact—Australia needs protection for the family, the unit that forms the basis for the nurturing and educating of us all. If we myopically focus on just one member of this institution, we ignore the importance of the whole, because never has the whole been more important than the sum of all parts.

It believes these are the values which represent a balanced Christian response to the challenges that face our society. Mr McNicol thought that this clarified its position and that, in the days ahead, we will be able to see, through the spoken and printed word, that what they stand for is exemplified in the words of St Augustine: `Unity in essentials, liberty in non-essentials and charity in all things'.

         —There is no real opposition to the suspension of standing orders. Although I have had a brief opportunity to look at the motion, I have not had a chance to consult with my colleagues. It seems that if the suspension is carried—if you would allow me a little licence to talk about that, Mr President, to try to facilitate the proceedings—the active part of the motion that Senator Short wishes to move is not something with which I think we will have any concern. It contains within it, by way of preamble, certain statements of opinion which, on the face of it, we do not agree with.

         I have not had a chance to study them but they seem to me to be quite unnecessary and a little provocative in an exercise which, as I understand it, is merely an attempt to establish that this procedure is without prejudice to subsequent debates in the Senate about how we might handle these things. I am not, on the face of it, fussed about that, but we cannot just have sprung on us a motion that has in it some statements of opinion about whether the government's legislation was originally valid or not. I realise that that is of no constitutional effect but it is some statement of view of the Senate which we could not comfortably agree with.

         This is a motion which we need to have carried before we get to the committee stage of the bill. I do not see why we have to have it carried now. I think we can get agreement—as I said, I have not consulted any of my colleagues; this is just my personal reaction from one look at the motion—about the action part if we can get some time to discuss it and take out the unnecessary and provocative little paragraphs.

         I am advised by the Clerk that this occurred in 1981, but this process is new to all of us here. Perhaps I can get some indication of whether there is some reason why this has to be carried now rather than in an hour's time, when we have had a chance to talk about the terms of the motion and get something we can agree with. As I said, on the face of it, the essence of the motion—in that we are not expressing an opinion ultimately about the powers of the Senate with regard to this matter—seems to be something about which we would be relaxed. But we cannot tag on to it a couple of exhortations about whether or not things were valid previously. That seems to me to be unnecessary.

         Perhaps we can consider this sometime between now and when we get to the committee stage, because I accept that people would want to do that before then, but I do not see why it has to be carried now. If that option is open to us, I would prefer to exercise that option. Perhaps while I have been speaking I have given people a little time to think about that process. The import of it seems to apply only once we get to the committee stage, Mr President. You may be able to give us some information on that.

Mr President, are you suggesting that I do not move anything at the moment but that I move something in an hour's time or, rather, that I move now what I propose to move and we consider it further in an hour's time? I have had circulated in the chamber the wording of the motion. Senator McMullan did not have a chance to read it carefully before, but it was the wording of the two preambular parts or `notings' by the Senate which, prima facie, caused him some difficulty. They are not assertions by the Senate; it is just the Senate noting the assertion by the government and the conclusion by the standing committee. I do not know whether, on closer reflection, he would have a problem with it. I do not really mind; I am seeking clarification on which way we go.

         —by leave—Mr President, if I understand you correctly, there are two motions that Senator Short needs to move: one is the suspension and one is the motion that says that he be empowered to move the particular motion, in the standard format. I think we can carry both of those. That would mean that he would have the right under standing orders to move it at some stage but would not exercise it at this minute. He will have been authorised by the Senate to move it at some stage and we will come back after a couple of second reading debate speeches to deal with it in a way that we can all agree with.

         That is, as I understand it, what the President is advising, on advice, and it will make sure that Senator Short cannot get caught out without having the chance to move it before the end of the second reading stage, and that we cannot get caught out by carrying it without having had a chance to have a proper look at it. If Senator Short goes through the first two stages but does not proceed to the third at this point, we will give him an undertaking that at some reasonably early stage during the course of the second reading debate we will enable him to move the motion. So we will support the suspension now but not proceed to the third stage—that is, the final motion itself.

          —The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) is the first of the eight bills that the Senate will be debating, consequent upon the government's decision following the advice received by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the original omnibus bill that the government had proposed—namely, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993—was or could be unconstitutional because it sought to impose a range of different taxation measures and increases all wrapped up in the one bill.

          That bill was an outrageous attempt to circumvent proper parliamentary consideration of the major budget related legislation so far as the taxation aspects of the budget package were concerned. What the government was aiming to do with that catch-all bill was somehow or other to play tricky games with the parliament, particularly with the Senate, to try to make it more difficult for the Senate to exercise its judgment and its responsibility for taking proper and duly considered views and, subsequently, to make decisions on the various elements of the taxation proposals that the government is making in this budget.

          Fortunately, the Senate, in its wisdom, rejected that proposition and, as a result of the pressure generated by the coalition, the government in the end took the decision to split that one bill into eight bills. This is one of the eight bills. Those bills cover a very wide range, indeed. Some of them impose very unfair, harsh and regressive tax increases which are in blatant disregard of the government's pre-election commitment not to increase taxes.

          Those bills impose a huge 55 per cent increase on one of Australia's major industries with great export potential—the wine industry. They impose new taxes that threaten the jobs of up to 20,000 employees in the tourism industry. They are part of a package of bills that impose very savage increases in the price of fuel for motorists, especially lower income motorists who are forced by this government to own older cars which use leaded petrol. The fuel tax increases are dealt with in a related package of bills; they are not part of these eight bills. Those increases will impose enormous costs on our transport industry and many of our major mining companies. They will be subject to debate in the context of other bills and I will not pursue them further here.

          The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) effectively abandons two-thirds of the personal income tax cuts that the government promised before the election and, indeed, legislated last year into l-a-w, law—to use the Treasurer's infamous words of a few months ago. This bill which is now before us seeks to change that set in concrete, unequivocal promise which had been passed into l-a-w, law. We are amending that promise with this bill.

That is something like 40 per cent of all wage earners and 60 per cent of all female employees in the work force. The bill provides a lousy $2.88 per week to offset the savage tax increases placed on practically everything that they buy.

          The purpose of this bill is twofold. One of the basic propositions of the bill is to bring forward the 1994-95 tax cuts. The first of the government's proposals for the two-stage tax cuts that were promised in the budget was that the first one would occur on 1 July 1994 and that the second one would occur on 1 January 1996. The latter promise has gone out the window. This bill legislates for the second tax cuts to be announced at the start of a financial year, whenever that may be, but not before 1997 or 1998. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has said that it will probably be 1998, but it will not be any earlier. The first stage, on the other hand, is being brought forward by a period of about 7 1/2 months to 15 November this year. But that is much the smaller part of the tax cut proposals of the government.

          The bill also contains an amazing and absolutely unacceptable proposition: that the date of effect of the first set of the tax cuts—which will now be the only tax cut—is when royal assent has been received for the accompanying package of sales tax bills and also the budget bills that impose very steep increases in the application of fringe benefits tax to various industries, particularly the hospitality and tourism industry. The bill also imposes a disadvantageous change in the tax regime for credit unions as well as a range of other tax increases.

That is an absolutely unacceptable proposal. For that reason I will be moving an amendment to the motion before the Senate to add the following words:

         That provision in the bill is nothing more than a blatant attempt to blackmail the Senate into passing all the accompanying harsh, regressive and unfair bills for which the government has no mandate at all. I refer to the staggering increase in the tax on wine, the increase in sales tax on all goods that are already subject to sales tax and the increases in a range of other taxes as well. This budget increases sales tax for most items to which sales tax applies by no less than 10 per cent in stage one. That is to apply from budget night, which was 17 August this year. The second stage, which will result in a further 10 per cent increase in the rate of sales tax on most items, will apply a couple of years later.

          None of those taxes was foreshadowed in the run-up to the election. Indeed, the government went out of its way to stress in the period leading up to the election that it would not, and would not need to, increase taxation in order to pay for the income tax cuts that it promised in an outrageous bribe to the electorate before the election. It has now welshed on those promises to the tune of at least two-thirds of the value of those personal income tax cuts.

          The government is abolishing the major part of its personal income tax promise; increasing sales tax across the board; putting a huge additional impost on one of Australia's major export opportunity industries—namely, the wine industry; and slugging motorists and the transport industry, through very savage increases on fuel taxes, with all the increases in costs that we know that will cause. Everything it has done in that context is absolutely contrary to the expectations that the electorate had at election time. Indeed, it is absolutely contrary to the government's mandate at the election, if it had one at all.

          The amazing thing we find is that in an interview yesterday the Prime Minister, when asked about this infamous linkage between the giving of the tax cuts contained in this bill and the parliament passing the other tax bills—the indirect tax increases—said that this linkage `means nothing'. He told ABC radio yesterday, `Let's forget about all the technical, tricky, rinky-dinky things'. Again, that is a major reversal of the government's view as expressed in this tax legislation. If the Prime Minister says this bill is to mean nothing, why is the government introducing an unprecedented linkage clause into it—a clause which links this bill with bills that are not related to it in any way, shape or form? It is simply another example of a government in absolute chaos in terms of its economic and budgetary policy.

          The budget strategy is in absolute tatters, but not because of any delay imposed by the coalition or this chamber. Indeed, if anything, at this stage we in the Senate are ahead in the consideration of the budget and related bills compared with the average of previous years. On average, in the 10 years that this government has been in office, the appropriation bills—the expenditure bills—have normally been passed in the latter part of October or the early part of November, similarly with the revenue bills. We are not up to that stage yet and there is not necessarily any indication that there will be any delay beyond the average in the passage of these bills. The only reason why there will be a delay in the passage of these bills is if the government insists on pursuing tactics which deliberately frustrate the parliament's consideration of the budget bills in due and proper form.

          The other aspect that needs to be stressed, given the whole shibboleth of lies, innuendo and misleading statements being made by the government about the opposition's handling of the budget bills, is that the coalition has never said that it will not pass the appropriation bills in the normal way. Indeed, we have said the contrary: that we will not block supply. There has never been the vaguest suggestion that we would do that. The government is assured of the passage of its appropriation bills.

For the Prime Minister and his Treasurer to run around saying that the opposition is frustrating the proper budget process is, firstly, factually wrong. Secondly, there is no basis at all for saying that the government's budget is being wrecked, because we are guaranteeing the government 100 per cent of its expenditure side of the budget and 98 1/2 per cent of its revenue.

In fact, the budget this year is not a deficit reduction budget, it is a deficit blow-out. The deficit last year was $14 1/2 billion. This year, even if the government got all its budget through, the deficit, on the government's own figures, would be $16 billion and that is probably an underestimation because it is based on a very highly suspect forecast of economic growth.

          Let us take the proposition that this bill is dependent upon the passage of a raft of bills which will bring in income to the Treasury. It would seem to me to be reasonable that anybody who wants to bring in a responsible budget will try to balance that budget. We on this side of the chamber are often taken to task for spending when it is said we should not be doing so. Surely it is a very sensible proposition to adhere to that if tax cuts are going to be given, there has to be money from other sources to pay for them.

          I repeat this point because it is worth repeating. It is very bad to have a fiscally flawed budget which does no good for this country. But should we put at risk the good of the country and the economic soundness of the economy simply because we have a perception that the party that is now the government said something during an election campaign which we now think it has not adhered to? I would have thought the proper way of dealing with that is to point that out to the people and to make sure that they do not vote for that party at the next election. I would have thought it a very bad ploy and a very bad strategy to vote down taxation bills or appropriation bills simply as a way of punishing the government. Those opposite may or may not wish to punish the government. But the point must be made strongly that by trying to punish the government they are really doing great harm to the people of Australia.

It provides that the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November this year, which is seven or eight months earlier than originally scheduled. That provision is on the basis that those tax cuts will be accommodated by other provisions in other bills. That is the reason why the provisions in Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) are to commence on the day that the other bills mentioned come into operation. The second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. George Gear, states:

          The bill will also provide a rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $24,450. The new rebate will mainly assist those taxpayers who do not benefit from the One Nation tax cuts.

         Much ridicule has been heaped upon the rebate provided there on the basis that $150 a year is not a great amount. But $150 a year is a significant sum; it is some $3 a week. Certainly for people who live in a frugal fashion, $3 a week is a substantial sum.

Sometimes in this chamber I think we forget just how frugally people do live. Senator Watson, Senator Panizza and I really could not complain about the lifestyle that we enjoy and that we enjoyed for several years before we came into this chamber. All I am saying is that a sum of $3 a week, $150 a year, should not be brushed aside as though it is of no significance. It does provide money in the pockets of people and to that extent they are able to spend it. Clearly what we need in the community at the moment is people spending money and buying goods in stores so that the demand for those goods goes up and the economy starts moving along at an even better rate than is the case at present.

          I turn to the budget generally. There has been a great deal of debate and criticism about the budget. Much publicity has been attracted by various people, including people in the Senate. But I would think that people like Senator Watson and Senator Panizza would be concerned to see that a budget is passed as soon as practicable. I understand the objections that they have to much that it contains, but I think they would agree that the point has now been reached where it is advisable—indeed absolutely necessary—that this budget be passed.

          The economy of Australia is largely dependent upon certainty. One of the factors that are now causing uncertainty is the way that this budget is being handled. I use that expression generally. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us all to see what we can do about getting it passed and to examine the objections.

          One of the objections to the budget which I would like to address is the question of the wine tax. It is a tax that we have to look at from several levels. Speaking for myself, I cannot see why a tax should not be placed on wine. The argument is raised that if we do that, an industry that has developed and is now burgeoning will be cut back. I question that because there seems to be no hard and fast evidence available. Plenty of assertions and allegations have been made but there seems to be no convincing evidence that that would happen.

          If we take that approach to the wine industry, then we would have to take that approach to every industry that we want to place a tax on. For example, the dairy industry, the tourist industry and others could say, `Look, if we weren't taxed, we would be able to put more money into development and away we would go'. In my view, the argument against the wine tax is not an argument that is apposite only to the wine industry but to any industry. It is really a manifestation of the argument that nobody likes to pay tax but somebody has to pay. As a matter of principle—and I would be interested to hear somebody like Senator Watson explain this—why should the wine industry be isolated out and given special treatment?

          The Liberal-National coalition is not taking this stand to create a precedent for all time. We are facing extraordinary circumstances. The government misled the Australian people at the last election by promising—just to mention three promises—no new taxes, no increased taxes and fully funded income tax cuts. It went to the Australian people with promises and a hope. The Australian people believed the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and his ministers. It is incumbent upon an opposition in this parliament to keep that government honest with respect to its election commitments.

Amendments will be needed because, if the government is going to keep its deficit reduction strategy in place—and that is absolutely necessary—it will have to defer the tax cuts. In his budget speech, Mr Dawkins spoke of Australia becoming more competitive and of the need to remove Australia's inherent `tyranny of distance'. But, contrary to what he said, as the road freight transport industry reminded us the other day, the planned massive increases to diesel excise and wholesale sales tax creates a tyranny of taxation which will gravely impact on Australia's economic, road safety, social and environmental record. This points to a concerning indifference by the government to the plight of significant sections of the economy. That is why we are making these changes and adopting these tactics.

This was abandoned by Treasurer Dawkins on 18 March. The second promise was to improve access for low income earners to emergency and dental care. This will now start next year instead of 1 July this year. The third promise was that 10,000 private hospital beds will be made available to Medicare patients. This money is now to be spent elsewhere. The fourth promise was that withdrawals of up to $10,000 for all superannuants would be allowed from superannuation funds for investment in housing. This is now significantly changed. The fifth promise was that tax cuts for middle and higher income earners would be paid for in July 1994 and January 1996.

          When the income tax reductions were first promised in the One Nation statement, the Prime Minister stated unequivocally then and up to the date of the election that the reductions would be fully funded, as opposed to the coalition's proposal for a broad based consumption tax, which did not need to be fully funded either wholly or partially from increases in other revenue sources. Who can forget the Prime Minister boasting at the National Press Club, and to anyone else who listened, that he could deliver the same tax cuts that the coalition was offering but without the GST—that is, without an increase in the indirect tax base. Let me remind this chamber of what the Prime Minister said during the 1993 election campaign. He said:

         But what we have before us today is a re-legislation of the tax cuts. During the election campaign it was never stated that there would be a corresponding increase in sales tax to fund the tax reductions, nor was the possibility of such a necessity even remotely recognised. In fact, the opposite occurred. The Labor government disavowed the need for a greater indirect tax revenue and argued that the income tax reductions had been given the status of law that was somewhat irreversible.

          The government's choices are quite clear. If these income tax reductions can be made only with tax increases elsewhere in the revenue, the government should be honest enough to admit that the reductions were irresponsible and unfunded in the first place, amounting to nothing more than desperate and mendacious bribes. Having admitted this, the government should either find expenditure reductions to fund the decrease in the income tax revenue or cease to pursue the income tax reductions altogether. Unfortunately, we cannot expect this government to act with such honour or integrity, so the opposition must force the government to face the results of its own duplicity. For this reason, we reject the linkage between the tax measures for the shabby and transparent sophistry it really is.

          In the 1993-94 budget speech the Treasurer announced that tax reductions scheduled for 1994-95 would be brought forward and commence on 1 November 1993. The final round of the tax reductions proposed in 1992 will be deferred until a date fixed by regulation. Even the 1 November date has had to be altered to 15 November because the government has refused to accede to the coalition's advice that the original tax bills were unconstitutional.

          The bill before us today is a symbol of the betrayal of this government's traditional calling of representing the lower income workers and families throughout Australia. The bill may have lower income tax rates and a rebate of $150 a year to those families whose incomes are $24,450 or less, but these cuts in the rebates will go nowhere near compensating the taxpayers of this country for the increases in all the other taxes that the government has introduced in this budget.

          Let us think of the unemployment consequences. We were told on Friday by the National Farmers Federation that the excises will add $50 million to the burden on the agricultural sector and will mean a loss of 30,000 jobs. We have seen the impact of a $25 million increase in Nabalco, the unemployment consequences that will arise as a result of the impact of the excise decision in terms of increased shipping costs and, in my own state, the tragedy of bringing forward the closure of the Savage River Mine.

          I refer this chamber to a report issued by Dr Neil Warren from the University of New South Wales which reveals that the lowest earning 50 per cent of households will be worse off by up to $1.54 a week as a consequence. I see that the government members are saying, `This report was published when the rebate was only $100 and the petrol price increase for leaded petrol was to be 10c. The rebate is now $150 and the leaded petrol increase will be only 7c'. That is not an unfair response, but I remind the government that the report noticed that the lowest earning 50 per cent of households will be $1.54 a week worse off. On my calculations, $1.54 a week means something like $80.08 a year.

          The petrol rebate has been increased by $50, not $80, and I am sure that a possible $30 less spent on petrol would not go far over one year.

The next 30 per cent will be a little better off. The highest earning 10 per cent of households will be better off to the tune of $13.46 a week. These calculations allow for the differing needs of households arising from the differing number of people in them. They confirm the widespread belief that the tax changes are highly regressive.

          The excise bills also have a regressive nature. They impact more on the poor. Those who are going to be thrown onto the scrap heap of unemployment will essentially be those who are least able to fend for themselves. The regressive nature of the indirect tax increases can be seen in Dr Warren's findings. They will raise the cost of living of the poorest 10 per cent of households by 1.3 per cent, whereas they will raise the living standards of the richest 10 per cent by one per cent. The regressive nature is further shown by the fact that Dr Warren's findings show that on average the poorest 10 per cent of households will save 54c a week, whereas the richest 10 per cent, which included many two-income couples, will actually save $28.67 per week.

This report, released by the Treasurer to this newspaper, reveals that the budget will make the well-off better off and the poor worse off. That supports the findings of the Warren report. By contrast, a similar breadwinner with a dependent spouse and two children who earns $50,000 a year would be 1.2 per cent better off thanks to the budget.

          The Treasury estimates show that a single person on $25,000 a year will be 1.1 per cent worse off after most of the budget tax rises. Figures for single people show that as their income increases they become better off. The report shows that, on average, pensioners and the unemployed will be worse off. It is not surprising that the Treasury figures show that the biggest benefits will go to the working parents receiving the new child-care rebates of up to $3,182 a year. Since low and middle income families already receive fee relief for child care, by definition the main beneficiaries of the rebate will be the two-income families on high incomes who so far have paid for their own child care. Mr Dawkins did not release the estimates for this group.

          We have before us today a bill which has the promised tax cuts in an amended form—a form that I believe could be subsequently amended because of deals that this government will be forced to do with other sectors as a result of other unsatisfactory features of other parts of its budget strategy. They represent a symbol of Labor's broken promises and a symbol of a government which has little vision for Australia. What we have is an attempt at the implementation of irresponsible promises made by a party which did not expect to retain government.

          These bills are the remnants of a budget already thrashed by caucus and, even at the stage of budget mark 3, they still do not have the support, I understand, of a lot of Labor members. The Keating-Dawkins duo, masters of bluff and threats, have found it difficult to swallow humble pie and admit they got it wrong. Even now, they continue to challenge the constitutional requirements. Their very arrogance is dangerous for Australia as they are prepared to risk a High Court challenge that could throw our financial markets into chaos rather than accept the inevitable and present separate bills.

          I think it is worth looking at the record of this government since its re-election on 13 March.

The Labor Party and all its members—every one of them—should hang their heads in shame for they ran a campaign in every form of the media emphasising that the tax cuts were there, that they were totally funded and that there would be no tax increases to fund them—none whatsoever.

          The Liberal and National parties were rubbished when they warned that it could not be done. However, I recall the remarks made by the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), who said that the budget would correct itself, or words to that effect. In stark contrast, the coalition parties presented a fully funded Fightback plan pitched at restoring strength to an economy that had been vandalised by Labor, an economy that would create permanent jobs in contrast to Labor's training schemes to hide real unemployment. There is no doubt today that a vast majority of Australians now accept that that plan which was put before the people by the coalition was necessary for recovery.

What he has done and what the government has done is to destroy confidence—the confidence of our investors, the confidence of our business and the confidence of our industry. The corporations succeeding today are doing so not because of the government but in spite of the government.

          Thanks to the excellent tables Treasury has supplied, it is possible to compare taxation percentages on average earnings, and I think it is worth honourable senators listening to these facts. The average income in Australia is $26,590. The marginal rate of tax, after these tax reductions have gone through, will be 34c in the dollar. Compare that rate with, for example, Japan where the average weekly earnings are not $A26,000 a year but $A49,000 a year. What is the tax rate in Japan? The answer is 20 per cent. When we compare Australia with Singapore, Singapore's average weekly earnings are almost identical to Australia's. In fact, the average weekly earnings in Singapore are $26,098.

         Will the department provide the committee with comparative income tax rates both for companies and for persons—individuals—in Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. When it comes to individuals I am particularly interested in the marginal tax rates and the progressive nature of them—in other words, starting with average weekly earnings, which would be known in those countries, to see the marginal tax rates which occur at that, above and below it.

         Answer:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Corporate and personal tax rates for the relevant countries are set out below. For those countries with readily available average earnings data (Australia, Japan and Singapore) the levels of income at which personal marginal tax rates cut in are expressed as a percentage of average earnings.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The information below shows that Australia's 33 per cent corporate tax rate is lower than that applying in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, but higher than that applying in Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It also shows that Australia's 47 per cent top marginal personal income tax rate (excluding Medicare levy) is lower than that applying in Japan and the Republic of Korea, but higher than that applying in the other Asian countries covered.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, simply comparing income tax rates in Asian economies with those in Australia tells us little about the relative net burden of taxation in Australia. Other factors need to be taken into account. For example, on average, a greater proportion of total tax revenue is raised from taxes on income in Australia than in the East Asian countries. And even though Australia collects, on average, roughly twice as much tax revenue as a percentage of GDP as the East Asian countries, it is relevant that taxes are raised to also fund the provision of government services. A lower level of government services implied by lower tax levels can impose additional costs on business and provides less scope for assistance to those individuals in need. Many Asian countries cannot match the level or quality of infrastructure provided in Australia, nor do they provide the same level or quality of social welfare services. Moreover, a comparison of statutory corporate tax rates does not by itself shed any light on the effective tax rates that apply (that is, taking into account factors such as eligible deductions, capital allowances, adjustment for inflation etc). Effective tax rate calculations are relatively complex and often depend on knowing circumstances applying to specific projects.

However, firstly I would like to take Senator Parer to task on a couple of specious comments he made about Australia's low tax rating and some nonsense that he introduced about Asia. We are, as he correctly states, the lowest taxed country with the OECD. We do traditionally compare ourselves with the OECD because those countries are roughly at the same level of development as we are. We have similar sorts of values; we have similar approaches to the essentials of a modern, sophisticated society. I refer to health care, high levels of education, a social security safety net, training and so forth.

          Comparisons with Asia are utter nonsense. It is easy to draw figures out of the hat without doing any sorts of comparisons with the provision of social security, health care and other services. Is the opposition really suggesting that we compare ourselves with Sri Lanka or the Philippines? The countries that are going places in Asia are moving in our direction; we are not moving backwards in their direction. They are moving to increase their social security safety nets and to improve their health care. They are moving for a couple of good reasons: one is that their families are breaking up as industry grows and they are finding that they are having to do that in order to provide services previously provided by the family.

          The second reason flows from that. If one is going to have a stable society that presents itself to the world as a producer and an exporter that is reliable, one does have to have social stability. That social stability depends on such things as high levels of education and health care and a decent social security safety net that does not depend totally on the family. If Senator Parer is suggesting that we should go backwards to the current levels which obtain in some Asian countries, I simply reject out of hand what he is saying.

          Because the government is fiscally responsible and believes in covering promised outlays with appropriate revenue measures, the bill will not take effect until all the other bills in this package, except for the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2), receive royal assent. The bill will facilitate a bringing forward of promised tax cuts to 15 November of this year. It will provide in this financial year a $1.5 billion stimulus to the economy at a time when the recovery is proving more difficult than anticipated. I have no concerns about admitting that our estimates were not correct. Our estimates were on the best advice of Treasury, Finance and other experts, but they were not correct. We are finding it more difficult than we anticipated to come out of this recession into recovery. So, if we are to be a responsible government, we have to tailor our budget to fit those circumstances.

          The world economy is not picking up and, while Australia is doing remarkably well with growth rates that are not only among the highest but are the highest in the OECD, there is a need for added stimulus, and I do not shirk from that. As part of this stimulus, the government proposes to inject $1.5 billion into the hands of middle income Australian workers. It is not just money in hand; it is part of an economic strategy, a very necessary economic strategy, to get us out of the sluggish recession that we have been in and into the next phase, the recovery phase.

          At least $300 million worth of these tax cuts are due before Christmas. Many people, for example, will receive January holiday pay before Christmas. That boosts that amount of money that goes immediately into the community and circulates, multiplying as it goes—and that is part of the whole recovery strategy. So, if the opposition is successful in blocking the legislation, it will be responsible for preventing middle income Australian workers from getting tax cuts before Christmas. If the opposition has its way, $300 million less will go into people's pockets before Christmas.

If it opposes this bill, not only is it preventing Australian workers from receiving that $1.2 billion over 1993-94 that I have spoken of, but it will also be preventing people from receiving tax cuts at a very personal level. For example, with these advance tax cuts, an accounting clerk on $520 will receive a tax cut of $159; a bus driver on $610 will receive $275; and a firefighter on $730 will receive $529. So, even at that personal level, these tax cuts are not to be sneezed at. But, more importantly, they are part of a government strategy to stimulate the economy at a time when it needs stimulating.

The early delivery of tax cuts is part of a deliberate strategy to stimulate the economy—a strategy to help us out of the recession we are in. The opposition, if it is successful in opposing this legislation, will prove once and for all that it has abrogated its role as a responsible opposition and as a potential alternative government; it simply is not taking its role seriously any longer.

One can only assume that the opposition sees itself as that: a permanent opposition, never likely to be in government, so never likely to face the Senate situation in reverse when the numbers are stacked against it—because it really does not see itself as being in government. I happen to believe that is a very realistic proposition to put to those opposite, because I think they are a long time out of government given the internal problems they have. Far from, as Senator Parer says, the government being in disarray; it is the opposition that is in disarray. Those opposite might like to bluster about that, but it is the opposition which is in disarray, and its own commentators are saying so. It has given up on anything responsible. It has handed over power holus-bolus to two Green senators who oppose almost everything those on the opposition benches stand for.

          Labor's major problem was its commitment to reduce income tax on the top half of taxpayers. This was, in turn, pushed by the earlier reductions to the upper levels of tax. Clearly, this whole process has been counter equity and has resulted in increasing divisions between rich and poor. It has also resulted in a reduced ability to deliver any services. The income tax cuts that were passed before the election were opposed by the Greens.

          The Dawkins budget is supposed to be an economically responsible plan to address unemployment within the constraint of improving the deficit. It is instead a mild version of the New Right fantasy, with all the holes overlooked or embedded within program expenditure. It delivers tax cuts of up to $1,152 a year for the upper income half of taxpayers. It increases various indirect taxes to make up for the cuts. Its vaunted equity measures are mainly funded by cuts to other services, often designed in a way that reduces overall expenditure in services.

One more sensible and equitable measure could have been to defer the cuts for people in the $36,000 to $50,000 range until the last tranche in 1996-97 year. The tax cut for the $20,700 to $36,000 bracket would give a tax reduction of $612 per annum to all taxpayers in the higher brackets, since they all pay tax on $15,300 of their income at the $20,700 to $36,000 marginal rate. Delaying the tax cuts for those in the upper bracket would not disadvantage the top wage earners; it would just delay additional advantages. Over 81 per cent would get a cut or rebate. If the cuts go through as proposed, the upper 19 per cent would get benefits of up to $520 on top of the $620 flow-on. But this is not the kind of thing that the government has looked at. It has continued to look at cutting from the bottom, with perhaps some efforts in the longer run, or after the huge community outrage, to try to plug some of the worst equity considerations. We are hoping that the government will see the necessity of continuing to work to plug those gaps where people are worst hit.

          A one per cent increase in wholesale sales tax alone is negated by expenditure of $15,000 a year on taxable items. But since most people in the under the $21,000 area would spend less than $10,000 annually on taxable goods, it is fairly equitable but only in terms of the wholesale sales tax alone. Taxes will not be limited to wholesale sales tax; of course, there is also the petroleum products excise, and petroleum increases will flow on to add again to the price of most commodities.

          It is because we believe that the government so far has not done enough to address these considerations in this particular proposed budget that the Greens will be flagging an amendment or change to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3). This change has come about because, over time, it has been considered that we—and all of those people who suggest that there must be more equitable ways in expenditure and revenue raising—must also make suggestions on different ways in which revenue can be collected.

          As a suggestion, because honourable senators know we like to be helpful, we flag an amendment to propose a new table on income tax for incomes which exceed $100,000 a year. This increase would be in the order of five per cent. There has been some talk of a wealth tax or perhaps an employment levy, but it has only been talk from the government at this stage. We would like to see the government give a commitment—especially in relation to the currently unfunded holes in its deficit reduction strategy—to look seriously at more equitable ways of funding these holes in its budget which it has not addressed to date, and to also look at more equitable ways of gathering tax rather than targeting the people on the bottom. This is perhaps just one of a number of options for more equitable revenue raising.

          The Greens have stated to the government that we are not wedded to one or another of these revenue measures, but there are a number of measures available which any government with some imagination would be able to find. The government ignores at its peril the message which the community is clearly sending. Fiscal responsibility does not demand cutting from the bottom and forcing the community to subsidise the rich. Also, employment requires market for local industry, not just exports—and we have never said that we are against exports; we have said that we are against the community being forced to subsidise multinational companies which are already receiving vast amounts of subsidies from the community in a number of different ways.

          A healthy national economy requires viable regional economies. Small and medium sized businesses provide the majority of employment in this country and make the major contribution to government business revenue. The government is embarking on what we believe is a highly flawed strategy in order, it says, to reduce its budgets deficit in the medium term. It did not need to sacrifice equity. Thus, the Greens WA hope that, should we receive majority support for our proposed changes or for other sensible changes that may come through this process in the Senate, the government will accept the opportunity to improve its very flawed budget package.

It is a debate that is setting the scene for matters more substantial than those with which it practically deals itself. As I understand it, the view of the Senate is that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill should be passed.

          The tax cuts that are proposed to be brought forward here, as Senator Beahan so accurately said, not only deliver on an election promise but bring its delivery forward to provide an economic stimulus to the Australian economy at an appropriate time. This measure is a very important part of the macro-economic package that will stimulate activity in the economy through providing tax cuts to individual Australian men and women and through providing the opportunity for those people to also have the benefit of this tax cut earlier than would be the case based on the legislation as currently passed. I think that is important as an equity measure for the men and women of Australia.

          There is a lot of concern that, somehow or other, this benefit will flow disproportionately to upper income Australians. There is no way that we can provide tax cuts for lower income Australians without them flowing to upper income people because a person on $100,000 a year has income in every income tax scale so, whatever cuts are made, that person is inevitably the beneficiary. But the focus, the emphasis, the whole thrust of these tax cuts is to centre them on low to middle income earners. Over the last 10 years of this government we have had a strategy that has overwhelmingly focused the balance of the benefit in tax and welfare areas on the lower income earners, particularly people earning below $20,000 a year—and that is very appropriate.

          We have lifted the threshold, we have cut the bottom tax rate, we have introduced family allowance supplements and other such focused measures, targeting the benefits at the bottom end of the income scale. I think most Australians thought that was appropriate, but it has meant that after 10 years we have got to the point where people on average weekly earnings need a go. We cannot give every year, year after year, the emphasis of every measure to the same group, even a very deserving group such as the lower income group. We are therefore delivering tax cuts to middle Australia. People on average weekly earnings are not rich people; we are talking about people on $35,000 a year or $600 or $700 a week. The clerks in offices around Australia, bus drivers and fitters in the workshop, the sorts of people who are getting around average weekly earnings and battling to make ends meet, are the people who are going to get a substantial benefit out of this measure. It is therefore appropriate that it be brought forward. It is a very equitable way of providing an economic stimulus.

          Within this package of measures is the lower income rebate, which is very important. Senator Margetts accurately described it as a key compensation element to provide a means by which low income earners can meet the costs that flow to them from the indirect tax measures in other parts of the package. We are very keen to provide those benefits. It is a socially responsible thing to do and an economic stimulus that we would like to provide.

          It is that balance and the incapacity to address that difference that has led to the United States situation of political gridlock. It has created the situation over recent years in which it has been impossible for the executive government in the United States to deliver on the tough decisions that are necessary to get the deficit down and to create the prerequisites that make room in the good years to provide economic stimulus in the periods of slow down. We have had that in Australia in the past decade. We have been able to make those tough decisions. Therefore, we were able to have a surplus in the good years and, almost uniquely in the Western world, had a significant capacity to provide stimulus in the economy as the recession started to bite in the early 1990s. But this year we are in danger of getting to a circumstance where we will lose that capacity forever. We are drifting towards a situation where the Senate gives to itself the capacity to vote for all the soft options and all the things that cost revenue but cop out of a hard decision to vote for the things that will generate the necessary revenue.

In this package we are talking about the circumstance in which we are not only seeking to deliver a stimulus and tax cuts this year but a deficit reduction strategy over the four-year period.

          It is unarguable that the lower level of debt at which we can discharge whatever social programs we wish to undertake is preferable. Every dollar of debt we take on is a dollar of debt that has to be paid back and a dollar of debt on which interest has to be paid. In such circumstances future generations have less flexibility to initiate programs than those at the moment. It is unarguable that it is desirable over the medium term to have a deficit reduction strategy for that reason and to generate a proper role for the public sector in increasing national savings so that we can fund the necessary investment to create the jobs that we need in the next century.

          I refer to the history of the tax cuts, which, after all, is what we are talking about tonight. I remind Senator Macdonald, amongst others, that when the tax cut legislation came before the Senate late last year, the Australian Democrats convened a public hearing on these bills. The verdict of a cross-section of witnesses was that the tax cuts were unaffordable, irresponsible and unfairly targeted. We all know now that those who earn less than $20,700 a year will receive nothing from the tax cuts. We all know that that constitutes about 46 per cent of the work force and a majority of working women.

          The debate has moved on from there. Before the budget about 47 per cent of Australians said that they would forgo tax cuts in the national interest because they thought that doing something constructive for employment generation and the reduction of the deficit was in the national interest. I am the first to concede that the debate has moved a long way from that point where those 47 per cent of Australians who were polled made those connections. What we find now is that Australians expect to receive tax cuts and need to receive tax cuts in order to absorb some of the increases that the budget is imposing on them.

          I turn to some of the comments made by Senator McMullan. In formulating a budget, the government of the day has to set some priorities; it has to make some tough decisions. But some of the decisions it had to make were of its own making. The straitjacket it found itself in, in relation to how to raise the money, was of its own making. Once the government has made those decisions, as a consequence it has to wear the ramifications. It has to take the fiscal responsibility for the way the numbers add up. This is where we disagree. The Democrats believe that the government can take that responsibility at the ballot box. It will face the people at the next election. People will remember what has happened in this budget.

          We have argued that the most direct and responsible means to embark upon the deficit reduction strategy is not to have the tax cuts. That has been denied us. It is disappointing that the government did not take the opportunity to introduce many of the proposals put forward in the Fitzgerald report—progressive tax measures.

          The tax cuts which were originally announced in the One Nation statement provide for reductions in the personal marginal tax scales from 15 November this year. Every dollar earned over $20,700 up to $36,000 will be taxed at the lower rate of 34c, which replaces the 38c scale now used. Every dollar earned over $36,000 up to $38,000 will be taxed at the new, lower rate of 34c, replacing the 46c scale now used. Every dollar earned over $38,000 up to $50,000 will be taxed at the new, lower rate of 43c, which replaces the 46c scale now used. Every dollar earned over $50,000 will continue to be taxed at the rate of 47c.

          The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made a big deal about how these middle income earners have missed out under this Labor government. They have borne the burden of the changes to the income tax rates and they have not been the recipients of the many targeted social welfare measures that the Prime Minister points to as some sort of measure of his government's credibility on assistance to low income earners. One would really have to say that, sure, perhaps there are a lot of people around who are on $34,000 to $38,000, who may be in single income families, who really will benefit from the tax cuts, but I think the rest is a huge question mark.

          In this legislation, the compensation we have been able to negotiate so far for low income earners is the rebate—a maximum of $150 for taxpayers with incomes up to $20,700, reducing at a rate of 4c for each extra dollar of income earned and being completely phased out at the income of $24,450. The interaction of this rebate with the new income tax scales will result in a tax reduction of about $3 per week for taxpayers on incomes below $24,450. Those below $6,100 will not now pay tax.

          The rebate is half as much again as it was originally set at, but the government could consider, at another time, additional compensatory measures to alleviate the burden on low income earners. It could consider measures such as increasing the additional family payment by an additional $2 per week per child and making the income tax rebate $200—that proposal was in the package of measures that the Democrats took to the government. Our initiatives were funded by capping the income tax cuts.

The way in which this bill and, indeed, the eight bills which will be the subject of debate in the Senate over the next day or so, have come into being is quite extraordinary. These bills emanated from the fact that the government initially introduced quite outrageously an omnibus type of tax deficit reduction bill into which it lumped virtually all the tax proposals it had in this budget.

          As we know, after considerable pressure from the coalition and others, that outrageous proposition was changed by the government. It pulled that bill out and substituted eight separate bills in its place. That was done because, amongst other things, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs said that there was a very real risk that the original bill was unconstitutional.

Therefore, the motion that I have moved states that the way the bills have been handled does not indicate that the Senate has arrived at any definitive or conclusive view about the constitutionality of the bills and, therefore, the right of the Senate to amend as distinct from request, or conversely.

          I think Senator Short may have said something about this when explaining his motion. I am sorry—I was getting advice at the time and I did not pick up what he said. I think I understood him correctly. Our concern was that the opposition might be trying to have it both ways in saying, `For the purposes of splitting the bills, we are going to regard them as imposing tax; but for the purpose of giving us the power to amend, we might slip this in through the backdoor, put this disclaimer in and then seek to amend them'. That would have caused us considerable chagrin. We would have been a bit agitated about that and we would have had a few words to say in the Senate.

Certainly, in our discussions he has assured me that that is not the case, that the opposition will not be seeking to deal with this package of bills in that way. Can I say in regard to this bill that I do not think there is anything controversial. I think nobody has challenged the right of the Senate to amend the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3)—the one we are talking about now. We can argue about whether it should be amended—that is another question. But I do not believe the capacity to do so is in contention. If it is, that is a problem that someone will have to point out to me. But there is certainly contention with regard to the sales tax package and with regard to the deficit reduction bills Nos 1 and 2.

If we accepted the political rantings of the Prime Minister, his merchant bank adviser and their intellectual camp of followers, I should be represented as a senile, monarchical faction clinging to the ruins of an imperial dream.

         When I read in last week's newspaper poll that Australians were turning from the republican push, it did not strike me at all that the Australians were necessarily choosing to remain loyal monarchists, but that they were simply sick of the stupidity, rancour and political opportunism which had seeped into the debate. Most Australians, like myself, cannot relate to the Prime Minister's mad push to alter the nation's constitutional structure on the ground that it expresses a defiant national character or cultural servility.

         But equally so, I identify hardly at all with those who see Australia through the eyes of the old empire and celebrate the symbols of monarchy. Neither position makes sense to most Australians. This is the very point: the bulk of Australians already are at home in their own country; they already enjoy a simple and ready association with their community and its core values. They have long been low-key cultural republicans, uninterested in the outward, jingoistic forms of nationalism the Prime Minister and his political colleagues are trying to foist upon them.

         Essentially, the Prime Minister and the Republican Advisory Committee are looking for the wrong Australia. They are strangers in their own country. They are seeking a European style or American form of nationalism which is way out of kilter with the Australian experience. It is principally for the reason that they are so out of touch with the reality of the Australian experience that they are doomed to fail. Ironically, it is they who are the slavish imitators of traits and attributes from other countries, not mainstream Australia.

         The Prime Minister and his entourage, who claim that they speak for Australians, want to turn Australians into race patriots. I am talking about 19th century-style patriotism—a blind and irrational celebration of race and country. Because they want to turn us into race patriots, bedecked with symbols, new flags and freshly written constitutional documents, they share more with the old monarchical tradition than they do with the straightforward Australian tradition. Australians have national feelings but they are not nationalistic. As the polls have clearly shown, they rightly turn their backs on those such as the Prime Minister who try to profit from getting them to change.

         The republican debate is a confused one that has burnt itself out as a proper issue for debate.

         —Senator Murphy should consider this: the republican push is divided within its own camp. At any one time, depending on its audience, it can be any one of a number of things. Firstly, it can be a technical exercise to adjust the formal constitutional arrangements so that they come into line with existing Westminster conventions. That is the minimalist approach. Secondly, it can be a political effort to use the issue of national identity to rewrite the constitution to achieve the Labor dream of a centralised popular national government freed from the restraints of federation and the states.

         Thirdly, it can be a means by which to remove the symbols of slavish colonialism which dog our national development and our self-pride. Fourthly, it can be an avenue by which Australia can adopt a newly identified base on multiculturalism or a bridge into the regional economies and cultures to the north. There are probably more but, like most Australians, I switch off when the Prime Minister switches on in relation to these issues.

         I want to say a few words about each one of those apparent national objectives which the Prime Minister and Malcolm Turnbull say we should be addressing. Firstly, the Australian constitution is not a colonial relic; its intellectual framework was varied, owing much to the variety of Western precedents, especially those in the United States, as well as the Westminster convention. Rewriting the constitution to formalise the practice of Australian constitutional law will only create a legalised government system and a system which will create instability and conflict on a scale only the QCs will recognise and celebrate. If we try to codify the constitution, we will end up singing hymns to the Australian Bar Association and not the republic.

         Secondly, the federal system of government is typical of geographically dispersed countries with defined regional interests. It is quite a natural phenomenon. More importantly, we know that the Prime Minister's linkage between republicanism and centralism has more to do with the old Labor mythology that the forces of dark conservatism in the form of the states, the Governor-General and the Westminster traditions, along with the CIA, the capitalists and anyone else we want to throw in, are all out to get them.

         As Thomas Keneally says, the Prime Minister's push to talk in such imperial terms about these matters fits badly with other trends in government policy. How is it that this rampant and rabid Australian Prime Minister with a love of European finery and overseas teak table designs, and hell bent on passing the Australian legal system over into the Geneva based United Nation's treaty system, is able to be a nationalist at the same time? The reason is simple. He is first and foremost a political opportunist—and nothing else.

         Thirdly, the republican push allies itself for political support with multiculturalism and claims that the republic will generate a new identity based on our changing ethnic make-up. This, so the logic goes, will signal our regional positioning and bring us into a deeper commune with the nations of South-East Asia.

         The republicans, if nothing else, are not immodest. Like most Australians, I have no idea whatsoever what multiculturalism means in regard to the complex historical forces which forge national identity. I do know that multiculturalism is a bureaucratic concept bearing on immigration policy. I know that most countries have largely multicultural communities. I know that multiculturalism is often said in the same breath as freedom, democracy and tolerance, but I do not think multicultural immigration policies gave birth to these values in Australia. Hopefully, immigrants came to Australia to enjoy those pre-existing values, not to establish them.

         Beyond the vast reservoir of platitudes which drip from the mouths of the politicians and the community groups, I have never heard anyone explain just how the recognition that Australia is becoming increasingly ethnically diverse translates into a defined identification with a body of collective national experience, which is the stuff of national identity. For better or worse, every time a politician talks of multiculturalism, most Australians look for the sign which reads `paid political advertisement'.

It is at this point that the republicans reveal their lack of understanding of their own country. They are strangers in their own country. Like the worst form of intellectual expatriates, their secret wish is that they were somewhere else. The republicans are intent on rewriting the Australian history.

         According to the Prime Minister and the Republic Advisory Committee, Australian history is little more than a tributary of colonialism. Australia, its leaders, institutions and community aspirations have been derivative and dependent and nothing more, according to the republicans. This is rotten history and a poor reflection on the truthfulness and honesty of the republicans. Australia grew up and out of the colonial period just as other now independent nations have. But this happened for Australia, thankfully, without the climactic revolutionary moments of other nation states. Ours was a slower, different path to nationhood. If the likes of the Prime Minister and the members of the Republic Advisory Committee do not like this, they are stuck with it. No-one is holding their passports.

Why did Australia develop its own military intelligence and diplomatic arms such as the Pacific branch in the first decade of this century? Why did Menzies and others painstakingly cultivate British support for the Australian strategic planning and constantly watch the interplay between Australian interest and the deployment of imperial naval strength?

         All of this sits oddly at a time when Australians are being told they have no national identity and that they need to have one manufactured for them. I do not know of any national flag which sprang from a national design contest and I do not know of any national song which was selected almost through official tender. No wonder Australians do not want to know the words of that song. Australians see the flag as the flag and not as a cultural cop-out. The whimsy and off-beat

Tonight I want very briefly to draw the Senate's attention to this little understood condition because it affects one person in every thousand in Australia, an estimated 17,569 Australians.

         Tonight I particularly want to talk about the plight of autistic children in my home state of Tasmania. But before speaking about Tasmania's autism tragedy, I should point out that the incidence and types of autism are not well known—so much so that many cases miss diagnosis.

         Autism is a pervasive disorder affecting the whole range of areas of development in a child—language development, social interaction and the ability to learn. While often there is no outward sign that a disability is present, the various types of autistic children all display unusual behaviour, from the most seriously affected child who is scared of interaction with others to the child who tries to interact but without the ability to express or understand feelings.

         `Classic' autistic children have extreme difficulties in relating to people. They avoid eye contact, are mute or have major speech abnormalities and take on seemingly pointless and repetitive activities. These characteristics are less marked in the `passive group' but they also will not initiate spontaneous approaches. They will interact with others but take a passive role.

         While the incidence of the severely autistic child is rare—nearly equalling the incidence of blindness and more common than deafness—many children throughout Australia fall within a continuum of social impairment from very high to very low functioning. There are autistic associations and centres in most mainland states of Australia. The tragedy is that services for the estimated 11 Tasmanian children born each year with autism are not appropriate. According to Queensland clinical psychologist and autism specialist Dr Tony Attwood, even the minimal services available in Tasmania are about 30 years behind those in the US and Britain.

         The laws of probability say that there would be about 470 people with autism in Tasmania, including 70 children, but it appears that more than half of these children have missed diagnosis. Work is being done to increase awareness of autism with both professionals and the wider community. However, once diagnosed, these children must have access to the latest developments. Early diagnosis and effective intervention is not only essential but, when considered in terms of long term savings in care, is also cost effective.

         In dollar terms, the cost to the nation of properly caring for autistic people is estimated to be a massive $585.6 million a year. Even this estimate is conservative. It is based on the proportion of autistic people with high support requirements being one-third of the total number of autism victims. Each autism sufferer in this group is estimated to cost around $60,000 per person a year. The cost of caring for the approximately two-thirds of autistic people with less intensive requirements is valued at about $20,000 per person a year. Importantly, several directors of state autism associations have stressed that the cost of care figure for autism can be reduced significantly with early intervention programs which minimise the need for intensive care later in life.

         Tonight I want to commend to the Senate a proposal to establish a world class therapy and education centre for children with autism and other neurological dysfunctions in Tasmania near Launceston. The centre will function as a satellite of the internationally acclaimed and award winning Giant Steps Centre currently operating in Montreal in Canada. Giant Steps Montreal has a success rate of 95 per cent of children integrated into the mainstream education system within two to three years of their attendance.

The secondary aim is integration into the wider community so these children can achieve self-reliance, participation and choice as independent adults.

         The newly formed Autism Association in Tasmania has applied to the state government for recurrent and capital funding for Giant Steps. The state department's evaluation is yet to be presented to the minister. However, it is much more difficult for a small state with a smaller tax base to provide funding to such small groups of people. Yet those who live in poorer, decentralised and less populated centres such as Tasmania deserve full support. This is where the role of the federal government should be.

I am told that the new education bill, scheduled to be finalised next autumn sitting, will amend the legislation to allow Giant Steps to be considered in a special schools category. Unfortunately, until such time as DEET has notification from the state registration board that the legislation is amended, Giant Steps does not meet funding requirements. There are also concerns about the viability of Giant Steps and the basis on which the Giant Steps committee calculated its enrolments. Giant Steps will need to put its proposal up again once the state legislation has been amended. It will need to address those concerns expressed to date.

In social terms, the effects on family life where a member of the family has autism is significant. The Giant Steps program involves the whole family so that siblings better understand and the family's quality of life is greatly improved.

         Despite the economic climate, mainland autism centres are attracting continued funding and are a valued service. All children have the right to an appropriate education. Surely Tasmanian children with neuro-integrative dysfunction should not be penalised, but should be helped to achieve their maximum potential within the community, even though that community is a very small community with a small tax base to afford to support the school. In many cases, with appropriate support, autistic children can go on to lead normal independent lives.

        (4) It is not clear on what basis it has been calculated that approximately $50m is required to bring JCU up to a competitive level with other universities in Queensland. In 1990, a relative funding model was applied to higher education institutions to provide a mechanism for recurrent funding to institutions within the unified national system to be funded equitably for an agreed profile covering their teaching and research activities. The model was used to establish relativities among institutions and as a mechanism to move institutions within an acceptable band of funding variation. In the application of the model, JCU was found to be within the tolerance band, and hence no adjustments were deemed necessary.

        As regards the provision of capital funding, JCU will have received $28.1m between 1989 and 1995 from the Commonwealth for the provision of capital facilities. This includes $4.8m in 1994 and 1995 as a result of the Government's decision to incorporate capital funds into institutional operating grant funds from 1994. The university will continue to receive its share of the $239 million which will be available to the higher education system on a weighted EFTSU basis for capital purposes through the roll-in arrangements from 1995.
