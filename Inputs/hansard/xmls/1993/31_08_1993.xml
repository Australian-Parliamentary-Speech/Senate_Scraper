Is it not a fact that, as far as low income earners are concerned, by the time they get that miserable $3 a week rebate they will be being slugged an extra $3.50 a week for petrol for the average car, at least $3 a week for the average family as a result of sales tax increases and an extra $5 a week for cigarettes?

         On the subject of equity issues, we have made it perfectly clear that this is not a regressive budget and never has been. The measures that have been taken in the last 24 hours have the effect of ensuring that any conceivable doubts that there might be on this subject have been well and truly alleviated. I refer to the increase from $100 to $150 so far as the low income earners rebate is concerned; so far as the modification of the petrol excise is concerned; and so far as the impact of the optometry and other measures are concerned.

         It needs to be understood, as has often been said, that throughout the 1980s the government has improved the equity of the tax system through a number of measures which have been taken to broaden the tax base and to reduce tax avoidance. That equity has been very important so far as lower income earners are concerned. There will be 4.2 million taxpayers with incomes below $24,450 who will benefit from the introduction of the new tax rebate. This will mean that 130,000 taxpayers will have their tax liability eliminated altogether.

         The tax cuts are just one element of a package of continuing reforms to assist Australian families. The package includes adjustments which have had less attention than they should have had because they are a very important contribution to the equity of this whole package. For example, adjustments to the family assistance system, including the introduction of the home child care allowance from September 1994, have made it a simpler system of greater benefit to low income earners. We have an age pension which over the course of the past 10 years has increased from 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings to 25.5 per cent at present. These are the measures which we believe fully allow us to keep our heads held up so far as the equity of the budget is concerned in its impact on lower income earners.

Does it therefore follow that he takes the view that an additional $12 a week in imposts on low income earners, as a result of what is left of all the nasties to be compensated for by a rebate of $3 a week, is fair and reasonable and that these people should sleep soundly in their beds? Is one in four the minister's definition of equity?

But our clear understanding is that the overall impact of the budget was not regressive, except perhaps in a very marginal way at some levels in its formulation. Certainly any lingering concerns there may have been of that kind have been well and truly eliminated as a result of the further changes that have been made.

The bureau's report is very timely in a public policy sense in that it has provided a very comprehensive analysis of the results of the very significant changes in aviation policy that the government has brought about in the last few years. The bureau report noted that these reforms have been far reaching and it made the comment that they will still be felt by the industry at the turn of this century.

         In terms of the impact of deregulation, the bureau found that greater freedom now exists in market entry; there is far more competition between incumbent domestic operators; the travelling public now has the benefit of lower than average air fares; domestic operators have improved their efficiency; and within the domestic market annualised net welfare gains of around $100 million per annum have been realised. More Australians and overseas tourists are flying in Australia today than ever before—around 18.6 million passengers a year to be precise. A small example of the significance of aviation reform was recently shown by the first departure of a Qantas Boeing 747 jumbo jet from the domestic terminal at Sydney airport. This month will see the inaugural international flight of Ansett from Australia to Bali, which is staging through my home city of Darwin.

They are also proposing to withdraw fiscal stimulus, which will slow the rate of economic growth and, as an inevitable consequence, increase unemployment.

If Senator Tierney's wild misconception that there is going to be a loss of jobs in the wine industry should in any event be correct, it would only be because there was increased expenditure in another area of outlays, whether it be beer, soft drink, mineral water or whatever, so the net effect on jobs would be nil.

         The way in which it contributes to it is by creating a macro-economic environment which will be stable and perceived to be as such into the medium term through to 1996-97: an environment which will, in fact, guarantee the maintenance of a low inflation environment; above all, an environment which will maintain the existence of a low interest rate environment; and an economic environment which rides the growth that we are expecting to be injected back into the economy over that period in a way that will generate a very confident environment for investment and for the kinds of new economic activity—in particular export oriented activity—that are, at the end of the day, more than anything else absolutely crucial if we are to get unemployment back to reasonable and acceptable levels in this country.

It is a situation that, as she ought to well know, is being experienced in common with every other developed economy in the world. We have to approach the solution to it not in a way that resorts to gimmicks or short-term solutions which may have some superficial appeal; we have to get the fundamentals of the Australian economy right.

         Of course there are specific programs that one can contemplate. Of course, the training and skill programs that we are talking about—the education programs—are all in their own way designed to achieve a better working environment, a better job opportunity environment for the future. Similarly, the infrastructure spending that we have been injecting through One Nation and related programs has that effect. But, ultimately, at the end of the day, if we want to make a fundamental inroad into the employment and unemployment situation in this country, we have to do it through creating a sustainable growth environment marked by low inflation, low interest rates and an attractive environment for investment. That is exactly what we are creating; that is exactly why this budget remains the very responsible document that it is.

         —Has the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to claims by the representatives of the Dalai Lama that China plans a huge migration of Chinese settlers into Tibet in the campaign of cultural genocide? As such moves would clearly be in breach of China's international human rights obligations, will the government protest in the strongest possible terms against their implementation? Has the government pressed the Chinese government to enter into earnest negotiations with the Dalai Lama as urged in the human rights report by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade?

It has not yet been in a position, however, to confirm those reports of large-scale population movements into Tibet.

         We are disappointed that the Chinese government refused to allow the second Australian human rights delegation to visit Tibet some months ago. We are also disappointed that Australian Embassy officials have been restricted in their ability to visit Tibet to assess the situation there. With that kind of access, it is obviously not possible to confirm the truth or otherwise of these kinds of reports. However, if these reports are true, such actions by the Chinese government would be a breach of the rights of the people of Tibet to enjoy their cultural heritage, and Australia would make its grave concern known to the Chinese government.

         Finally, we continue to believe that there would be very considerable value in the representatives of the People's Republic of China government and the Dalai Lama meeting, without excessively restrictive preconditions, to discuss the situation in Tibet with a view to resolving tensions there. That is a view that we have put a number of times to the Chinese authorities and will continue to press.

I ask the minister: has he yet been persuaded by industry representatives that pay TV printed circuit boards can be manufactured competitively in Australia along with all the components of reception equipment other than integrated circuit chips?

In fact, in just the last six months, we have seen some spectacular examples of Australian technology companies substantially and dramatically increasing their exports of this electronic equipment from Australia to overseas markets.

         Australian companies are certainly able to do it, but the key question is whether they can do it at competitive prices. The reason I make that point is that Australian companies will certainly have to do that so that the Australian consumer is not unreasonably slugged with equipment which is dramatically more expensive. I reiterate that Australian companies have demonstrated that they can do this effectively.

         The Broadcasting Services Act provides for industry conditions to be set as a licence condition. As Senator Bourne knows, those arrangements were agreed to in the Senate and put into the legislation. But that can be done only in a generic sense.

         As I know Senator Bourne is also aware, because the Senate debated this matter at length, the digital standard can be set only after the allocation of the A and B licences. The conditions that apply to that, which were amended by the Democrats in the Senate, have brought the date forward by which that had to be done to a point where, if the A and B licensees do not agree to a standard by March next year, the minister can then set the standard. Once the A and B licensees have agreed on a digital standard—which is important in terms of the consumer protection involved in that measure to ensure that people are not having to choose between more than one set of technology—the specific industry conditions can then be set, because the manufacturers will then know precisely what type of equipment it is that they have to manufacture.

         I notice that the opposition has recently discovered the importance of women when it comes to votes. It certainly objected to it in the last election. It was only in July last year that Dr Hewson was saying that the opposition did not have a policy about women so much as a social equity policy with implications for women. In the last election the women of Australia did not want to be implicated by Dr Hewson. The opposition has since realised the error of its ways. If it were sensible, it would listen to what this government has discovered about the portrayal of women in the media. It is an issue that should enjoy the support of the opposition.

         There has been a change in business culture in this country since the mid-1980s onward, and that is reflected in a very considerable increase in focus on export potential and export performance. It has been reflected in the very encouraging figures that we continue to read each month in the balance of payments with regard to continuing export manufactures performance, particularly on the side of elaborately transformed manufactures.

Equally, it is the case, both for a number of much larger businesses and for the remainder of the 6,000 businesses that are referred to in that same McKinsey report, that there has not yet been a grasping of that export potential; there has not yet been an assimilation and absorption of that as export culture; there has not yet been a full enough willingness to grasp the opportunities that are available to business through things like the export market development grants scheme, the international trade enhancement scheme and other things of that kind which are designed to help Australian companies that want to get out there and compete with the rest of them.

         It is the case that a heck of a lot more change needs to be inculcated into management practices, into training and into awareness about the scope and potential for getting out there and producing much better returns than Australian business is producing at the moment. That is a very fair criticism that is made of much of Australian business. Incidentally, it is a fair criticism that is made of a number of business organisations, and I am not persuaded that they have, between them, contributed a great deal of value in terms of themselves changing this particular culture and producing this new environment in the business community that we all so badly want.

The question was about the number of companies which have sought to continue to advertise after this year and, indeed, up until 1996. If the conditions of section 21 of the act are met, it amounts to quite a few companies. So far, 155 section 21 defences have been lodged, which is actually a very large number of organisations.

         After the end of 1995 some advertising can continue. Under section 18 the Minister for Health can exempt certain Australian sporting and cultural events that have international significance. So far, four applications of that kind have been received and, so far, I have approved three of them. These were: the Telecom Rally Australia which took place in Western Australia a couple of months ago; the Australian Ladies Masters Golf Tournament in Queensland—I might say, I am still getting arguments on that because the decisions are so detailed and so strict as to limit the size of advertising on the bibs that the caddies wear in the tournament, but that decision has been made nonetheless—and the Adelaide Grand Prix, which I signed an exemption for last week and which I think is now well and truly established on the international scene.

But the point is that the opposition is now prepared to argue for bipartisan support on this absolutely vital issue of concern to women, and I welcome that very much.

         I have to say that the opposition's points of view are very much consistent with this government's policies. In relation to the approach we have had of a national view about domestic violence, the government has put this matter on the political agenda, has brought this issue out in public and has worked very closely with the states through the relevant ministers' meetings, particularly the Attorneys-General, to see that we have now got in place—and I believe in all states, but there may be still one or two not on board—legislation for the portability of protection orders. That is an issue of grave concern and indeed has been raised by senators in this place from time to time.

         We have also seen the change of legislation that allows police to seize guns from any person against whom a protection order has been issued. We know that those require the states' cooperation and, as I understand the opposition's policy, it is entirely in support of the government's policies on this issue. So I can see that we will have a very strong voice from this Senate to continue the campaign of working with the states to see the necessary changes, because most of the changes that are needed are at state level.

         There are two bills.

These administration charge bills respectively impose an administration charge on a person in respect of the processing of an application for a rebate for excise duty or customs duty as the case may be.

First of all, it is a bill properly characterised as one `dealing with taxation' and it is also a bill properly characterised as one `dealing with the imposition of taxation'.

          The document is tabled as a matter of courtesy rather than obligation to assist the Senate, and in particular the proposed Senate committee in its consideration of the constitutionality of this issue.

          I do take this opportunity, however, finally to indicate that while the government will not be opposing the reference of the whole issue to a Senate committee, and while I am now tabling this 13-page very detailed advice, the government will be opposing the motion, if pursued, requiring us to table drafting instructions and other related documents, notice of which has been given by Senator Hill. The grounds for the government's opposition to this are strong grounds of public interest immunity, and they are ones that the government would certainly insist upon for good reason which, if the occasion arises, I will be happy to spell out.

While I respect the advice and integrity of Mr Rose, I think it must be remembered that he was asked to do a job defending the government in its handling of this particular issue. So we would hardly expect a decision from the Attorney-General's office contrary to what the government has put forward. What the government now proposes is to treat these sorts of issues as issues in a non-taxing bill. We disagree with that particular philosophy because, in our view, that non-taxing bill certainly contains taxing elements.

          I find it rather strange that this advice conflicts with an answer that has just been handed down in this place in relation to the matter previously raised by my colleague Senator Ferguson. In that case the government has two particular bills to meet the constitutional requirements, namely, a tax raising bill and a bill concerned with the administrative aspects.

          The real point at issue is that the government is trying to treat this as a non-tax raising bill to enable it to add a string of issues associated with this particular feature. I put it to the Senate that this is contrary to the constitution. The government is seeking to avoid some very fundamental constitutional issues through a very unsatisfactory device called tacking. I think this is deplorable. The government cannot have it both ways. It can produce either a bill which basically relates to administrative issues and, as such, can be amended, or a bill involving the raising of revenue. I think it is a very shabby exercise; it is a very devious means of getting around what are justifiable constitutional restraints. I suggest that the minister refer the issue back to the Attorney-General's Department.

        While I will concede that the question I put today to the minister representing the Treasurer is a matter for customs, I find it absolutely amazing that he had no idea as to whether a new taxation bill was being drafted or had been drafted and put into circulation. The one thing that Senator McMullan did not say in his answer was when the decision was taken to draft this bill.

         I asked when it was decided to draft this new tax bill because of what was said at estimates last Thursday night about the implementation of this new so-called administrative fee to pay for the administrative costs of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It was established by the officers and by Senator Schacht from the program performance statements for the inland revenue that the administrative and salary expenses totalled $16.5 million in 1992-93. The inland revenue officers estimated that one-quarter to one-third of this related to the diesel fuel rebate scheme; that is, somewhere between $4.1 million and $5.5 million could be attributed to the administration of that scheme. It was also determined that, because an expected amount of just over $1 billion is to be rebated to eligible diesel fuel users, the income from this fee would be just in excess of $10 million.

         At the estimates Senator Schacht argued that not all the expenses may have been included in the program performance statements. Our advice is that any other significant expenditure would have to appear as a separate line in the budget papers. There was no other line in the budget papers. Therefore, we could assume that all administrative expenses are included in the program performance statements, especially as at that estimates committee hearing Senator Schacht specifically stated that there are no costs incurred in administering the scheme outside of the inland revenue program.

         If it were the case that this fee had to be put into place by the implementation of a new tax, I would like to know why at that time on this important matter—and, remember, it is a line in the budget, so surely some legal advice should have been sought prior to the estimates hearing; long before the hearing last Thursday when I asked these questions as to whether the fee would be constitutionally legal—Senator Schacht, in his answer to my questions and also to questions from Senator Hill, said:

        I believe that until that time it was decided that this would be a backdoor tax that nobody knew of. The Government would be able to implement a new tax which would bring in increased revenue to the government without the introduction of any legislation. It was not until it was pointed out that the matter would be unconstitutional if it brought more revenue in to the government than was to be expended in administration and salaries, that this government then decided that it had better do something about it. It hastily sought to draft a new tax bill in order that this fee could be brought into place to bring in the expected $10 million of revenue for this government.

If Senator Ferguson reads the transcript of that long estimates committee hearing last Thursday, he will note that although I conceded that the inland revenue section of the Australian Customs Service has administration costs and administers the diesel fuel rebate scheme, I clearly indicated that other areas would have to be investigated. I promised Senator Ferguson that by the time the estimates committee met the following Thursday I would get a more detailed breakdown. The issues he raised about the administration costs I conceded were quite relevant and to the point, as was the question about how we get the $9 million to $10 million figure when he and I were estimating on the back of a envelope the division of the inland revenue section. I certainly made it clear to the department that I want that complete breakdown.

         This administration fee of between $9 million and $10 million per annum relates to the diesel rebate scheme. For 1993-94 the pay-out under the scheme is estimated at over $1 billion to people in Australia in all the eligible areas. We are not talking about a massive charge at one per cent raising $9 million or $10 million on a pay-out to eligible people of over $1 billion. When this was introduced by the Fraser government, the estimated cost was around $200 million.

         I point out, as I did in the estimates committee, that since that time there have been a number of appeals to the AAT over the issue of eligibility. I am told that on almost every occasion over the last decade the AAT has upheld the appeal against the government over extending the eligibility. So now you have people who are eligible for the diesel rebate scheme who are in no way connected with primary production or the mining industry.

However, even Senator Schacht will admit that when this diesel fuel rebate came in in 1957 exemption certificates applied for diesel used off-road. Unfortunately, he has to accept that this rebate of $1 billion to the mining and rural industries, et cetera, is no help to industry; it is simply a rebate for fuel that is used off-road.

         Senator Schacht gave us figures about the cost of administration behind the introduction of the one per cent administration fee. Of course, we could go back to the old system—I know that the Fraser Government changed it—of bringing in the levy and taking it out again. There might have been a few dodgers, but a lot of claims come in that are eligible to go out. They do not go out because a lot of farmers and other operators forget to claim.

         When Senator Schacht gives us this information on how he arrived at the one per cent administration fee, I want him to tell us whether the government or the Treasury has allowed for the interest that accumulates on the global figure that is kept in Treasury for roughly two months. From my experience, the turnaround time for rebate claims is, on average, two months. That is what I believe, and I might be wrong. Working on the basis that that amount is held by Treasury for two months and using the present interest rate of about six per cent per annum, interest of one per cent would accrue for that time. Is Treasury allowing for that one per cent increase per two months—or six per cent per year—for which that global figure belonging to the eligible users is held in Treasury? If it is not making allowance for that, it is really costing the user two per cent. I would like Senator Schacht to answer that question in time.

        I will not accept the minister's attempt at myth making or rewriting history which her government seems to be turning into a fine art. The minister tried in her answer to suggest that bipartisan support from the opposition for action on domestic violence is new. She suggested that the opposition has newly discovered the subject of domestic violence. I must put it on the record that this is totally wrong and a complete fabrication. The minister's misrepresentation of the opposition's position is, to my mind, utterly disgraceful. Let me give some examples of why I say that.

         Over a year ago the national strategy on violence against women was publicly released. Immediately, Dr Hewson on behalf of the opposition made a strong statement of bipartisan support for action to be taken to implement the strategy. Our policy confirmed that. Last year during the `reclaim the night' marches both Dr Hewson, as the Leader of the Opposition and I, as the then opposition spokesman for the status of women, sent messages of support to those people who were marching around the nation in an attempt to reclaim the night so that women are able to go out safely.

         The real point is that the minister was simply taking a cheap shot. She was just being the smart alec that she is. I think her nose is out of joint because last Thursday the federal women's committee of the Liberal Party put on an excellent day-long conference on domestic violence. It was a very practical, useful and well attended conference. Dr Hewson and Dr Wooldridge made excellent speeches at the conference, both of them demonstrating great sensitivity to this serious matter and to the concern of the opposition about this canker in our society. It was quite obvious from the minister's demeanour during question time that she had not read either of the speeches; she has staff to read things for her. If the minister had any decency, she would return to this chamber and apologise. I seek leave to incorporate the speech of Dr Hewson, which was referred to in the minister's answer.

         —I wish to support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Newman. I happened to attend the women's conference on domestic violence which was held last Thursday here in Canberra. It was an excellent occasion. The women representatives of the Liberal Party, who are formally coming together in this way once a year, along with a number of parliamentary observers from both the Senate and the House of Representatives made contributions which were well based, sound, well informed and sensitive on domestic violence, in particular, male dominance of women in Australia and other societies. There were also two outstanding speeches given by parliamentarians, those of our colleagues Dr Hewson and Dr Wooldridge.

         It is clear from the whole tenor of the smart remarks of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Crowley) that she is thumbing the nose at what the public of Australia wants to see in this country; that is, bipartisan cooperation between parliamentarians on both sides of the chamber on matters of such importance as getting a solution to domestic violence. Instead of that, the minister takes the question of bipartisanship and tries to throw it back as something which is new, and it is not; as something where we have caught up with her, yet she has never understood the plot. This is disgraceful speechifying in this chamber by a minister who ought to know better and who ought to show the proper respect for bipartisanship which has always been offered on this important matter.

         —I want to speak briefly on this matter of violence against women. Senator Crowley's performance today, particularly in relation to her answer on domestic violence, was not satisfactory from a minister. I can understand that Senator Crowley feels under pressure. After all, media reporting of her competence in the first session of this parliament in May was that she probably was not up to scratch. People on this side of the chamber were under attack from some people in the media. They said, `Give Rose a go. Be

         The Senate will notice that in the first couple of days the minister had an easy ride. What did she choose to do with it? She has chosen to come in and get a dorothy dixer on something that is two months old, pretending it is new. That is how desperate this government is to have something to say about women; it had to drag up something that it had a hand in two months ago. That is the paucity of innovative thinking on that side of the chamber in relation to the status of women. We all know that any innovative thinking on that side of the chamber in relation to the status of women stopped when Susan Ryan finally got fed up with being treated the way that she was.

       1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.

       2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.

       3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.

      <para font-size="-=2">
       4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.

       We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.

        (1). One of the most critical issues to the Vietnamese people today is the persecution of their freedom of religion and expression, which has been carried out by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) since 1945. World media reports have shown consistently that this persecution has increased greatly since 1992, when Buddhists, despite violent repression by the GOSRV's armed forces, started asking for `real' freedom of religion.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (3). The GOSRV's policy of oppressing religions has, since 1945, applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members and, most seriously to the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith and spiritual life of 80% of 72 million Vietnamese.

        (4). As the rightful heir of the 2000-year old Buddhist tradition in Vietnam, the UBCV was formally formed in 1951 by all Buddhist sects, lineages and regional congregations. It is the sole legitimate umbrella Buddhist body in Vietnam despite the GOSRV's unsuccessful attempt, in 1981, to disband and forcibly replace it with the State-run Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), and instrument for the GOSRV's propaganda purposes.

Despite being held under strict house arrest since February 1982 simply because of his opposition to the GOSRV's attempted disbandment to the UBCV and its formation of the State-controlled VBC, the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang, a nominee for 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, has been repeatedly and patiently appealing to leaders of the Communist Party and the GOSRV to ask for:

        (6). In replying to these reasonable requests, the GOSRV has, in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinement and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever tries to contact, visit, help or offer gifts to him are stopped, threatened, interrogated, bodily searched (and in some cases strip searched), etc. The Patriarch's straightforward appeals have not only been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, but have also been vilified as `anti-state', `reactionary', `creating division amongst Buddhist community', etc. by the GOSRV's mass media and it's nation-wide agencies, including it's own VBC.

In the last 12 months, hundred of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and/or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct—Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct. 1992, tortured to death few days after arrested), Thich Hai Tang, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about one hundred of lay followers (9/7/93) etc.

The GOSRV's exclusively economic renovation has not, and can not, lead to democratisation or potentials which will allow long-overdue human rights to it's citizens, such as freedom to select their own political aspirations, ways of expressions, religions, education, employment, place of resident, etc. The greater it's economic strength, the more determined and confident the GOSRV is in it's opposition to such a democratisation process and the worse it's treatment of it's citizens becomes. This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.

         Surely the responsibility and accountability for bringing up children should rest with parents' loving discipline, not with the government. Laws already exist to safeguard children's welfare. Why do we need laws to allow licence and rebellion to multiply? Apparently Article 15 gives the child the right to associate with whomever he/she pleases and parents' rights stated in Article 5 are worded in legally weak and qualified terms.

         It was important that this report be tabled today, and that is one of the reasons the opposition opposed the adjournment motion. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that this report contains material which could be regarded as defamatory and potentially defamatory. The officers concerned were shown the contents of the draft report where it referred to them and were invited to provide oral or written comment. The comments submitted have been taken into account in the report as considered appropriate.

          This report of the Auditor-General deals with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and its review of travel irregularities. The report provides the parliament with the results of an audit office examination of travel irregularities alleged in relation to senior executives of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The examination was carried out in response to a request from the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) dated 19 March 1993 after an AQIS internal management review was leaked to the press in late February 1993 and tabled in the Queensland parliament on 3 March 1993. I gather that some of my National Party colleagues may have some knowledge of this matter and have been assiduous in pursuing it.

          The travel irregularities had previously been investigated by a departmental officer, who had concluded that no misconduct was involved, but the minister was concerned that unless an arm's length investigation was carried out allegations against officers would continue to be made. This report is a result of that investigation.

          I do not want to deal in substance with the many matters raised. Some of them are quite insubstantial in terms of money amounts and in any event there will be plenty of opportunity in Estimates Committee A to deal at length with the matter of primary industry expenditure. I imagine this matter will be taken up there. What I do want to put on the record in the Senate itself are a couple of general matters raised in the letter from the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, to Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, dated 29 August 1993 and which appears as an attachment to this report. In it the Auditor-General says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The most important lesson arising from this audit concerns the ethical underpinning associated with the management of travel and related expenses. Senior executives are responsible for setting a good example within their organisations and to the public. This report shows there can be no presumption or assurance as to the economy and probity of travel and related expenditures while the approving officers do not themselves set and observe high standards. The ANAO considers that where officer payments and entitlements are concerned, the test of probity and propriety must predominate. The decisions and actions of officers in relation to this type of expenditure must be able to withstand full public scrutiny irrespective of the dollar value.

         I think that is the key point. I do not think anyone will go over the edge about the size of the matters here, but it is the question of the principles involved. The letter goes on:

          My final point is that the department has agreed with all but one of the recommendations, has recovered the moneys owing to it and has rewritten its secretary's instructions. This demonstrates once again the vital role played by the Auditor-General in the proceedings of this parliament and in the proper supervision of the expenditure of taxpayers' money. How unfortunate it is that this government is continuing to deprive the Auditor-General of the appropriate resources to ensure that taxpayers' money is saved.

          As a result of this government's activity, the Auditor-General has, as I understand it, announced that 100 of his employees are to be removed from his employment in one way or another because resources are inadequate. That seems to me to be an extraordinary decision by the government. I commend the Auditor-General's report and I hope that, despite the reduction in his resources and the failure of the government to respond to repeated requests and recommendations from committees of this parliament, the Auditor-General will be able to continue the outstanding work he is doing.

          We asked questions about that in the estimates committee and were told by senior officials of AQIS that they had organised and had brought forward a report on the original report that made these allegations. They brought forward this second report to investigate the first report and it was a matter of Caesar judging Caesar. That report cleared all officers who were implicated in the first report. It was a complete and utter whitewash. We asked various questions in the estimates committee and were told by senior officers there that there was nothing to worry about.

          Last year we had an extraordinary action against AQIS. AQIS wrote a letter stating that the Danish genetic material and live pig imports had been discussed at prime ministerial level; over six weeks later AQIS wrote a second letter denying this. Then an AQIS officer stated that the importation of pig genetic material had been discussed at ministerial talks between the Australian and Danish minister; the executive director had to correct that months later. There was an AQIS cable from Brussels about higher authorities for live pig and pig semen imports because of links to a joint venture proposal between Australia and the Danish industry—I might mention that the Australian industry was half owned by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

          This is not a department; it is a circus. What makes it worse is that it is a circus that is paid for by the farmers of Australia who are not getting any value for money. In fact, AQIS is an embarrassment to the government and an embarrassment to the Public Service, and it should be stamped on with both feet. I do not take kindly to being lied to at an estimates committee. We are receiving disinformation from AQIS—every time we find a letter that says something that involves someone and pig imports, or semen imports, or genetic material imports, someone from that organisation has to get up and deny that it was ever written, or state that it had a different intention or that it should never have been written.

          We now come to the conclusion that the Auditor-General's report has found indiscretions in AQIS. I want to know what this government is going to do about this. We cannot afford to have a quarantine inspection service that carries on like a three-ringed circus with a bunch of clowns at the top. I will take great delight in further questioning the AQIS officers at the next Senate estimates committee in a couple of days time.

          As I have said, it is a serious matter when the whole future of our exports is placed in the hands of these—I have to say—at the very least, incompetent and now dishonest officers. But it is even more embarrassing and even more questionable when farmers have to pay for services that they are not getting. Every time people use a telephone, charge a car expense, use taxis or go on a trip to Ireland when they should be in America, it is not the government which pays for it; it is the farmers who pay for it. I am not referring to the people down the line; I am referring to those in the highest echelons of this department who are giving absolutely no example to the people down the line. Throughout rural Australia now we see AQIS inspection officers getting about $35,000 a year, but abattoirs are being charged $70,000 or $80,000 to keep those people on. It is not a government charge; it is a charge that goes to the cattle producer, the exporter of our primary industry.

This is a very serious matter because, once again, its credibility has been significantly dented. The flow-on impact from that dented credibility has serious medium and long term ramifications for Australian producers and Australian produce. I certainly join with Senator Boswell and Senator Baume in urging the government to take immediate definitive action to clean out what has been going on in AQIS.

          There are many examples one can refer to. The Danish letters are a classic example. The intent of those letters was continually changed or their wording was pronounced as incorrect.

When these matters are raised in the future, I think it is absolutely imperative that they should be referred directly to the Auditor-General—and I congratulate him or his officers on this report and the recommendations contained within it. This report and, I think, the activities that have gone on in estimates over the last two or three years have proved quite conclusively that internal investigations, particularly in this area, just do not work and they whitewash the facts.

Suffice to say that the Auditor-General, after carrying out two earlier reviews, undertook an extensive review of some 330 individual matters. As the report says, in the Australian National Audit Office's opinion 39 per cent of the matters were found to have no substance, 47 per cent were found to be breaches of regulations of a minor nature and 13 per cent were found to be breaches involving the paying back of moneys. The office suggests that three could involve misconduct in terms of the Public Service Act. I think that is of concern. The office also said that it was doubtful whether a court would agree to open the way for any action in these cases.

          What we are dealing with here is not whether someone filled out a travel form accurately, thoroughly or on time, or whether that person made a financial gain. Some who did do the wrong thing have paid back a sum of $2,000, so there is not a great sum of money involved. What concerns me more than what basically is in the report is the fact that such an inquiry was necessary at all. The inquiry involved senior executives of AQIS, some 11 or 12 people who are supposedly at the peak of their careers—the cream of the service. They appear to have not handled the system properly—to have rorted it, abused it or neglected it—but the fact remains that they are the management. What they have done is typical of the disease that has been rife throughout the whole service for quite some time.

          When I first came into the Senate some eight years ago we discussed some of the problems of AQIS. I do not think the service is operating as well as it should be. As Senator Crane said a little while ago, AQIS is our postage stamp to the rest of the world in regard to getting our products out and, obviously, looking at some of the ones coming in. I have had heaps of complaints at different times about the cost—and the rising cost—of inspection services. This service, which is supposedly monitoring disease, is riddled with a disease of its own—a disease of slovenliness and carelessness. It comes out in the report that in most cases the service is just not being administered as well as it should.

          This is the same service that employs meat inspectors—on full pay, of course—in towns where there are no meatworks. I heard a story just recently about an inspector who notified the local abattoir a week in advance that he was going to be sick. In fact, the inspector wanted the day off so that he could attend a local race meeting. An inspector was flown a great distance to work on that particular day. It so happened that it rained on the day the bloke was meant to be sick and the race meeting was cancelled. He then decided that he would go to work. So the abattoir ended up with two inspectors at great cost, not to the service, as Senator Boswell said, but to the user because the user pays under the cost recovery system of AQIS.

I will be moving that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. I do not want a witch-hunt or anything like that.

        This Bill contains a wide range of omnibus amendments to the various programs administered under the Social Security Act 1991.

        Child disability allowance (or CDA) is paid in recognition of people who care for disabled children at home. Several reforms in this Bill will improve the effectiveness of this important payment. First, it will become possible for CDA to be shared between two people who share the care and control of a disabled child but one or both of whom do not receive family payment for the child. People who receive family payment as well as CDA for a child can already have both payments split in this way and this amendment makes sure that the same treatment is given all round.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The payment of CDA during a child's "temporary" absence from home has proved difficult for administration of the payment. It is to be made clear for all new claimants of CDA that payment is to be made only while the child is being cared for in the family home and during specified respite or hospitalisation periods. Also, all current recipients of CDA will now continue to qualify for CDA while the child is in short-term hospital care. Lastly, a limit of 12 months is to be placed on the backdating of CDA to the date of another, similar claim. Earlier cases of backdating for 5 to 10 years had highlighted problems with collecting information about a child's disability or care requirements for such a long time in the past.

        It is also being clarified that the debt that arises when family payment clients underestimate their taxable income by more than 25%, or fail to comply with the notification provisions, is the difference between what has already been paid and the amount due on recalculation.

When they have finished their training,  these people can immediately return to the social security payment they were receiving before.

        People who are serving a newly arrived resident's waiting period before being paid job search, newstart or sickness allowance will now be able to serve that waiting period concurrently with the ordinary waiting period that applies to most new grants of these allowances. This will reduce the overall waiting period by around 7 days.

        The NSW Medically Acquired HIV Trust was established by the NSW Government to provide a package of financial assistance for people infected with medically acquired HIV in NSW. Through this Bill, the social security system will not be treating payments from the Trust as income under the ordinary income test. This is in line with the Government's intention for payments made by the similar Mark Fitzpatrick Trust that was established by the Commonwealth and covered by identical legislation last year.

        The rate of pension or benefit paid to someone whose partner is in gaol or psychiatric confinement following a criminal charge is to be clarified in this Bill in two respects. First, to recognise the financial realities of living apart from a partner who is confined, a person in this situation will now be paid the higher rate that applies to a person without a partner instead of the rate normally paid to a member of a couple. Secondly, it is being made clear that an additional amount is not to be added to a person's rate of benefit for a partner who is in gaol or psychiatric confinement and therefore being maintained by the State rather than by the beneficiary.

        Last year, an amendment was made to the review of decisions provisions to channel applications for review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the SSAT) through the internal Departmental review mechanism. This Bill makes a minor enhancement to that initiative to make sure that, if a person incorrectly applies for review to the SSAT instead of to the Department, he or she is taken to have applied to the Department for internal review on the same date. This preserves the person's rights to be paid arrears should the review eventually decide in his or her favour as if the correct application had been made in the first place.

        The dual payment of mobility allowance under the Social Security Act and training allowance paid by the Department of Employment, Education and Training is being prevented by this Bill. This dual payment exclusion has applied so far only to people undertaking training as part of a Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service rehabilitation program but is now to apply to all cases of common entitlement to these two allowances. To further protect the integrity of Commonwealth payments, it is being made clear that, where a person receives a payment by the Department of Employment, Education and Training under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme or the Aboriginal Employment  Incentive Scheme, the person's age or widow B pension will be reduced. If the person receives age pension, his or her partner's pension might also be affected. This is consistent with the approach taken with other social security pensions and benefits.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill also makes some purely technical refinements not involving new policy in areas such as investment income, family payment, the employment entry payment for sole parent pensioners and the impairment assessment tables for disability support pension. There are also some minor technical amendments to the Act to ensure its integrity in terms of correct references and terminology, Notes to the text and similar matters.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1987 (the Act) to put beyond doubt the construction of item 41A of Schedule 4 to the Act. Item 41A is a key element of the legislative mechanism for implementing the Government's Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan (the Plan).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From its commencement, paragraph (a) of item 41A and the Customs by-laws made in respect of that item have always been intended by the Government to benefit only the 5 `plan producers' by allowing them duty free importation of certain passenger motor vehicles where they have earned export credits under the Export Facilitation Scheme in accordance with the Plan, and hold the appropriate determinations under that Scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In extending the Scheme with effect from January 1991, item 41A was amended by the addition of a paragraph (d) to allow non-plan producers such as component manufacturers to benefit directly from export credits they had earned under the Export Facilitation Scheme. Previously non-plan producers could only benefit through the sale of their credits to plan producers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It has recently been contended that these provisions and the Customs administrative by-law could have allowed the duty free importation of such passenger motor vehicles by importers not holding such determinations under the Scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's automotive policy sets out a schedule for the gradual reduction of tariff levels through to the year 2000. The intent of this policy, announced as part of the 1991 Industry Statement, is absolutely clear. The policy reflects the Government's commitment to reducing assistance to the automotive industry, but at a rate that is manageable and sustainable by that industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Plan has provided Australia's motor vehicle and component manufacturers with a clear direction in meeting the challenges of motor vehicle and component manufacture in the 1990's. Under the Plan, motor vehicle and component exports have reached record levels, exceeding $1.2 billion per annum. Confidence in the industry's future is reflected in recent decisions to upgrade and extend manufacturing facilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The possibility of uncertainty in the Plan's legislative mechanism could seriously undermine the benefits achieved to date. The industry has every right to expect that the plan will be maintained as previously announced by the Government. The Government is therefore acting to preserve the integrity of its automotive industry policy by expressly stating that for an importer to benefit under  paragraph 41A(a) of the Act, they must be the owner of a determination under the Export Facilitation Scheme.

As a signatory to the Florence Agreement, Australia cannot impose tariffs or other charges on the importation of books of scientific, cultural or educational value. Bounty is paid on the local production of such books in order to assist the Australian printing industry compete with overseas book printers.

        The Amendments proposed in this Bill are the Government's response to the Industry Commission's recommendations contained in its report No. 27 of 15 October 1992 on book production. In that report the Industry Commission commented that productivity improvements in book production appears to have more than offset the effects of the gradual reduction of assistance and that continued reduction of the bounty rate and other assistance is likely to maintain pressure to improve efficiency. The Commission supported the continuation of the orderly reduction in assistance within the general program of tariff reductions announced by the Government in March 1991.

        The Bill also proposes to extend bounty eligibility to directories other than Australian telephone directories and time tables on the condition that they contain less than 30% advertising and to specifically exclude company prospectuses from bounty eligibility as they are in a similar class of publications to annual reports and shareholders reports, which are already excluded as they are unlikely to be printed offshore because of time restraints.

        The computer bounty is an important element of the Government's policy for the computer industry, which for bounty purposes includes manufacturers of modems, multiplexers, microprocessors, computer sub-assemblies, electronic microcircuits and, since July 1991, printed circuit boards.

        The decision in 1990 to continue the computer bounty scheme, which resulted in the extension of the scheme until 31 December 1995, reflects a commitment by this Government, and indeed this parliament, to encouraging increased development and use of computer equipment and microprocessor technology.

        In 1992/93, the computer bounty program provided about $75 million of direct assistance to 927 registered manufacturing premises. The program is expected to provide $78 million to industry in 1993/94 and slightly lower levels in forward years with the adoption of the legislative changes proposed in this bill. On current trends, without either legislative or administrative changes, the budget outlays for this program are expected to be in the order of $88 million in 1993/94.

        This proposed definition, together with the proposed amendment to the method of calculating value added by a manufacturer in section 6 of the Act, expressly requires that in order for expenditure on research and development to qualify for inclusion in a manufacturer's bountiable factory costs, the research and development must be likely to result in the manufacture of bountiable equipment  within the bounty period; that is, by 31 December 1995.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments to the rules of origin effected by Clause 10 of the Bill are a response to the Government's agreement to the outcome of the 1992 review of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic  Relations  Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). The proposed amendments also extend the administrative and technical aspects of that agreement to other preference arrangements.

        Rules of origin are those rules which previously appeared in section 151 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act), to determine whether particular goods imported into Australia are eligible for entry at preferential rates of duty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 10 of the Bill inserts a new Division 1A of Part VIII into the Act to provide a better defined and more  predictable basis for calculating the origin of goods. The concept of "factory or works" cost of goods as calculated in accordance with rules set out in Gazette notices issued by the Comptroller, has been replaced by specific provisions contained in the Act (new sections 153C—153G refer). Furthermore, the Bill includes diagrams and explanatory notes in a new Schedule inserted in the Act as a means of illustrating the operation of the rules of origin in their application to New Zealand.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to New Zealand, it should be noted that there is some modification of the rules of origin in certain circumstances. New section 153K of the Act implements the agreement between Australia and New Zealand to allow a two percent margin of tolerance in meeting the usual fifty percent area content requirement, where an unforeseen circumstance (such as an adverse movement in exchange rates) would otherwise result in a shipment failing to qualify for preference. The amendment is intended to assist manufacturers in such unforeseen circumstances, whilst ensuring that the preferential trade benefits of ANZCERTA are not diverted away from Australian and New Zealand manufacturers.

        Other amendments peculiar to New Zealand modify the treatment of materials of mixed origin to allow the area content of such materials to contribute to the area content of the final product in circumstances where otherwise they would not.

        The amendments will make the rules of origin more objective in their application and should overcome weaknesses in the previous provisions which had enabled some claimants for preference to circumvent the spirit of the rules.

        The Government has decided that section 28 of the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 should be amended to allow the Authority to await the Minister's decisions on the recommendations contained in its reports before releasing those reports to the public. Earlier release could encourage parties to cooperate less than fully in  the public inquiry held by the Authority, reserving some arguments to put to the Minister once they knew what recommendations had been made by the Authority. Were this to occur, considerations of natural justice could mean that the Minister would have to seek the view of other parties on these arguments, leading in  effect to a second inquiry being undertaken personally by the Minister.

        From an operational point of view, it is desirable for Customs officers to have the ability to require information as to the possessions of ship's crew and for there to be a sanction for not fully declaring those possessions which represents a real deterrent to non-compliance. If there is no penalty for non-compliance, there is no incentive for crew members to ensure they fully report their belongings to Customs and could encourage crew to secrete prohibited or dutiable goods with the intention of smuggling the goods ashore at some later time during the ship's stay in port.

        This Bill amends the Migration Reform Act 1992 and other relevant legislation within the immigration portfolio, to defer to 1 September 1994 the introduction of those parts of the Reform Act which were due to come into effect on 1 November 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Migration Reform Act 1992 makes important changes to the Migration Act 1958. It simplifies the legal basis for administration of entry to and stay in Australia. It expands merits review by the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal, establishes the Refugee Review Tribunal, and modifies appeal rights to the courts. It also establishes a detailed code of procedures for the processing of visa applications and reviews and clarifies the procedures in relation to cancellation of visas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government is concerned to ensure the smooth and trouble-free implementation of the Reform Act. Implementation involves far reaching changes to the administration of migration law and to administrative processes. The process of planning for implementation of these changes has been under constant review, and this review has highlighted the complexity of the task. To this end, when assuming office, I ordered a "stocktake" of the processes and laws to be implemented.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is clear that the Reform Act requires fine tuning and this is to be expected in legislation of this nature. At this stage, a number of minor amendments has been identified, predominantly of a technical nature, which still need to be made to the legislation to ensure that it operates smoothly. These further amendments will be introduced in the autumn sittings of the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Substantial drafting of subordinate legislation and consequential amendments to related legislation is necessary. Procedural instructions must be prepared. Major and complex changes are necessary to the computer systems and databases used to administer the migration program. Very significant training of migration officers is required, and a major information program to enable my Department's clients to understand the changes which will occur is essential.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In these circumstances, the government considers it preferable to defer the introduction of the Reform Act until all these issues can be adequately addressed. Deferment will ensure that the implementation of these complex and important changes will be smooth and trouble-free.

        This Bill also provides that the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 relating to the detention of unauthorised boat arrivals continue to apply to persons who arrive up until 1 September 1994. The existing provisions cover the detention of such persons who arrive up until 1 November 1993. Extension of this date will mean that arrivals between 1 November 1993 and the new commencement date of the Reform Act will come under the same detention provisions as those which apply at present.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The issue of detention of boat arrivals is being examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and it would be pre-emptive to change the existing arrangements prior to consideration by the government of the Committee's report, due in December 1993.

        This Bill introduces amendments which will put beyond doubt the power of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider refugee status review applications made before 1 July 1993 to the former Refugee Status Review Committee and not considered by the Committee at that date.

        These applications constitute a caseload of some 5,500 review applications and are considered as a priority. The provisions made by this Bill facilitate a smooth transfer of this caseload to the Refugee Review Tribunal and ensure that the Tribunal can get on with the work of clearing it.

         this morning and which has been known to me for some considerable time. Now is the time to say something about it and to ask the RAAF what it is going to do for what it has done to Wing Commander Chris Kenyon. The article tells the story of the fact that Wing Commander Kenyon uncovered, in the course of his employment, a shortfall of $1.7 million in relation to funding. Being in charge of the section at the time, he set about trying to find out the story in relation to it.

It is my view that someone or some group of people within the air force has a case to answer for the devastating persecution that has taken place against an officer once described as a brilliant officer, and a man who has had a good career in the air force. I wonder where the incompetence or the dishonesty really lies. It is a large amount of money and the reaction to it of those who have been involved would certainly indicate that they have been concerned about it. It would indicate to me that they have been attempting to get this man to leave the air force. They have been pursuing him in a number of ways, which perhaps will in the future come out.

         I hope that in the estimates committees tonight the RAAF or the appropriate people will be able to explain exactly how much money has been spent on this already, and give an account of what they have been doing in attempting to drive this man out of the air force. It is certainly the time and the appropriate place for them to do it. I hesitate to think what the cost has been to taxpayers of what has gone on over the last few years. It is stated also in the newspaper that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator Faulkner, is understood to be seriously concerned about the case and awaiting further correspondence. I can understand that he would be seriously concerned about what has gone on.

I think there is a great deal that needs to be explained. I certainly know the sorts of things that I think need to be done and the explanations that need to be given. I know of a number of cases in the Public Service where people have come across something that they regard as seriously wrong. What happens? They are persecuted and hounded.

         Senator Newman today gave notice of a motion about setting up an inquiry into what is referred to as whistleblower legislation and whistleblower issues. This is one such issue. People who read these articles scarcely fully understand the devastation to the person involved who, in the course of his employment and pursuing his job, uncovers something that he believes needs to be looked into and for his trouble suffers, as has happened in this case. I have more papers and more information. But as I said, the estimates committees need to meet today and I am sure that we will get other opportunities to discuss this issue.

         Apparently a very large number of Labor Party backbenchers attended the caucus committee and added to the community furore about the impact of this budget. Martin Ferguson described the budget as attempting to defend the indefensible. Today's Melbourne

         Labor members are allegedly telling their electorates that they are all concerned about this tax and are opposed to it. Therefore, it is a matter of great concern that when it came to a major meeting at which the government was really forced to back down, apparently the issue of the wine tax was not pushed with any vigour, and indeed I do not know whether it was raised. That is the message which has come through to me.

         It is my strong view that the government is in the process of desperately rewriting this budget. It is important that those Labor backbenchers in the winegrowing areas add their voices to the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats and vigorously and publicly oppose this tax. I believe there is no doubt that the mere sign that two or three of them were prepared to cross the floor on this issue would, given the current state of the government, lead to the overturning of this pernicious tax.

Even worse, the Mr Cleelands and Mrs Silvia Smiths of this world are still failing to stand up and indicate to their electorates that if the government proceeds with this tax, they will cross the floor. That is now the challenge that is before them to test their real sincerity on this issue.

        The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act does not "require" ATSIC (that is, it is not mandatory for ATSIC) to take recovery action in respect of grant monies where there has been non-compliance with grant conditions by a grantee organisation. ATSIC, nevertheless, has set stringent accountability requirements which surpass those in existence prior to the creation of ATSIC.

        In situations where serious breaches of grant conditions have occurred, ATSIC has ceased funding and issued notices, pursuant to Section 20 of the ATSIC Act, for the recovery of grant funds. This practice has resulted in organisations such as an Aboriginal Legal Service and an Aboriginal Resource Agency, amongst others, being denied further funding. Funding to a number of organisations receiving grants for a range of programs, including the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP), has ceased as a result of non-compliance with grant conditions. Some of these organisations have since ceased to exist.

        The Board of Commissioners has maintained a policy which in effect means that organisations that fail to account for their grants satisfactorily may not receive further payments. Payments to organisations that have failed to acquit grants are made in exceptional "life and death" circumstances and only after remedial action has been instigated.

        ATSIC, in developing its accountability procedures (including Conditions of Grant) has liaised with Government departments delivering grant programs and consulted extensively with the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), the Office of Evaluation and Audit, the Australian Government Solicitor and the Department of Finance. As a result of this interaction, the Commission has established a framework of grant procedures, including accountability requirements, that are considered at least equal to other government agencies.

        ATSIC is a strongly decentralised organisation with most grant decision-making occurring at Regional Office level. It does not keep consolidated records of each and every breach of grant conditions, however minor (such as organisations being a little late in providing a progress report). ATSIC, however, is satisfied that with regular audits of its operations being conducted by the Office of Evaluation and Audit and the Australian National Audit Office strong administrative controls are being exercised.

        (1) One of the conditions of the approval given to Ausfern Pty Ltd in May 1992, under the controlled specimens provision of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, was "initiation of a trial regeneration program". It is far too early to be able to provide any results of this trial program. Ausfern Pty Ltd hired the services of the University of Tasmania's Applied Biology Unit to conduct a five year study on tree fern regeneration, including propagation and tissue culture techniques. The program will trial direct sporing and tube stock replanting as methods of regenerating tree ferns in eucalypt plantations, as well as assessing natural regeneration on existing eucalypt plantation sites.

        (2) There is no conclusive research which shows that natural regeneration is a viable method of achieving sustainability for tree fern harvesting in native forests. Natural regeneration probably would be a viable method if native forests where harvesting occurs, were not being clear-felled for eucalypt plantations. The lack of knowledge of tree fern biology and appropriate regeneration techniques for cleared areas was the reason for imposing the above condition on Ausfern Pty Ltd. Insistence on any one technique without such knowledge would be inadvisable. Regeneration methods must also take account of the possibility of introducing diseases, particularly Phytophthora, which could occur through replanting with tube stock.

        (1) Yes, whereas under previous financial arrangements with car rental companies, operators either had desk space within a terminal or the right to meet pre-booked customers. Under the FAC's new arrangements, operators can now choose between four options for their commercial arrangements with the Corporation. The arrangements were designed to give operators the flexibility to choose which option best suits their business needs.

        As part of the implementation process, the FAC had envisaged a review of the fee structure after the new arrangements had been operative for a reasonable period. The FAC considers that review now timely, because of the comments received from various parties on the fee structure.

        The first option is for desk space within a terminal which gives operators access to both pre-booked and walk-up customers. In exchange for this level of access to airport business, operators are required to pay an airport access fee (which is higher than for the other options), a per square metre fee according to the size of the desk space (which goes to the operator of the terminal—either the FAC, Ansett or Australian) and 5 per cent of airport related turnover. This option is primarily designed for operators with 20 per cent or more of airport car rental business.

        The third option is for the same rights as the second option but offers operators a different mix of fixed and variable fees.

        The fourth option (also known as Alternative A) is for the right to meet pre-booked customers at the airport (but not in a terminal). In exchange for this level of access, operators pay the same airport access fee as in the third option and a flat $5 per contract, regardless of the length of the contract. This option is primarily designed for smaller operators with less than 2 per cent market share.

        The total turnover of car rental business at Hobart Airport in 1991/92 was around $6,300,000. To facilitate this example, assume Option 1 operator has 20 per cent share of this market ($1,260,000), Option 2 operator has 10 per cent share ($630,000), Option 3 operator has a 5 per cent share ($315,000) and Option 4 operator has a 1 per cent ($63,000) share. For the Option 4 operator, it is also necessary to calculate the number of contracts entered into to get its $63,000. On the basis of a $50 a day average car hire cost and an average hire period of 5 days (in other words, the average contract is for $250), the number of contracts entered into is 252. Only Option 1 operator seeks desk space. The average size allocated for desk space is 10 square metres. On this basis, it is possible to calculate some examples of payments to the Corporation.

        In this analysis, small operators pay the least to the Corporation, although this calculation is sensitive to the assumption about the length of each contract. If the average length of contract in the above example was assumed to be only one day, then the Option 4 operators outlay as a percentage of turnover would increase to 10.3 per cent. If the average length of contract on the other hand was assumed to be 10 days, the percentage would fall to 1.3 per cent.

        (1) No. However, the Main Roads Department of Western Australia (MRD) sought and was granted an exemption from the requirement to seek competitive tenders for works costing $3.735m out of a total project cost of $32.7m. This was on the basis of advice by the MRD that the small scale nature of the works, the heavy traffic volumes (over 50,000 vehicles per day), the need to provide ongoing access to commercial properties and complexities of relocating services made it difficult to specify in tender documents the exact nature of the works. The MRD considered it more practical for the works to be done by its own employees and by contractors working directly under its control.

         The guidelines will be introduced once consultations with the Australian Taxation Office and other interested parties have been finalised. They aim to overcome difficulties with the interpretation of the category "works of art" for the purposes of sales tax exemption under Item 115 of Schedule 1 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 but will also have implications for similar categorisation problems in the Customs law.

The draft guidelines will also draw on previous submissions on this issue by the Crafts Council of Australia and the recommendations of the 1990 report of the Tourism Shopping Implementation Committee which consulted with representatives from the arts and crafts sectors.
