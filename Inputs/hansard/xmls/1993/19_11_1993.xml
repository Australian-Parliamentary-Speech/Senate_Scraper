Does he have any advisers? I think this is a very important question. It certainly is of great concern to every taxpayer in this country. Could the minister indicate to us the total outstanding Commonwealth debt at present? I say this in the light of the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) three years ago that `in three years time'â€”in other words, at the current momentâ€”`there will be no government debt, domestic or external'. He said, `It is an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the government of Australia'. The three years is now up. Has Mr Keating kept his promise?

If he is only making a political point, then we can bat on; but if he is asking that question in a serious way and would like the precise quantum, then I will have to plead guilty and say that I cannot give it to him. There are no advisers here who can assist me in that regard. We are better off moving onto the next bill and coming back to this one when I can give him a definitive answer.

         Six of these acts relate to amendments that ought not to be before the parliament or taking up our time at present. These amendments arise from careless or faulty drafting instructions from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in relation to each of these bills. They do not relate, of course, to errors in the drafting itself; they are clearly errors in the instructions given by the minister in the first place. Correcting bills that were pushed through in such a hurry in the first place that they were not correct is the sort of thing that seems to take up a great deal of our time these days.

         The bill is to provide a legislative base to formalise partial cost recovery measures undertaken for some time by the Department of Industrial Relations and also to allow another government agency to make regulationsâ€”further eroding the powers of the parliament in favour of the bureaucracy, with the excuse that this is necessary to achieve national uniformity of occupational health and safety legislation.

         The financial impact of this bill is stated to be an approximate $180,000 revenue gain from partial cost recovery of fees under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act. However, as the measures in the bill will only formalise practices which have been in operation within the Department of Industrial Relations for some time, the accuracy of the claim of $180,000 additional revenue is seriously doubted.

         In part 2, the bill makes gender neutral changes to the Defence Act 1903, and the chairman becomes a president. Part 3 amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to enable the Australian Industrial Registry to integrate with state industrial registries where agreement to do so is reached. The inference in the second reading speech is that the federal registry will be dominant. This is clearly expressed in the proposed section 63(1B)(a) which reads `acting as the registry for the State industrial body'.

         To avoid duplication on a register, organisations with more than one branch on the same register will be able to amalgamate, provided their rules are the same or are made to be the same.

         One might well ask: what is the hidden agenda in this amendment? Is it, in fact, another attempt to allow unions operating under state awards to transfer to federal awards? There is reason to think that this is the case. I refer to an article in the

        We have good reason to think that this amendment is part of that process. The second reading speech refers to an agreement between the federal and South Australian governments in this direction. It is obvious that this agreement was entered into by the current South Australian government in the full knowledge that it will be surely defeated in the forthcoming election and that it wanted to lock the incoming government into an agreement which would not even be contemplated by the new Liberal government, in much the same way as the Keating government ratified the ILO Termination of Employment Convention of 1982 well after the March 1993 election had been called.

         Section 23 of the principal act dealing with limits on the operations of the act requires Commonwealth departments, agencies and enterprises to be responsible for occupational health and safety of employees or contractors. This is to be expanded to include `other persons at or near a workplace'. This expanded clause causes some concern not only because of the vague nature of `or near', but also because public liability insurance cover costs may be forced through the roof as it encourages `other persons' not to exercise due care when entering onto or being near the defined premises, wherever that might be.

The proposed new sections would allow Comcare to recover overpayments from their client's superannuation fund without any reference to the client. It is an outrageous provision.

         â€”in replyâ€”Senator Reid has asked me to respond on a number of issues. Firstly, she asked why only amendments to section 23 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (Commonwealth Employment) Act have been proposed. Section 23 of the act authorises the making of health and safety regulations relating to employees or contractors. It does not allow regulations to be made in relation to third parties in the vicinity of a workplace.

         Section 23 will be amended to allow regulations to be made to protect third parties in the vicinity of a workplace to which the act applies. This is consistent with the objects of the act and the employer's duty in section 17 to take all reasonably practicable steps to avoid jeopardising the health and safety of the general public at or near a workplace. The amendment also complements the amendments being made to section 70 by enabling the adoption of Worksafe standards in regulation form to the fullest extent possible and, as such, contributes towards the achievement of a national uniform system of occupational health and safety regulation.

         Advice received from the Attorney-General's Department has confirmed that, because no definition of the term `premises' is included in the act, the meaning of the term `workplace', and therefore the coverage of certain sections of the act, is ambiguous. Inserting a definition of the term `premises' makes it clear that a workplace to which the act applies includes field locations such as vehicles or mobile staff facilities. This removes doubt about the act's coverage and is done on the basis of advice from the Attorney-General.

         I will try to paraphrase the issues Senator Reid raised. She asked why the Department of Industrial Relations introduced fees for functions that it carries out in relation to the act without the necessary legislative authority. Application and trade test fees were introduced in March 1989 with the approval of the then Minister for Industrial Relations as part of a move towards cost recovery for services provided by the department. This was consistent with government policy.

         The rationale for cost recovery was to provide additional resources to clear a significant backlog of applications for trade skill assessment without additional calls on the budget or a diversion of resources from other priorities. Included in that rationale was to fund continuous improvements in TRA operations to provide a quicker, better and more cost-effective service to clients, including the upgrading of staff profiles in all TRA state offices to provide a flexible approach to skill assessment, and the development and implementation of information technology databases to process and track client applications in a timely manner.

         At that time, the department did not seek legal advice on the matter. The question of whether there was appropriate authority for charging fees was first raised by Department of Finance officers in the context of discussions about the department's section 35 agreement mechanism for revenue retention in July 1993. As a consequence, legal advice was sought from the Attorney-General's Department. Its advice was received in mid-August and stated that there was insufficient statutory authority for the collection of fees, and the collection of fees ceased immediately.

         The amendments relate to the fact that Comcare will be able to take from a person's superannuation moneys which, in its opinion, may be owed to it by that person as a consequence of Comcare's own mistake in making an overpayment. There is no suggestion in this bill that it is because the employee of the Commonwealth has done anything to cause the overpayment or has done anything to mislead Comcare into having made an overpayment. It is because of a mistake within Comcare that it has overpaid somebody. Comcare will now, under this section, be given the right to rip into that person's superannuation fund and take it.

There will be no question of writing to the person and saying, `We have bungled. We have made a mistake. We have overpaid you. We believe that morally you should refund to us a certain sum of money'.

         I hope that Senator Bell will consider the injustice of this. I am not suggesting for a minute that Comcare is not entitled to get the money back. It may be, but surely there must be some process whereby it is determined that it is entitled to get it back without this high-handed, absolutely unreasonable attitude of merely being able to say to the superannuation fund, `We want $49,000 for this fellow as over the past 20 years we have overpaid him'. All senators know what happens when someone turns 65. They drop out of Comcare. It is not as it used to be. They rely on their own superannuation.

I hope that the Democrats and the Greens will give serious consideration to the absolute unfairness of this provision. There is no question of going to a court to determine whether or not the overpayment was a mistake, whether it was something that ought not to have occurred, whether Comcare ought to wear the consequences of its mistakeâ€”and there have been a number of cases that I have known over the years where there has been a mistake made but it is absolutely unfair to demand the money back and the minister has made a determination not to proceed with it.

The minister will recall that, when he dies, his wife only gets a small proportion of that superannuation. That will have been eroded too.

I did listen to Senator Reid's contribution at the second reading stage, even though the conditions that I complained of earlier did apply; in other words, I was required to be at a public hearing as well as here.

         I do not share Senator Reid's interpretation of the bill although, at first glance, much of what is here appears overly strict. Proposed sections 114B(1) and (2) appear on page 15 of the bill. That whole section at the bottom of page 15 goes to the determination of whether an overpayment has been made. While we would be alarmed if the situation Senator Reid described were the case, it seems to me that a great deal of care is being required to be taken before this money is `ripped out', as Senator Reid said, of an employee's fund.

         From my reading of the bill, it is not Comcare that determines whether an overpayment has been made. As I read it, Comcare would form an opinion based on proposed section 114B(2)(b) which requires the administrator to tell Comcare or the authority whether the retired employee has received any payment, and which requires the administrator, if the retired employee has not received any such payment, to give Comcare or the authority, as soon as practicable, particulars of the rate of pension. It is not Comcare which marches out and gathers this information; rather it is the administrator. There are many more safeguards than one would think on the basis of Senator Reid's characterisation.

I have had a particular personal concern in pursuing any anomalies with regard to compensation payable to people under those provisions. Consistent with that attitude, I am able to lay claim to being genuinely interested in any anomalies that may disadvantage employees under this scheme.

         When a Commonwealth employee retires and notification is given to the superannuation authority, it may well be months before the superannuation is freed up and the employee receives any benefits under it. The employee could not even go to Social Security. As I see it, he would be left absolutely destitute from the time he retired from the Commonwealth, when his Comcare payments would cease, and the superannuation would be tied up. A reading of the proposed sections just referred to by Senator Bell actually confirms that that interpretation would be totally reasonable. Goodness knows what would happen to the person from the time the notice is given to the superannuation fund until it is finally resolved. Proposed section 114B(1)(c)â€”I do not see how one can explain away these wordsâ€”states:

        There can be no ambiguity about those words: `where Comcare is of the opinion that it may have paid moneys in excess of the entitlement to a retired employee'.

The same words are used in subsection (2) of proposed section 114B:

        There is absolutely no protection whatever for the employee. There is no possibility of the employee having the opportunity to argue that, the payment having been made, he was entitled to keep it. It was nothing he could have known about.

         Anyone who has any comprehension about the way Comcare goes about making its determinations as to what will be paid would know that the injured Commonwealth employee has absolutely no capacity on earth to determine whether the amount he is receiving is the correct amount or not. He would have to be an Einstein even to get close to challenging it with Comcare and saying, `I should be entitled to 3c a week more than you are paying me'. There is no possibility that Commonwealth employees would have the capacity to work that out and be certain of it. If he is sent $349.87 a fortnight, he will accept that, bank it and use it, thinking it is the correct amount Comcare should be paying him. There is no reason for him to think that he should challenge that amount and wonder whether it includes an overpayment or rack his brains to work out whether it is correct or not.

         Comcare cannot always get it right. This provision would not be in here at all if Comcare never made a mistake. It does make mistakes, and they are probably honest mistakes.

From the proposed sections Senator Bell read out, the bill sets up certain relationships between Comcare and the administrator of the superannuation fund, but there is no protection for the former employee of the Commonwealth.

Senator Reid asked, and I think it is a reasonable question, whether these proposed amendments will cause hardship to retired employees. The answer to her question is no, they will not. In fact, the current arrangements that require the employee to repay overpayments directly are more likely to cause hardship than the proposed arrangements, particularly if the amount of overpayment is large.

It may result in recovery proceedings being commenced and may also reduce the retired employee's income over a considerable period if he or she is required to repay the amount in instalments. The proposed regime has several important safeguards designed to protect the regular income of the retired employee and prevent any hardship or inequity.

         When compensation payments are reduced, the relevant administrator will be in a position to commence superannuation payments, thus ensuring a regular income for the retired employee. There may be a short periodâ€”I do not envisage it being any more than two, three or four weeksâ€”when the retired employee may not receive the full amount of superannuation if the arrears of superannuation are insufficient to cover in full the overpaid compensation. During that period, the balance of overpayment will be deducted from superannuation payments until the overpayment has been repaid in full. It is also important to point out that a determination as to the amount of compensation that has been overpaid and is to be recovered from a superannuation fund administrator is reviewable.

         There are a number of preconditions for the operation of the scheme for the recovery of overpayments, which will need to be met before the new mechanism will operate. The retiring employee must be in receipt of compensation, under proposed section 114B(1)(a) and (c). Under proposed section 114B(1)(b), he or she must be entitled to a superannuation benefit and must elect to receive payment of a benefit, whether it be a lump sum or a pension or a combination of both. The mechanism will not operate if the employee elects to preserve his or her benefit. The employee must not have received any superannuation payment, under proposed section 114B(4). This safeguards the retiree's income stream.

This will avoid the possibility that, where payments have been made for a significant length of time, the employee may be forced to go without a superannuation income for some time if the overpayment is recovered from the superannuation fund administrator. As I said before, the amendments Senator Reid has moved, I believe in good faith, are not necessary because  adequate provisions exist within this legislation.

         â€”The remarks made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) confirm the necessity for these amendments in order to protect people. I do not think the minister understands the impact on future payments once the superannuation capital sum has been attacked in this fashion. If we allowed for the superannuation to be paid and the person to make fortnightly repayments, that would make a lesser impact on the person's entitlements and receipts than doing it in this fashion. I do not believe that the minister is saying that we can take this capital sum out of the superannuation and yet pay to the person the fortnightly payments he would have received had that not occurred. It is almost like double jeopardy.

         The minister seems to think the former employee of the Commonwealth, once retired, having had the unfortunate situation of finishing up in the hands of Comcare, will still receive money while this is sorted out. Can the minister give an unequivocal guarantee that, if that person has turned 65, Comcare will still pay that amount of money to him for as long as it takes to sort out what has to be repaid? I do not believe that that is the case. I would be very interested to have an unequivocal assurance that the moneys will be paid after the person turns 65 while these difficulties are resolved. Since the amended scheme came into effect in 1989, I have not known that to be the case.

         â€”I do not quite understand what that means, because there is some real significance about turning 65. Comcare normally does not pay people any more because they move into their retirement income phase. This has caused a lot of hardship and heartache to a lot of people. A person would be expecting his superannuation to provide him with certain fortnightly repayments which he would have budgeted to live on after he had reached the age of 65 and retired. He is in the uncertain situation then of not knowing how much of the capital is going to be taken and what impact that will have on the amount of fortnightly payment he will subsequently receive. This is of real significance to people at 65. If we are talking about someone aged 55, Comcare may very generously continue to go on making the payments the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) referred to, but it is at the age of 65 that I have some real concerns.

        It goes on to apply the regulations relating to the occupational health and safety act to those premises. Presumably, that is a definition of `premises' which is so broad that it will cover all the members of the Australian Defence Force in the course of their duties.

         I wonder whether the minister would like to comment on the application of the occupational health and safety act to members of the Australian Defence Force. My understanding is that, up to the present, the members of the ADF have been excluded from the application of the occupational health and safety act in a rigid way. Over the past 10, 15 or 20 years, the Department of Defence has moved very considerably to make sure that there are noâ€”for want of a better wordâ€”bad habits, circumstances or anything that is deleterious to health within the practices or the duties it requires from members of the Australian Defence Force. In relation to explosives, gases and things like that, quite a high level of attention has been paid to minimising any risks to members of the Defence Force. But there are other provisions of the occupational health and safety act, such as the limitation to some absurdly low weight that one person can lift and all the other things, that clearly were inspired to aid the unions in their featherbedding and which have never been applied to the Defence Force, nor could they ever be applied. I wonder whether the minister could make some comment on the applicability of part 5 in this bill to members of the Australian Defence Force in the pursuance of their duties.

         â€”I thank the minister for that answer. I was seeking confirmation that section 7 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act did apply. I now move to part 7 of this bill which deals with amendments to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. I ask a question in a similar vein as to whether there is anything in part 7 which displaces or overrides provisions of the Veterans' Entitlement Act or any other act in relation to compensation for members of the Australian Defence Force.

         â€”Before we leave this committee stage and while we are still seeking clarification, I think it would be appropriate to ask the minister to address the situation that we have before us. The claim has been made, in the context of the coalition's proposed amendments, that this will have the effect of allowing untrammelled or unqualified access to the superannuation funds without proper process. The counterclaim is made by the minister that the process is sufficient for justice to be done.

         I would ask the minister whether it is possible to provide, immediately subsequent to the passage of this bill, a concise summaryâ€”I do not mean in the terms of the explanatory memorandum but in terms of a brief letterâ€”which would describe to us the way that this is supposed to proceed so that we could monitor and see whether the description that has been given by the minister of the way that this will work is, in fact, the way that it does work. I ask this because, with regard to the licensed authoritiesâ€”I sought to clarify to whom this appliedâ€”in the operation of workers compensation payments and the administration of that whole scheme, the Democrats have been vigilant over a couple of years. We have found those operations to be not in strict accordance with the intentions that were expressed in the original granting of those licences.

         One of the tools that has been useful to us in monitoring those licences was the assurance and the explanation given to us by Senator Cook, the minister responsible at that time. To be able to accurately determine whether the situation described by the minister is the one which prevails or whether the situation described by members of the coalition is the one which will prevail. It would be of great assistance to us if we could have a brief description of how the department sees this provision operating. We could then monitor that situation. Whether or not we get it, we will be monitoring it.

         â€”On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we propose to vote against the clause. This clause seeks to penalise Western Australia for introducing voluntary student unionism. That legislation is currently going through the state house in Western Australia. This clause will take from the grant allocated to that state the moneys the student unions will lose as a result of voluntary student unionism . For example, if the figure was $5 million, the funding to the state for higher education would be reduced by that amount. The money would then be given by the Commonwealth to those student unions, which I believe are referred to here as higher education institutions.

         I simply bring to the attention of the Senate, and particularly the Democrats and Senator Bell, that the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights states in article 20 that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and I highlight the word `association'.

         At the moment the union fee is paid in an amenities fee. Ever since I have been associated with this cause, there has been a great deal of feeling among students that they should have the choice of whether to pay this money or not. It goes automatically to their guild and, in turn, the guild provides services which students may or may not use. There may be students who wish not to use the services of the guild and therefore would not contribute any fee.

A lot of students are not happy with their guilds and the uses to which the guilds put their fees.

         The central element of the coalition's education policy platform, which was well publicised and released prior to the elections, both federal and state, was that legislation would be brought in to end compulsory guild membership. The government in Western Australia was elected on that platform. The people of Western Australia elected a Liberal government which had as part of its platform legislation to end compulsory guild membership. Here we have the federal government trying to interfere with a state government carrying out a promise on which it was elected. The Commonwealth is blatantly interfering with the state government. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, said in the second reading speech:

        The institutions do not have any rights; it is the members of the institutions who have the rights. That is where the government has it wrong. The government, in its collective approach to this, would like to give institutions all the rights in the world. Institutions should be about the last things in the world to get rights.

         I refer to an extract from a campaign broadsheet produced by the Cross Campus Guild Network headed `Minister set to silence students', circulated in August-September this year. It says that, should this measure be passed, the guild would still end up with the same amount of money because it would be funded by the federal government. It continues:

        This would be a terrible outcome. Yes, the Guild would survive pretty much as it has done before, but its legitimacy would be crushed by the sudden huge drop in membership, and the loss of access to the governing bodies of the Universities.

        It is saying that the guild would then be a government funded body; it would lose its legitimacy; it would not be there as a result of voluntary support of the students.

It would be something it was never meant to be.

         I am a past guild councillor of the University of Western Australia, as Senator Chris Evans might well remember, and past chairman of the public affairs council. I can say that student guilds can do a lot of good things, I do not dispute that, but they become multimillion dollar businesses which in some cases overlook the concerns of the average student and sometimes direct their funds to political purposes which the students do not endorse. For example, in my day the guild of undergraduates gave money to the Frelimo group in Mozambique.

It is a feel-good term and one of those phrases that is designed to sound good enough so that everybody ought to agree with it. In fact, the usage of it does not hide what it is: the concept is one of anti-student organisations.

         When we refer to these student organisations, we have to be careful that we do not characterise them as unions in the sense of trade unions affiliated with the ACTU and thereby affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. In fact, there is no possibility of seeing a student organisation that provides services on campus as fulfilling that definition of a trade union. It is unfortunateâ€”and I am personally concernedâ€”that many of the student organisations have the title `union'. They do not serve the purpose of a trade union. That is where our confusion and obfuscation has arisen.

         The coalition likes to characterise student organisations as unions because of the implication that such bodies are captives of the Australian Labor Party. There is nothing further from the truth. Over recent years the Australian Democrats have been received in a climate of great welcome by student organisations, which are only too keen to criticise the education policies of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, some of the most significant opposition to the education policy of this Labor government has come from and been initiated by student organisations, which do not in any way see themselves as kowtowing to the desires of this government.

         The point to be made here is that the freedom of association that was spoken of by Senator Ellison has been well met by the opportunity to join political groups.

I share his abhorrence of that. If I were a member of an organisation or a student at a campus that was so affected, I would be railing against that to ensure that the perpetrators of such a donation were voted out of office at the next opportunity.

Senator Calvert has done an incredible job of ferreting out which are appropriate and which are not. At this very moment we have before us criticism of donations and moneys made available to organisations that we, who are not the government, would like to criticiseâ€”and are criticising.

         These organisations we are talking about cannot be accurately described in the same breath and with the same association as unions in the sense of trade unions. Senator Ellison gave us the very reason why we could understand thatâ€”he was a member of one. I presume that he, as a member of oneâ€”I may be wrong, but I will presume; when I was a member of one, it applied to meâ€”did not think as a member of the Labor Party, act as a member of the Labor Party, or believe that he was a member of the Labor Party. I would have thought that it would be fairly apparent from that definition and that experience that, although student organisations sometimes use `union' in their titleâ€”or `guild' or `association'â€”they are vastly different from the organisations that are called trade unions.

         â€”Senator Kemp interjects, `Why not voluntary?'. The answer has been provided several times during my speech. The argument is tired. It has been applied; it has been run. The answer is quite simplyâ€”I repeat what I said beforeâ€”that these student organisations are servicing a community; that is, the community of campus. It is a campus which has services provided to it by that student organisation. It is entirely parallel to the community we find serviced by a local government. There is no opportunity for a person living in the city of Canberra to say, `I don't really live here. I won't really belong here'. There is no opportunity for a person living in the community of Wagga Wagga, Bourke or wherever to say, `I don't belong to the organisation of this community.

         Of course, there is the opportunity to conscientiously object to being asked to associate oneself with this group of people and withdraw from membership of same, and thereby be subjected to payment of the service fees but not have one's named added to the membership lists. That opportunity may not be readily taken by people who do not understand what it is they are being required to pay. I think a proper assessment of this situation would really give the lie to the expression `voluntary student unionism' which has been responsible for so much of the confusion that we find ourselves in at the moment.

We in the opposition say no, they should not. We think that if a state government decides to have compulsory unionism then it should not be bribed not to. Equally so, if a state government decides to have voluntary unionism, it should not be bribed not to. That is our position. We make no ideological judgment.

The Greens acted against the wishes of a majority of the winemakers and grape producers in Western Australia. They left them out on a limb; they did not represent them. I recommend that Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts not go down to the south-west or the Swan Valley for Christmas because they are most unwelcome there.

         Let us remind the Greens of what they are doing. They are potentially ripping off Western Australian taxpayers to the tune of up to $5 million by refusing to support our amendment. We have had this week in the national capital a furore over the funding of the sports grants and the political pork-barrelling meted out by these corrupt sporting grants through Minister Kelly's office. An amount of $3.9 million went to Western Australia: $600,000 went into the seat of Swan; $500,000 went into the seat of Canning; and equal amounts went into the electorates of Brand and Perth. The four most marginal Labor seats in Western Australia, together with Cowan, received in excess of $2 million in pork-barrelling grants to try to ensure that Mr Beazley and Mr Gear in particular were returned to this place. I am focusing on the amount of money that is involved.

Both those gentlemen, who were returned to this place by between 100 and 200 votes, owe their political life to the blatant and corrupt political pork-barrelling that was meted out through the minister's office. It was a disgrace. We are talking of a total of about $2.1 million to $3 million in global terms in Western Australia in the last financial year. The Democrats and the Australian Labor Party are now combining to rip $5 million out of Western Australia.

         If when the guilds in the University of Western Australia, Murdoch University and other campuses become voluntary they behave in the most obnoxious, nasty manner by not servicing their students and basically running down the unions, they will have very low memberships because no-one will want to be a member of them.

As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate last night, I hope there is an incentive in the system for the unions to be run well, to make decisions in the interests of the students, to provide services that students want to use, and to provide inducements to join unions and to get involved in them, such as discounts at bookshops and coffee shops.

         I conclude where I began: Senator Bell did not focus on the key element of this measure proposed today, which is to exclude clause 20. Does Senator Bell go along with the bribery, the extortion and the blackmailâ€”or `greenmail', considering the way the Greens are behaving todayâ€”to ensure that the taxpayers of Western Australia have up to $5 million ripped off them? Schools, teachers, facilities for disabled children and programs for disadvantaged Aboriginals will be put at risk because of his action. Funding for those people in need will be put at risk by his action, because he would rather see the money put into unrepresentative unions that do not represent their students. That is the question Senator Bell needs to answer. He has not even addressed it. The people of Western Australia in particular want to know why he will take their money away from them to ensure that young people in Western Australia do not have the freedom to decide whether to join a student union.

Given the well-known views of Senator Kemp and Senator Ellison on the question of UN declarations, their concerns about Geneva based bureaucrats, international bureaucracies and foreign committees, the general xenophobia that they show in relation to anything that arrives from an international body and their concern about Australia's sovereignty, I am very surprised to find that suddenly they are using this argument in support of their position.

As I say, it is quite bizarre, given the attitude of senators opposite when we debated things like the UN declaration on religious beliefs and the UN declaration on children, that they now turn to those international organisations for support.

         I do not really want to go through the whole debate about student unionism. I think it was well canvassed in Australian society in the 1970s. I think it is a shame that the student warriors who are now members of parliament have not been able to give up their ideological obsession with this issue. I understand that Mr Moore was also a well-known student politician on a tertiary campus in Western Australia.

         While I know that Senator Campbell has an ideological and deep personal commitment to what he sees as a question of voluntary membership, I think he is also coloured in his views, as he indicated in a couple of the speeches he has made, about the question of the NUS supported candidate in the federal seat of Swan at the last election. Senator Campbell, like many Liberals, has been unable to accept the result of the election and the fact that Mr Beazley was returned in the seat of Swan, and Mr Gear in the seat of Canning. His contribution today again highlighted the concern that nags away at him.

It is a very good result for the Australian parliament, as well as the Labor Party, that Mr Beazley was returned. I really do think it is time to move on. Senator Campbell has dealt with the arguments about voluntary student unionism. They really are not relevant.

The student unions on the big campuses have grown out of all perspective. They are giant organisations. As Senator Ellison said, they have budgets running into millions, and there is a lot of abuse. There is even criminal abuse at times in the administration of those funds. There is also an abuse, in a perverse sense, in so far as those funds are used to promote whatever political causes the executive group of the union holds at the time.

By the same token, if students can have a voluntary association with the student unions, there will be an improvement in the quality of administration and in the quality of service that those unions can provide.

The fee for these services will be paid either through the guild or through the university in some other way. That is where the compulsion comes in. The membership of a guild enables the students to have some control. In other words, it enshrines that principle of individualism which is so important to the coalition.

         Senator Woodley drew this concern to the attention of the Senate in a quite proper way. Then surprisingly he concluded by saying that the way to deal with this problem is for more students, and particularly those from the conservative side of politics, to get more involved in these student activities. In other words, this would further politicise these unions and guilds. The solution that Senator Woodley presented to the chamber would compound the problem.

         There was also an assumptionâ€”and I think that this is importantâ€”that these services would not be provided if they were voluntary. When we think about that, we are saying that these services are absolutely vital to the students but that, if the students wanted to pay for them, they would not be. I really do not think Senator Woodley is able to have it both ways. If he rests his case by saying that these things must be provided, they will be provided and they can only be provided in a compulsory fashion. Implicit in that argument is the possibility that students do not want the comprehensive range of services which are on offer. I do not know the answer to that question. One of the advantages of bringing in a more sensitive response to market forces is to test what is absolutely vital to the students and what is not. There is a problem of logic there, and I do not think that has been addressed by any of the supporters of this bill.

Given the nature of the arguments that we constantly hear from the Labor Party and the Democrats on the need to be more attuned to international treaties and covenants, he raised an interesting argument. Undoubtedly, he put that argument forward in an attempt to show that the sorts of things which are important to the Labor Party are also consistent with the general thrust of this bill.

         An important issue before this chamber is how much Australian law should be influenced by UN treatiesâ€”treaties which have never been endorsed by the Australian people and Australian parliaments. The argument is constantly put forward that `this law must be put in place' or `that law must be put in place' because there is a UN treatyâ€”signed by Senator Gareth Evans or Mr Keating but not passed by this parliamentâ€”which says it must.

         This is an interesting issue. As Senator Schacht has indicated, these treaties do erode the sovereignty and independence of our nation. It always surprises me that the Senator Evanses and Mr Keatings of this world, the great republicans of this nation, so constantly talk about the independence of Australiaâ€”which as a strong supporter of our current constitution, I ardently supportâ€”while at the same time taking steps which erode the sovereignty and independence of our nation by following these UN treaties and instruments. The ability of Australian citizens to take complaints out of Australia to UN committees is a very significant change in the nature of law in this country and certainly overturns the Australia Act, which was brought in by a Labor government only five years ago.

         Senator Chris Evans raised a useful point. We have signed so many of these instruments and signed so many of these treaties that no-one really knows what is contained in all these inevitable clauses. One day they may well come back to haunt the Labor Party. Mr Goss, the Premier of Queensland, was very aware of that. It is true that there are ILO conventions which talk about freedom of association and voluntary unionism. If our party ever decided to use such a convention, we could wipe out the closed shops in this country. We would destroy much of the basis of the compulsory membership of trade unions. That is why I say to Labor Party members who may be prepared to follow Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Keating down this UN path that it may come back to haunt them, particularly from that base of support which they so constantly need and rely on.

Principle is always difficult for the Labor Party to deal with, because it is a party that has very few principles.

         â€”I was surprised to hear some of the comments in this debate today from the other side and from Senator Bell on behalf of the Australian Democrats. This debate is capable of being reduced to very simple terms. The debate is about whether the Commonwealth government should have the power to reduce the grant to any given state because that state has said to its students, `You will have a choice as to whether or not you join a student union'. The government wishes to say that, if a state government gives students free choice, it should have its states grant reduced. We in the National and Liberal parties disagree.

         For all of the rhetoric and the sophistry that we have heard from the other side and from the Democrats, it is an immutable fact that those of us in the National and Liberal parties are supporting free speech and freedom of association. More importantly, we do not believe that the Commonwealth government should have an overreaching power to dictate to the state governments how their money should be spent, because that is effectively what happens. A state government that gives students free choice as to whether they want to join a union has its states grant reduced and the money given to a student union. In effect, the Commonwealth is allocating that money for them.

If we do not support the coalition's amendment, then what we effectively say is that from now on the Commonwealth government can dictate to state governments on any issue of policy on the basis that if the state government takes a certain course of action the Commonwealth will take away more of its moneyâ€”take away more of its untied grant and spend it for it.

         It is quite interesting that in the past some of the people who have spoken in this debate have supported some of the most spurious claims about a right to do this and a right to do that. Yet they are now saying that there should be no right for students to choose whether or not they want to belong to a student union. Senator Kemp has very eloquently said today that if we follow the arguments of Senator Bell and the government and believe that the services provided by student unions are invaluableâ€”that they cannot be done withoutâ€”then, of course, the students would happily cough up the money and join the student union. It seems to us that the only people who really believe that those services are so invaluable are the members of the government, the members of the Democrats and some members of the executives of the student unions in question, because, given a chance, the students themselves do not see it that way.

         Let me make a brief comment about when I was at university, which was not that long ago. We did not have compulsory student unionism. The first thing I did when I got to university, quite interestingly enough, was to join the Oxford Union Society. But it was not a union; it was a debating society. There was an Oxford University students union but my junior common room in my college chose not to have anything at all to do with the Oxford University students union. Our junior common room was non-political. We had absolutely no interest in politics and we certainly had absolutely no interest in the Oxford University students union.

         The good thing about it, I suppose, was that we did not see much of the executive of the Oxford University students union because most of them were busy being involved in die-ins outside Greenham Common and riots in the centre of London. They certainly were not representing our viewpoint; they were not doing the sorts of things that we were interested in. So we said, `We don't want to have anything to do with it'. And do you know what? The amazing thing is that Oxford University continued on undeterred, our junior common room continued on undeterred, and I was not disadvantaged in the slightest because I was not a member of the Oxford University student union.

         It is a fact that the Australian university students are no different from this. The Australian populace on the whole does not believe in compulsion when it comes to unionism, be it in the university or in the workplace. So why is it that this chamber today seems poised to support compulsion and to support coercionâ€”coercion by a wicked and pernicious federal government and by student unions which cannot, given free choice, attract funds from students who are increasingly dissatisfied and disenchanted with their idiotic politics?

         â€”There were some points that I wanted to address but which I did not get time to in my first contribution. The first one is in response to the interjection of Senator McMullan that we did not support the state government this time last year because we chose to support state governments that are Liberal governments. Clearly, had we wanted to use the tactics this government is using to bribe or induce the Western Australian government not to do what it is doing in relation to voluntarism on campus, we would have moved an amendment this time last year to penalise a state government to in fact ensure that there was compulsion on campus. Of course, we did not do that.

         Senator McMullan would know that it certainly would not be our policy to create a similar form of bribery in relation to a state government to cause it to adopt some other form of policy. Our action here is intended to ensure that any government across Australia that seeks to take any action in relation to compulsion or voluntarism in relation to student membership is not penalised either way. That is the principle.

         I think the Democrats are going along with a very dangerous precedent. I understand, even though I do not agree with them, their views about unions on campus. Of course, they are arguments I have heard for many years. They are in fact arguments we have within the Liberal Party. We have had some very bitter battles with what were known as the `guildies' within the partyâ€”some of the people who had become involved in the guild. Michael Leishman, who was a guild president, if I remember correctlyâ€”I hope I do not hurt himâ€”used to speak at our state conferences very much in favour of the very arguments Senator Robert Bell has used. He said that it is not a union; it is more of a local government-type situation. We used to have very good debates at our state conferences and Young Liberals conferences and so forth. We usually won by about 500 votes to 4, but we always had good debates.

         That brings me to my next point, one that has yet to be addressed: as student guilds or associations come to rely more and more upon federal government moneys to subsidise their membership revenue, they will become more and more reliant upon the discretion of the federal minister. In the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which I have not read since last year but which is still sharply focused in my mind, the specific clause about how the money goes to the student unions or institutions clearly set out, I believe, that it was a matter of ministerial discretion.

         I think an issue this chamber will have to deal with sooner or later, probably within the next 12 months, is under what regulations and criteria that money is given to student unions. Take the extreme and probably stupid and silly example of a campus with thousands of people, only a fewâ€”10 or 15â€”of whom are members of the union. Clearly, that would be an outrageously unrepresentative student union. I am sure that any sensible ministerâ€”and we have some sensible ministersâ€”would not want to pay millions of dollars to such a student organisation that was clearly unrepresentative. So in that position the minister will have to make some sort of decision on whether or not the government gives millions of dollars to student unions. That is one worry, and we will have to deal with that. There will have to be regulations to decide what sorts of unions we want to fund.

If that is the case, what the state government of Western Australia, and in particular my good friend and colleague the Hon. Norman Moore, the minister, are doing is ensuring that individuals do have the freedom to choose not to join a union. If that is called interfering in the autonomy of institutions, so be it.

But, again, that is me putting my view on student union voluntarism.

I do not seek to enter into that argument, but the fact of the matter is that Mark Dale has been a welfare officer on campus. He knows probably better than anybody in this chamber how important the duties of a welfare officer are. Yet Mark Dale is saying, `Voluntary student unionism is vital'.

         I understand and appreciate what Senator Campbell said about the essence of this committee stage debate on the removal of clause 20, but the fact is that we have ended up in this wide ranging debate about the whole philosophy at this stage. I would like to address the gratuitous insults which were delivered in my direction by Senator Panizza, but I think it is inappropriate to continue what is, in effect, a device to try to defend myself. I will leave it at that.

         â€”On the issue of a union not being a union, I certainly would never conjure up any affiliation with the ACTU as being the basis of a union. I am sure that is the opposition's position. I just cannot see how Senator Bell can say that student unions are not unions because they are not affiliated with the ACTU. That would be like saying the Public Sector Union is not a union because it is not affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. There are lots of unions that are not affiliated with the Australian Labor Party.

         I think there is a genuine misconception in the Australian community that the National and Liberal parties are somehow anti-union. I can see from some of my colleagues' rhetoric from time to time when we say that unions have got too much power and have too much control, and unions run the country, that we could be interpreted as being anti-union. We are not: we are very much in favour of associations.

          The Liberal Party is an association. In Western Australia it has 15,000 or 16,000 members. We like associations. We build them. The Australian Democrats are an association. But we love to have voluntary associations. We like it if people pay some money and join the Liberal Party, but we respect their right to choose not to.

         It is not that the UN declaration says we should have freedom of associationâ€”we can argue with Ron Castan and Senator Evans as much as we like. I do not really care about the UN Declaration. What I care about is something that I think is a fundamental birthright of all citizens of the world and that is that no state, no nanny state, no government should tell a young person whether or not to join some association. It is repugnant to me but it is more repugnant that we should have a Commonwealth government stealing money from the state because the state government, for very good reasons, intends to ensure that young Australians do have that freedom.

         â€”It will be a sparkling contribution, Senator. It seems there is a fallacy in linking this issue with the freedom of association question. The pseudo-economic argument that Senator Kemp sought to put fails to take into account that the sorts of goods we are talking aboutâ€”which are provided, in the main, by these servicesâ€”are public goods. Individuals faced with the decision whether or not to pay for those goods can assume that, if they do not pay and everyone else does, those goods will still be available. So each individual has an incentive not to contribute, irrespective of his or her judgment of the value of goods being provided. It is the fundamental, underlying rationale for the public provision of goods through taxation. I assume that is the linkage that Senator Bell was making when he made his local government analogy, and that is the fundamental fallacy of that approach.

         I have only two or perhaps three other points I wish to make. First, it seems to have been missed in most of the debate that the people who run these organisationsâ€”with whom I often disagreeâ€”are those who are elected by the members of the organisation. The argument that somehow the people in charge of these organisations will run away with these resources for a 12-month period without taking any notice of their members may be correct. As in any representative democracy, there is the capacity of people elected to fail properly to reflect the interests of those who elect them.

         â€”In any representative democracy, that is absolutely right. But if they go too far, results ensue and, in these circumstances, the time periods are very short. Senator Kemp raised an interesting pointâ€”a point which he raises often. It is not relevant to the issue, but he and Senator Evans had an interesting discussion about the impact of internationalisation on Australian law. I think Senator Kemp is wrong, but I welcome the fact that he raised that issue because it is an important one. He has his eyes steadfastly faced on the 1950s when this was not a problem. I think he is failing to understand the nature of the international relations between countries in the 20th century and the fact that these matters become Australian domestic law only when this parliament passes laws to make them so. Nevertheless, it is an important debate and I welcome it. That issue is a little tangential but he was not the first to raise it, and he and Senator Evans had a worthwhile discussion on it.

         The other point I wish to make before concluding is that this is not an interference in the right of the government of Western Australia to pass the legislation which it seeks to pass. It is simply making the Western Australian government face the financial consequences. At the moment, these services are provided by university institutions through the fees they raise on behalf of students and passed to student associations which then fund the services. But the services will need to be continued to be provided and, if the state government believes that the funds should be provided otherwise, let it face up to the economic and financial consequences of doing soâ€”not the rest of Australia. That is what we are doing. It is up to the Western Australian government whether or not it chooses to proceed. It is properly a matter of judgment for it to face up to the consequences of its decision.

         In conclusion, I thought a very effective argument was put in response to a concern about interference with student association fees. The South Australian Liberal Party spokesperson for education, Mr Such, stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We will not be attacking or in any way focusing on student union fees. Unlike what may be said in other states or at other levels of government, we will not be trying to interfere in how student unions operateâ€”operate what I believe is basically a welfare-type arrangement. Students that do not like the decisions on how the money is used should get involved and make sure it is spent in the way the students want it spent.
       </para>
       <para>
        That advocacy was put during the course of the current election campaign in South Australia. That was Mr Such's response when he was interviewed by the Campus Review about his views on the issues in the lead-up to the South Australian election.

         It proposes amendments to that act which will, firstly, establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority to replace the existing Torres Strait Regional Council with the objective of cutting down on the volume of duplication with ATSIC and other bodies operating in the Torres Strait Islands. Secondly, it will devolve some financial functions to the regional councils but will try to ensure that there will also be safeguards to deal with the regional councils that do not perform properly. Thirdly, it will establish the Electoral Review Panel. Fourthly, it will strengthen the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit.

         The provisions in the bill for the Torres Strait regional authorities propose the establishment of an independent Torres Strait Regional Authority to replace the current Torres Strait Regional Council. These provisions occupy a major part of the bill. The Torres Strait Regional Authority will be established as a body corporate and will operate in much the same way as ATSIC. The provisions cover things such as: funding powers, including the appointment of advisory committees and the disclosure of pecuniary interests; the provision of 20 elected members and election procedures; the appointment of a general manager by the minister; staff appointments; and reporting requirements, such as estimates of expenditure, annual reports and financial statements.

         While the coalition recognises the practicality and advantages of rationalising multiple government input into the Torres Strait, we understand from visits there that many people living in the Torres Strait Islands have aspirations towards a type of self-determining rule similar to Norfolk Island or the Cook Islands. The coalition's support of these rationalisation measures does not reflect support for some form of independence, and certainly not for sovereignty.

         There are problems with some of the proposals in that there are people who have lived in the Torres Strait Islands for some time who are not indigenous people. I give the examples of members of the European, Chinese and Japanese populations. Rather than making a set of laws for one section of the population, we feel that there should be no blank cheque given by these proposals.

Whilst we are supportive, we appreciate that the islanders wish to maintain their cultural integrity and want their own body outside ATSIC. However, at this stage, we emphasise that the coalition is not making a commitment to sovereignty.

         As regards the devolution of powers to the regional council, this bill strengthens reporting arrangements and accountability requirements for those regional councils. It provides them with increased funding responsibilities with wider powers to approve funds and issue guarantees. These powers may also be suspended if deemed necessary by the ATSIC chairman. The regional councils will now be required to provide draft budgets which are tied to a regional plan for their region. ATSIC will have the power to remove regional councillors who fail to perform functions or comply with budgetary or reporting requirements.

         â€”We are debating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993. One of the most important amendments proposed in this bill creates a separate Torres Strait Regional Authority which will now have powers and functions similar to ATSIC in relation to Aboriginals and Islanders in the Torres Strait. The Senate is debating such an amendment for the second time. Four years ago when ATSIC legislation was before the Senate, the coalition moved amendments to give the Torres Strait Islanders separate recognition in a regional council. This amendment gives the Islanders their own form of ATSIC.

         For a government which casts itself in the role of leading a reconciliation process, it has been very strong on rhetoric yet very slow to do the obviousâ€”it has taken up to four years just to do the things it had to do for the Torres Strait. Following my question in the Senate earlier this week to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Ray, it is now on the public record that the federal government has opened a dialogue with the Torres Strait Islanders on the means to achieve greater self-government. Following discussions between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and Torres Strait Islanders, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to the Queensland Premier and the Torres Strait Island Coordinating Council to propose a preliminary meeting.

         The bill before us today is seen by the Islanders as just a first step towards a form of self-government, having free association with Australia. It is, therefore, relevant to anticipate what those future steps might involve and what support is to be given to them by state and federal governments. There is a lot of confusion within the government ranks about the level of commitment to Torres Strait self-government. On Wednesday Senator Ray said:

        Senator Ray was at pains to explain that self-government for the Torres Strait was a long-term aspiration and the substantial details of the proposal by the Islanders have not yet been put forward. Yet only yesterday the Chairman of the ICC, Mr Gaetano Lui, told ABC radio that the ball was fairly in the government's court. Both federal and Queensland governments had been sent their proposals. Mr Lui complained about the lack of response from the state minister, Anne Warner. The desire for self government by the year 2001 was also expressed in the regional council's Torres Strait development plan. The Islanders believe they have reached a negotiating stage with the government. Mr Lui said that the time for consultation is over.

         Mabo has given Islanders a position of strength, and the federal minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has led them to believe that the government is right behind their self-government aims. Having had the Mabo glory taken away from him by the Prime Minister and the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), Mr Tickner is now seeking political glory on his own. The problem is, as Senator Ray pointed out, that there are many complex issues to be discussed. In his enthusiasm to make a name for himself, Mr Tickner may be guilty of overlooking these complexities and, indeed, the welfare of the Islanders themselves.

         Gaetano Lui has mentioned the Cook Islands several times as a possible model for self-government. Firstly, it is important to remember that the Cook Islands were only ever New Zealand's to administer on behalf of the United Nations until the act of self-determination in 1965. The Torres Strait Islands, on the other hand, are as much a part of Australia as is Sydney or Melbourne; they are as much a part of the state of Queensland as is Mount Isa or the Gold Coast. Norfolk Island is a quite separate case. It was not part of a state but was a federal territory. The legal and constitutional implications of setting up self-government with free association with Australia are quite different, and in the case of the Torres Strait Islands would be very cumbersome. Norfolk Island was originally inhabited by Pitcairn Islanders, who in those days had no association with Australia. They do not consider themselves as part of Australia.

         Unless the Queensland government relinquishes the Torres Strait Islands to the Commonwealth as a territory, a referendum would be necessary to set up another state. The regional council's aim of providing the standard government function of maintaining peace, good order and government, suggests a reference to a territory or a state rather than a local government. I have been advised that the Islanders' call for self-government, based on free association with Australia, goes far beyond the Norfolk Island model, and it suggests an even more autonomous state being not part of Australia.

         The Islanders say they would still want Australia to look after foreign affairs and defence. This is like the Cook Islands, where they have their own parliament and free association with New Zealand. There are some 17,000 Cook Islanders living on the islands and another 20,000 in New Zealand. Income is mostly from tourism and remittances from relatives in New Zealand. The New Zealand government provided budget support in terms of a cash grant of $8.5 millionâ€”that is not a lot of moneyâ€”in 1992-93 and $8.3 million this year. There is also an allocation for projects and training assistance, which was $5.5 million in 1992-93 and $5.2 million this year. They also receive several smaller packages from places such as the United Nations, Australia, the US, and so on, but they would not add up to much more than $1 million.

         report from the inquiry into the efficiency of the interface between seaports and the land transport system by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure.

         The current index has compared waterfront costs in 1991 with those in 1992 and has found that total costs of international container movements through the waterfront fell by between five per cent and 11 per cent at Australia's major ports of Sydney and Melbourne. Stevedoring charges themselves declined over this period by a substantial 22 per cent. Shipping lines reduced the average planned stay of their ships in port by almost half a day per port call because of reform efficiency improvements. Container depots are now able to make cargo available five to seven days after ship arrival, compared with the previous average of 10 to 21 days.

         The report notes an apparent decline in port related charges, which, importantly, includes those levied by the state controlled port authorities. However, it attributes this fall primarily to an increase in the number of containers exchanged per ship visit rather than a change in the underlying level of the charges.

         While the current index provides further evidence that the total costs of moving international cargo across the Australian waterfront have clearly and substantially fallen, the government fully recognises the need for continuing reform, particularly in port authorities and other services at the sea-land interface. In order to pursue this, I have provided Peter Morris, the chairman of the House of Representatives standing committee, with a further reference for that committee to inquire on an ongoing basis into the issues raised in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         The committee has been asked to give particular attention to encouraging participants in the transport system, and particularly the shippers, to recognise their role in improving overall performance. In this regard, the BTCE report provides detailed information which will assist shippers to understand the waterfront industry and raise their awareness of the costs involved in each separate link of the cargo handling chain.

The minister claimed in question time yesterday that the awarding of Australian artists creative fellowships is `resolved at arm's length from the government'. Is it true that in 1989 the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, attended the meeting at which the recipients of that year's fellowship awards were decided and that one of the recipients was his personal friend Mr Geoffrey Tozer? Is it true, as alleged in a Sunday

         in July 1991, that the first fellowship to Mr Tozer was to renovate the St Benedict's convent in Queanbeyan for the purpose of setting up a music schoolâ€”a project that was personally overseen by Mr Keating? Why, if no music school eventuated and the building is to be sold on 27 November, has Mr Tozer received an unprecedented second fellowship valued at $325,000 when the guidelines for the Keating fellowships state that second fellowships should be awarded only in exceptional circumstances?

He is a citizen and he is entitled to carry out those activities. Whether he does or not is of no interest or consequence to me. But to the best of my knowledge, the application which was made, which I have not seenâ€”it goes to the committee quite independentlyâ€”was related to his performance schedule and his recording schedule during the period in which he was a recipient of the fellowship, and his application on this occasion for the second round of grants similarly related to a continuation of his outstanding record of performance and recording, being internationally recognised as an outstanding concert pianist.

Ms Brown's career in law has encompassed work as a solicitor, barrister, lecturer and magistrate. She is an experienced and very highly regarded lawyer. For the past three years, she has been chief magistrate of Victoria. She has made a significant contribution to the work of a number of boards and committees, reflecting a very broad interest in law and judicial administration.

         The Trade Practices Commission has issued a draft determination; it is not yet a final determination. The commission has indicated that, on the information presently before it, it considered that competition would be less than substantial if the venture went ahead and that the joint venture could result in higher prices. However, the process still has a way to go. I understand that a conference will be held with the applicants in a couple of weeks time and that the applicants will have the opportunity to put further information to the commission.

         The Trade Practices Commissionâ€”which at least Senator Boswell would be interested in and aware ofâ€”cannot be directed by me or any other minister in relation to any individual application of the act. So the minister cannot give a direction to the Trade Practices Commission in this matter. The legislation sets down the criteria within which the commission acts and it acts independently. The parties' source of redress, if they are not happy with the decision, is appeal to the Trade Practices Tribunal and subsequently to the Federal Court.

         In terms of who is responsible, obviously in any agreement, be it a commercial agreement between companies or an agreement between governments, both sides will try to make sure that the other side keeps its part of that agreement. We are constantly monitoring the Medicare agreements with all the states to make sure that they are being kept. I am quite worried about where those outcomes will be in a couple of states. As far as I am aware, South Australia will keep to the terms of the agreement by the ratio across the whole of the state, even if some individual hospitals go over and others go under; it averages out. I also believe that there is a way to ameliorate the situation for those hospitals. I will check with the minister and get back to Senator Lees as soon as I can.

         With respect to the allocation of the second part of the programâ€”that is, the grants program to assist with this community education programâ€”more than 400 applications were received from around the country with a total of 28 from Tasmania. There were 20 successful projects. They were selected on the basis that they best met criteria outlined in the guidelines. These criteria required that the projects have a clear community education focusâ€”many applications contained a large service delivery focus rather than an educational oneâ€”and be state-wide or national in scope, that is, that they have a clear national potential.

         Tasmania was not successful with any of its projects in its application this year. That is not a measure taken against Tasmania, nor is it a measure taken against most of the other applicants who were also unsuccessful. It is a question of limited resources and making a choice between projects which meet all the criteria, demonstrate levels of excellence and have the widest capacity to extend that education campaign. As I said, it is no measure against Tasmania. Indeed, in the last round of grants, Tasmania was successful with three projects. There is no capacity to rethink or reallocate the dollars. I appreciate Tasmania's disappointment this time round but I would remind Senator Calvert that Tasmania successfully received three grants last time.

Employment in the audiovisual sector is estimated at 20,000; exports of film and television programs are estimated at $65 million; and the total value of goods produced and supplied is $3.4 billion, of which the film industry made up $690 million. So, even in this limited audiovisual sector of the industry, we have at least 20,000 jobs.

         Film in particular is an inherently labour intensive industry and, therefore, it has significant capacity to make a valuable contribution to employment. The cultural contribution is the most important aspect of the reason governments support arts organisations, the film industry and others. But it is important that we recognise its growing economic significance, and that is why governments continue to make assistance to nurture this sort of industry. The report states:

       <para>
        It is talking about the trends of technological change. That is why so much emphasis was given in the budget to increased support for the arts. Around 31 per cent of the total federal arts budget now goes to support the film industry. Just to indicate that this is not something in our region that is uniquely recognised by the Australian government, the Singapore Minister for Information and the Arts said:

        I think there is growing recognition in most parts of the world and in most parts of Australia, if not all together here, that there is growing economic significance in the arts. Austrade has identified audiovisual as an area of significant export potential. This report by the South Australian centre for the Film Commission, the department and the screen producers is very timely and very welcome. I commend it to members and others.

         â€”I think Senator Vanstone's question is a very important one. In the cause of protection of children from violence by both men and women, the government has established the National Child Protection Council. Earlier this year, that council produced the first ever national program for the protection of children from violence, which will allow the Commonwealth to negotiate with the states to make sure that, first of all, we extend community education about this matter.

         What we have learned from the violence against women campaign is that, as well as services of all sorts, what is very important is the need to change a community's attitude about what is acceptable. Although the community tends to give lip-service to opposing violence against children, there still is an unacceptable amount of violence against children occurring in our society. It is a matter of very serious import. The National Child Protection Council will be negotiating with the states. Negotiations are currently under way about the design of the implementation stage of that national program.

I assure Senator Vanstone that it is something that this government has a large amount of concern about.

One of the major concerns we face in this place is that quaint thing called Commonwealth-state relations. It is the states that are the principal deliverers of servicesâ€”services of matters of law, services of matters of health and services of matters of education. Where it is appropriate, what the Commonwealth has done is assume leadership. In this very important case it has assumed leadership and it has assumed a national perspective, because it realises that, despite the best intentions of states, sometimes the state prevention strategies are not sufficient.

        Today in question time I asked Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, when we would be likely to receive the government's response to the family law committee report. The answer Senator Bolkus gave, for those who did not hear it in its entirety, was `soon'. I think it was arrogant and petulant, and I think the Senate should condemn it absolutely. For the benefit of Senator Bolkus and this government, there is a convention in this place that the government respond to committee reports within 90 days. It is now over a year since this report was presented.

         The background to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act is a long and tortuous one. I first raised matters about the complaints my office received about five years ago. I initially sought to have a Senate select committee inquiry, but the government repeatedly told me that nothing was wrong with the Family Law Act and the family law system and that there had been sufficient reviews of the whole area of divorce in Australia.

         I enlisted the assistance of Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats. He and I got our heads together. We bashed them against a brick wall for a while, because the government would not listen to us. We persisted and, in December 1990, the government finally and reluctantly agreed to such an inquiry but insisted that it be a joint inquiry. The committee received a total of 1,031 submissions. That is why I am so interested and why the minister was arrogant in his reply today. He hardly rose to his feet to say that the government's response would be released soon. People throughout Australia are today continuing to write to every electorate office around Australia with complaints about the Family Law Act.

In my opinion, our 120 recommendations reflected a balanced, definitive analysis of the Family Law Act in Australia. It was a genuine attempt to assess the weaknesses in the present legislation and, I suggest, to offer appropriate and workable changes to the law.

         Let us reflect on what has happened in the 12 months since the report was presented to the parliament on 24 November 1992. In the intervening period there was an election. That meant that, for a time, the effective work of government was not proceeded with. Through an anomaly that occurred prior to the election, the election of the Attorney-General was delayed by over one month. There was a caretaker minister, Mr Kerr, but I think it was almost May before we had a portfolio minister directly in charge of and responsible for the Attorney-General's affairs. That obviously caused some delay in developing a response to what I consider to be a very good and worthwhile report.

         The report is receiving detailed consideration by all concerned. The government, when it responds to reports of the nature of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, does not just take the report and make decisions on its own. It tests those views with a number of bodies and organisations, including the Family Law Council and the Family Court. It seeks responses, and those responses are tested again and again.

         On reflection, I believe that the delay in responding to the report of the committee will probably be very beneficial. It is important that, in a major review of the Family Law Act, which has been in operation now for some 18 years, this time we get it right. My information is that there will be a response by the minister in the next two-week sitting of the Senate, and in a somewhat shorter time in the House of Representatives. I do not have a detailed date, as probably Minister Bolkus did not have a detailed date, to give in response to Senator Brownhill's question.

I do not expect that the government will agree to each and every one of those 120 recommendations, but I do hope each of them will have received the benefit of that 12-month period of deliberation on this aspect of the report. I welcome Senator Brownhill's raising the matter. It is not something that I, as the former chairman of the committee, had forgotten about. Indeed, I have been pressing the matter along and, while I have a concern about the delay, I hope the government has used that 12-month period to undertake a full and deep consideration of the report and that, when it does respond, it will give detailed consideration to the benefit of all Australians, not just those that end up before the Family Court of Australia.

        The issue I raised in question time could not be more serious. It raises grave doubts about the propriety of the Prime Minister of Australia. Yesterday the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) stated that the awarding of these fellowships, ironically known as the Keatings, `is resolved at arm's length from the government'. The Prime Minister's office is quoted in yesterday's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Courier-Mail

         I have been informed by the Australia Council that one Paul Keating attended the meeting in 1989 at which the fellowships were decided, including the first fellowship for Mr Tozer. Who was on the advisory panel, the recruitment of which was supervised by Mr Keating? Who were the music representatives? One was Mr Ross Gengos from Abels Music in Manuka, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister, the man who has the Prime Minister's ear over CD copyright. The Prime Minister opened Mr Gengos's record shop. Mr Gengos's Abels also produced a record titled `Geoffrey Tozer in Concert' in 1987.

They have to report back fortnightly. The farmers even have to be means tested. If necessary they must relocate in order to find a job.

They are discriminated against because of the means test limitation.

What Mr Black essentially said last night was that in the run-up to the last federal election, to be precise in January 1992, in a meeting at Kirribilli House, Mr Keating indicated that if the Fairfax newspapers were balanced in their coverage the Prime Minister would entertain an application from Mr Black to raise the foreign ownership limits from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. In the event, that actually occurred after the election. There was a bit of toing and froing. Mr Dawkins, as Treasurer, was opposed to it, but it happened.

         On the face of it, new lows were reached in Australian politics because for the first time Mr Black was alleging that a government had made a decision in relation to foreign ownership not on any national interest criteria but specifically at the request of a media proprietor. It is one thing to acknowledge that media proprietors would like to be more in control than they are at present, if they do not already have 100 per cent control, and there is nothing particularly unusual about Conrad Black pushing his case in the way that he did.

         The relevance of that is that Mr Black was also asserting that when he saw Mr Keating earlier this week he asked Mr Keating whether he was prepared to go higher. Mr Black said last night that we can never get too much of a good thing and, as far as he was concerned, he would like at least 50 per cent but certainly he would like somewhere between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. In other words, he was putting an ambit claim on the table.

         Mr Black had asked Mr Keating for his reading of what was feasible and how things looked. Mr Black said, `Mr Keating said that it would be premature to do anything at this point but that if I had some suggestions I should make them and he would be prepared to consider any suggestions'. In other words, Mr Black was again saying that the Prime Minister indicated his willingness to further increase the foreign ownership limit to accommodate Mr Black. Those are extraordinary allegations.

         We have just had a door-stop in Seattle by the Prime Minister in which he confirmed the accuracy of those reports. In many ways, I think he was boasting about it. His answers were breathtaking in their arrogance and amorality. When asked what he thought of the coverage of the Fairfax papers in the run-up to the last election, he said that he thought they were reasonable. We do not have to be too smart to work out what Mr Keating had in mind when he said that he wanted balanced coverage. That was code for saying that he expected that there would be little or no criticism of the ALP in general and himself in particular in the run-up to the last election.

Senator Schacht obviously has not heard what Mr Keating said in Seattle; Senator Schacht is a bit slow on the uptake. The proposition is that Mr Black said last night that Mr Keating said he wanted balanced coverage.

Mr Keating was asked whether he was prepared to entertain any further applications, and he said yes. He was asked, `Who are you to decide what is fair and accurate?

That is preposterous; it is shameless; it is unprincipled; it is utterly unscrupulous; and it is amoral.

         Senator Schacht seems to see nothing wrong with that; he has no greater concept of political morality than his leader. I thought the Left of the ALP stood for something. I thought the Left had principles and that it would have been out there arguing that foreign ownership debates should be conducted in accordance with the merits; that is, whether or not there was a need to increase the intake of foreign resources, technology, manpower, skills and expertiseâ€”all those very necessary characteristics. If they are available in abundance in Australia we do not need to increase the limits.

That is why I think it is outrageous that the Prime Minister is flaunting his approach in this manner. For example, last night Mr Black said that Mr Keating had not been endeavouring to influence the editorial position but was more concerned with the performance of journalists. Precisely!

          What Mr Keating knows, and Senator Schacht knows too, is that the odd bad editorial is something the government can live with. But it cannot liveâ€”it bleeds to deathâ€”if it gets a few bad headlines followed by some critical news pieces. That is what Mr Keating was on about; that is what he wanted fixed. Mr Keating was, to quote Conrad Black, more concerned with the performance of journalists. He says he is to be the arbiter of that; he is to make the judgment about whether they are doing the right thing by him, and whether he thinks their articles are balanced.

         Apart from anyone else, Fairfax journalists are compromised. What do we expect of them? Every time they write a story it will be judged by whether the Prime Minister thinks they are towing the line. If Mr Black wants to get an increase, he will have to be satisfied that his journalists are doing the right thing. Where does that leave one of the great institutions of this country? Where does it leave the freedom of the press and the integrity of journalists? It leaves them entirely under the submission of a Prime Minister who obviously does not have any idea of political morality or any idea of the national interest, and who thinks that he can impose his political will in the most shameless way.

         First of all, the Liberal Party feigns indignation about the so-called bias of the Fairfax press when, for 100 years, it was run by the Fairfax family and was basically a broadsheet for the Liberal Party in Australia. At the state level, the Fairfax press in Sydney for 100 years never supported the Labor Party. Apparently, in 1943, 1961 and sometimes in the 1980s, it supported the federal Labor Party editorially, but for 100-plus years in the history of the Labor Party, the Fairfax press was unswerving in its support for the Liberal Party. Of course, in those days it only took a quiet chat from a Liberal Prime Minister or leader to Sir Warwick or one of the other Fairfaxes to fix everything up; nothing was ever debated, but that was the way things were then.

         As to the actual accusations of bias, Senator Alston, in my view, has to point out where the bias was during the coverage of the election campaign: which journalists were compromised; which journalists did not write factually; which journalists bent stories to favour the Labor Party during the four-week campaign in February and March of this year. He has to put the case up, name the journalists, point the finger at them and say, `Your coverage in this election campaign was biased'. The Prime Minister spoke to Mr Black and said what everybody in Australia would say was quite a reasonable comment: `We would like to see unbiased coverage in the election campaign so everybody gets a fair go'.

         This is another case of the Liberal Party venting its spleen about losing the so-called unlosable election. Five times in a row the opposition thought it would win and five times in a row it lost. This is what the opposition cannot stomach.

         The feigned indignation on this issue from the other side, in view of 100 years of history in which the print media in this country always overwhelmingly supported the Liberal Party without shame and without any concern at all for balance, is really a bit rich. It is a bit rich for honourable senators opposite to start complaining now when there was no complaint at the time about the bias of journalists.

The nature of the response effectively rejected the need for either a taxpayers' bill of rights, as advocated by the Taxation Institute of Australia, or a charter of rights, as recommended by the recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, report No. 326.

        RE: THE ARGUMENTS FOR A TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have read press reports today that would indicate that members of the Government in the Senate are of the view that there is no pressing need for a taxpayer's bill of rights to formally protect the rights of taxpayers. The Taxation Institute does not agree with this contention. Rather, it is of the view that, with the pending extension of the self assessment system now is the most appropriate time to specifically legislate to protect and enshrine the rights of taxpayers and the duties and obligations of the ATO in administering taxing Acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator McMullan has stated that rights such as the right to be treated equally under the law, to object against an assessment, to rely on a private Ruling, to seek an explanation, to be represented, the right to privacy and to have documents remain confidential when they are prepared by a lawyer are all presently enshrined in the law. In some of the examples provided, there is some limited protection provided in the taxing Acts. However, it is submitted, that in many of the examples cited by Senator McMullan, "these rights are not clear, are not well understood by either taxpayers or the ATO and are limited in nature. Additionally, there are many examples of areas where there is little or no protection given to taxpayers, which should be the subject of specifically legislated rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For example, the right to object does not extend to a penalty of less than 20% of the tax payable. A specific right enabling a taxpayer to object and appeal against decisions made against them by the ATO in respect of actions taken during the course of an examination of their affairs or in respect of any determination of their liability to tax, would greatly extend a taxpayers rights in this regard.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The right of a taxpayer to obtain confidential information, should not be limited solely to information obtained from a lawyer. It should extend to advice obtained from any recognised adviser in respect to the tax affairs of the taxpayer. There is currently limited administrative recognition of this right. However, it is submitted that this right should be specifically enshrined in legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is currently a right for a taxpayer to be represented by a legal adviser. This was confirmed in Dunkel v DFCT 91 ATC 4142. However, taxpayers do not presently have a right to have a non legally qualified adviser present. This is obviously unsatisfactory since many taxpayers obtain tax advice from accountants and tax agents who are not otherwise legally qualified. Consequently, this right needs to be specifically expanded.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An example of a right which is not presently enshrined in the legislation is the right to reasonable certainty. This would mean that, where the law was unclear, a taxpayer would be given the benefit of the doubt. This was once an accepted rule of interpretation for taxing statutes. This right should operate to require a finding in a taxpayers favour if the law was so uncertain as to not enable a taxpayer to ascertain with reasonable certainty his or her liability with respect to particular activities engaged in or proposed to be engaged in.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is submitted that an important right which is not dealt with in any taxing statute is the right to expect equal treatment under the law and by the ATO. This, of course would not mean that a taxpayer's particular circumstances could not be taken into consideration. However, it would mean that all taxpayers would obtain equal treatment under the law, which is particularly important in relation to the exercise of discretions by the Commissioner. This would mean that a situation such as that which arose in David Jones Finance and Investments Pty Ltd v FCT 91 ATC 4315, would not arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are many other instances where there is a need to develop and formally recognise taxpayer's rights and the "Taxpayer's Bill of Rights" drafted by the Taxation Institute discusses many of these in some detail. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody in a speech to the National Institute of Accountants on 4 November 1993 referred to the need for the recognition of such rights. It is strongly submitted by the Taxation Institute that the only way such rights can be properly recognised is via a formal Taxpayer's Bill of Rights.

Mr Gardini's clientsâ€”honourable senators may rememberâ€”were formerly housekeepers at the Lodge who had had their employment terminated in a rather unsatisfactory manner. Their employment was terminated when they were phoned on a Sunday evening and told not to bother coming in to work on the Monday and that, if they did attempt to go in to work on the Monday, they would be turned away by the guards.

It says:

Because of the public airing of the circumstances of our dismissal we sought assurances from the Department that our service at the Lodge had been satisfactory so that we could seek alternative employment without having unsubstantiated allegations hanging over our heads.

         The important point is that there are provisions under the relevant act, but in the estimates committee public servants sought to make what appear to be wholly unsubstantiated allegations against the two housekeepersâ€”allegations which are not supported by the facts and certainly are not consistent with the issuing of certificates of service. In spite of these allegations having been made, under the privilege of the Senate, the government attempts to relyâ€”and the Prime Minister attempts to relyâ€”on the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. He is hiding behind the skirt of legislation which was intended for something completely different.

         At the same time, the Prime Minister has absolutely no qualms about having public servants come into an estimates committee hearing and attack the two housekeepers, who could not defend themselves, and make all these baseless allegations.

I am as infuriated as Mr Gardini is that the Prime Minister thinks that the appropriate way to deal with his domestic staff is to sack them in this fashionâ€”after all, staff deserve to be decently treatedâ€”to use public servants to malign them before a Senate estimates committee, to refuse to even give them the opportunity of having a reference, and to leave this hanging over their heads.
