         —This morning we are debating cognately two taxation Bills: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 2. Yesterday my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Short outlined the main points of the Bills. I intend to go through these Bills and address what I believe are the good points. I will also raise some of the concerns I have.

         I believe that, once again, the Government is just tinkering at the edges of the Australian taxation laws rather than getting around to finally doing a complete rewrite on them. If I have time towards the end of my delivery, I will mention a couple of comments of former Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, in this morning's press.

         The first point—I congratulate the Tax Office for fixing this up—is the capital gains tax amendment whereby property installed on crown leases is depreciable. Crown leases all around Australia have always been a problem not only with the depreciating of property, plant and installations but also with various other things. A lot of those concerns will be taken away by this measure.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The amendment seeks to amend capital gains tax provisions so that disposal of interest in plant erected on crown leases is treated consistently with the depreciation lease provisions. In other words, the build-up of interest will be treated in exactly the same way; depreciation will be treated on the same basis as are capital gains. The amendment seeks to prevent capital gains and losses from accruing in respect of plant installed on crown leases after the lease has terminated. This is to enable taxpayers to obtain depreciation for plant installed on crown leases. This is rather messy. I know for sure that plant has been depreciated on certain leases before, let alone crown leases, but the area has always remained grey for as long as I can remember. This amendment at least should put it into perspective.

         To date, any land on which there was depreciable plant had to be owned by the entity that was claiming the depreciation, whereas we could never say that that was the case with a crown lease. Notable industries that will be affected are the mining industry, probably the biggest user of crown leases; the pastoral industry; some primary industries; and small businesses in cases where they lease land. The sort of land that they lease in Western Australia that comes to mind is former railway land.

         Another provision deals with accrued leave. I welcome this amendment because under the present situation a deduction for accrued leave is not available unless it is actually paid out to the employee who is eligible for accrued leave. Of course, it then can be paid out only in the case of retirement, death or whatever. There are a lot of businesses sold on a walk in, walk out basis where a new owner takes everything over lock, stock and barrel and also takes on the employees who worked for the old employer. That part of the takeover or selling price of the business that took into account accrued leave was not then a deduction from the income of the person buying the business.

         Under the new provision, that part of the purchase price will be deductible—and so it should be, too. In the former situation, if the previous owner paid the employees out, and they did not want early payment—for various reasons they may not have been ready to retire—perhaps they would then have spent the money. So it is better for everybody all round, and the employers, the unions and the employees themselves all welcome it. I welcome the measure and I believe it is a victory for commonsense at last.

         The March or February statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to depreciation schedule broadbanding, and the figures for depreciation were brought back to virtually half. The new depreciation figures were 33 1/3  20, 15, 10, 7 1/2, 5 and 2 1/2 per cent.

         If the rate applying to a person then lay between the figures, the taxpayer had the right—and still has the right—to go to the next highest figure. Unfortunately, the legislation was not written properly—which happens quite often in the federal sphere, especially in the House of Representatives where there is virtually no scrutiny of Bills because of the guillotine and the limited time available for debate—and the provision was not very definite. So taxpayers are able to slip up to the next band, even if they were on the 20 per cent band, simply because of the way the legislation has been written. I do welcome that measure because it makes very definite where a taxpayer stands in relation to depreciation.

         The next point I would like to address is the definition affecting PAYE provisions in this Bill. The purpose of this amendment is to require PAYE provisions to cover training allowances payable under the landcare environmental programs. It also extends the definition affecting remuneration allowances provisions to cover members of local government bodies. This worries me a little because the whole elected council has to agree to bring the payments received by local government councillors into the provisions of PAYE. Councillors are almost like members of parliament; some are virtually full-time and they receive a fairly high remuneration. There are problems if there are no PAYE deductions, because towards the end of the year the councillors receive a large bill which causes quite a blimp in their cash flow.

         Of course I presume that, where local government councillors do get high remuneration and there are no PAYE deductions, they would come under the provisional tax provisions. I am not fully aware whether that has been the case but, for instance, if councillors were paid anywhere near what members of parliament are paid—and that is not very high, I can tell you; everyone knows that—I presume they would come under the provisional tax provisions.

         I ask the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) to advise in due course the implications for fringe benefits tax. In an employer-employee relationship PAYE provisions apply. From my past experience as a councillor, there were rulings from the Taxation Office to the effect that no employer-employee relationship existed between a council and its councillors. But once an employee becomes eligible to contribute PAYE deductions, then I presume that fringe benefits tax will apply.

         Does that mean then—as I am sure it will mean—that the meals provided at council meetings will come under the provisions of FBT?  I refer to the odd drink that hard working councillors have after a meeting—not towards the end of the meeting. The council that I belonged to was not one of those that opened the bar at lunchtime or afternoon teatime or anything like that. But hard working councillors are entitled to an odd drink towards the end of the day, so I presume that that will come under FBT, as will the odd end of the year function that councils have at which a few cigarettes are smoked. I presume that those things will come under FBT. In due course I would like the Minister to address the matter of the allowance that a councillor is paid, as well as a few other matters.

         To be fair to the Government, there is a provision to undo the PAYE connection with local government, should that be desired. However, the provisions require that there must be a full council decision to that effect. Once a full council decision has been made to introduce PAYE conditions, then that decision would be very hard to undo. I am not worried about the PAYE provisions if councillors are fairly highly paid. In my own local government experience, I used to get the princely sum of $3.32 per meeting to travel from the furthest distance of my constituency, which was about two kilometres from the council chambers. But for the ones who receive a high remuneration, I believe that it is a good measure. My concern is how far the FBT provisions will extend.

         Another welcome provision in this legislation allows an employee to apply to the commissioner for a special rate of deduction where the employee has more than one employer. This has been a sore point for a very long time for these employees. It may be the case that an employee works during the week and does part-time work over the weekend. This applies in the shearing industry to those who press wool or shear sheep—although the ones who shear sheep make enough during the week and they do not need it, but shedhands and others do work over the weekend. Of course, they have not been able to sign a rebate form because they have already lodged one with their employer during the week and then, of course, for any extra work that is done they are taxed at the highest rate. At the end of the day, after having all that tax taken out, they would say, `God'—I am a believer, so I will not say that. After having all that tax taken out, they say, `This job doesn't pay very much. I don't think I'll come next week'. I welcome that aspect of the legislation. I think once again it is a victory for commonsense.

         There is also a good capital gains tax rollover measure for transfer of assets between company groups.

No capital gains tax will be paid on the transactions in between. I welcome and applaud that measure.

I have only a limited knowledge of child-care issues as I am one of those who believe that child care should take place in the home, as happened in my time; but I will not get into that argument at this time, Madam Acting Deputy President.

         In the limited time that I have to speak, I would now like to draw attention to the reduction of company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Both Senator Watson and I commented on this at the time of the announcement by the Prime Minister. We hammered the press to raise the point that this is not as glossy as it seems on the surface, but the press did not take it up. When one goes into this further, the problems really emerge. However, I do believe that the reduction of company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent is a big advantage to companies to enable them to reinvest in and expand their companies. They can employ more people and buy more plant, with a build-up of the economy around a company. As far as that goes, it is good. Then the profits of the company are distributed. If a person is on a tax rate of 48c in the dollar, the Government will be collecting more tax. I know that the taxation authorities, in the explanatory memorandum, have admitted—

I think it has become quite well known that the complexity and the uncertainty within the taxation law make the law uncertain as a whole and, therefore, we are effectively reducing the major principle of the rule of law. I think it is not without significance that in looking at the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which are before us, we find that the second Bill has 58 pages and the explanatory memorandum has 116 pages. Continually we are enacting legislation which means that there is more confusion in the system.

         In addressing the question of reducing the corporate rate, at the outset I think we can say it is a pea and thimble trick. It is proposed by the Government as bringing down a universal benefit on all people who are subject to paying corporate tax. In fact, that is just not the case. Some people will be worse off; some people will be better off. But at the end of the day what offends me most is a point that was raised by my colleague Senator Watson yesterday, which deals with the fact that what we are doing is giving an advantage to foreign companies. When we put this legislation together with the double tax agreements we see that if an Australian company becomes the subject of a takeover bid, and another Australian company wants to use its investing powers to take over that company in competition with a foreign company with foreign investment, the foreign investors have an advantage because the returns that will flow to them make it more attractive for the foreign investors to be able to bid more for that company.

         This legislation has been touted—first during the election period and now that it has been brought into the Parliament—as supposedly being of benefit to Australians. I think others of my colleagues have made the point that because of the manner of the collection of the taxation we will literally get to the stage where Australian residents can be paying more tax but foreign investors are paying less. That is not my idea of making laws for the Australian people.

         The disparity between the top rate of personal tax and the reduced rate of corporate tax again raises the question of whether or not it becomes attractive for people to incorporate and use the lower rate. In a press release put out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia the point is made that many small business people looking forward to the promised tax cut in company rates from the present 39 per cent to 33 per cent for the 1993-94 tax year will be disappointed because under current Tax Office practice they will end up distributing the after tax profits after dividend imputation at full individual marginal tax rates. According to the New South Wales chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the general anti-tax avoidance rules prevent individual taxpayers alienating income from personal exemption.

         In other words, a further element of confusion is put into the tax system. The Government purports to say that it is passing laws in the interest of Australian citizens; it purports to say that there are universal benefits being bestowed when there are not; and we see this downright un-Australian advantage being given to foreign investors.

         With the disparity between the top marginal rate and the corporate rate, there is a general expectation that some people will seek to incorporate. Business has queried whether the Government might not consider the reactivation of the old division 7, at least in relation to private companies that do not earn the majority of their income from active businesses. A significant report from the Economic Planning Advisory Council suggests that the reduction of the company tax rate will only deliver marginal benefit to local firms. The reduction will mean that Australia will become one of the cheapest countries in the developed world for foreigners to invest in, which is the point that I made earlier.

         It is in the area of finance, tax and debt that the question of our independence as a nation is really relevant. By the year 2000 we will have an international debt of around $400 billion, largely because of the tax policy that this Government has pursued for the last 10 years. Because just over 60 per cent of all federal taxation revenue collected is personal income tax, we have seen a downgrading and a lessening of Australian savings. At the end of the day there are no savings against which Australian companies or individuals can borrow in order to expand or build new businesses. The result has been that we have had to go overseas to borrow other people's savings—hence the debt.

It is not our imports and exports that cause us great hardship. Over a 12-month period we export about as much as we import. We build that foreign debt every month because of the interest and dividend payments that we are obliged to make every month. On average, we are paying somewhere around 7.1 per cent on the money we are borrowing. Even the most optimistic figures published by the Government indicate that, of that gross international debt figure of $200 billion, about $86 billion is government sector debt on current figures.

Notwithstanding some of the later contributions, we have had a series of sensible and substantial contributions to the debate. In something of an economic treatise, Senator Short spoke more broadly about the economic and political implications. It is perfectly legitimate to do that in a second reading debate on a tax Bill, and he is entitled to make them.

I would like to take a bit of time on those that come under the general privacy heading. I understand the concerns that people raised there and, although there may be some things to be raised tomorrow, I think they are more of a second reading nature.

The concerns, as I understand it, principally relate to matters dealing with the migration information in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), although a little concern was also raised about any potential extension arising from the amendments relating to the Queensland CJC.

         Concern was expressed about the amendment relating to the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. I want to put on the record that there will not be any open-ended access. What we are talking about here is access to information only where the CJC satisfies the Commissioner of Taxation that the provision of information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been or is being committed, or to the making of a proceeds of crime order. So it has limited access and it is of the order which the Senate has approved in the past—in fact, which the Senate has quite actively sought in the past—with regard to other similar bodies. I think we do need to be consistent, and I am sure that that is in the main what people would intend and wish to do.

         A number of concerns were raised with regard to the company tax reduction. To the extent they were saying that this is not a cure for all ills, of course they were right. It is a beneficial move. Senator Panizza acknowledged that and expressed some support for it, but he also had some reservations about it. I do not want to oversell it and make people think that just by reducing company tax a magic wand appears and all sorts of economic ills disappear. That is not the case. But it is an economically beneficial move because it creates for some companies operating in Australia—depending on their profit and investment plans and other business situations—the opportunity to undertake new investment and to create more jobs. For that reason this change has been broadly welcomed. It would be inappropriate to oversell it, but I do not think the Government has tried to do that. This is part of a package of measures. More is needed. I suppose it is, in the conventional way of expressing things, necessary but not sufficient for solving all our economic ills. It is a step in the right direction and worthy of the support of the Senate.

         There was a disturbing attempt to imply that in some way these changes will be relatively adverse to the circumstance of Australian business. This was linked to questions about takeovers. The outcome relating to takeovers will depend on a whole range of factors. For example, an Australian company may distribute only part of its profits to shareholders. Where profits are retained for reinvestment, the tax rate on those profits will operate at this company tax level, and the marginal tax rate in the foreign country from which the company comes is, of course, also an independent factor in this. It is true that if a company has its origin in a country with lower taxes than ours, at the end of the day it pays lower taxes. As the corollary applies—particularly as a result of these changes—a company which has its headquarters in, and operates out of, a country with a higher tax base pays higher taxes. If that is the sum total of the point—which is very profound—it is true. But I do not want to pursue that.

To the best of my knowledge, that is clearly the case, and I do not think anybody making a resolution would be in any doubt that that is the case. If Senator Panizza wants me to check whether that is the understanding of the Minister, I would be happy to do that. To the best of my knowledge, that is not a matter of any contention.

         This Bill will extend to the three mobile telephone carriers—Telstra Corporation Ltd, Optus Mobile Pty Ltd and Vodafone Pty Ltd—the benefit of land access; that is, the ability to enter privately owned land in order to inspect, evaluate or construct telecommunications facilities for the provision of general telecommunications services. In short, this is a Bill which, if passed, we hope will strengthen and provide for true competition in the telecommunications area, an initiative which is very long overdue.

The Telecommunications Amendment Act 1993 seeks to redress that situation in that it will provide mobile carriers with the same statutory land access rights as are currently applied to the general carrier; that is, Telecom.

         For the Government to claim, however, that this Bill will support, in principle at least, a fairer and more competitive environment is a somewhat optimistic view, given the humbug which has been going on for almost all of this year with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), the Government and the department with regard to the pay television fiasco, and given the embarrassing situation in which the Minister has found himself in this place in recent weeks.

         Competition within the industry has hardly been the focus of the Government's telecommunications reform, as the Opposition has long witnessed. It is hardly a word that even exists in the Government's vocabulary when it comes to the real implementation of policy. This Government only discovered the word `competition' in recent times and is still trying to come to terms with its real meaning in terms of actually applying it in practical policy terms. It seems that under this Government telecommunications policy appears to be about inadequate departmental advice, interference, meddling and ministerial bungling.

         The Bill before us, however, does seek to provide Austel with the power to issue directions to carriers about compliance with the new obligations under the land access code, which will provide for procedures which must be followed by carriers relating to land, owners of land and occupiers of land. It will set down procedures for consultation between land owners, land occupiers and carriers in the event of a dispute or disagreement about a carrier exercising its land access powers. It will set up procedures for consultation between carriers to share facilities when new facilities are proposed in the vicinity of existing facilities.

         It is the intention of this Bill to safeguard the interests of property owners by introducing a land access code under which Austel may deal with any contravention. At least now, carriers who contravene directions will be subject to a strict enforcement regime. In past years Telecom as the sole carrier had unquestionably broad access rights over land access under the Act, and it is not unreasonable that the Government should be redressing them, reining them back somewhat.

         Carte blanche in this respect is no longer the preserve of Telecom, and the newer players in the industry will operate under identical arrangements. The Australian Telecommunications Authority will be provided with the power to issue written directions to carriers about how they are to comply with the land access code and to ensure that such directions are enforceable. Indeed, the obligations require the giving of reasonable written notice to the owner of the land and, in certain cases, to the owner and occupier of the land on which the carrier is intending to exercise its powers. This is timely because, in the past, arrangements between the carrier and the landowners or occupiers were somewhat different. In past years, although complaints concerning Telecom's access rights have been very few, the rights of land-holders or occupiers were virtually non-existent. Now landowners and occupiers will have much greater rights, and the restrictions will now be placed on carriers to meet these requirements when installations are made.

         Previously, if they were unhappy about Telecom activities, there was technically very little that land-holders could do. If they had genuine problems regarding, say, trees being pulled down, the installation of cables underground which may disturb their crops, or even with the ripping up of their land, they had very little leverage with which to negotiate. Understandably, that will now change with the passage of this legislation and the rights of landowners will therefore be re-established. As the Opposition therefore has no objections to this legislation, we support its passage through the chamber.

Just in recent days, it has become very fashionable to portray the Department of Transport and Communications as a department of scorched earth economic rationalist zealots that want to let her rip. That is in fact the view on everything by the Opposition. It wants an open skies aviation policy which I have described—

         —It is in the Fightback document—as outrageous. In other words, to hell with the interests of our own carriers, let us give away these extraordinarily valuable rights to the carriers from everywhere else and not protect the rights of our own Australian carriers. This scorched earth stuff is Opposition policy. The Opposition has the same policy with regard to telecommunications: let her rip. The problem about letting her rip in telecommunications, as far as I am concerned, is that the real result would be not more competition but less. The policy of the Government, effectively supported by the Department of Transport and Communications, is not scorched earth, the devil take the hindmost and the market rules—and properly so. To establish a mobile phone network takes an enormous amount of capital. We have to expend a very large amount of money—like pay television—before we get a dollar back.

         In my view—and I do not apologise for saying this—the competition which this Government with its sound policies is introducing into telecommunications has to be carefully managed. It is not a case of let her rip. We could get into the situation in which, if open slather were allowed in telecommunications rather than the careful approach that we are taking, the financial viability of the operators that are now effectively providing competition to Telecom could be undermined to such an extent that the final result could be less consumer benefit, not more.

         One of the things that the telecommunications and broadcasting industry was telling me for most of last year—and at the last ATUG conference that I went to this was said to me again and again during the evening—was, `We support fully the Government's changes in telecommunications. We support the establishment of the Spectrum Management Agency to handle the management of spectrum'. This all happened last year at the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Of course, those two agencies will manage all future tender processes for radio spectrum sales and broadcasting licences. Members of the industry also said, `We support the competition which has now been effectively provided to Telecom by Optus, and now by Vodafone in the mobile market. We support all of that'.

         It has been a very commendable record of public policy, but it is enough now. I have said publicly several times that I agree with that view. What the industry was telling me for six months last year was, `Look, we now need a period of consolidation in the communications side of this portfolio. We need a period in which industry can adjust to all these massive changes'. During this period the broadcasting industry can get used to dealing with the new ABA and the new broadcasting Act; all of these other agencies can find their feet, and Optus and Telecom and, eventually, Vodaphone can effectively work out their roles. Of course, that is currently happening and, I am pleased to say, getting a lot of public attention in respect of Optus and Telecom balloting for phone services.

        The proposed decreases in avgas occur in two stages. The first is effective from 7 May 1992 and the second decrease is effective from 19 August 1992. The decreases result from two sources. The first is from the Government's policy of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the aerodrome local ownership plan to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is from a reduction in Civil Aviation Authority costs.

        The resulting reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of decreases in the rate of excise duty to be paid on the avgas. This Bill proposes a total decrease of 2.1 cents per litre. A decrease of two cents per litre is attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. The other 0.1 cents per litre is attributable to the CAA achieving cost savings in the provision of its rescue and firefighting services. These cost savings result in a corresponding reduction to the proportion of excise duty used to fund that service.

The Government considers that the proposed increase is a responsible measure which adequately satisfies this balance.

        Both the decrease in the duty payable on avgas and the increase in duty payable on tobacco took effect last year pursuant to Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 and 2 of 1992.

Notwithstanding their lapsing, duty collections continued at the rates specified in the proposals and therefore this Bill proposes to validate those collections as well as incorporating Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1993 into the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

         —On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I indicate at the outset that as with the previous Bill, which dealt with a different subject, the Opposition will be supporting the passage of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1993. The Bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and seeks to validate duty collections pursuant to excise tariff proposals which lapsed following the dissolution of the Parliament earlier this year.

         The excise tariff proposals I have just mentioned provide for a reduction in excise duty on gasoline used in aircraft—that is, avgas—as well as an increase in the excise duty on tobacco and its products. In respect of avgas, it has already occurred in two stages with the blessing of this enabling legislation. The first stage was effective from 7 May 1992 and the second from 19 August 1992. As a result, the price of avgas falls by a total of 2.1c per litre. But not unlike petrol, as motorists would know, the cost of avgas varies according to location. For instance, in Canberra it is currently available at 89.9c a litre, which includes a 5c freight charge. In my home city of Adelaide it is available for about 84c a litre. Overall, the excise still represents about 30 per cent of the cost of a litre of avgas.

         Under the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992, the excise was reduced by about 1.02c per litre, from 26.4c per litre to 25.38c per litre. The reduction in excise has occurred because of the Government's promise—one of the few promises the Government has made that it is going to keep—to reduce excise duty, as the cost of providing the services to aircraft funded by that particular duty also falls.

         The total reduction has come about because of the 1990 transfer of federally owned aerodromes to full local ownership, and the encouragement of aerodrome owners receiving federal funding to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. So the Government is no longer responsible for the cost of maintaining and administering those aerodromes. It is also the result of savings achieved by the Civil Aviation Authority, following the removal of rescue and fire fighting services from secondary capital city airports. This move was supported both by the industry and by the Opposition.

         In respect of the increase in the excise on tobacco and tobacco products announced in the 1992 Budget, it is intended to address, in part at least, some of the social costs to the community of people's smoking. The excise increase will be $5 per kilogram, increasing the price from $52.50 to $57.50 per kilogram. Concerned though any government ought to be regarding the social costs of smoking, an unfair burden should not be placed on smokers by inappropriately inflating the cost of such products. Both these excise duties—that is, on avgas and tobacco—as I understand it, took effect last year pursuant to excise tariff proposals Nos 1 and 2 of 1992. Notwithstanding the lapse, collection of duties continued at the rate specified earlier. Hence, this Bill proposes the validation of those collections.

         Sadly, as far as light aircraft operators are concerned, what this Labor Government giveth with one hand it taketh away with the other. Unfortunately, the savings they will gain through reduced excise will be more than offset by the additional cost to general aviation engendered by the Government's proposed new airspace management system. Even more importantly, the new airspace system announced recently with great fanfare by the Civil Aviation Authority is fundamentally flawed and potentially dangerous. It is like no other system in the world.

         —I thank the Minister and I thank the Senate. If we look at the charts, it is clear that the original proposals put up for airspace had only minor differences, such as cloud separation requirements, from the International Civil Aviation Organisation's recommendations. Those proposals resulted in a simple, easy to learn, system. However, under the system now proposed by the Civil Aviation Authority the differences are major. These include unique and complicated radio procedures for visual flight rule aircraft in class E and class G airspace, thus negating the only reason for these classifications of International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace.

         There are more differences. First and most important, in the original plan an ATC service was to be provided to all instrument flight rule aircraft to ground level where traffic levels were high but would not justify a control tower. This is the system in both the United States and Canada, and the airspace is called class E. It is transparent to visual flight rule traffic and it is not as costly as the existing high level controllers providing the service, as the diagram shows.

         Under the new proposals this air traffic control service will stop at 5,000 feet in radar airspace and 10,000 feet in all other airspace, which covers about 80 per cent of Australian airspace. No other country in the world has such a system. The Civil Aviation Authority has invented a mandatory traffic advisory frequency procedure in an attempt to compensate for the lowering of safety. Unfortunately, this is an unproven system and completely at odds with the existing mandatory traffic advisory frequency where all instrument flight rule traffic is provided with flight service traffic information.

         This unique mandatory traffic advisory frequency procedure will be complicated and totally different to that applying in any country in the world, and effectively negates the whole reason for changing the airspace, which was to be harmonisation with best world practice. Australian pilots flying overseas and overseas pilots flying here will have to learn and adapt to totally different procedures. More importantly, the advanced Australian air traffic system equipment will now have to be designed for the unique Australian airspace system, resulting in potential huge cost blow-outs and delays in commissioning.

         Another major difference is the mandatory transponder or radio requirement for aircraft above 5,000 feet in en route radar space. This is not an International Civil Aviation Organisation recommendation, and again no other country in the world has shown it can afford such a restrictive and expensive requirement. In the United States, that requirement is now 10,000 feet; in Canada it is 12 1/2 thousand feet. This unique Australian requirement will cost up to $6 million and only affects general aviation aircraft, as airline aircraft already have transponders. As I said earlier, what the Government gives in one hand in reducing this avgas excise, it is taking away with the other with the additional costs it is imposing on light aircraft operators. If radio is used instead of a transponder, the cost will be even higher as air traffic control sectors will have to be smaller and visual flight rule aircraft will have to be charged for the service.

         No objective cost benefit study has been done for this transponder requirement, even though a comprehensive cost-benefit study has been done for closing down control towers, which, by strange coincidence, represents a cost saving to airline aircraft. Avgas powered aircraft pay the same whether there is a tower there or not—an across-the-board excise, as a result of this legislation, of a bit more than 25c per litre.

         Some thought must be given to what this system would do to air traffic controllers who are, of course, a very professional group. They are losing responsibility for providing safety services to passenger carrying airline aircraft that need and can afford an air traffic control system while they will be given extra responsibilities for large numbers of visual flight rule aircraft operating above 5,000 feet without a transponder. Even flight service no longer provides a service for these aircraft.

         The new system will place professional air traffic controllers in an almost impossible position, as they are to be given responsibility and therefore duty of care for visual flight rule aircraft, including gliders in class E airspace, without the internationally proven protection of the class D airspace procedures. One has to seriously question why we even bothered to move to the International Civil Aviation Organisation's separated instrument flight rule and visual flight rule cruising levels.

         The total injustice of this system is obvious. The airlines claim that, because they pay over 80 per cent of the Civil Aviation Authority's income, they should have most of the say. They have used this clout to bring in procedures which reduce safety to airline passengers but save the airlines many millions of dollars, while forcing additional and onerous requirements and costs on general aviation. However, in the long run, the airlines will probably end up with less safety and higher costs as they will no longer have a thriving general aviation industry from which they can draw a pool of experienced pilots.

         The board of the Civil Aviation Authority has failed to obtain independent, professional advice on these issues—for example, by speaking to North American experts—before making a final board decision on airspace design. Instead, it has accepted the recommendations of the Civil Aviation Authority management. Apparently, Civil Aviation Authority management regards the proposals as not a significant departure from internationally accepted practice. But no country in the world, including Australia, has ever put in place the proposed system of airline traffic, operating into airports such as at Yulara or Cooma, without a traffic separation or information service being provided on other instrument flight rule aircraft.

         The Civil Aviation Authority management has wrongly claimed that this is the practice in Canada. That is clearly not the case, as Canada has yet to move to International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace. However, in its current airspace, which is similar to our proposed class G, airline traffic is provided with a traffic information service from remote VHF outlets and local flight service stations on frequency 126.7. This is completely different from what is being introduced in Australia.

         The Civil Aviation Authority has also wrongly claimed that Canada has a similar system to our mandatory traffic advisory frequency.

The reason a ground station must be present for mandatory frequency requirements is for fundamental safety reasons.

         Civil Aviation Authority management claims that the North American system of class E airspace would cost up to $30 million per annum to implement in Australia. That is completely unjustified and incorrect as a claim, and shows a clear lack of understanding of the criteria used in the North American system. These criteria are based on objective traffic densities and risk modelling. If the same criteria were used in Australia it would mean only class E airspace to ground level at a small number of busy airports with airline traffic but with insufficient traffic density to justify a control tower. This is, of course, as was originally planned by John Wright's team. There would be a cost, but this could be fully justified under the application of objective safety criteria.

         Under the proposed potentially dangerous system, airline traffic will be largely on its own below 5,000 feet in radar airspace and below 10,000 feet in other airspace. This means that large aircraft such 737s going into Yulara or the F28 jets that fly into Cooma—we need to remember that Cooma can be subject to bad weather conditions—will not be provided with traffic or separation services on all other instrument flight rule traffic. This is totally unacceptable, and it is unfortunate that we will probably have to wait for a serious incident or accident before the merit of fully adopting the proven international system is driven home.

         Under the original John Wright plan the International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace was not to have been introduced until July 1994. The Civil Aviation Authority claims to have industry support for its new airspace system. This may appear to be the case only because the Civil Aviation Authority has convinced industry that the proposed system is based on proven international practice. As I have just indicated, that is clearly not the case. Senior air traffic controllers who have been involved in the development of the airspace proposals and the chief pilots of a number of regional airlines are totally opposed to the parts of the proposals that are unique to Australia and that are as yet unproven.

The team that the Civil Aviation Authority has put together for the airspace system project is made up of pilots and Civil Aviation Authority management with no training in the complex job of objective risk analysis of airspace design. Designing an airspace system is just as complex and specialised a task as designing the aircraft that use the airspace—a task that no-one would contemplate leaving to pilots.

         The proposed system is fundamentally flawed and potentially dangerous. Therefore, the CAA board, the Department of Transport and Communications and the Minister are personally responsible if this system is introduced, because they have failed to obtain proper independent expert advice before accepting the proposals. Only yesterday we saw the Minister profess ignorance of all these matters in answer to a question I put to him during Senate Question Time. Again it is clear that Minister Collins is failing on too many fronts to exercise appropriate authority or control over his Department of Transport and Communications, and thereby allowing it to run its own agenda, whether that be pay television, aviation or whatever comes next. While passage should not be denied to this particular piece of legislation, the time has well and truly passed when this Minister should stand aside.

         The price of avgas will fall by a total of 2.1c per litre as a consequence of this Bill. The reduction in the price of avgas can be separated into two separate components. First, there is a 2c per litre reduction which is attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. This program involves transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the aerodrome local ownership plan to accept full responsibility for their aerodromes.

This has been implemented after a comprehensive consultative process which was carried out with the aviation industry, local authorities and the Federal Airports Corporation. Nevertheless, the Australian Democrats wish to ensure that the results of this cost cutting measure are monitored so that the rescue and firefighting services are not diminished at these airports.

        The National Road Transport Commission was set up initially to make recommendations regarding uniform registration rates for heavy transport vehicles because, quite frankly, the situation was chaotic, with each State and Territory having its own regulations and charges, making the whole heavy transport industry a nightmare. In June and August 1992 all States except New South Wales and Western Australia accepted the determination of the National Road Transport Commission regarding the implementation of annual registration charges for vehicles rated over and above 4 1/2 tonnes as well as permit charges for vehicles operating above 125 tonnes.

        The Liberal and National parties have long battled with this Government over the question of inefficiencies in the heavy transport road sector with respect to fuel and registration charges. So this legislation is at least a move in the right direction. The arrival of a consistent set of registration charges throughout all the States and Territories of Australia to overcome the flights of registration from States of ownership to States which have lower charges is a constructive point from which to move forward. The industry, as represented by the Road Transport Forum, supports the principles of this Bill and the charges in the Bill as proposed by the National Road Transport Commission.

Hundreds of those involved at all levels of the industry came forward in discussions to put their strong view, and this was appreciated by the commission. The commission had a solid and dependable rapport with industry right across Australia. It is my belief that the entire process was a valuable exercise both for government and for industry groups. These measures represent much needed and long overdue reform for the heavy vehicle industry in Australia. For too long, inefficiencies with respect to road user charges have contributed to inefficiencies throughout the entire industry and throughout the entire country.

        This legislation applies to the Australian Capital Territory alone. It does not affect any existing registration scheme in operation in the ACT other than to fix the charges to be collected when a vehicle covered by the Bill is registered. Registration exemptions or concessional charges will continue to be a matter for the ACT itself to determine. The charges do not include, nor does the schedule preclude, the fixing of fees for administration and other services provided by the ACT. In effect, this Bill pioneers national regulation of the road transport industry in Australia. It is but the first step in establishing necessary uniform regulation right across the country, including uniform loadings and general regulations.

        It is interesting to note the variations which have applied to registration charges in the past, variations which of course will be removed by this legislation. For example, a six-axle semitrailer—that is, a prime mover with bogie drive and a tri-axle—is currently charged the following rates: in Queensland, $3,280; in New South Wales, $5,870 and in fact up to $8,000 in some circumstances; and in the Northern Territory, just $430. It is clearly ludicrous to have such massive variations in registration charges across this nation. Under the National Road Transport Commission proposals incorporated in this legislation a six-axle semitrailer would attract a registration charge of $4,000 anywhere in Australia.

        There has been some controversy with regard to the introduction of these charges. That controversy was such that it was necessary for the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure—which, sadly, no longer exists in its own right as a result of this Government's determination to reduce adequate parliamentary scrutiny of issues and legislation but has been combined with the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and henceforward will be a very overworked committee—to take up a very detailed inquiry into the impact of uniform road user charges, particularly on rural and isolated areas of Australia. Of course, that inquiry confirmed what we all knew—that the road transport industry in Australia is the highest taxed industry in this country. Currently, a six-wheeler truck for each 120,000 kilometres that it travels is taxed in total at a rate of some $44,000.

        We also need to recognise that a major cause of the excessive taxation on this industry is the dramatic increase in fuel excise that has occurred since this Government came to office in 1983. It has risen from 6c per litre to 26c per litre. This has taken total collection of fuel excise to some $7 billion—but, sadly, only $1.2 billion of that $7 billion goes back into road funding. That is a parlous situation for a country which is so heavily dependent on road transport for the production and distribution of its goods and for its wealth creation. When this Government came to office, about 80 per cent of fuel excise went into road funding; now it is down to something less than 25 per cent.

        During the election campaign we saw yet another part of the Government's dishonest attack on coalition's policies; that is, the suggestion that road transport would in fact be charged more under a coalition government, notwithstanding the fact that we had made a firm commitment to abolish fuel excise and completely get rid of that 26c a litre that is charged not only on road transport operators but on all vehicle operators, including motorists. That would have represented a substantial saving to road transport in this country. Our further commitment was that there would be no additional road user charges levied on the industry other than that being put in place by this legislation—the uniform road user charges that this Government had already introduced on the recommendation of the National Road Transport Commission.

We also heard claims made by Labor Party candidates not only that there would be additional road user charges for the road transport industry but also that private motorists would be hit by increased registration charges initiated by State governments as a result of the loss of revenue from the fuel excise.

        But of course the fact is that that revenue does not in any way provide the States with funds for roads.

        I just raise that matter to highlight again the dishonest way in which the Labor Party campaigned during the last election. It is absolutely essential that a review of the costs of these new charges be undertaken by the Federal Government, and in particular by the National Road Transport Commission, to ensure that there is equity in the impact of the charges—firstly to make sure that the road transport industry in toto does not continue to pay a much greater level of taxation than is paid by other industry sectors, and, secondly, to ensure that regional, isolated and rural areas are not paying more than their fair share of the costs of taxation on the road transport industry because of the additional cost to freight that these charges and levels of taxation cause.

With those remarks, I conclude and simply indicate the coalition's support for the legislation.

         —by leave—In response to a return to order of the Senate to table documents by 12 o'clock today, I advise the Senate that those documents cannot be provided to the Senate today for this reason: the Pearce report, which was due to have been tabled in the Senate on Monday—that is, four days hence—as a result of urgent requests from all honourable senators to have it earlier, has in fact been produced and will be available to the Senate I hope within the next hour at the latest. The report has been completed and was printed this morning. I am simply waiting now for copies of the tabling statement to be printed with it. As soon as I have both of those documents, I will table the Pearce report. For that reason, I did ask officers of my department to concentrate on getting the Pearce report into this Parliament four days ahead of schedule—that is, today. I think they have done a herculean job. As we say, the impossible we do today, the miracles take a little longer.

         I just advise the Senate briefly what will be happening with the MDS papers. I am indebted to Senator Alston for narrowing the focus of these papers. As I indicated to the Senate last night, there were 113,000 pages of documentation broadly identified as being covered by the original request. I am now told that Senator Alston's motion has narrowed that down to hundreds, rather than thousands, of pages. Work is commencing on that. Mr Hutchinson of the department is preparing a report on the MDS papers, and in fact I am grateful to the ANU for allowing Professor Pearce some further time to work on this next week.

         It is preposterous for Senator Collins to come in here and now refuse to comply with the order of the Senate yesterday. I do not for a moment accept that there is any difficulty in his doing that, at least in part and, indeed, I would say in whole. There cannot be very many pieces of advice. His whole defence in this matter seems to have been, `Hell, why should I have thought of that? This is arcane legal nonsense', or, `There I was sitting up in Darwin on 19 January and staff were on leave and I did not think of doing this, that and the other'. I suspect that there was precious little advice that he got or asked for. Yet here he is having the cheek to say to the Senate that he really cannot comply at all with that request to which he did not object. That is treating the process with contempt. That is making it abundantly obvious that he is not fair dinkum about trying to face up to his own responsibilities.

         —I am simply saying that if the Minister went along to see Professor Pearce and went to great lengths to tell the professor how good he had been, Professor Pearce may well take the view, and should, that any self-justification is irrelevant because his terms of reference confine him to passing judgment on the department. Therefore, it is outrageous for the Minister to suggest that his undertaking to the estimates committee does not require him to table every piece of paper, including the transcript. This process will be a farce—it is no fault of Professor Pearce—if the Minister chooses not to table the transcript. If the Minister chooses not to table every relevant piece of paper it will be his decision alone, taken for political purposes to cover his ample hide. It will certainly, I think, contaminate the whole process. It will bring Professor Pearce's name into needless controversy, and it will ensure that the Minister remains the focus, as he deserves to be.

Let me simply say that the Minister has not provided any reason at all why he is deliberately and flagrantly disobeying the order of the Senate, to which he did not object yesterday. He has not in any shape or form tried to explain why he is not able to table at least some of the documents. I would not accept that that is sufficient. He ought at the very least to know how many documents there are and what they are. He ought to have been able to tell us that before midday. The Minister is deliberately refraining from cooperating with the expressed wish of the Senate. He is clearly wanting to be as protective of his own hide as possible. He is not wanting to provide the documents that will enable the Senate to pass judgment on his responsibility. Once again he is wanting to hide behind a report that he has commissioned and whose terms of reference are limited to the activities of bureaucrats. We know he has been desperate to try to blame the bureaucrats from day one, when he is not busy blaming the Opposition, the Senate, the media, or anyone else.

         His main game has been to try to shaft the bureaucracy. That is understandable when he is not prepared to face up to his own responsibilities, but it is outrageous for him to somehow pretend that the Pearce report, in the form in which it appears, without all the documentation, somehow addresses the issues of concern. It simply does not. The Minister will be hounded until he fully complies with the request.

         —I want to add a few words to those of my colleague Senator Alston because it seems to me that clearly two separate issues are being confused, I suspect deliberately, by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins). Whatever the motive, they are clearly being confused. One issue is a course of action that the Minister has adopted in relation to both the satellite fiasco and the confusion over the MDS process, that is, the reports he is seeking independently from Professor Pearce. With regard to the one he sought in relation to the satellite process, he said that it would be tabled sometime today, and he has indicated to me that he expects two documents to be tabled with that. Also, we now understand a further report will be done in due course by Professor Pearce in relation to the other process, which report will be apparently a review of a review of the process that is going to be undertaken internally by Mr Hutchinson. No doubt they will be interesting documents, but whether they will go to the core of the problems is unclear.

         As my colleague Senator Alston said, the first Pearce inquiry that the Minister instituted seems to be quite limited in its terms of reference. That is one issue; that is the step that the Minister and the Government decided to take. He has said that those documents will be tabled, and that one will be tabled today. That is separate and distinct from the issue, which is the issue that this Senate should address as of midday today—the obligation that the Senate imposed upon the Minister to table certain documents before the Senate at midday of this day. That is part of our responsibility of accountability.

         When I look back upon experiences of recent times, for example, a similar order that we imposed on Senator Evans in relation to the Marshall Islands affair last year, there were all sorts of protests about how difficult it would be and so forth. But Senator Evans, to give him credit, tabled the documents. There were some parts that he preferred not to, and they were whited out. We had discussions and it was handled in a proper way because they were sensitive to individual interests and so forth.

He was not at all happy with that; nevertheless, he accepted his obligation to comply with the order of the Senate, as all Ministers should be prepared to if we are going to have a decent system of accountability within our democratic structures. He complied with the order also. This Minister has failed to comply with the order of the Senate which was made yesterday:

        What I, as one senator, want to know is why the Minister is failing to comply with this order of the Senate. If he gets up—he is going to contribute further in this debate—and says, `I regret that I had insufficient time to put the MDS stuff together', that will be an argument that we will consider in good faith. I will be amazed if he has got the nerve to say, `I have had insufficient time to put the satellite material together', because clearly he and his department have been putting that stuff together now for weeks, and had to put it together for the purposes of the independent inquiry that he set up. In those circumstances, I ask that the question of the Pearce report be put to one side and that the Senate address why this Minister is deliberately breaching an order of the Senate that was passed yesterday.

         But I will put the record straight now. When the original request was made for MDS documents I told Senator Alston that because of the all-embracing nature of the request the department had identified potentially in excess of 113,000 pages of material. Senator Alston said, `Fine. I'll work on narrowing down that focus', which he did and I thanked him for it. Mr Hutchinson of the department has told me in broad terms that this has narrowed the focus down from thousands to potentially hundreds of pieces of paper, and that is helpful.

It has been a hell of a job, quite frankly, for all of these documents to be perused and for Professor Pearce to not only examine them but also examine officers, write a report and bring it down before the Senate gets up. I undertook that I would have the document in the hands of the Senate by the 25th of this month—next Tuesday. Senator Alston knows about this. I was told by my department, on advice from Professor Pearce, that that was the tightest time in which he thought he could do a responsible job.

I had 10 years in opposition. If one needs more than four days to do a job, then one should hand one's pay cheque back after a fortnight. But Senator Alston did not dispute that. I said, `That will give you Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday—four full days—to examine it'. I further gave an undertaking that it would be in the House at the beginning of the sitting on Monday—not at the end of it, or the night.

I refer to the little stunt Senator Alston pulled on yesterday afternoon about my alleged lack of communication with my departmental secretary. I will canvass that now, too. I had a meeting with Mr Evans in response to this request from the Australian Democrats and Senator Alston to get the Pearce report in the chamber four days ahead of when I had promised. I told the honourable senator all about this yesterday, and he knows it. I met with Mr Evans at about one o'clock yesterday afternoon and I said, `What I want you to do is to separate out your part of the report.

He had also forgotten that Senator Bourne was present at that meeting. I will tell you what: as I said yesterday, I have nothing to fear from this Senate because I have done nothing for the last three weeks except come in and tell the truth. But if you do not tell the truth, I will tell you the thing you have to have—a good memory to go with it. Senator Alston has not. That is his problem. After 15 minutes of argument I went to get briefed on the Aboriginal affairs Bills—just remember what I was doing yesterday afternoon—so I could take them through the Senate.

         In all this time, I had not gone back to my office—I did not have time to, did not have a chance to pick up a phone. In fact, I had staff running around with briefings on the Aboriginal affairs Bills that went through yesterday. I went back to my office. I did not get there. I was met in the corridor by the staffer who was sitting in this chamber, who said, `Senator Tambling is speaking. The debate is on now. Here are your papers. You have got to go back into the Senate'. I came back into the Senate and spent the rest of yesterday afternoon taking those two Bills through the Senate. I got back to my office at 6 o'clock, and the Pearce report was waiting there at 6 o'clock.

I know that I did not, because what I have said is exactly what happened yesterday afternoon. What Senator Alston has not bothered to tell the chamber is that I agreed to narrow the focus down to these documents on the understanding—which he tried to deny yesterday—that I had brought the Pearce report forward a full 24 hours and was going to table it on Monday.

         I want to say a few words about Professor Pearce, because I can see where the focus is shifting now—and it is outrageous. Senator Alston should keep it on me. I will tell honourable senators something about Professor Pearce. I refer them to what Senator Michael Baume had to say in this chamber last week about Professor Pearce, and I will table a paper in relation to that. Senator Baume is not bad at throwing abuse, as I am, at the best of times, but Senator Baume gave one of the fairer versions. Senator Baume said—look in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         —that Professor Pearce is noted as the outstanding expert on administrative law in Australia. But the one concern that Senator Baume raised—and it was valid—was that he acts as a legal consultant, which he does, to a private firm which may have an interest in the contract matter. That is a serious issue, and I took it up immediately. I will table a letter to Jack Lake from the head of my department, who discussed this with Professor Pearce and pointed out the obvious. Frankly, when Senator Baume reads this letter I am sure he will accept it.

         Professor Pearce said, `Yes, I do act as legal consultant to a private company but that is not relevant. There is no conflict of interest, because I am investigating'—as the report will clearly show in a minute—`a problem of a failure of process in the department which has nothing whatever to do with any commercial interests of any company'. I table this letter now. So if the one concern that Senator Baume had is removed we are left with Senator Baume's statement—and it is correct—that Professor Pearce is what everyone acknowledges him to be: one of the outstanding experts on administrative law in Australia. Senator Baume is right about that.

         The one thing I said to this former Minister who is a lawyer and now a backbencher was, `One of the main reasons I was delighted with Professor Pearce's appointment is that he is an outstanding legal academic—and the one thing I do know about academics of all kinds, but legal academics, is that they are very jealous of their reputations. And I do know that there is no way he will put his name on a report which is not a scrupulous representation of the facts'.

         I will finish on the one point of what I said to Senator Hill. What did I say to Senator Hill to tell Senator Alston about the two documents tabled? He should read the report first before he leaps to judgment. As he will see, in the body of the report is a statement from Professor Pearce that he examined all of the relevant documents. There was no let or hindrance to him—he saw the lot. The reason that he has brought in only two, so he is not going to bury us with paper, is that in his judgment—and I will defer to it—those two papers, the two documents, are the only documents that he considers, having looked at all the rest, are relevant.

As I said two weeks ago, even a telephone call generates a file note. Professor Pearce saw the lot. But I knew what I had seen: only two documents. Professor Pearce has now discovered that the two documents only that I had been telling the Senate for three weeks I saw are the only two documents that exist.

I think it is very difficult for people to make decisions based on second-hand versions of who said what to whom when and who recollects what about what was said. This is a very unsatisfactory way to conduct a very important debate. I think we should revert to being much more disciplined about putting things in writing and making statements on the record in this chamber. I think that would make the debate on this very important matter much more helpful.

It seems to me, from what has been said today, that Senator Collins's purpose in taking us outside the chamber was to somehow override that clear order of the Senate. What he said today is that, in his view, because of the exigencies of Pearce, he is somehow absolved from complying with a solemn order of the Senate.

That is precisely the point. He agrees to table documents, then, for his own purposes, for other reasons—he says Pearce—he does not comply. The Minister has not advanced one reason why he is unable to comply with that request. The only mention he made of it was that the department tells him it has narrowed down that request to hundreds of pages. He has made no attempt to table any of those pages, and no attempt to argue that somehow it has been too difficult for him to comply. He has simply ignored that order of the Senate. He has flouted the requirement. He ought to give the game away.

        I say for the benefit of the House that I did have the courtesy to speak to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) about this, and indicated what I thought was a manageable way of handling the debate, now that I have got it in here before Question Time. It was that I would speak on it as soon as I could and table it; that someone would adjourn the debate, which would give the Opposition the chance to read it; and that negotiations, as they normally do, would take place between the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and the Manager of Opposition Business about bringing the debate on at whatever time is convenient to both the Opposition and the Government.

         The written statement touches upon the key issues in this matter. I have just explained, again, what I explained to Senator Hill half an hour ago, in full: that I will table the report; that I will make a statement on it; that it would be reasonable for someone then to adjourn the debate, having spoken to my motion to take note of the report; and then the Opposition can bring the debate on later, whenever it wants to—today, if it wants to—having read the report. That is not an unreasonable process. I have now tabled it.

After the conclusion of that matter, on the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition for the adjournment of the debate, leave was granted by the chamber for the Minister, Senator Collins, to table the Pearce report and make a tabling statement.

The second is that a Minister has committed some gross personal impropriety, either inside or outside Parliament. I talked to Senator Michael Baume about this the other day. He would agree that history seems to indicate that that is either corporate or sexual impropriety. It would include such things as a Minister sleeping with a Russian spy—or perhaps kissing Senator Bishop on national television. The third ground, which is very important, is that a Minister has misled the Parliament. In my view, if he has misled the Parliament, he should resign instantly.

It constituted Japan's first major setback after Pearl Harbour, it saved Port Moresby from a combined land and sea attack, and it ensured the safety of Australia from potential invasion.

          Last year, on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, celebrations were conducted all over Australia, and major celebrations were held in Townsville and Cairns in North Queensland. In the delightful little seaside town of Cardwell, situated approximately halfway between Townsville and Cairns, the townsfolk many years ago decided to establish a lasting memorial to those who participated in the Coral Sea Battle. Cardwell is situated on the shores of Rockingham Bay, where the Coral Sea touches mainland Australia. It was approximately 500 miles due east of Cardwell that the Battle of the Coral Sea took place in 1942.

          I am concerned at reports that the Federal Government is about to scale back the role of the Anton Breinl Centre for Tropical Health and Medicine, which is based at James Cook University in Townsville. Some $500,000 in general funding for research into tropical disease and training of people in public health may now be withdrawn from the centre in favour of a planned expansion of facilities in Brisbane. The director of the centre has said that such a funding cutback would mean a serious down scaling in research and a 50 per cent reduction in staff numbers.

          A working party on public health development established by the Government has apparently recommended that major public health research and education facilities be limited to one per State and, further, that a national centre for international and tropical health, incorporating Aboriginal health, be established. The working party has recommended that this national centre be located in Brisbane. The recommendations largely ignored the contributions and existing facility of the Anton Breinl centre. The Anton Breinl centre's role may be greatly eroded under this proposed plan.

          It will come as no surprise to those of us from the north to learn that the working party included no-one from northern Australia.

Meliodosis, another example, is a lethal and little understood tropical disease which, in the last proper wet season, claimed a number of lives in North and Far North Queensland. The disease is particularly savage, claiming its victims with little warning—in a matter of days. This disease, the bacteria of which reside in the soil, is most dangerous during wet weather. It is only thanks to the drought that this disease has not caused more deaths over the last two years. Ross River fever is another debilitating tropical disease which needs much more research. The Anton Breinl centre has been heavily involved in vital work on all of these diseases.

          In the field of education the centre plays a very important role through its courses for over 100 graduate students in public health and tropical medicine at diploma, masters and PhD levels. I am advised by the centre that some 20 per cent of the students at the college are from Aboriginal and Islander communities, and that there is a special focus on Aboriginal health, which I think is very important.

          I am somewhat surprised that the Labor member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, has not lifted a finger in the last week since the prospect of funding cutbacks has been raised. I would have thought that Mr Lindsay, as the member for one of the northern seats, would, like me, be getting behind the Anton Breinl centre. In 1991, Mr Lindsay told Parliament:

        <para>
         So I have been very surprised that Mr Lindsay has been silent in response to the concerns expressed by the Anton Breinl centre. I understand that the Anton Breinl centre is today delivering a submission to the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, in the hope that cutbacks in funding and an erosion of the role of the centre can be averted. The submission seeks an expansion in support from the Commonwealth from 1995, when the current funding contract expires, which would include work at the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin. I know Senator Richardson has met in recent days with the director of the centre, Professor Wronski, and I would urge Senator Richardson to reconsider the recommendations of the working party, to ensure that the role of the Anton Breinl centre is expanded rather than scaled back, and to make sure that the special needs of northern Australia are not overlooked, yet again, by this Government.

         —As honourable senators will be aware, there have been many issues regarding pay TV which have been extensively canvassed in this chamber over the last two weeks or so—indeed, over the last two or three hours. I will not traverse the ground which has already been covered. However, an issue has emerged which, I believe, is of great interest to Victorians. Specifically, when all these matters are finally resolved, where will the ABC pay TV headquarters be located? This is no trivial issue; some 240 jobs are at stake.

         Indeed, the acting Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Conroy, advised the Senate estimates committee hearing last week that it was estimated there might be 100 jobs on a pay TV news channel, and up to 140 jobs on a second channel which would be a children's channel with an arts component and a documentary component. In addition, Mr Conroy emphasised the stimulatory effect which pay TV will have and its potential for providing significant knock-on effects to other sectors of the industry. Indeed, I believe these knock-on effects will lead to a multiplier impact and will result in a very significant boost in jobs for people such as actors and producers, and production houses and industries generally affiliated with the television industry. It will provide major career opportunities for the media in Melbourne, particularly the men and women employed by the ABC who, very sensibly, prefer to live in Melbourne.

         The location of the ABC's pay TV headquarters and production facilities is currently under consideration by the management and board of the ABC. It appears that the two locations being actively considered are Melbourne and Sydney. There is no technical reason why ABC pay TV should not be based in Melbourne. At a Senate estimates hearing, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, perhaps reflecting the interests of the Northern Territory, said:

         The ABC TV budget totals some $360 million. It is collected, as honourable senators will be aware, from taxpayers all around Australia. The ABC spends some 70 per cent of this TV budget in New South Wales, yet only 34 per cent of the population of Australia live in that State. I simply do not believe that this concentration of ABC activities in one capital city can be justified. Whatever the historical reasons for concentrating activities in Sydney, modern technology has opened up the opportunity for a major decentralisation of ABC activity. It is also worth noting that the other public broadcaster—the Special Broadcasting Service—has also concentrated its activities in Sydney. Melbourne has excellent facilities and staff resources on which to base this major new ABC venture. I urge the ABC board to take this opportunity to demonstrate that the excessive concentration of ABC activity in Sydney is coming to an end.

         The article tells an extraordinary story of events regarding the immigration to Australia of a person who was allegedly involved in the imprisonment, and possibly later death, of a Mr Istvan Somogyi in Hungary in the mid-1950s. Istvan Somogyi's wife—now Mrs Magda Bardy—migrated to Australia with her son in the second half of the 1950s. She and her first husband, Istvan Somogyi, had been imprisoned in Kistarcsa in 1951 during the Stalinist period by the Hungarian secret police, the AVH. Mrs Bardy served 2 1/2 years in gaol. On her release, she found that her husband had died in prison as a result of torture.

         Since the collapse of the communist regime in Hungary in 1989 Mrs Bardy has been searching Hungarian records to track the fate of her first husband. Through her investigations she has learned that the person who signed the orders for her internment and the internment of her husband probably migrated to Australia, and has been living in Sydney since 1957, just a few kilometres from where Mrs Bardy lives. She found her husband's arrest document was signed by a person called Tibor Vajda by order of the head of the secret service. His crime was that her husband `was aware of smuggling of people and goods and provided a hand in these', and his internment was `for state security reasons'.

         The same Tibor Vajda was one of the many post-war communist hardliners who were arrested in the power struggles following Stalin's death. In January 1953 he was convicted by the military court of Budapest and sentenced to six years gaol for maltreating prisoners and preparing false statements. In October 1956 came that short-lived revolution, the surge towards freedom in Hungary, which was so ruthlessly crushed. Vajda was one of the thousands of AVH agents who fled Hungary at this time.

         Through her investigations, Mrs Bardy found that the Tibor Vajda who arrested her and her husband was a dental technician who had joined the Hungarian secret police in 1946.

         The coincidences include the fact that the birth dates of both Tibor Vajda and his wife corresponded to the birth dates of Tibor and Eva Vajda as recorded in government documents from the archives of the Hungarian Government. Vajda's personal details in the New South Wales Dental Board records also matched. Information contained in Vajda's curriculum vitae, signed by him on 12 January 1952, corresponded to the general report of him being a dental technician in Hungary. From a search of his company records Mrs Bardy found that Vajda's signature corresponded with the signature on her husband's arrest papers. A forensic expert believes that the signatures were `very probably' written by the same Vajda.

         It is also worth noting that in 1960 Mr Vajda made his first application to practise as a dentist in Australia and that that application was refused, although that decision was overturned the following year after intervention by his then local member of parliament. I hope that when the Minister is investigating these matters he will also report on the details of the initial refusal of the application. I also hope that the Minister will report—depending on the circumstances and the facts, of course—on whether it is within his powers to revoke the citizenship of Australians who have knowingly provided false information to the Australian Government.

         I raise this matter because I think it is a compelling story which shows great fortitude on the part of a woman and her son who suffered depravation in the early 1950s, and who have now been good citizens of Australia for more than 30 years. In the interests of all concerned—and not least Mr Vajda—it is a matter that requires the attention of the Minister. It is a matter that probably affects us all in some way. It is for those reasons that I hope the Minister will respond properly to the approaches that have been made to him.

So the Nullarbor has been saved.

What the process involves at the moment is either a Minister or the Prime Minister, usually in an election climate, making some commitment to look at World Heritage listing of an area. What then happens is that the locals usually get very worried about this and we then have a number of groups of people—I see Senator Ian Macdonald in the chamber; he has personal experience of what happened with the wet tropics area—with enormous uncertainty, livelihoods affected and families affected.

I have had the pleasure and benefit of visiting a number of World Heritage sites, both in Australia and around the world, and it is sad that the whole World Heritage listing process has been debased because of the crass use of World Heritage listing for base political purposes—mostly, in fact always, by this Labor Government, now in its fifth term.

All I am saying is that, if we are going to be in the business of nominating areas for World Heritage listing, it is just sensible politics, it is sensible economics and it is sensible out of pure human decency and courtesy to go and talk to the people who are affected.

         World Heritage listing has become a very high profile issue which upsets people.

I am not saying that they are all genuine concerns or matters of particular worry, but, even if the perception of the decision making power moving away from their local control and moving out of their hands is just a perception, it is dangerous, and it is important that governments consult with these local people.

It would seem to me just basic commonsense to talk to the local people, get their views and persuade them if necessary. The overriding concern must be finding a sustainable way of protecting the environment and a sensible balance with the economic activity that is taking place in that particular area. I think senators all around the chamber would agree with that, and I am sure the people who are affected on the Nullarbor, the people who are affected at Willandra Lakes, the people who are affected at Shark Bay and the people who are now affected at Lake Eyre would agree with that as well.

We need to look at how people have protected these areas already without the great benefit of having a line drawn around them and having that map sent off to the World Heritage register.

To that extent I would have to agree with him. I think it has been used on several occasions as a political football. I hope he is not disagreeing with the importance of the Lake Eyre basin.

         I would like very briefly to speak on that subject. It was in 1984 when I as president of the Conservation Council of South Australia, and Mr Barry Cohen as the then Minister for the Environment, first made the proposal that the Lake Eyre basin be made a World Heritage area. The reason for that was that just as the Galapagos Islands are a World Heritage area then so also should be the Lake Eyre basin. It was on those islands that Darwin observed the differentiation of different species of birds and other animals. They were islands separated for some considerable time by water. It was there that he twigged to the notion of evolution, the way in which speciation occurs through genetic variation and the impact of different environments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Lake Eyre basin, with the ponds along the Cooper and Diamantina rivers, and also the mound springs, is analogous to the Galapagos Islands. There is speciation there to the extent that there are quite unique species occurring in perhaps only one of those mound springs. They are islands of water separated by a sea of desert. The exact same process has gone on, that process of evolution, which has given those unique species. For very important biological reasons it is important to protect that area. It has exactly the same importance as the Galapagos Islands in terms of that evolutionary model.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other characteristic which encourages us to set it aside as a World Heritage area is that it has very important links with both the Aboriginal culture and with white culture following European settlement in Australia. It was precisely because of the presence of those mound springs through that very arid desert region and the waterholes on the Cooper and the Diamantina that Aboriginal people were able, over countless centuries, to go through that area and use that area for their hunting and other purposes.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Of course, when European settlement occurred then again the availability of that fresh water allowed the area to be used for exploration and eventually for the pastoral activities to which Senator Campbell has referred. So there are important cultural reasons also why that region should be protected.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another point that I want to make is that there is a great deal of misunderstanding in relation to the continuance of activities in an area which has become a World Heritage area. I suspect that those pastoralists and those miners and potential miners, and so on, in the area of the Lake Eyre basin who are concerned about the protection of the area as a World Heritage area are needlessly concerned. They believe that somehow or other it is going to lock the area up and prevent a continuation of many of those activities.

         Certainly, in relation to the unique wildlife which occurs in many of those mound springs, it will mean fencing off those mound springs so that the cattle do not go in and break them down as has happened in the past. But that is already happening to some extent because the pastoralists themselves have recognised the importance of protecting those areas.

         The best example—and we may yet get to debate it today—of a World Heritage area which has continued to be used for a very important economic purpose is, of course, the Great Barrier Reef. According to legislation that we will be debating today, the reef brings in somewhere between $1 billion and $1.6 billion each year. The designation of the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage area has not stopped fishing, it has not stopped tourism, it has not stopped a whole lot of activities which are very important economic activities. What it has done is ensure that the qualities for which the area is designated World Heritage are protected.

         The legislation is significant because the dairy industry is the largest food processing industry in Australia as well as our largest value-adding agricultural industry. Export income from dairy products this financial year is expected to exceed $900 million, up from $761 million last financial year. This year, Australia's production of milk is expected to exceed 7,000 million litres of milk, the highest level of production for 20 years. It is interesting to note that these high levels of production have not resulted in calls for cuts in production, but have been welcomed by the industry.

         The dairy industry has been through a period of dramatic rationalisation over the last 20 years and is now enjoying a period of stability, as well as relatively high returns for farmers. Some 20 years ago, there were 47,000 dairy farmers in this country. Today there are only about 8,000 dairy farmers and they are producing as much milk, if not more, than was produced by the 47,000 farmers 20 years ago.

         Our dairy farmers are certainly among the most efficient in the world. In just 10 years, they have achieved a 25 per cent increase in the annual amount of milk produced per cow through better breeding, concentration on nutrition, and so on. Ten years ago the milk per cow was about 3,000 litres; this year it will top 4,000 litres.

         Even so, Australia's per capita consumption of liquid milk, at 102.9 kilograms per annum, is a long way behind many other comparable countries. The Irish consume 184 kilograms of milk per year per head of population; the Finns, 172 kilograms per year per head; the Scandinavians, around 156 kilograms; and New Zealanders, 134 kilograms. The Danes, the Swiss and the Americans also consume more milk per head than we do, so there is definitely room for expansion.

        On international trade, may I remind honourable senators, the European Community is still heavily subsidising a range of products, including dairy products. Our dairy farmers have traded into these highly corrupted markets for years without government assistance. They have also competed against them in the domestic market without tariff protection, apart from an EC tariff quota arrangement. This arrangement means that, after the European Community has shipped 11,000 tonnes of cheese into Australia, we are entitled to add an import duty which is equivalent to the amount of export subsidy paid by the EC to its exporters. Meanwhile, Australia is only permitted to export 3,000 tonnes into the EC and must pay a tariff of more than 20 per cent.

Yet, despite the recent cut in payments to exporters, the EC still pays them rates up to about 240 per cent over the world price.

         As the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) pointed out, the cost of doing business in this country is too high, and the Federal Government must create a better economic environment for our export industries. So far, the dairy industry has led the way with value added product, but its expansion is constantly hampered by high costs and closed markets. Currently, milk tankers are subject to a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent. There are 18 tyres on a milk tanker, and the tax on each tyre is $90. Excise on fuel is about 27c a litre, and transport costs are about double those faced by many of our international competitors.

It is absolutely ridiculous for Australia to be trying to compete on international markets when we do not allow our industries to compete on international terms. We must allow this to come about. It is not only a matter of allowing it; we must make it come about. We cannot expect our producers to compete on this ridiculous pattern in which we have all the costs at our end and all sorts of obstacles at the other end as well. We do not put obstacles of any magnitude on the product coming in, we only put them on the product going out. The industry has been trying to cope with this for a long time.

         I, too, have been known to make comments about the operation of AQIS, and I think this is another opportunity for me to do exactly that. There is no reason why it cannot be arranged that producers accept responsibility for the quality of their own product and pay penalties if it is not good enough. But they are being obstructed by enormous costs. I recently had a case where two AQIS officers were appointed and moved to King Island but there were no houses for them. This went on for some months until we were able to arrange that accommodation. I question whether having two more officers on King Island was necessary, because the work could have been done by the meatworks and the dairy organisation.

I give great credit to people like John Bennett and Pat Rowley for the enormous amount of leadership they have demonstrated and for the way in which they have been able to hold a very fragmented industry together and, in very difficult times, to keep farmers moving in a forward direction so that not only are they able to survive but they can survive with dignity and with profit.

         There is still a big future for the industry. The real difficulty in my area is that there is only a certain amount of land suitable for dairy farming. It just so happens that most of that land is also suitable for growing cash crops. So there is now very stiff competition between what can be made from dairying and what can be made from other products. I hope that it works out to the advantage of the farmers and that they may be able to get a better price by being under competition for the use of their land.

         The industry was all but gone in 1976-77. It is now able to recover and is looking to increase its productivity from three per cent per annum to five per cent per annum. I believe that it will. In Tasmania alone, this would be worth an extra $20 million to our economy. I am amazed at the new range of products that have come into the area. We have one factory producing UHT products, everything from custards to cat food. We now have new factories being built for specialist forms of cheese. We have whey powders of pharmaceutical grades being prepared for baby food and so on. In cheeses, yoghurts and all sorts of products the progress has been quite outstanding. I look forward to seeing those products continue to expand in the years ahead. As time is running out, I announce that I support the Bill.

        I draw the Minister's attention to a letter signed by him of 1 September 1992 addressed to my colleague the honourable member for Cowper, Mr Garry Nehl, regarding this matter in which he not only refers to claims of alleged rorts in Telecom but also indicates that he has requested a report on the matter. I ask: did the Minister mislead the Senate in his answer on Wednesday, 12 May, when I have in my hand a letter which he himself signed and which clearly shows that he did have knowledge of this matter? Did the Minister in fact read the letter of 1 September 1992 or does he make a habit of signing letters without reading them?  Will the Minister make available the report from AOTC on alleged travel rorts in Telecom?

It was appropriately made on International Museums Day and concerned the relationship between Australian museums and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is very important to note that the statement was developed in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and provides for a stronger role for indigenous people in policy making, management and care of their cultural property in public collecting institutions. It indicates that museums will undertake to provide information to communities in an accessible form so that rightful owners may request the return of objects, and museums will extend their programs to assist communities to care for cultural property in their own keeping places and in community museums.

         There is recognition of the importance of these issues and the primary rights of indigenous people to ownership of their cultural property, et cetera. On the basis of those commitments and that history, I was a little surprised by announcements by the Victorian Government that there was going to be developed in Melbourne a federally funded museum of Aboriginal culture. Let me say quite clearly that, contrary to any impression given in media reports today, the Commonwealth has provided no commitment whatsoever to the Victorian Government to assist in funding the development of a museum of Aboriginal culture in Victoria.

         For some years, training of air traffic controllers has been conducted in a tertiary institution in Tasmania. For some time, the CAA has expressed its concern about the high failure rate, if you like, of the graduates from that institution to actually make it on the job. The change results from that concern and the decision of the CAA to establish a national system of air traffic control which involves the establishment of two complete backup air traffic control systems in Brisbane and Melbourne—that is, complete duplications of the air traffic control system that can be used in the case of a failure. Those backup systems are absolutely ideal for training air traffic controllers on the job.

         I gave this matter a great deal of consideration when I was the then Minister, and it was felt by the CAA—and, I might add, in accordance with practice around the world—that it would get a far greater degree of rigorous control, and of course the control has to be very rigorous in training these officers, if they were trained on the job rather than having them trained in a separate institution in a simulated air traffic control situation. Having seen it work, let me explain how it works. The backup systems are in a position to actually replicate the real life situation that is going on in the control room next door. In other words, what is actually happening in the air can be brought up on those screens at the same time, with of course the satisfaction that, if the trainee controllers do not do it properly, two aircraft do not actually collide with each other while the trainees are training.

         With the establishment of what is going to be very sophisticated and expensive backup equipment it made far more sense to utilise that backup equipment for the training of air traffic controllers, rather than continuing it in Launceston. I conclude by saying that merit and expertise remain the primary criteria for the training of air traffic officers.

The program started in 1991 with a $4 million grant from the Australian Government. It became very quickly a model for cooperation between government and small business. The program arose from discussions at the National Small Business Forum, an organisation representative of the small business organisations in Australia that was started by Minister Beddall when he was Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs.

         Such was the success of the organisation that in a very short time, in the One Nation statement of early last year, the $4 million funding to the export access program was increased by a further $8 million to expand the program, because small business was taking up and becoming involved in the program at a very rapid rate.

Will he table today correspondence and any terms of reference establishing a review, as he did with the Pearce inquiry into the satellite licence tender process?

         In conclusion—I have only just had this matter brought to my attention a few minutes ago—in terms of all this huffing and puffing and obfuscation that is going on on the other side, the person whom the industry would probably say is most rightly aggrieved by the problem with MDS is Mr Stokes. It is well known in the industry that he is one of the big bidders for these licences. I said yesterday in the Senate—and I have only just had this brought to my attention; I have never met Mr Stokes but I am about to redress that because I want to follow up what he said today—that I had given Mr Stokes, happily, something which people who are contesting a court action do not often get; that is, I had provided him with all the legal advice in advance from Attorney-General's and from Mr Gyles QC which canvassed all of the arguments that are to be tested in the Federal Court. I speculated—and it was only speculation yesterday—that I felt that the comments made by Mr Stokes were probably made before he had an opportunity to read that advice. I have just had pointed out to me the statement made by Mr Stokes which appeared in the

It was using the voluntary agencies as conduits for getting help to those in need. We promised to match money raised and spent, and we did. On 6 December, the Prime Minister announced the initiative.

        On 12 December an advertisement appeared in the press inviting expressions of interest, and it stated quite clearly that operational funds would not be eligible for matching funds. On 14 December the department started sending out application forms to agencies. Those forms set out the terms for the matching grants. They included the relevant time limits for fund raising and for expenditure, and the type of expenditure which would receive matching funds for their Christmas appeals.

         On 21 December letters were sent out by the department offering funds to successful applicants. Once again, those terms of money raised and money spent were made quite clear to all of the applicants. It is quite clear that any agency participating in the Christmas appeals knew and was fully aware of exactly what the terms of that offer were. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that the Government had reneged on its undertaking or somehow misled the agencies with regard to its support.

         I come now to another very important point—the claim by Senator Patterson that the goalposts were shifted. What is important to know is that on 31 January, as the time for expending the relief had come, a number of the agencies contacted the Government and said they had not had time to complete the expenditure. So the Government, with a fair amount of generosity, extended the time for that money to be spent until 31 March, giving all the agencies another two months in which to continue to expend the money which they were having matched by the Government.

         To date, the Government has actually provided $8.74 million for eligible agencies. It is estimated that a further $3.8 million will be paid out to finalise this program. It was nothing to do with the election. The program was announced in December. The extension of the time to 31 March was decided in response to requests from the agencies at the end of January. It was never in any doubt to the agencies. I am sorry that Senator Patterson has got it so wrong.

         The Government has a right to explain to the citizens of Australia the kind of health care system that they have and all that they are entitled to. They have been subjected to some pretty ordinary scare campaigns in recent times, both by the Opposition and by some of the private health funds, about the kind of care they can expect to get. While it is accepted by everyone, except some people in the Opposition and a handful of doctors, that the Australian health system is not in crisis, nonetheless that is a perception that some people have tried to put over. In researching that problem—research that the Government conducted some time ago—there were a number of alarming statistics that needed to be addressed.

         Very large numbers of people believed incorrectly that they would be forced to pay extra charges not covered by Medicare if they went to a public hospital; about one-fifth of Australians thought they would have to pay bed fees; over one-third thought they might be liable for an anaesthetist or a surgeon; over one-third thought they would have to pay for medication; a large number thought they would have to pay for intensive care fees. All of those things were wrong, but they were all perceptions that in the Government's view needed to be corrected. So we set about organising a campaign which would explain to Australians the kind of health care they could expect in the public system, and we proceeded to make sure they knew all about it.

         —I would have thought that the more intelligent among the Opposition—and there must be some—would have worked out by now that the interests of Australians come before the interests of the Opposition and that we should all be considering where we can improve the system and doing it. We certainly should not be trying to scare Australians into believing that in some way we have a system in crisis. We have not. Ninety-seven per cent of those who turn up for care in public hospitals get dealt with quickly and adequately.

In view of the fact that Professor Pearce found that at the date of the pay television determination the Minister was familiar with the MDS and AM-FM conversion procedures, both of which required payments of deposits of differing kinds, why did the Minister not ask for a briefing and why did his staff not arrange or provide it as a matter of course?

Under the auspices of the memorandum of understanding, a joint project in the area of defence communications has commenced. Another joint project on jet engine modelling is being planned. Both of these projects will involve exchange of technical information and the posting of Singaporean engineers into DSTO laboratories.

We have to obey the various guidelines put down by the Department of Finance on disposal of surplus equipment. We are doing that in this particular case. We recognise that there is not a widespread market for these planes. They are surplus to requirement, and they are being disposed of at auction as per the guidelines.

Does the Minister consider this disparity morally defensible?

         The MFP is not a South Australian project; it is a national one. But if it does succeed, as we all hope it will, it will benefit, obviously on a very significant scale, the citizens of South Australia, including those who are presently unemployed, and we can expect very significant benefits to be generated for the whole Australian economy. Against that background, in those circumstances, while I am not aware of the precise considerations that determined this salary on this occasion, I believe the amount that has been determined by the board appears, on the face of it, defensible.

The start-up date will certainly be no later than 1 January next year and, with a bit of luck, it may well still be earlier than that; but that is contingent upon Cabinet decisions and the making available of the appropriations that are necessary to sustain that.

The latest project approval is a further demonstration of the overall commitment by this Government toward land transport in Australia. In the case of South Australia, through the national highway, One Nation, black spot and other road and urban public transport project expenditures, the Federal Government's commitment for the 1992-93 year is estimated to be in excess of $120 million.

         We know that in both industry and universities women are largely clustered in the lower paid areas of employment. That is a major concern for government and one which the affirmative action legislation intends to address. The universities have all been making their reports over the years that the Affirmative Action Agency and the affirmative action legislation have been in place. It has been very interesting to see how universities have actually had to address the fact that women in universities are still largely appointed to the lower positions; they are much more present in non-tenured positions and in tutorships.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Reid this day, relating to the employment and training criteria used by the Civil Aviation Authority.

        There are three aspects of the matter that need to be dealt with arising from the question and the Minister's answer: firstly, the question of the balloting of the students for employment; secondly, the nature of the employment in the first place; and, thirdly, that part of the Minister's answer which in fact dealt with the motion I moved yesterday dealing with the location of the school in Launceston.

         I will not go over speeches that I have made previously which dealt with the fact that the school should never have been placed in Launceston and clearly should have been in the national capital in the first place. It was placed in Launceston for political reasons. The folly of that decision has now been proved by the Minister's statement today about and endorsing shifting it from Launceston, the cost to taxpayers all-up being about $40 million. Goodness knows what it will cost to relocate the facilities in Melbourne and Brisbane, as is presently planned.

         But the course has been operating in Launceston. I wish to refer in particular to the students who did the course during 1991 and 1992. They responded to an advertisement in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Weekend Australian
         </emphasis>
         of 6 and 7 October 1990, which advertisement said in part:

        Graduates will be eligible for employment as air traffic controllers or flight service officers with the Civil Aviation Authority following successful completion of final field training. Persons embarking on a career with the CAA will find it challenging and rewarding.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure they would if they could actually get jobs. At the bottom of the advertisement, it states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Course numbers are structured to meet the needs of the CAA and employment opportunities are excellent.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we examine the facts, we could only come to the conclusion that that advertisement was misleading. Thirty-three students completed the course in 1992, having started their course at the beginning of January 1991.

         It transpires that within six months the CAA knew that the students would not get jobs but it did not tell them. They found that out near the end of their course, in November 1992. Having completed the course, and graduated in the order of numbers from one to 33, they then found out that they would not be employed in order of merit. A ballot was to be held for the positions that they would be offered. I do not know whether any of them have actually been offered jobs, but many of them would have taken up other courses had they known that this advertisement was false.

         On 5 January 1993 the ballot took place in Canberra, none of the students being present, so far as I know.

          It relates to the issue, in a general way, that my colleague Senate Reid mentioned and I support what she said. While it is relevant to the issue of training by the CAA, and training for young people learning to fly, it also relates to the question that Senator Brownhill asked of Senator Ray. I am desirous of an answer from either Senator Collins or Senator Ray, so I thought it would be appropriate to raise it at this time.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Brownhill this day, relating to the certification by the Civil Aviation Authority of aircraft being sold by the RAAF.

        The matter possibly involves Senator Collins as well. The question relates to the aircraft that are being sold. I have been contacted by the Broadmeadows College of Technical and Further Education about the sale of those aircraft. The college, or someone associated with it, is interested in looking at them. I understand that it is being suggested that an amount of $40,000 will need to be spent on those aircraft to bring them up to a standard that will allow them to be registered, so that they can be flown in civilian air space. The RAAF has in the past been flying them in civilian air space. The query is raised as to why they should now require these modifications to enable them to fly in the same air space.

         There is a suggestion, from the CAA to the air training corps, that a waiver is not possible for use by cadets of these aircraft in a flying-training role. I ask either Senator Ray or Senator Collins to indicate whether they would be prepared to consider an exemption for air training corps from the CAA requiring these qualifications so that the aircraft can be used by cadets for flying training purposes only. The matter is a fraction urgent because the auction is on at the end of this week, I understand, and these people are interested in some response to this before they consider their position in bidding at the auction.

         —On this matter I probably cannot be as helpful as the Minister representing the CAA. Even Senator Macdonald might think that the Minister would like to concentrate on another couple of matters for the next few minutes. I will give a general answer to supplement the answer I gave Senator Brownhill. In fact, 51 aircraft have been acquired since 1975. Forty-seven of these are now available for disposal. There have been a number of requests indicating an interest in purchasing the aircraft—and I suppose there have been some people wanting them for nothing, as always happens with military equipment.

         I am informed that in their present configuration the aircraft would not be immediately eligible for registration on the CAA civil register, which is the same information as the senator has. All the aircraft require a number of modifications to bring them to the standard which the CAA has accepted for certification of a number of the CT4B aircraft operated by British Aerospace and Ansett Technologies at Tamworth, New South Wales, for pilot training and flight screening.

         I understand the costs are, as has been quoted here, about $40,000. As to why there is this dichotomy between the standard for a military aircraft and that for a civilian aircraft, I have not gone back into the mists of time to find out what the circumstances are. It has been known for quite some time, though, that these planes were up for disposal. I think I signed off this particular matter in January 1993. I think those opposite would concede it would be most unreasonable if we spent $40,000 per aircraft in Defence to upgrade them. We sell them as is. They can be used for a number of different purposes but, if they are to be used for the purpose of carrying the general public, then they will need the $40,000 spent on them.

         The crux of the matter raised is whether a distinction can be made if the aircraft are used for CAA training. I will pass that on as quickly as I can to my colleague to try to get a response before the weekend. I simply do not know whether I can or cannot. Clearly, if I cannot, I hope that the matter continues to be negotiable. If those at Broadmeadows, or wherever it is, decide to put in a purchase order, maybe negotiations on the matter can ensue. It is really the first time this matter has been directly put to me in this way. I have known that it was going to cost $40,000 to upgrade the planes for CAA. I did not know of this other function that they could be used for—nor should I. I really prefer not to know who the potential tenderers and auctioneers are. I usually like to be informed after the event.

         —I was disappointed that Senator Ray resorted to the Collins defence of blaming the Department of Finance for the tendering process. If that is the advice from the Department of Finance, then the department ought to reconsider its position. Hardly any aircraft at all have been sold in Australia. To dump 36 aircraft in one block, irrespective of whether they meet registration standards or not, just kills the market: it cannot be done. There is no loss for the Commonwealth in holding these aircraft and selling them in smaller units over a six-month or 12-month period at a rate which the market could absorb. I believe we are going to lose quite a lot of money under the procedures proposed by the Department of Finance. I would seriously suggest to Senator Ray that the department ought to talk to some people in the industry if it is faced with similar situations in the future.

         Two other matters were overlooked and I bring them to the attention of the Minister. The first is the safety angle of the airplanes which, as the Minister alluded to, have been quite willingly flying in airspace and which now have to be upgraded if they are to be used in the same airspace under a different category. That is rather disturbing. The second point is that the Minister said that the upgrading would cost $40,000, which is quite correct, but if there are 800 engineers in the RAAF, surely they could have helped with the upgrading of those planes.

         —If the 36 were sold at, say, $25,000, that brings in about $900,000. If they were sold separately over a period, as Senator MacGibbon suggested, then that would bring in something like 36 multiplied by $35,000 or more. The extra money would be good for the department and it would be a fairer sale. On the basis of the figures presented earlier, something like an extra $1 million-plus would be coming into the department. That represents quite a difference. Being taxpayers' money, I would imagine that in his ministerial capacity, and being a frugal person, the Minister would be more interested in making sure that the taxpayers were as well looked after as any other interested parties.

         —As honourable senators will recall, my question was related to the home child-care allowance, which was an election promise targeted at Australian families where a parent is providing for their own child care. It is going to involve a cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate for families with children. It was also a recommendation of the bipartisan Lavarch committee inquiring into the status of women. It has been part of the national debate in this country for a long time. Those working in the home, providing for their own child care, have been calling for this allowance for ages. Yet the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)—I emphasise that it is family services—firstly tried to answer some other question altogether. She got the wrong end of the stick about what sort of child care I was talking about, and then she tried to duck the question entirely by saying that I was asking the question of the wrong Minister.

         It is clear that it was the wrong Minister. This Minister does not seem to know much about families at all. Any time she is asked anything she gets the wrong end of the stick. This issue was important enough to Australian families for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to regard it as an extremely important promise and to include it in his election policy speech.

         The Prime Minister said, `It's time'. Clearly, from the Minister's evasion, the time is not yet ripe. The measure needs to be introduced at the beginning of the financial year because it relates to an annual tax rebate which is to be cashed out, presumably through the Department of Social Security. If it is not done on 1 July this year, it presumably will have to be delayed until 1 July 1994 at the earliest.

         That is hardly an indication of the urgency with which the Prime Minister seemed to attend to it in his policy speech. The reality is what the dogs are barking all over Canberra: the Expenditure Review Committee is not going to pass the Government's election promises—avoiding and delaying any it can get away with. We have already seen it welshing on the removing of the pensioners from the tax system; we have seen it welshing on buying hospital beds in the private sector; we have seen it welshing on starting up the emergency dental health program, and now the Government is clearly getting Australian families to take a raincheck on the home child-care allowance. It was always a pretty deceitful promise anyway. It was a pea and thimble sort of trick. It was sold as $30 a week for families who provided their own child-care; yet in reality it was a transfer from the father's wallet to the mother's purse, plus $2.80 in tips. It is nice to have that extra $2.80, until we remember that that $2.80 is coming out of that same family's pocket by way of the taxes it has to pay.

         That did not bother the Government all that much because it was pretty good for a headline on the evening news. At that stage of the election, if honourable members can recall, that was all that was worrying the Government at the time. It did not really expect to be in government, and it spewed out promises willy-nilly, never really thinking about either the cost or the implementation. It has been pretty clear in the answers that we have been getting from the Ministers just lately that implementation and cost really were ignored. We saw Senator Richardson yesterday trying to bluff his way through the election promise about the dental health system, and then being forced to admit later that the Government was breaking a promise by putting back its emergency dental health program.

         We have seen the reduction of the Government's commitment to match the funding of the major welfare organisations, and we have seen the Minister fudge the issue of the home child-care allowance by simply saying it was being considered in the Budget process. If it is being considered in the Budget process, it is being delayed substantially, and yet on 24 February the Prime Minister said, `Labor believes it's time to redirect this assistance and convert the tax rebate to a cash benefit paid directly to the spouse at home caring for the children'. That promise was going to cost $326 million over four years.

No fine print was delivered to the voters when they signed on the dotted line for this Government. At the next election I guess they are going to want to see every t crossed and every i dotted because this Government cannot be trusted with promises, just like it cannot be trusted to run the country.

        Senator Crowley today went on to say that there had been general increases across the board and that the affirmative action legislation was working particularly well. Why is it that a government, through the Minister, continues to tell the people of Australia that this legislation is working particularly effectively when in fact in education, in the Public Service and in various other areas under the Government's control the legislation has clearly failed?

         I suggest that the Minister familiarise herself with the very book that she launched and come into the Senate and give us a straight answer as to the situation in this particular area. As I say, she launched the book, and what we need to know in the Senate is why is the affirmative action legislation not being trumpeted by her and her Government consistently.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Reynolds this day, relating to Government support for charitable organisations.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Today on the Pru Goward show Senator Crowley said that she was appalled at the beat-up of the Opposition on the issue of grants to organisations in the Christmas appeal. She said that some of the charitable organisations are quite distressed that this kind of misrepresentation has emerged. There was no misrepresentation, and I have had no representation from any of those organisations that they were distressed. Of course, they are grateful for the money they receive from the Government, but I am distressed at the way they were given that money. She said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It does no good at all to have gotten it as wrong as this and I hope the Opposition will be able to make an apology, because they have very, very unfairly misrepresented what was promised and what was delivered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to know, and I want Senator Crowley to tell me, how I and the Opposition misrepresented the situation. On 6 December the Prime Minister in a press release said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am pleased to announce today that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what he said on 6 December. On the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sunday
        </emphasis>
        program on 6 December—on the same day—he said to Laurie Oakes:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So let me say to you, Laurie, that for every dollar that the voluntary agencies like the St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Salvation Army collect for material assistance, the Commonwealth will match for the Christmas Appeals.
       </para>
       <para>
        There he is again saying, `for every dollar that they collect'. On 11 December, again in a press release, the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I announced on 6 December 1992 that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on in great detail in that press release about the conditions surrounding the Government's funding. He talked about the organisations that would be eligible, and stated that they must have a sound record in material aid, et cetera. But nowhere did the Prime Minister say that the Government's funding would involve only the dollars spent by the agencies over a specific period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I did not misrepresent the situation. I came into the chamber yesterday and said that the goalposts had changed. For a week the agencies believed those press releases. On the basis of those press releases the agencies actually started to look at how they would organise their spending patterns. The Prime Minister has the habit of legislating by press release, so I suppose the agencies were to be excused for thinking that this was no different. In today's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Canberra Times
         </emphasis>
         , a spokesman for Senator Crowley—and maybe this is wrong; Senator Crowley can advise us—said the following:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the contract signed by the major welfare groups on December 11 said "matching funds means grants equivalent to amounts of Christmas appeals donations received or expected to be raised between November 1 and December 30, 1992, and expended between December 1 and January 30, 1993".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That is the first the public knew about it—except for the advertisements that appeared on 12 December. We have not been able to get a copy of those advertisements. Maybe the public was told then. In an interview with Senator Crowley, Pru Goward said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well, the Prime Minister's Press Release actually said
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the Government will match dollar-for-dollar cash donations by the Australian public, which a reasonable man, I'd have thought would take that to mean the money raised, and according to the charities it was only later that the Government decided what they really meant was the money spent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pru Goward thought that; the public obviously thought that. Then, in an editorial appearing in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sun-Herald
        </emphasis>
        on 13 December, it is obvious that the editor thought that:

        Then we've got Prime Minister Keating's promise of a dollar for dollar raised by us. That will help take the pressure off.
       </para>
       <para>
        The community believed that, and that is what the donors believed. The Government has duped the donors of Australia. I have had phone calls to my office by people saying that they gave money on that understanding. They have been duped. That is the issue. The Australian public was told by the Prime Minister that the Government would match dollar for dollar the money that was raised by those organisations. That is what people believed when they gave donations to those organisations. That is the great untruth; that is the great misrepresentation. For Senator Crowley to say that I created mischief is very poor indeed.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Loosley this day, relating to the advertising of entitlements under Medicare.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson missed the whole point of my interjection and the objection of the health agencies to the expenditure of nearly $3 million to inform people of their entitlements under Medicare. Medicare has been in existence for 10 years. People do not choose to be ill; they get ill, and then they seek access to health care providers. Advertising their entitlements under Medicare is a total waste of taxpayers' funds because of that very point. That is the point that has completely escaped the bureaucracy and Senator Richardson.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problem with Medicare has not gone away because of the election, and it was not a point scoring exercise. There is enormous difficulty of access in relation to the public hospital system. The money spent on advertising the virtues of Medicare should well be spent, as Senator Richardson has acknowledged, on advising people to get private insurance because then they would get access to the hospital system.

         It has been noted that the waiting times in the public hospital system, certainly in Queensland, vary by anything from seven months to get an orthopaedic appointment or to get into an ENT outpatients ward, to 18 months once one is advised to have surgery. I have a letter before me from a patient in Nambour who has been waiting three years to have a tonsillectomy. I would suggest that some of that money should be spent on the Nambour hospital so this lady can have her tonsillectomy instead of currently having to go to her local general practitioner to get antibiotics to stave off the symptoms. I am happy to notify the Minister of the name of that patient if he so desires it.

       . . . the beat-up by the Opposition on this.

       Their great good work on behalf of needy Australians is now being called into question.

       . . . every dollar that the voluntary agencies like the St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Salvation Army collect for material assistance, the Commonwealth will match for the Christmas Appeals.

       In regard to the second claim, may I say that I have not and will not in any way question the great work of these charities. It is an absolute disgrace for Senator Crowley to imply this. On the contrary, my efforts have been aimed solely at exposing the fact that the Government has duped these charities and a generous Australian public by reneging on its promise to match, dollar for dollar, money raised in these Christmas appeals.

Those documents concerning the satellite tender and the MDS process were to be tabled in the Senate by 12 o'clock today.

         At 12 o'clock today, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) came into the chamber. We thought that we were either going to get the documents or an explanation as to why the documents could not be tabled. Approximately an hour later we had achieved neither. We still do not know whether the Government had any real explanation of why it was unable to table the documents, and we certainly do not have the documents.

         At that stage debate on the matter was adjourned until later in the day so that the Minister might consider his position and so that, hopefully, we would get the documents in accordance with the order of the Senate or, alternatively, hear from the Minister as to why he was unable to comply. This debate has now been reopened, for which I thank the Senate. I think we are at the stage where what we are really doing is giving the Minister a further opportunity to act in accordance with the order, or to make some satisfactory explanation.

         I will put this matter a little more into context. I said that the order was made yesterday by consent. Yesterday certainly no indication was given by the Minister that he would be unable to comply with such an order. I guess that that is not surprising, because we have been hearing for some weeks that there is no difficulty in the Minister tabling documents in relation to these two matters and, in fact, that they would be tabled.

         Mr Deputy President, I do not want to take much more of the Senate's time, but I take you back to 6 May. In answer to questions from my colleague Senator Alston, who asked that a whole range of documents in relation to the satellite pay television licences be tabled, Senator Collins said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I will table the documents which apply to Senator Alston's question. As I said yesterday, I have asked my departmental secretary to start the process of getting those documents together now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Collins said that on 6 May. Those documents included advices, notes of telephone conversations—all relevant material, in effect, to the satellite process. On 13 May the Minister also said, in effect addressing Senator Alston:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This I can guarantee: the maximum number of papers will be lodged on Tuesday. If any are left out, I imagine that it will not be long after that that they will be tabled.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then yesterday Senator Collins, in relation to Professor Pearce, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Professor Pearce has been examining all of the papers connected with this matter. He has had access to whatever officers of the department he wished to speak to about it. His report, together with the papers that he has examined, will be tabled in this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have got to this stage, and certainly Senator Collins has now tabled Professor Pearce's report and two documents—but he has certainly not tabled all the documents that Professor Pearce has examined. Certainly Senator Collins has not complied with the order of yesterday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Yesterday's order was very carefully drawn to try to reduce the number of documents that we would require, because we understand that there is a certain management difficulty in dealing with a lot of paper. We were at pains to try to be more specific—more specific than those that the Minister had indicated earlier that he would be able to provide to the Senate. So we were not even keeping him to his earlier undertakings. We tried to be helpful by reducing the number and focusing on the documents that were particularly relevant to the questions that we were seeking to have answered, and the order was in that form.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So Senator Collins has not complied with the order. He has not complied with any of the undertakings that were given on any of these days. He has not complied even with the statement that he made yesterday that he would table all the documents that Professor Pearce considered. We of course, not surprisingly, find that just a totally unsatisfactory situation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is one document that immediately struck me as being relevant. It was referred to on page 5 of Professor Pearce's report and is a draft determination that was floating around, which said:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       </para>
       <para>
        I would have thought that that was a vitally important document for us to have to make our determination whether this Minister has met the standard of performance of a Minister that we think is necessary.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is one thing to argue that Professor Pearce has made certain assessments, but that does not absolve us of our responsibilities. We have responsibilities to make certain assessments, and we can only do that if we have access to the necessary documents. We have had undertakings to produce those documents time and again, and they have not been produced. That forced us to the stage yesterday of seeking an order of the Senate that they be produced. Obviously we do not go down that path unnecessarily, but they were not being introduced. We sought the order, and the Minister said he consented to the order. The order was made. The documents have not been tabled and we still have no satisfactory explanation why that has not occurred.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So I raise the matter again and invite the Minister to either comply with the order or put to the Senate an explanation that we can consider. If the Minister is not prepared to do that, then we obviously have no alternative than to take other actions that are open to us because, as much as Ministers might not like being called to account by the Senate, it is our responsibility that they are and we are not going to let them avoid their responsibilities so easily by simply snubbing their nose at the Senate in the way that Senator Collins has done today.

         —I think, having now had a detailed discussion with Senator Collins and having had some opportunity to brief myself on the course of events in this very complex matter, I may be in a position to assist Senator Hill and the Senate in the, hopefully, amicable resolution of this matter. As I understand it, the situation is that Senator Collins did consent to this order yesterday. He indicated at the time of doing so in the Parliament that he had not yet had the opportunity to look at the details of the motion before him, but clearly what he understood to be involved in the motion was an order for the production of documents which was very much more limited in its scope than that which had previously been the subject of Opposition attention.

       <para first-indent="16">

         In fact, as Senator Collins said yesterday, the original scope of opposition requests—on the MDS side of the equation alone—could have extended to something like 113,000 pages of material. What Senator Alston was now proposing was something much more limited. So Senator Collins accepted it on the basis that it was a much more confined task confronting him. Senator Collins also accepted the order yesterday without demur on the basis that, at that stage, he understood that the Pearce report—which has in fact now been tabled today—would not be required or expected to be tabled until next Monday. So it was on the assumption that the Pearce report would have that many more days of gestation that Senator Collins agreed yesterday to bringing forward his obligation to table this batch of papers.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I understand it, what then happened yesterday afternoon was that further discussions were held outside this chamber—so they are not documented and inevitably recollections will vary about what occurred—and Senator Collins was requested to bring forward the tabling of the Pearce report from Monday to today. Senator Collins acceded to that request in the knowledge of and with the implication that, by doing so, the time and attention of his office and the relevant departmental officers involved would thereby be totally preoccupied with the bringing forward of the Pearce report, preparing the details of its presentation, being prepared to answer questions and so on.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Whether or not it was practicable at the time of agreement yesterday to meet this order, it certainly became hopelessly impracticable to do so in the circumstances as they evolved yesterday afternoon. That really is the reason why it just has not been possible to do the work necessary to bring the papers forward today.

         What matters less, I would hope, than what has happened in the past is what should happen now. It is perfectly reasonable for the Senate, having passed an order and not having it complied with, to seek an explanation and to seek an indication of what response is now contemplated. The response that we propose to make, having had an opportunity to look at the scale of the task that is yet to be performed is this: we would propose—and we will make this the subject of explicit undertakings by Senator Collins in a moment—that we look at the order in two parts, the first part being documents relating to the satellite licence tender process, namely, the report that has been already put down now by Pearce. Let us call it Pearce report No. 1. The documents that are sought in relation to that are those here identified in the motion:  copies of any requests, copies of any legal, technical or other advice. They are further described in the text of the motion.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, let us look at, as a separate exercise, the similar kinds of documents related to the MDS licence tender process which is to be the subject of Pearce report No. 2—if we might so describe it—which report will be tabled in this Parliament next Wednesday.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So far as the second category of documents is concerned, namely, requests for advice and copies of any legal, technical or other advice relating to the MDS process relating to Pearce report No. 2, we are proposing that those documents be tabled in the Parliament no later than next Wednesday. Indeed, if it is possible to table them any earlier than next Wednesday, if it is possible to table Pearce report No. 2 any earlier than next Wednesday, we will do so, and Senator Collins will give that undertaking. Present indications are, given the scale of the task, that that is not likely to be achievable any earlier than next Wednesday. But that is certainly our objective and that is the undertaking that Senator Collins is prepared to give.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So far as the other category of documents is concerned relating to Pearce report No. 1, or the satellite process, the undertaking that we are prepared to give in relation to this category is as follows: Senator Collins will table these documents as soon as he is able to do so and, in any event, no later than next Monday, when Parliament resumes. If it is possible to complete the task today, tonight, before Parliament rises, then Senator Collins will come into the Parliament and make the documents available. If the task is completed, as seems likely, not by tonight but some time tomorrow or Saturday or even Sunday, then Senator Collins will undertake to make the documents thus prepared available to the Opposition spokesman and the Democrats spokesperson as soon as those documents are ready and as soon as they can be couriered to whatever location they are—as has happened, I understand, with other documents.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The reason why some more time is required to prepare all these documents for presentation should, I hope, be obvious to honourable senators, but let me just spell it out in case it is not. Time until now has been totally preoccupied, for all the relevant officers and advisers, in going through the other steps that have been involved in leading up to producing and tabling today the Pearce report and dealing with the ongoing saga of the MDS licences.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Even though the scope of the request has now been much confined, which we appreciate, it is not just a matter obviously of retrieving and putting into a single pile all the documents that satisfy this description. It is a matter, in accordance with the time-honoured procedures and practices of this place on which I have had occasion to rely on various occasions, perfectly understood and accepted that there are legitimate grounds for non-disclosure. I do not seek to identify now all possible grounds that might be relied upon or might be relevant to these particular documents, but there are manifestly at least three: Cabinet-in-confidence, commercial-in-confidence, and documents, the nature of which or the nature of parts of which may adversely impact on the conduct of legal proceedings, or prejudice any party to legal proceedings.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are legal proceedings currently extant in relation to the MDS side of the process—not, I verily believe, so far as the satellite part of it is concerned, but there is a sense in which these issues are intertwined; for example, the consideration of tender processes, practices and procedures and so on. There is a sense in which it may be that some of the documents that relate to the satellite side of it could impact on legal proceedings extant elsewhere. Obviously the documents have to be looked at very carefully against these criteria.

         That will take more time than people have had until now. It may not take more time than this evening, before Parliament gets up. If it does, it will not take any more time than next Monday afternoon, when we resume; and I repeat that Senator Collins is prepared to give the undertaking, whenever the documents are prepared, to make them available to Senator Bourne so that she has maximum time to prepare whatever response she wants to make to them. That is the situation, as I understand it.

I must say, though, that the Minister's office should have realised that that could have been one of the consequences, and perhaps something should have been done there.

I must say that it was only yesterday or the day before that I spoke to the Minister about the Pearce report getting in before the weekend, so I would expect it not to take much more than a day and I would hope to get these documents within a day. If we can get them tonight, and tabled tonight, that would be excellent; but I would really like to see them on Friday at the very latest.

That process should not be necessary but unfortunately, in view of the history of this matter, it now seems to be necessary.

The undertaking to table all the documents that Professor Pearce examined in relation to this report was given in good faith and what subsequently happened simply gives an indication of just how independent Professor Pearce's handling of this matter has been. And I am still happy to discharge the obligation, Senator Hill. Outside of his formal examination of me, with his assistant Dr whoever it was, I have had no contact with Professor Pearce. I gave this explanation. I will read the relevant section of the report. In the introduction to the report, at the bottom of the page, Professor Pearce said:

        For Senator Hill's benefit, I will say again what I said at lunchtime. I had made an assumption—not an unreasonable one—that all the documents would probably be given to Parliament. The explanation I have been given, and it makes sense, is that Professor Pearce, having examined all the documents—and he says he did, so I do not dispute he did—determined that the only documents that were really relevant to the central issue of this matter, which is what has been debated in here every day for three weeks, namely, my responsibility, were two documents.

That is a very narrowly cast request, and it may well be that, construed narrowly, there are no more than two documents that satisfy that description.

        I want to make it clear from the outset that we have no quarrel with the authorship of the report that has been tabled in the Senate today. Professor Pearce is eminently qualified to deal with the matter and he has clearly done the job that he was asked to do. In no way are we impugning his integrity or seeking to make any personal attacks. I simply put that on the record at the outset because I apprehend that when I do move to some criticisms of the reports inevitably the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, will say that it is an ad hominem attack. I want that to be perfectly clear. The first thing to be said is that the terms of reference of Professor Pearce were narrow, and he conceded that explicitly. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I did not seek an amendment to the Terms of Reference, noting their narrow compass and the short period for completion of the inquiry (it should be observed that the Terms of Reference do not require me to comment on issues arising from the doctrine of ministerial responsibility).
       </para>

        In other words, there is nothing at all in this document that can exonerate Senator Collins from any allegations that might be made in terms of ministerial responsibility.

         —I am simply pointing out that whatever might be said by way of gratuitous obiter dicta is utterly irrelevant to the terms of reference. All I can say is that page iii, for example, where it talks about no systemic deficiency, which just happens to coincide with the form of words that Senator Collins has chosen to use in defining ministerial responsibility, again can in no way be regarded as passing judgment on Senator Collins' actions. It will be our contention that the only appropriate place for that matter is in the Senate. At the end of the Minister's tabling statement, he said, `I'd rather be found accused of an error of judgment than to stand here today accused of a rush to judgment'. That seems to imply that, because the report talks in terms of an error of judgment, Senator Collins is accepting responsibility for that at worst. If that is the case, that is a significant advance because for the first time he seems to be prepared to accept responsibility for the actions of his subordinates and not simply to bag them as he has done for the last three weeks.

        That seems quite a surprising conclusion to reach when one accepts that Professor Pearce says that it was desirable that matters were brought to the attention of the Minister. One would have expected officers of the department to have addressed this issue and, in various ways, Professor Pearce makes it clear that he thinks the issue of a deposit would have been discussed. I find it surprising when it is suggested a deposit was not discussed. He goes on to make it clear that he believes these matters should have been brought to the attention of the Minister.

         That is quite a separate question to what actions the Minister himself should have taken, and I will deal with that briefly. It is quite clear that this is not a Minister without any experience at all; this is a Minister who had been the Minister for Communications for some nine months as at January of this year—a Minister who was clearly aware of pre-existing approaches to tender, and particularly in this area. If one looks at paragraph 46, one sees:

       </para>
       <para>
        It follows from that that this was not a Minister acting in ignorance; this was not a Minister who knew nothing about communications; this was a Minister who was familiar with the procedures that had been adopted in other instances and who, therefore, ought to have immediately turned his mind to what procedures were being followed in this instance.

         Let us look at what Senator Collins has previously said. He said that he had read the determination of 19 January before he signed it. He said that he checked it for completeness. Professor Pearce says of Senator Collins:

        The Minister thinks that he read the minute sometime in the period before his return to Canberra on 18 January. . .

       <para>
        He is there talking about a draft determination dated 4 January which is attached as appendix 3. It is perfectly clear that Professor Pearce is expressing grave concern about the procedures in the Minister's office. The minute which was hand delivered to the Minister's office was not logged in in the normal fashion. Presumably the only reason why Professor Pearce does not reach any conclusion at the end in that regard is that, again, he accepts that he is only examining the failings of the bureaucracy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is clear that that document was read by the Minister sometime between 4 and 19 January. Indeed, as I understand it, he also read the actual determination before he signed it. So on two separate occasions the Minister's attention was drawn to the requirement for only a $500 application fee; therefore, there is no excuse whatsoever for the Minister not to have turned his mind to the subject and sought advice.

Therefore, there is nothing wrong or improper or `kicking the umpire' to say that some of Professor Pearce's conclusions seem strange, are hard to accept and, indeed, in some instances are conflicting. He identifies a number of examples of where the process went horribly wrong. They found that document, but they do not know how it originated. No-one seems to take responsibility for knowing how the subject came up.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, the point is that what went on in the department was clearly a succession of administrative failings. Yet the disappointment about this whole report is that at the end of the day no-one is responsible. Indeed, there is not even negligence, merely errors of judgment. That is clearly nowhere near good enough if one wants to get to the bottom of this fiasco, let alone to make sure it does not happen again. The only appropriate way that can be achieved is by establishing a select committee and ensuring that the proper processes are followed, that the failings are properly identified and that the system starts to work. But all we have here is pointing to a whole range of things that went wrong but then saying, `Well, it's no-one's fault in particular; indeed, it's no-one's fault'. That, I would have thought, is a contradiction in terms.

         In no way does this report absolve or exonerate the Minister. It quite clearly was outside Professor Pearce's terms of reference, as we always said it was. Senator Collins, of course, always wanted to maintain that somehow this document would clear him. It does nothing of the sort. In fact, it seems to clear the department, even though it identifies a number of problems. But it certainly does not get Senator Collins off the hook. In view of what Senator Collins has said today, I would have thought he has made a number of major concessions about his responsibilities—

        Senator Collins would have us believe that because it mentions a $500 deposit fee, that ought to automatically—we are alleging—make him aware of the rest of the context. Of course, it should. The Minister should have been acutely aware of the procedure that was being followed in this instance. The Minister is paid handsomely to be a policy expert. He is supposed to draw on his accumulated experience. He is supposed to know what the process is all about. He is the one who is passing ultimate judgment on it when he initiates the procedure by signing the determination. Yet, for reasons never explained, the Minister did nothing.

        I have made the point several times that this is not a process issue, this is a policy issue; advisers are there to advise. If the Minister has an office full of people who do not have any idea or recollection of the history of tender processes in communication, what is the point? He might as well just close his eyes and sign every piece of paper that comes along. Quite clearly, advisers are critical of the process and if they are not, they might as well all be on leave permanently. The fact is that the Minister had an adviser—

In fact, he considers it to be an error of judgment, and just that. I think, considering the consequences, we can consider it to be quite a large error of judgment.

         The reasons for not including a deposit requirement were:  it might deter new media players; the provision in the Broadcasting Services Act for ABA and TPC scrutiny of successful bidders; the winning bidders only won the right to be considered and would not automatically obtain a licence, and they would have to pay the full amount within a relatively short time frame of 30 days. Clearly, the department did not foresee the consequences. Very obviously, it did not foresee the consequences.

         The debate about this issue has become focused almost exclusively on whether the Minister should be sacked. This is obviously a very important question. As I said last Tuesday during the discussion of a matter of public importance relating to this matter, the Democrats we believe that any Minister should resign if he makes a serious error which he had sufficient information to avoid making. On the evidence in this report the Democrats do not believe that the Minister's resignation is warranted. On balance, the error appears to lie with the department. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility, as we defined it, demands that the Minister get on with cleaning up this mess.

However, given the findings in this report the Democrats believe that the objectives I have stated would be best served by ministerial continuity. Senator Collins now intimately knows, I should imagine, the pitfalls in his portfolio and will therefore hopefully be much more skilled in avoiding them. A new Minister would have to start from scratch.

         What this report reveals is that the Minister will have to improve the running of his office, and if we have a look at page 15 we will find that out. The Democrats remain convinced that the Minister must take a much harder look at the policies pursued by his department which we believe have been significantly at odds with the Government's policy and with the wishes of this Parliament. In saying that, I confine my criticism to the Department's handling of communications policy.

         —Before lunch the Minster for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, suggested to the Senate that this document was a report which was put together to determine whether he should resign. That is an extraordinary statement for Senator Collins to make. He obviously did not even get as far as page 1, or maybe he got as far as page 1 but his memory became rather selective. On page 1 of his report, Professor Pearce says:

        That clearly establishes that this document cannot, in any sense of the word, be seen to be an excuse for, or a vindication of, the Minister's own incompetence. Nor does it allow Senator Collins to escape the consequences of his responsibility as a Minister. His responsibility as a Minister is to oversee his department and to answer to this Parliament. It is our responsibility in this Parliament to see that he answers to us, and to see that he is held accountable for what happens within his department.

         Let us go through this report and see how it, in itself, raises issues that go right to the heart of Senator Collins's ability as a Minister, and his ability to discharge his obligations not just in regard to his department, but here—to answer for that department in this chamber. One of the interesting things about this report is that it highlights the fact that the advice, the minute, that was given to the Minister sat in his office for 14 days. I am not saying that every bit of correspondence that comes into the office of a senator gets turned around within 14 days. It would be grossly untrue to say that. However, when one gets the single most important piece of paper that is likely to cross one's desk, at least in the space of that month, if not perhaps in the space of the first six months of that year, one might want to have a look.

         We might even give Senator Collins the benefit of the doubt and say that if it was sitting on his desk for 14 days maybe he was actually considering it. That is the most charitable thing we can say about Senator Collins. But I do not think he was considering it. The document in question, which is attached to this report as appendix 3, says some interesting things. At the bottom of the first page of the document, it says:

        The minute then goes on to outline the other considerations:

        These other considerations are the submission of an adequate industry plan (with the possibility of a plan being imposed as a licence condition if the submitted plan is inadequate), approval from the Trade Practices Commission as required by the Act and possible ABA consideration of the suitability of the applicant.

        There is absolutely no reference at all to a deposit. It makes it very clear that it is price and price alone, subject to those other considerations and to no other considerations. It is very clear from that, that if Senator Collins had read this minute, and it is only a two-page minute, he might have had cause—a reasonable person might have had cause—to say, `Maybe I should ask about the possibility of a deposit. We have done it with the others. Maybe I should ask about it here'. But no, this minute sat there for 14 days and Senator Collins did not even think to ask. I remember once asking a colleague of mine in the Queensland State Parliament, a very successful Minister—

A good Minister requires his department to perform. A good Minister always keeps his department under scrutiny'. Senator Collins's explanation for this matter, as honourable senators will be well aware by now, is that he had a lot of other documents crossing his desk.

He ensured that the delegated legislation that was made was absolutely and thoroughly put together. He had a hallmark for being a person very attentive to the documents.

         Senator Bourne said that, in her opinion, we need some ministerial continuity. That assumes that the Minister's track record to date has been one that obliges some degree of confidence in his ability to continue to perform the job. In looking at Senator Collins's degree of competence and at how well his track record stands up to scrutiny, we should remember that his big boast when he became a Minister was, `If I can't get waterfront reform right in the space of 12 months, I will resign'. On national television he said, `I'll resign if I can't fix the waterfront in 12 months'. Just this week we received a report showing that the cost of loading a 20-foot container in Melbourne has fallen just $4.24 in the space of the two-plus years that Senator Collins had to fix the waterfront.

I have not heard anybody here today say that he is not. But having said that, Opposition senators then tackled the task of trying to undo his report. First of all, they said that it does not talk about what is required for ministerial responsibility. Of course it does not because Professor Pearce was not asked to deal with that topic.

        That has great significance to the question of whether Senator Collins ought to resign. I have heard him say, `Well, if the whole department, the whole system, is in a state of disrepair, if I have let it get out of order, out of control, and the officers are just absolutely awful, then of course I am responsible for that department'.

         Professor Pearce has put this down to an error of judgment not, as I said before, to negligence, a want of care, tiredness or anything else; just a wrong judgment, and we can all make wrong judgments. Paragraph 47 states:

        That was what the wrong judgment was. On the basis of this report, how can we condemn the Minister? How can we condemn the department? How can we condemn the officers of the department? What we can say is: there was an error of judgment; is there something we can put into operation which will prevent further errors of judgment? That is what this discussion should be all about, but it will not be. It will be a fruitless, dead, tired argument about whether Senator Collins ought to resign, which he is not going to do. We all know that. According to this report, there is no basis for his doing that.

         We are faced with a problem of probably the greatest bungle in electronic media policy making in this country since the introduction of TV in 1956. I have listened to Senator Collins and Senator Bourne, and I find it hard to believe that no-one appears to have been responsible for this incident. The Minister does not appear to have been responsible. The department seems to have made an error of judgment. The Minister's staff seem to have been completely exonerated of any suggestion of careless work. From Senator Bourne's comments, we can see that she does not seem to feel that the Minister has any particular responsibility for the administration of his department. In her opinion, the Minister has been the victim of a malicious and conniving department which wants to put forward its own views.

         On the evidence that is published in this report, one can come to very different conclusions. For example, as Senator Cooney related, Professor Pearce came to the conclusion in paragraph 55 that the inquiry had not revealed any systemic deficiency in the department's practices, nor had it revealed a general want of capability in any officers of the department. What we saw in a sense, as Professor Pearce said, was simply an error of judgment. I put to the Minister that this report shows a department with very shabby and very careless practices. One only has to turn to paragraph 15, which states:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I commenced the inquiry by examining the relevant departmental files. It could not be said that these were in as good a state of presentation as one normally expects from departmental files.

Professor Pearce apparently has the original document, and in paragraph 21 he states:

        Great paperwork by a well-run department!  When one goes through this document one finds on every page prize examples of departmental failure and sloppy paperwork. Then we get to the Minister's office—no wonder the department is so sloppy because the Minister's office is so sloppy in its paperwork. Senator Collins should have a look at paragraph 29, which states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The minute was hand delivered to the Minister's office on 4 January 1993. It was not logged-in in the normal fashion.

However, I am informed that there is no record of this having occurred and the document cannot at present be found.

        We have here an example of the department being unable to find the actual basis on which the original determination was drafted. This determination went through various drafts, but when the department looked back and tried to check its origin it found it very difficult to find who drafted it and where. The document then appeared in the Minister's office and was not logged in. But we then find that the document was read by one of the Minister's staffers. That staffer apparently gave the document to the Minister and said it was okay to sign.

I will tell the Senate what that Minister should have done. If the Minister was not happy with the briefing he was given he should have called over the officers of his department and asked to be taken very carefully through the particular document. But, of course, the Minister did not do that. As far as the Minister was concerned this was just another piece of paper which some unnamed adviser had apparently said was okay to sign and that was exactly what the Minister did.

         This really focuses on the role of the Minister and his role in dealing with important bits of paper which pass over his desk. This is where I profoundly differ with the emphasis of Senator Bourne's speech. I believe the Minister cannot be absolved from responsibility in this area. When documents of high public controversy pass over his desk, the Minister has a key responsibility to satisfy himself that the document is sound in every respect. That is what the Minister failed to do. That is why I believe Professor Pearce said at the start of the report:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

         This is a matter of great seriousness; it is not trivial.

It will also go to the heart of what particular role a department has and what actions should be taken in a department which has clearly failed, I believe, in a number of key areas. There is nothing in the Pearce report which shows that any action will be taken in the department.

         In the months to come I will be interested to inquire at the Senate estimates committees how many of the officers in this department received performance-based pay bonuses. That will be a very interesting exercise. It will be interesting to get the Minister's answer as to whether the senior officers in this department, whose paperwork was so sloppy and who—at least in Professor Pearce's own words—were responsible for a major error of judgment, receive these very generous performance-based pay rises.

        Professor Pearce specifically says that he has nothing to do with the Minister's responsibility in this matter, only with the department's responsibility. The Minister has been very critical of the Opposition criticising this report in any way and says that, because we do, we are criticising Professor Pearce. That is not true, and the Minister really cannot get away with that. Bearing in mind that we cannot look at the Minister's responsibility, that we can only look at the department's responsibility, let us see whether we agree with some of the evidence that Professor Pearce has put before us. He starts off by saying:

        It could not be said these were in as good a state of presentation as one normally expects from departmental files. Papers do not always appear chronologically, folios are not always numbered and officers who have accessed them have not so indicated on the file cover. It is also to be observed that notes have not always been made of the outcome of meetings. These deficiencies were explained as flowing from the extraordinary pressure under which the officers of the Department were working in bringing the . . . scheme to fruition . . . senior officers were required to work very long hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Pearce goes on making excuses for the officers because they were under pressure. That is never an excuse; it can never be considered an excuse for inefficiency. Regularly in this place, officers are under pressure. Regularly in this place, people work long hours. We senators work long hours and, indeed, our all night sittings do not absolve us from responsibility. Just because one is tired does not mean that one absolves oneself from all responsibility.

        The events in question occurred five or six months ago and at that time when the officers were weary and were in many cases about to go on leave. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that my questions have often elicited an `I cannot recall' response.

        An efficient department and an efficient office of the Minister said, `We were all too tired; about to go on leave; it's been a gruelling session; we didn't write it down; we didn't do it efficiently; we didn't make the necessary notes; we didn't indicate what occurred at the meetings; and we can't remember—we can't recall'. Professor Pearce said that he had received full cooperation from the Minister's staff, but they could not remember. He believed, quite legitimately, that they could not remember. They were not efficient, they had not written down a thing—how could they remember something that happened six months earlier? He went on to say:

         He deals with the urgency surrounding this. The officers of the department wanted it all done before the election. Professor Pearce says that the urgency was one of the problems of the mess-up. The urgency was because they wanted it done prior to the election. He said that they sent the determination off to the Attorney-General's Department and two senior officers of the Minister's department believed—assumed—that it would go to the Office of Commercial Law within the Attorney-General's Department.

That is not so. I am not being critical of Professor Pearce; I am saying that I do not agree with him. The Minister's office was absolutely irresponsible, inefficient and just incompetent.

        What the Minister should have said to his staff—and what Professor Pearce did not refer to, because he did not have a term of reference that enabled him to do so—is, `What am I likely to get my head kicked in on? I want brief myself on that. It is my responsibility'. Those were the words that the Minister used. I would not use them. I would say to my staff or my department, `What is in this that could cause me problems? What is controversial? Brief me.' The Minister did not do that. That was his prime mistake—his irresponsibility. He signed a document that he did not read fully—he says himself he did not read it fully—because he had a memo that said, `Okay, sign'.

He is not absolved of any responsibility because he has had a gruelling year and has been working for six months with only one day off. This Minister would not know what work was. If he talked about two years without a day off he might be talking about something more applicable, but to whinge in here that he was tired and had had only one day off in six months is not something that I would be proud of if I were him.

         Again the excuse was that the Minister had been in the portfolio only a short time and was the fourth incumbent in a period of two months. Being a new Minister is no excuse not to accept responsibility and say, `The buck stops with me'. When a medico sees a patient he does not have an excuse if he is new and he is tired—or, as in this case, if it is Christmas Eve and there is an election coming up. These are the excuses that this Minister has been using in the Senate. He accepts the money and, as he himself says, `If you accept the money, then you must accept the responsibility'. That is no less than the Senate accepts, and expects of any Minister in this place.

         These are the points that I think need to be traversed. The judgment in the Australian Capital Equity Pty Ltd case sets out the details of the determination that was made for the tender process for MDS licences. It sets out that one determination was made on 1 October 1992, in advance of the power conferred by section 92A of the Broadcasting Services Act, which was conferred on 5 October. It then cites section 92A of the Act:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For the purposes of subsection 92A(1) of the Act, a licence granted under the Act for a multi-point distribution station referred to in column 2 and described in column 3 of item 66 in schedule 1 is a licence of a kind for which the Minister may determine a price-based allocation system.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 9 December 1992, a press notice invited tenders to be submitted for those licences. It was called a price-based allocation. On 7 January 1993, the Minister in writing revoked the determination made in October 1992, known as determination No. 1, and at the same time, under the heading `Radiocommunications: Allocation of multi-point distribution system licences', determination No. 2, determined another tender-based allocation system for granting multi-point distribution station licences.

        The clause then goes on to provide that any tender not accompanied by the deposit would not be a valid tender. This particular tender for MDS licences is price-based. It contained the five per cent deposit. The questions that need to be asked are these: who were the people who drew up the determination for the Minister to sign on 7 January 1993? What processes did they go through to determine that there needed to be a deposit paid on that occasion—

In the case of the satellite licences, the Minister had no such option; he was required by the Parliament to have a price-based system.

         When we go further into the report we find that that course of action was followed, but the draft was sent off to the Attorney-General's Department and addressed to the secretary. Officers then said that they presumed someone from the commercial section would give some legal advice, but it did not take place. Only the drafting people looked at it. Why is that so? If there was a presumption that it was sent in that form, why did nobody follow it up? Why did nobody ask for the legal opinion if that is what they anticipated should happen?

         Also, what procedure was followed with regard to the MDS licences? Presumably there had been discussion about why it was thought proper to have a five per cent deposit for the MDS licences; it was felt correct that this was the formula to be followed. If one looks at FM licences which occurred in an earlier period, one finds that a $10,000 deposit was required even for those licences, as distinct from a fee.

I am often given documents by my staff; the documents are submitted to me for signature. I do not simply sign them. I read them, and if there are things wrong in them that I do not believe are consistent with precedent or the things that I believe are right, I ask about it and have it altered if it is wrong. It is not good enough for me in my office to say that I do not have time to read things and therefore I will just sign them. I do not, and it is not good enough for the Minister to say that either.

         As I said, the terms of reference given to Professor Pearce to investigate these matters are simply too narrow for enough information to be brought before the Senate for anybody to make a proper decision or a proper finding. In this matter it is simply a question of making sure that the taxpayers of Australia get good government. Governments make policy; bureaucrats administer policy. When an Act requires the determination of the Minister, that is exactly what it means. The Minister is charged with the responsibility of making a decision and putting it into practice. It is not the responsibility of the bureaucrat; it is the responsibility of the Minister.

         Whereas Professor Pearce concludes at the end of his report that officers in the department made an error of judgment, that is a perfectly proper finding for him to make because he has seen the evidence. But it is irrelevant to the question of whether or not the Minister exercised ministerial responsibility and sufficient care in carrying out the responsibility he was charged with by the legislation which required him to make a determination—not the bureaucrats to make the determination; the Minister to make the determination. That is the question.

         Many more questions need to be answered—with regard to the precedent that was set and with regard to the people who were involved in both sets of tender documents—to ascertain why one lot required a five per cent deposit and one lot did not. We simply cannot deduce that there was some general ethos in the department that somehow a five per cent deposit was a hurdle. It clearly was not. There was no consistent view.

         What we have not seen is why the difference. We can achieve that only if we have a proper Senate inquiry to adduce all the evidence so that a decision can then be made. The aim at the end of the day is to ensure that Ministers know what ministerial responsibility is about and bureaucrats know what their responsibility is about in terms of administering policy made by executive government. Those are the questions that the Senate ought properly inquire into and get to the bottom of. What flows from the answers to those questions is another issue altogether.

         I know that Senator Bourne made some statements earlier today, but I ask the Democrats to look at those questions that I have set out to the Senate in the last 20 minutes. We require answers to them. At the end of the day it is the Senate's responsibility—the responsibility of all of us who are elected and who are not part of the Executive—to ensure that taxpayers' money is wisely spent and that we get peace, welfare and good government. A Labor Party backbencher is no more a member of executive government than you or I. It is our responsibility to see that we carry out what we are elected to the Parliament to do. I sincerely believe that on this occasion the best and, indeed, only way that can now be done is to have a Senate committee of inquiry and ascertain all the facts, which are much broader than the terms of reference that were given to Professor Pearce.

He appears to me to have had an extremely compassionate view of the human dimensions of all this. He refers to the stress, the tiredness and the need for leave.

         In some respects, it is quite reassuring to know that a former ombudsman has this view of the world, this compassion, but as a new leader I am very conscious of the whole notion of office administration. Despite Professor Pearce's acceptance of the explanations, I am quite concerned about his findings and the comments he makes regarding departmental files and the way the Minister's office was administered. The Minister himself acknowledged this a couple of weeks ago. This report is quite damning, in my view—leaving aside the acceptance of the explanations—of departmental procedures and the Minister's office administration.

         —Ministerial advisers. In the short time that I have been here, many of the ministerial advisers that I have had to deal with often appear to be more political appointments than people who are across the breadth of the policy issues. At paragraph 52, Professor Pearce comments:
        </para>

        The comparatively recent phenomenon of Ministers having advisers on their staff does not remove this obligation from a Department.

       <para>
        This obligation is for departmental officers to bring matters of significance to the attention of the Minister. I wonder whether a situation has evolved where so many assumptions are made about what the role of that adviser ought to be that departmental advisers need to think more clearly about whether they are fulfilling their role or whether they are relying on advisers. Despite the fact that advisers may say that they are much more likely to be concerned with political policy issues than process, I wonder whether this delineation remains clear enough. Professor Pearce, at paragraph 54, states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In my view the conclusion is inescapable that it was a mistake for the departmental officers not to bring certain aspects of the tendering process to the attention of the Minister.

        He goes on to say:

        I find that an error of judgement was made but that is all that it was—an error of judgement. I find no basis whatsoever for any suggestion that the departmental officers deliberately failed to advise the Minister that the payment of a deposit was not part of the tendering process.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what we asked Professor Pearce to look at. That is what he has concluded. I do not believe that there has been any conspiracy in this matter, but I do believe that we should be concerned about the exposure that we have in front of us of lack of due process and lack of due responsibility. I do not believe that that exposure on this matter is sufficient to warrant the resignation of this Minister. We still have an open mind on the matter of an inquiry. As honourable senators would know, we are awaiting the documents on that.

I might add that the reason I immediately recognised this is that I happen to think this is one of the most serious errors that were made, and I want to talk about that.

         I will return to paragraph 27 which Senator Bishop left out and make a few comments. I said a couple of weeks ago—and I have turned out to be right—that in my view the real cause of this very serious problem could probably be likened to an aircraft accident. I said half jokingly that I should have had the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation look at this matter, and I will tell the Senate why. They are system experts and they really know their stuff. Major airline accidents have always got one thing in common. A series of events occur, and fortunately it happens rarely, each one of which does not seem to be a major problem at the time but because they occur together a disaster results. Honourable senators should read this report. Senator Kernot was right to say that it is highly critical, but only for anyone who has bothered to read all of it.

Professor Pearce makes a highly critical comment that these assertions `were not well founded'. Senator Bishop skipped over this.

         This report has indicated that a whole lot of errors did occur, which at the time did not seem to be major problems to the officers. If I wanted to single one out, and I do, it is the very issue that Senator Bishop tried to skip over. What appeared to me to be a serious error in this matter, from my end of it, was that it was clear that the officers had conscientiously and carefully attempted to implement the Government's policy.

         I ask Senator Kernot to look at the Attorney-General's advice and the clues in there and it will be found that this was the department's `preferred position'. The officers had laid down all these hurdles and they had sent them off to the Attorney-General's Department. Have a look at the hurdles, one of which was to have a look at the viability of the company. The department sent a letter back saying, `You can't do any of this'. The letter did not say, `You can't put a deposit on', but it said, `You can't put any of these conditions on'.

         What then happened—and this is pure speculation on my part, but I publicly speculated about it—in terms of the succession of errors, was that the officers, as Professor Pearce sets out in the report, then sent their readjusted model to the Attorney-General's Department. There was an assumption made that the commercial law section of the department looked at it, and it did not. Professor Pearce, in a very critical comment, said, `That was not a well founded assumption'. But every senator on the other side of the chamber has ignored that. It is a very important omission.

         I believed all along that what would be found at the end of the day was that these officers conscientiously went about delivering the Government's policy—or Parliament's policy. In fact, the Opposition wanted to go further than we were going to go with it. The officers clearly got the determination checked by the Attorney-General's Department for completeness. They had an officer from DITAC working with them who attended to all the industry matters, which were done very well and properly done. They sent it off to the Attorney-General's Department and they assumed that it was going to commercial scrutiny. What has been obvious to me from day one is that it did not get that commercial scrutiny. That is a serious error in hindsight.

Since this happened, it is not intended—and this is contained, as Senator Alston knows, in the Broadcast Services Act—for the department to have much of an ongoing role now in tender processes. The Spectrum Management Agency is going to take over all the spectrum management tenders, and it was always intended that the ABA should handle all the future licences.

I gave mine, and I think it is the real one. Ministers resign—have a look at the record—on three grounds: firstly, if they lose the confidence of the Prime Minister and their colleagues—and I have not; secondly, if they commit major personal improprieties, either inside or outside Parliament—and I have not; or, thirdly, if they lie, if they mislead the Parliament. What this report does, if it does nothing else, is indicate that every single thing I have told this Senate for three weeks was honest and truthful.

        The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to extend the wool debt repayment schedule from seven years to eight years. Honourable senators may remember that when the commission was established in 1991 it inherited a $2.7 billion debt and a 4.6 million bale stockpile, and was given seven years to repay the debt and dispose of the stockpile. However, a lack of buyers and a downturn in wool prices prompted industry fears that the Wool Realisation Commission would be forced into a fire sale of the stockpile wool. The Federal Government responded by promising to extend the repayment program from seven years to eight years, meaning that no wool would have to be sold from the stockpile next year and the Government could determine repayments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While the Federal coalition welcomes the extension, we believe that the strict debt reduction schedule should be abolished, thereby reassuring a still uncertain market that there will be no fire sale. The fact that this Bill is before us underscores the plight of the wool industry from the woolgrowers, their families and their communities all the way up to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission.

         The figures speak for themselves. Last year, the loss to the average woolgrower business was nearly $40,000; this year it will be close to $34,000; next year, ABARE says, it will be over $34,000; in other words, an average of $107,000 in just three years. Even worse, the slide in property values has reduced equity and, in so doing, reduced the capacity of many woolgrowers to demonstrate viability, thereby making it harder for them to borrow and harder to survive.

         The reality is that Australia's total rural debt has blown out from $10.6 billion in 1987 to $15.6 billion last year, and it is still climbing despite the drop in interest rates. This debt, assuming an average rate of 14 per cent after bank and other charges, means that the total farm interest bill is just over $2 billion a year. That is more than the total net farm value of farm production this year.

         Complicating matters is the fact that the current stockpile of 3.9 million bales has barely shifted in the last nine months and continues to hang over the industry. The wool pipeline is full. So full, in fact, that wool is being held in brokers' or buyers' sheds around the country and in various forms at other points in the pipeline. Over the years wool has lost market share to cotton and synthetics, declining from some 10 per cent of the total market share for fibre in 1950-51 to just 4.4 per cent of an admittedly larger market in 1991-92.

         During the years of the reserve price scheme, particularly towards the end, production was encouraged by the relative security of the industry and the prices that farmers felt they would receive for their product. The Australian sheep population hit a high of 173 million in 1990. With improved productivity in the industry and the higher fleece weights, on average, production soared to unprecedented levels. However, last year total sheep numbers fell to 151 million.

         In the face of encroaching debt and relatively low prices, farmers are voluntarily making difficult decisions about off-loading, not breeding or even contracting numbers. The forecast total production figure for greasy wool this year is 851 million kilograms, while next year the figure is expected to come down to 805 million—still above the long-term average. Some estimates put it as low as 700 million kilograms. Fortunately, this provides scope for wool to be sold from the stockpile, without depressing sales, through the auction system.

         The Federal coalition believes that the Federal Government could and should do more for the wool industry. For example, the Federal Government could slacken the strings controlling the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and give it more flexibility to go out and market stockpile wool. It could also remove the transparency in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's operations so that buyers do not know how much the commission is selling or at what price and, by virtue of these two factors, what their competitors are up to.

         By not abandoning the debt repayment schedule, the Federal Government has lost an important opportunity to reassure the market and instil much-needed confidence. Instead, the Federal Government has chosen to extend the repayment deadline. While this extension acknowledges the difficulties facing the industry, it also risks a burst in market confidence, followed by an even greater uncertainty in 12 months time. Ironically, the sooner we can restore confidence, the sooner prices are likely to recover, and the faster the debt can be repaid. Growers have a vested interest in the rapid repayment of the debt because they are stuck with the costs of servicing the debt and stockpiling the wool.

         Along with the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr John Anderson, I welcome the Federal Government's offer of $50 million for interest rate subsidies under the exceptional circumstances provision of the RAS. However, is it enough? As I mentioned earlier, Australia's farm debt is now a staggering $15.6 billion, and interest payments on that debt amount to around $2 billion a year. If the new interest rate subsidies reach every woolgrower, and it is estimated that about 90 per cent need them, the subsidies will be worth only $1,000 a farmer—a paltry figure, considering the generosity displayed by this Federal Labor Government to waterside workers, the better cities program and, as we have seen in recent days in documents before the Senate, specifically and directly to the trade unions.

         The Federal Government also talks about helping farmers meet world best practice. It is important to remind the Government that the Australian broadacre farm sector is one of the most productive in the world and that its productivity improvements should be regarded as a model by the rest of the community, and indeed by the world.

         The farm sector has a record of which it can be extremely proud. However, I would like to draw to the attention of honourable senators one of the most fundamental issues facing the sector—that is, the lack of profitability and its potential to hold back any future productivity gains. The Federal Government continues to sidestep the fact that taxes on farming inputs amount to a three to five per cent penalty in our international competitiveness. It is an issue that the Government must confront, not simply in international trade competitiveness but in our capacity to hold at bay imports from countries such as New Zealand. No business can consistently afford to give its competitors that sort of advantage. The reality is that a Federal coalition government would have removed this burden.

         According to Treasury figures, farm sector inputs are taxed at over $1 billion; another $1.3 billion dollars is levied in the food processing sector; and the Australian farm pays about $8,000 in cost inputs resulting from non-rebatable tax costs on production. In the light of these figures, the Federal coalition pleads with the Federal Government to ensure the survival of the farm sector both for the people involved and, indeed, for the nation. I trust that the Government will address the many structural issues shackling the farm sector and finally give it the opportunity to operate in a long-term, internationally competitive environment.

         —Despite its current declining fortunes, the Australian wool industry still has a massive impact on the Australian economy and, therefore, on the living standards of every Australian. The legislation we are dealing with this evening in relation to that very important industry—the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993—as has been indicated by my colleague Senator Tambling, is not being opposed by the coalition. That does not mean that we necessarily agree with the intent of this legislation—in fact, that is why Senator Tambling has moved an amendment—nor do we agree that the legislation can provide the results which we believe are essential at this time for the wool sector.

         This Bill does no more than re-arrange, by delaying, the debt repayment program. It is no more than a short-sighted delaying action when the Government should be tackling the big picture of debt repayment scheduling. While, obviously, growers and the industry in general will in part welcome the payment extension from seven to eight years that is delivered by this legislation, it is not an answer to the problems, and that is equally recognised by the industry.

         Being grateful for being handed small mercies is no solution to the stress the industry is feeling. But the passage of this Bill is necessary, despite its massive deficiencies, as a stopgap. The coalition is, therefore, in a catch-22 situation. If we do not support the Bill, the repayment time frame will remain at seven years. Supporting the legislation is the least damaging alternative of two not very practical options. The coalition's view remains that the strict debt repayment schedule should be abolished if the wool industry is to regain any confidence and surety in its dealings.

         There is no point covering old ground tonight about the destructive decisions which led to the borrowing, which left us with $2.3 billion dollars worth of debt on the part of growers and the debilitating wool stockpile. These have been debated ad nauseam and it is to be hoped that responsibility has now been accepted by those involved. I simply remind the present Minister that as long ago as August 1989, when everything still appeared rosy, I warned the Government in a question to the then Minister, Senator Button, of gathering storm clouds. Sadly, that warning was ignored. However, beyond that experience of recent years relating to the collapse of the reserve price scheme, successive governments have, over many years, brought the industry to its present financial difficulties.

         As I have said numerous times in this Parliament, the interrelated mechanisms of tariff protection and centralised wage fixing have for most of this century caused a transfer of incomes, savings and wealth from farmers and miners in general, and woolgrowers in particular, to urban industries, their owners and employees. One consequence of that is that woolgrowers do not now have the store of savings which would otherwise be available to them to tide them over the current crisis. This has been made worse by this Labor Government's failure to have an adequate IED scheme operating in more recent years. Another consequence is that it raises the question of justice and equity in the face of any criticism of suggestions of taxpayer-funded assistance for woolgrowers in their present difficulties.

         As colleagues would well recognise, I am the last person to advocate subsidies for any group, especially of a sort that would hide future market realities from producers and encourage uneconomic production. However, provided long-term viability is encouraged, assistance for woolgrowers in the current circumstances could be seen as quite fair and simply repayment for the subsidy the wool industry has provided to the urban community for some 90 years.

         The crisis caused by past soaring wool prices, the debt past decisions created and the stockpile have masked these other concerns and goals, which must be addressed just as urgently. We cannot negotiate a global strategy for the Australian wool industry until we deal with quality control, marketing and, crucially, identify new markets for the commodity at the same time as we are negotiating how to deal with the stockpile and the debt repayment. This is no time to be submerged totally in the crisis management of the debt and the stockpile, although finding the correct solution to the stockpile problem is of paramount importance.

         It is perceived that wool costs more, takes more care and time to look after and does not have the resilience and longevity of man-made fibres. A lack of awareness of cool wool has continued the perception that wool is too warm to wear most of the year and inside. This was identified and stated quite clearly by the International Wool Secretariat more than two years ago. Barely a month goes by without information being released to the media about new man-made fibres which are seen as a replacement for wool in mid and lower price range garment manufacture.

         While marketing can hold back the tide of change to some extent, it is definitely time to look for new markets away from clothes, especially away from mid-range clothing. We must also face up to the fact that our local wool advertising campaigns have not been the success that we would have hoped. The `Get real, get wool' campaign, which we are told cost a small fortune to produce, received accolades from the advertising industry but made little impact on consumers.

We have a major problem when all the available research shows that, while consumers recognise the Woolmark label, they have no idea what it actually means.

This is a direct government responsibility and relates to my earlier remarks regarding the many years of income transfer from woolgrowers to others. At long last, the costly burden of tariffs is being lifted from the woolgrowers' weary backs. But this Labor Government, beholden to its union mates, continues to allow archaic industrial relations arrangements to persist, which reduce productivity and therefore increase production costs throughout Australia. This detrimentally affects woolgrowers' indirect costs.

         More direct are the specific industrial relations practices in the shearing industry which reduce efficiency and increase costs.

They also have to bear the burden of a high level of input taxes, which the coalition would have removed had we now been in government and which was referred to a few moments ago by my colleague Senator Tambling.

         The Government continues to drag the chain on all these essential reforms. If this sounds like I am digressing from the legislation, far from it; these are simply examples of how we are failing to look at the big picture. As long as we do so, the wool crisis will stay exactly that—a major crisis. This legislation is no different. It is a bandaid and nothing more. The coalition, therefore, refuses to do more than simply allow its passage. To do anything else in the current circumstances would be to make the problem worse. However, I conclude by making the point strongly that answering the difficulties with non-solutions is a pathetic way for a government to go about its business.

         Since then, sales from the stockpile have virtually ceased, with stockpile sales for the season to 30 April totalling 110,000 bales, worth in the vicinity of $58 million. During 1991-92, storage costs were approximately $26 million and interest charges were $258 million. On a per bale basis this is $8 for storage and approximately $60 for interest. As per the AWRC's inventory, the value of the stockpile at the end of 1991-92 totalled $2.4 billion, or approximately $585 per bale. I do not think the value of the wool in the stockpile would be anywhere near that figure because, besides the fact that we have a debt, the stockpile is deteriorating. The wool is losing its springiness due to double dumping. In addition, it is losing its yolk and is being stained by the steel bands around the bales, which are rusting.

         The basis of this Bill is the Government's original request that the AWRC meet a minimum schedule of repayments over seven years. This was later replaced, at the industry's urging, with a cumulative debt reduction scheme, which provided for a maximum outstanding debt at the end of each year of the program as follows: in 1992, $2,698 million—in other words, $2.69 billion; in 1993, $2.398 billion; in 1994, $1.998 billion; in 1995, $1.498 billion; in 1996, $948 million; in 1997, $398 million; and then by 1998 it would go to zero. That is the position we were in. Now, with the serious problems that the Australian wool industry has, this Government, after much pressure, has decided to bring in this Bill which simply extends the repayment by one year, and one year only.

         I would like to challenge the fairly common view that `greedy' woolgrowers are to blame for the collapse of the reserve price scheme and, therefore, are entirely responsible for the wool debt. According to this view, the key issue for wool policy is how to get woolgrowers to repay the debt incurred in amassing the wool stockpile and not the stockpile itself. First, the wool debt is an irretrievable cost and, secondly, we have a very big stockpile overhanging the market and affecting the market itself. I cannot see at this stage how imposing additional costs on woolgrowers for debt repayments could possibly be in the national interest.

So it was not entirely the woolgrowers who ran the whole situation.

         The Wool Marketing Act 1987 passed a large measure of the control over the setting of the minimum reserve price to the wool industry. It also enabled the Government to continue to use its powers to collect the wool tax and make the scheme compulsory. A decision to allow the MRP to be set so very high was made by the Government in May 1988 and it was implemented on 1 July 1988. I have raised this issue in the Senate ad nauseam, but it is still relevant. A decision was made in May to lift the reserve price from around 700c a kilo to 870c per kilo. By 1 July, the indicator, which was 1,300c per kilo when this decision was made, had dropped to 1,000c per kilo. There was only a 130c difference between the minimum reserve price and the price indicator and it was a disaster.

         The Government stood by for two years, from 1 July 1988 to 1 July 1990, without interfering at all—it had the power to interfere, as did the wool corporation—and the wool industry collapsed. The wool corporation was made up of non-woolgrowers, so we have to finally realise that the moral responsibility of all this debt does not lie entirely with the woolgrowers. It is a problem that has to be addressed.

It was when the general body of woolgrowers wanted the reserve price to be higher that we ran into trouble. As I said, it was obvious that, before the price of 870c per kilo was implemented on 1 July, we would be running into trouble.

Much water has passed under the bridge, but what still remains is that the wool industry is in dire straits. Some areas are in even more difficulty because, compounded upon the low commodity prices, they also have drought, although we are not discussing that tonight.

         I was pleased to hear some of the points that were made by those opposite. However, I would disagree with their suggestion that we abolish the retention of time limits on the legislation. That would send the wrong signals to everybody. It does not answer the question of how and from whom would the debt be recovered. We are extending the debt repayment by 12 months because the $118 million that is due for debt repayment in 1993-94 is already to hand. It means there is no need for the commission to go out and actually have to sell wool in this next financial year to face its debt repayments. If we removed the time limit from the legislative schedule it would remove the need for the commission to put wool on to the market, but we would be increasing the debt, because the debt has to be serviced. If we chose not to sell the wool, who would service that debt and how would it be serviced?  We have not heard about that tonight.

         When the announcement was made about the time extension for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, many people overlooked the point that Senator Panizza just briefly raised; that is, it is the intention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to travel around during the break before the Budget sittings to our wool buying countries. He will not only look at what those countries perceive to be the problems but also encourage them to get back into the marketplace and to buy the product. He will remind them of just how good our product and our industry is. No-one would quibble that wool is the best fibre product available in the marketplace because it is so versatile—it is warm, it is cool and it is everything one could want. However, we need to keep reminding people of that.

That inquiry will be one of the most significant things that has happened in this industry. It is a very important industry to this nation; if our woolgrowers are suffering in this crisis, and we produce the best wool available, I would not like to know what is happening to woolgrowers in other countries. However, at present, our main concern is with woolgrowers here in Australia. This very good package goes some way towards addressing those needs. We should also be aware that these moves have had a lot of support from many grower and farmer organisations in the country. I have much pleasure tonight in supporting this Bill.

No doubt all of us are aware, through either personal experience or from watching television at night, of the crisis that is afflicting people in the drought stricken areas of Australia. I remind all honourable senators that, whether they grow sheep and produce wool in a drought affected area or in an area that is receiving good rainfall, the crisis in the wool industry affects people in the same way, because we have an enormous uncertainty about the price of wool in the future, an enormous debt overhanging the industry and, of course, the problem with the stockpile.

I think he was being quite cynical, but I say to Senator Lewis that my solution to the crisis for wool may, indeed, be found through the review process that is going on into the marketing of wool and the future treatment of the stockpile.

         The solution will not be found by trying to redesign the bureaucracy that has built up around the wool industry, particularly through the Australian Wool Corporation and now the Wool Realisation Commission, but in destroying the bureaucracy around the wool industry and breaking down the industry into units that can be handled not only by growers but also by entrepreneurs who want to find new ways of processing wool, new woollen products and new ways of taking woollen products into new international markets.

         There is absolutely no doubt that the bureaucracy that has surrounded the wool industry in Australia for so long now has ensured that the change that is required to move into a rapidly changing world, and to cope with rapidly changing tastes and rapidly changing economics, has simply not occurred. Most of us know from personal experience that the more distant bureaucracies and large corporations are from their members and constituents, the more inefficient those industries will be.

I said in my contribution to the debate on wool a couple of weeks ago that if the owners of a stockpile of a product, say, Ford motor cars, experience a massive decrease in the demand for motor cars and a massive increase in supply and have a few acres of parking space out in Geelong or somewhere filled with those products, the last thing they will do in trying to sell that stockpile is create a bureaucracy. They will not be looking to funding people who live and work in that bureaucracy with big salaries and telling them to spend X amounts on research and development and X amounts on marketing.

         What one would do if one were dinkum about getting rid of the stockpile, returning some certainty to the industry and returning it to equilibrium, would be to ensure that one had some highly motivated entrepreneurial individuals who were responsible for getting that product into the marketplace and getting a return for it as quickly as possible. One could not do better than getting a couple of thousand hungry used car salesmen out there selling the product.

         There are enormous vested interests built up in this industry and in the Australian Wool Corporation and it is associated bodies. What I am advocating today is that the solution to the problem is to destroy the bureaucracy, to walk over those vested interests and to ensure that the sale of wool and the stockpile in the interim is put in the hands of people who are about selling and getting a return as quickly as possible.

         I must say that my experience in the last couple of months, in talking to woolgrowers and others who are now coming into the business of trying to find new markets, is quite pleasing. Some entrepreneurs I have met, such as those who are associated with the wool insulation business and who are trying to find alternative uses for wool, do not have a good relationship with the Australian Wool Corporation and its associated bodies. This reflects the bureaucratic inertia of such organisations in that those concerned cannot get answers or cooperation from the Wool Corporation because clearly some of the ideas that are being put forward by entrepreneurs are not in the mainstream.

         These people are going behind the back of the realisation commission, behind the back of the Australian Wool Corporation, doing deals with growers, buying wool straight out of sheds and doing deals with overseas mills and, basically, ignoring the bureaucracy that is surrounding the wool industry. If that is what can happen in such a highly structured, centralised bureaucratic system that we have at the moment—if we can have these sorts of entrepreneurs working on the edges of the industry, trying to make a dollar out of solving the crisis—I wonder what could happen if we broke down the massive bureaucracy, got rid of the structure we have at the moment and opened the whole thing up.

         I hope my words have given Senator Austin Lewis a ray of hope. I suggest, particularly in light of the review that the Minister, Mr Crean, announced some weeks ago, that what the industry needs is not just a restructuring of the wool corporation and the setting up of new committees and new bureaucratic structures. Indeed, we should take the opportunity to say we have a real problem, to say that what has happened in the past 20 years has not worked for the industry. If we are going to solve the deep problems of the wool industry for all of rural Australia, we should take this opportunity to make some very radical change.

         What we are talking about tonight has been well laid out by previous speakers. We are trying to extend the period for the debt repayment on our stockpile from seven to eight years and make available $50 million for interest rate subsidies. At a time when we need leadership, direction and a united approach to try to put the wool industry back on track, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill can be classed only as a very small contribution to what is a huge problem.

The whole matter of the wool stockpile, the debt, the drought and everything else associated with the wool industry at the moment can rightly be called a natural disaster of unprecedented length. Here we are in 1993 with the lowest wool prices in 50 years, coupled with Australia's farm debt, now a staggering $15.6 billion, with an annual interest bill in the order of $12 billion. It is almost getting to the stage of what is happening with our Government and its debt.

Let us hope that this 30th review will come up with something which may be of some help.

         We all know that the major problem facing the wool industry at the moment is the stockpile—some 3.9 million bales. Just to give some idea of the magnitude of that, the other day I read that it equates to 11.7 million filing cabinets. Stacked one on top of the other, it would measure 5.9 million metres high, compared with Mount Everest which is a mere 8,848 metres high.

         Who do we blame for all of this? It is very easy to blame the Government and the wool corporation. I suppose that, for starters, they are the ones we should look at. Over the years we have seen the wool corporation and the International Wool Secretariat waste millions of dollars on extravagant and useless wool promotions. I suppose that was fair enough when wool was selling at 1,000c a kilogram. Who amongst the woolgrowers, including myself, was ever going to question the wool corporation?

         Nevertheless, in 1990 I did—at an Agricultural Outlook Conference here in Canberra. I had not been in this place very long. At a private briefing given to us by the chairman of the wool corporation, Hugh Beggs, he said that the wool stockpile then stood at 2.5 million bales. I said, `Are you sure that it is not 3.5 million bales?'. He said, `No, of course it's not'. A week later we found out that it was 3.5 million bales. He not only misled me but he also misled Australia by making that sort of statement. Obviously he was misled, too, because he was reported as saying—a very remarkable quote, which he will probably never put in a frame over the top of his bed—`We are lucky, those of us in the wool industry, in having a product which is almost infinitely marketable'.

         On that same day I also asked whether the wool corporation had a fall-back position if anything went wrong with the reserve price scheme, which was experiencing a bit of drama. At that time the reserve price was about 860c. It had just fallen back to 700c when Mr Kerin said that it was immutable and was never going to be moved. It was amazing to me that a multi-million dollar corporation that had been running the wool industry for so long did not have a fall-back position or an emergency plan.

We all remember the approval of the 870c a kilogram floor price. The money—I hope I declared the fact that I am a woolgrower—that I was paying out of my wool account, which was not all that big, was going into an account to buy back the wool I was selling. When it was reduced to 700c a kilogram, with about three million bales in stock, the situation was quite ridiculous. The iron-clad guarantee that Mr Kerin gave did not last very long; in fact, it eroded very quickly. I have heard of some buyers losing heaps of money. One buyer lost $50 million.

The measures include interest rate subsidies, maintenance of the wool tax, restructuring of the debt and an inquiry. Much of what has been said here tonight has canvassed the broad issues. A good deal of what has been said has a strong element of truth to it in terms of the way the Australian Wool Realisation Commission has operated and the complete failure of the old scheme of reserve price mechanisms.

         It is a bit unfortunate that some people still seem to hark back to those days. In my own State as late as 5 May the agriculture Minister was still suggesting that the reason for the crisis in the wool industry was the changing of that scheme. He made that point to the Victorian Parliament and effectively blamed John Kerin for the crisis in the wool industry. An interesting observation that people make about the crisis in the industry is that people have learnt so little about it.

         It is unfortunate that some people in Victoria, such as  the Premier, have maintained a similar very negative attitude towards the proposals that have been advanced by this Government to address what is obviously a very serious problem. The Premier indicated that he thought the proposals that the Federal Government was bringing forward were no more than a bandaid package. It is little wonder that in Victoria, with the foot-in-mouth approaches that the Premier has taken, the transport Minister is currently organising a challenge against the Premier and is openly canvassing votes within the party room. It is common knowledge that the Premier himself is backgrounding journalists in an attempt to undermine and discredit his own transport Minister.

         Of the approximately 8,000 woolgrowers in Victoria, about 2,000 will be seeking financial assistance this financial year. The crisis is quite pronounced. However, it is not just the woolgrowers who are affected by this crisis. This point has been made by other speakers, but I think it needs to be emphasised, because it is not often addressed in public debate. Australian shearers, for instance, have played a vital role in the development of the wool industry and have a proud record of advancing working conditions for all Australians. Their incomes have also been slashed. Many growers are using the present crisis within the industry to undermine and attack workers' wages and conditions.

I am concerned, however, that the woolgrowers of Australia, and the people who are dependent on them for their living, are being sold short by a government whose penny-pinching attitude will exacerbate the situation in which many of our woolgrowers find themselves at this point in time. Why? Because the Government has taken an attitude that says, `Instead of giving flexibility to the realisation of the stockpile, we are merely going to postpone the crisis for another 12 months by extending the debt repayment schedule for another 12 months'.

         What is desperately needed at this point is quite simply an abandonment of the debt repayment schedule. We need to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we do not flood the market with the wool that is currently in the stockpile; to ensure that we do not depress the prices that farmers are getting for what they produce so that the farmers who are still left in the industry—heaven knows we have lost enough to date—will have a chance to get a decent rate of return.

         That would also allow us to achieve one other thing: at only a very small rate of realisation it is possible for us to set a zero tax for woolgrowers in so far as the Wool Realisation Commission is concerned. That 4 1/2 per cent of tax is worth something like $27 a bale. It is very important that we do everything in our power to maximise the cash flow of our woolgrowers.

         Just a couple of moments ago we heard Senator Carr make a plea on behalf of shearers. I am not going to get into the rights and wrongs of the shearing industry, nor am I going to go into detail about the rates that shearers get, but it is interesting to note, as Senator Panizza interjected, that the rates for shearers have gone up. There are many in this country who would argue that if the rates for shearers had stayed the same, the shearers would actually be making more money than they are now. But the point is this: unless we can maximise the cash flow of the woolgrowers, there will be fewer and fewer shearers working because there will be less opportunity for woolgrowers to pay those shearers to shear the sheep.

That is why those of us on this side support the amendment that has been moved, which points out that the inflexibility of the Government's approach to this problem, the retention of a time limit, sends all the wrong signals to the wool market. It sends to it a signal that this Government is not willing to back the wool industry. It sends to it a signal that the Government is unwilling to take the steps necessary to return prosperity to woolgrowers.

         What the market wants from us is simply confidence. The market wants to believe that we believe in the wool industry at a time when we can finance our stockpile at interest rates that are very low compared with what we have been paying in the past. Now more than ever is the time for us to be saying, `Yes, we are willing to carry the financing cost of the stockpile because we know that at the end of the day we will recoup it and more'.

         We can finance this stockpile at 7 1/2 per cent. We could hold the stockpile for 14 years, pay the interest, sell the wool at the end and still come out on top. But instead, the Government has given the industry just one year of grace in the extension of the debt repayment schedule for the Wool Realisation Commission. The wool industry deserves better from its government than the treatment it has received, which is merely an extension of one year in the debt repayment schedule.

         Madam Deputy President, you would understand how I felt last night when I received a call from a young man from Surat who phoned to say that he had been unable to continue working on the family farm. The farm had not had any rain for 12 months and he had to go off and earn money as a pilot in the Northern Territory to try to get some cash flow to help keep the farm going. His story is the story of thousands and thousands of wool-growing families. These are people for whom the rural adjustment scheme is not a hope of salvation but an absurdity. Under the criteria they cannot qualify for RAS because the Government assesses them as not being viable enough. These are people for whom the promise of assistance is held further than arm's reach.

         The Government does the wool industry a grave wrong in not extending the debt repayment schedule further or abandoning it so that the wool industry knows that we will not flood the market with more wool in 12 months time, so that the wool industry knows that we are willing to hold on to the stockpile until the price comes up. If we release wool into the market in large quantities, or give the industry reason to believe that we will do so, the only consequence will be a reduction in the price. That does not just mean a reduction in the earnings of woolgrowers, but a reduction in the earnings of shearers, truckies and everybody else in this country. Hundreds of thousands of people in this country are dependent on the wool industry.

I do not know what the level of provisioning is by banks against debts in the rural industry. It is probably about 30c in the dollar. But if the Government was willing to borrow the money at low interest rates to refinance those farmers and, therefore, buy the debts off the banks, an immediate tax benefit would come to the Government, because the banks that had already made provisions at, say, 70c in the dollar would all of a sudden be realising their loans at something like 90c to 100c in the dollar.

How can we call ourselves Australians if, at this hour of crisis, we now turn our backs on the people who have done so much for our country?

I believe we owe it to them and to all the woolgrowers and primary producers in this country. We owe it to the young fellow who phoned me last night and said he had to get a job as a pilot in the Northern Territory.

         —Tonight the Senate is debating the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, which we support because it extends to the wool industry the period of the Government guarantee from seven to eight years to cover the additional year of debt.

         Essentially, this Bill is all about the activities surrounding those people whom I might call the liquidators—the people who have the responsibility of getting rid of the wool. What people have not realised is that there is a vast difference between a marketer and a liquidator. Their approaches to selling and distribution are entirely different. So we have a fundamental problem with the attitudes and philosophies of a group of people who have the job of liquidating wool.

If you have to sell a commodity over a definite period, you never send out a signal to your customers as to the quantity and value of the commodity that you are going to dispose of over the various time schedules. The sooner we get back to a system of trying to market our wool internationally in a proper way, the sooner we will be able to trade our way out of difficulty. That means some restructuring, such as getting rid of a number of the bodies that have a finger in the wool handling pie.

         There is some hope on the horizon; in recent weeks there has been some increase in price. I remind the Senate of a matter that I have raised in my own State. We must recognise that nowadays, in effect, we have two stockpiles. There is the official stockpile, which is causing so much heartburn, and there is another one which is equally as important and which requires consideration. That is wool which is stockpiled not only in farmers' sheds, brokers' houses, warehouses and other places, but around the world in noil form, semi-processed stock and so on.

         One of the problems in marketing wool is that industry leaders and Ministers have not visualised the sort of industry they want in the long term. In the past the industry has been based on a high price for that section of the clip known as the fine micron end, from 19 microns down. But if we are going to return to buoyant earnings across the spectrum, we have to refocus on wool as a broad use, multi-use fibre and not just as an exclusive fibre commanding very high prices. We have to look at more average prices, and focus on an increased demand for the product as a whole rather than on wool as a specialty fibre. If we concentrate in the next few years on wool as a specialty fibre there will be no future for this great industry.

         I add a word of warning as one who spent a number of years in the wool industry. A lot of people do not realise  that by withholding supply we are wrecking the long-term interests of the industry, because wool must flow through the system. Once the processors stop using wool and move to synthetics, it is very hard to get back. Because of the low prices in eastern Europe and elsewhere, we have a great opportunity to get people back into producing woollen products. For this purpose, we must restructure. We must have a sense of direction regarding where the future of this once great industry should lie.

What is unfortunate about this debate is that too much of the material that has been printed so far in our newspapers and too much of the wordage that has been delivered in places such as this have suffered from the same inadequacy. It has been theory delivered in isolation—not just isolation from the real world, but isolation from other theories and other ideas.

I think that is great. Government intervention and support is what is needed and such a suggestion would certainly receive the whole-hearted support of the Australian Democrats.

He suggested that the rest of the stockpile would be less of a problem if, for example, a significant portion of the stockpile—whether that be a quarter, a third or a half—be sold at an early discount. I suggest there is some merit in that proposal as well and I would like to build on it a bit. I suggest—and Senator Panizza was saying something similar to this a few days ago—that the wool that we sell in the first instance should not be sold to our traditional wool markets and not sold for the traditional uses to which wool has been put, but rather for uses which are novel and which do not compete with our traditional wool markets.

         That sounds just a bit easy to say, but I will continue that theme and fill it out because examples of it have been given. Part of what Senator Panizza was saying some days ago was that such uses need aggressive marketing. Senator Crane added some of the novel uses which need to be expanded upon. Those who are interested in the wool industry already know that a huge potential exists for the replacement of imported wool used in the manufacture of carpet in Australia. I do not know what the exact percentage is at the moment but, not long ago, 85 per cent of the wool used in Australia to manufacture carpet was imported. We imported it from New Zealand, Pakistan, Uruguay, Argentina—from a number of places which honourable senators would be surprised to know we traded with.

         The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, would be aware that situated in the city in which he lives is one of Australia's fine carpet wool manufacturing companies. At that establishment in Devonport, the factory is willing to—and does—buy all carpet wool which is produced in Tasmania, yet it still imports a huge amount from overseas. At first glance, it might be thought that the superfine merino or the wool we produce for other uses may not be suitable for carpet, but that is not the case at all. The best, strongest wool for carpet is in the order of 32 microns, but it is possible to use wool of 28 microns or even finer in the manufacture of carpets, provided one can buy it cheaply enough. And this is where I suggest the circle can be completed.

         The other day Senator Panizza described a considerable portion of the stockpile as being bellies, skirtings, crutchings and whatever else. I told Senator Panizza of an entrepreneur who has managed to sell such wool to India for use in carpet, regardless of its micron. The fact was that it was cheap wool. This is where the discounted wool from the stockpile could be used. I suggest that such wool should be made available to Australia's carpet industry at the discount about which I have just been speaking. One source of a subsidy to pay for that discount is the $250 million which is necessary to meet storage and interest payments. That is a cost at the moment, but if the quantity of wool were removed it would no longer be a cost. That gives a hint of the source of the subsidy which could be used to attract the discount to provide that wool.

         Many other things which are imported could be replaced with low cost, low quality wool. Again, those who are interested and informed in the wool industry recognise the fact that synthetic woolpacks can be replaced with woollen woolpacks, and have been, successfully. When I suggest there ought to be action rather than words, a very good example of government action would be to facilitate the development of the industry—which already exists, which needs expanding—by expanding the provision of woollen woolpacks to replace the synthetic ones.

         As those in the wool industry know, synthetic woolpacks seemed attractive at first. When I was first involved in the wool industry we used hessian woolpacks, even before core sampling. At the time we took a few pounds of wool out of the top of the hessian pack, used that for display and repacked and restitched later. I did not like synthetic packs when they were introduced because they were awkward to handle, slippery and burned the inside of one's forearms when trying to move the things around. I think it would be great if we were able to replace those packs. I know what they are called in the industry, but I will not use that term here; it was not a favourable term that was used to describe the new breed of synthetic woolpacks. It would be a great day to return to a natural fibre, nothing which could be better than wool.

         A bounty for the production of such items is the sort of government action, initiative and intervention which would provoke a greater use of such material. I think the same government action is consistent with the support for what I previously described as snake oil remedies. They are only snake oil remedies when the proponent writes a letter to the editor and says, `I reckon we ought to knit the stockpile', or whatever. They become useful if the Government has the capacity to recognise their usefulness and to take action which would facilitate that use. The CWA has taken action; it is instructing children, particularly Victorian school children, in the fine art of knitting. In this Senate I remember challenging other senators to knit a square for National Wool Day last year. My square may not have been all that impressive but at least I completed it.

         This legislation demonstrates that the Government recognises its responsibility to do something about the industry but it does not demonstrate the fact that it is doing everything possible. While what we hear from the coalition demonstrates concern, it does not demonstrate that that responsibility is being shared. There are many other areas of government where the coalition positively wallows in the Government's misfortune. We see it every day; whether it is the statistics or the indicators about unemployment, the balance of trade or inflation, a sort of glee comes across the coalition when a set of bad figures come across.

         —It does; it happens every day. Senator Patterson should admit it. None of that gloating helps the industry and it certainly will not help the wool industry. Instead of doing that, as I indicated earlier, some of the factors that have been mentioned here are outside the competence of the Government. It is like the Government taking credit for the relief of the drought some years ago. But it cannot be blamed for everything and, in the same vein, the rest of us cannot avoid responsibility. I believe we have the responsibility to be constructive, to recognise suggestions which have merit and to support those measures which can assist the industry.

         —The purpose of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 is to extend the repayment of accumulated debt of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission from seven to eight years. While not opposing this Bill, because the rescheduling gives the woolgrowers an extra year to repay the wool debt, I believe it is important to join with my colleagues in pointing out to the Government the problems it has created and which it is currently perpetuating in the wool industry.

         In the last three years there has been a dramatic downturn in prices, a rapid and large accumulation of stocks and the abandonment of the reserve price scheme. This combination has placed the wool industry under a number of short to medium-term pressures. The most important of these is the cost of servicing debt incurred via the stockpile; the challenge of managing and disposing of the stockpile; the economic and social impact of a substantial decline in woolgrowers' incomes; and the need to adjust productive capacity. Add to this the disaster of one of this century's worst droughts and it should be obvious that the people of rural Australia certainly need assistance.

         Unfortunately, it is not obvious that the Government will take more effective action than the measures that we have in this Bill before us today. The very serious plight of the Australian wool industry and those players in it, including many people who are not woolgrowers, needs to be urgently addressed. The crisis extends well beyond woolgrowers and their families. The crisis involves everyone in rural communities whether they be directly employed as woolgrowers or whether they make up part of the community that services the wool growing industry. In fact, entire rural communities face nothing short of economic and social devastation if the current disastrous prices prevail in the wool industry.

         Business losses for the average woolgrower over the last three years totalled $100,000 and similar losses are expected this year. The current stockpile of 3.9 million bales has barely shifted in the last nine months and it is an ominous shadow over the future of the entire industry. The forecast total production figure for greasy wool this year is 851 million kilograms. Next year this is anticipated to come down to 805 million; however, some estimates put it as low as 700 million kilograms. This provides further scope for wool to be sold from the stockpile without necessarily depressing the effect on sales through the auction system.

         We plainly believe that the Government could have done more for the wool industry in this hour of critical need. For example, the Government has failed to address the call from the Wool Council of Australia for a 12-month waiving of the 4.5 per cent debt repayment component of the wool tax. This single measure would have helped all woolgrowers. The Government could also have taken the opportunity with this Bill to slacken the strings which control the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. It could have given the AWRC increased flexibility to go out and market wool from the stockpile rather than wait for buyers to come to it.

         The Government could have removed from public scrutiny the operations of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission so that buyers would not know how much wool the commission was selling or at what price it was selling it and, therefore, what other buyers were doing. The Government could have allowed the commission to establish more markets, develop innovative trade deals and new uses for wool, but it has not gone down that path. Above all, the Government had the opportunity to send a clear signal to the market that there would be absolutely no chance of a fire sale of the wool stockpile. The Government has failed to do any of these things.

         In this Bill the Government has chosen to extend the repayment deadline by one year. This is a welcome move, but it really only puts the problem off for another year. In fact, it gives woolgrowers unfounded confidence only for them to find that the problem is still there when the repayment schedule advances 12 months further down the track. The coalition and the woolgrowers themselves do not deny the need to repay the debt. Growers have a vested interest in the rapid repayment of the debt, otherwise they will be burdened with the cost of servicing it and paying for the stockpiling of wool. These are additional costs that this wool industry could well do without.

         The Government also conveniently ignores the fact that it removed drought from the natural disaster relief arrangements and so it is partly responsible for the crisis in many areas of the country, including many woolgrowing areas, now affected by drought. There seems to be a broad acceptance that drought is a recurring theme in this country. It is something that rural Australians have to be prepared to confront and to plan for when they can. However, given the economic climate in which farmers have been operating for the last few years, this task has been made exceptionally difficult. It is worth observing in any case that the severity of the current drought puts it into a category which no rural producer could possibly hope to plan for.

         The Government has brought forward two packages: the Federal Government wool package, which is before us at the moment, worth $44.6 million, and the drought package, worth $6 million.

         The wool industry now has assistance of around $200 million in interest subsidies and farm exits. This is a lot of money—no-one would argue that it is not. But I point out to people, particularly Government supporters, who would say this is a lot of money that in 1983 the Fraser-Anthony Government devoted the equivalent of about $700 million to saving the rural industries. We can debate that backwards and forwards, but this Government is the government at the moment and obviously its preferred options are not with the farmers. It has its own interests and people whom it wants to look after; unfortunately, the farmers do not fall into that category.

         There are about 60,000 woolgrowers who produce wool in some quantity. To the best of my knowledge, 18,000 to 19,000 dedicated woolgrowers produce about 48 per cent of the total wool output. The average farm loss for a wool producer is around $40,000, and 91 per cent of those 18,000 to 19,000 people are in that category and are losing money. About only nine per cent of woolgrowers are actually running at a profit. I would like to know how they are doing so; it is beyond me how anyone could make a profit out of wool with the way prices are at the moment.

         Both packages contained in this Bill introduced today assist farmers. The wool package assists 5,700 farmers and the drought package assists another 820 farmers. So roughly 6,500 farmers out of 18,000 are receiving some sort of RAS assistance. I rose to speak tonight to bring this point to the attention of the Senate: what is happening to the other 12,000 farmers who are not receiving RAS? Some of them have off-farm investments and are not eligible for RAS, but there are a great many more who are not receiving any assistance at all. There are 4,500 farmers or their wives who are on Job Search allowance and there are 200-odd on farm household support.

         In effect, the only assistance available to those types of people, people that are at the desperation stage with no income because of drought and low commodity prices, is that of farm household support. When people do accept that, they are taking the first step towards exiting their property. Farm household support, which is the equivalent of Job Search allowance or unemployment benefit, is a loan. It is a loan for a period of nine months, and if the grower goes over that period, he has to pay back that loan and exit the property. That is why only 200 people so far have availed themselves of farm household support: people are terrified that if they take it they will have to pay it back, eventually sell their homes and get a $45,000 exit grant.

         While this package caters for about 6,500 people, it is not an adequate package. There are very many—up to 50 per cent—woolgrowers who are not receiving any assistance at all and they desperately need that assistance. Therefore, I believe that when Mr Crean goes out and makes statements that there is help, that there is assistance from the Government, he is not completely telling the facts as they are. While he is correct in some ways, in that there is assistance for people who have to exit, that assistance is not helping people stay on the farm.

         I hope that Senator Sherry or those in the advisers' box can correct me on my next point because I would love to be proven wrong on it, but I do not think I am. I believe that up to 50 per cent of woolgrowers who are in desperate straits and need interest rate subsidies are not receiving those subsidies. These two packages, in effect, top up the already existing clients of RAS and lift their interest rate subsidy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent or even, on some occasions, 100 per cent. As I said before, if Senator Sherry has received some advice to prove me wrong and if he can assure me that that interest rate subsidy is flowing to the wool producers who are in need of it, I will be the happiest person in the Senate. I know that the hour is late and that we have a couple of extra Bills to get through, but if Senator Sherry can allay my fears on that point, I will be very grateful.

         Firstly, in terms of the causes of the current problems of the wool industry, there is no doubt that the Australian Wool Corporation kept the price of wool too high for too long. There is no doubt that that is the primary reason we have the problems we have today. But let us be honest about it: all the politicians of all the political parties in both this place and the other place accepted that situation for a long time. All political parties supported the floor price scheme for almost 20 years. So when we are apportioning blame, we have to remember that it is all very well to look back at the circumstances surrounding the increasing of the floor price scheme, but very few politicians in either chamber envisaged what was going to happen.

         Secondly, there is an international recession. I know that some people tend to scoff at the effect of the international recession, but there is no doubt that it has had a substantial effect on our wool markets. Coupled with that we have the situation in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. Whilst I welcome the political and economic changes that are occurring there, they have certainly had unforeseen consequences for the demand for wool. We really face a quite serious problem in terms of what is happening in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. I have been reading some briefing notes on what is occurring in those areas. Unfortunately, much of our traditional wool market has been replaced by synthetics from other countries. That causes me some concern about our long-term prospects of regaining the market. We have also had some problems with contracts with China. I think they are the main reasons why we are in the situation we are in, and why we are debating this issue tonight.

I will not go into all the details, but the package is composed of four basic parts. Firstly, the Commonwealth is funding up to $44.6 million under the exceptional circumstance provisions of the rural adjustment scheme. I will return shortly to the contribution made by government above and beyond that. Secondly, the Government has determined that the wool tax will be maintained at 8.5 per cent for 1993 and 1994.

         Other people have put forward various measures. One suggestion is that we burn the wool stockpile. That is rather ironic, given that one of the great advantages of wool is that it does not burn. In fact, it would cost tens of millions of dollars to burn the wool stockpile. This was first proposed by a Frenchman. The second irony is in the nationality of the gentleman who proposed it—I forget his name—given the attitude of the French towards commodity prices and the support they give within the European Community. I was very concerned that such a far-sighted, responsible and dedicated premier as the Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss, picked up the suggestion. I thought that was particularly regrettable.

         I mentioned earlier the contributions under RAS. I have been informed that the Government underwriting through RAS of the total rural debt in this country—and I do not have the breakdown of the wool debt—is some $3.2 billion. I am not suggesting for one moment that there is a payout of $3.2 billion, but the underpinning of interest support on $3.2 billion is not an insubstantial amount of money that is being provided to the rural sector. I do not know the portion that is going to the wool industry, but it would be very substantial.

         Regarding the comments from the Opposition tonight, I welcome Senator Tambling's general contribution. He said that the Federal Government could slacken the string controlling the Australian Wool Realisation Commission so that it could better market the wool. I have already outlined that the package does include a review by Professor Garnaut, and hopefully that will include a review of marketing arrangements. I would like to make a comment here on the marketing of wool. It is not necessarily money that is spent on the marketing of wool. I am informed that over the last 10 years $1.2 billion has been spent on various aspects of wool marketing. That is an amazing figure. If we have spent all this money, what has been the result? It really is quite astounding. Of that, $277 million has been contributed by Government. So we have spent an enormous amount of money on marketing, but it has not necessarily been the solution to the problem.

         Regarding some of the other contributions, again, Senator Panizza's was generally positive. He challenged the notion that greedy woolgrowers had led to the current situation. I do not for one moment suggest on behalf of the Government that it is the fault of greedy woolgrowers. I have to say that if any of us were in the circumstances of woolgrowers where we were being offered a higher price for what we were producing, I do not think too many of us would knock that higher price back. I do not think any of us would knock it back. He made the point that the scheme was compulsory, but there were not too many woolgrowers clamouring to get out of the compulsory scheme because of the prices they were receiving.

         Senator Panizza made the point that the Government should make a greater contribution—without being specific about what the contribution should be—but I made the point earlier about the contribution through RAS of the underpinning of the support of $3.2 billion. Regarding our non-traditional markets and marketing, Senator Panizza referred to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. I have alluded to some of the problems that we face in getting back into that market. It will be particularly difficult.

         I suspect that Senator Campbell's comments concerning the bureaucracy in the wool industry are probably right. I think he has a good point that there are so many vested interests and such a significant bureaucracy that supposedly is looking after the wool industry, and yet it seems to have not been doing a particularly effective job. Certainly I think that is one of the areas which needs a total review.

         The situation we have today is a pretty damning indictment of the various bodies in the wool industry, not to mention the various leaders of the wool industry. I referred to a media article earlier. I will not embarrass Mr Lempriere or Mr Cleland by further quoting what they said about the problems we were not going to face in terms of the wool stockpile. Unfortunately, I think there was a lack of vision by some of the persons in the wool industry at that time.

         I agree totally with Senator Campbell and a number of other speakers who commented that this crisis is affecting the entire community. I have been to rural and regional areas as a member of the rural and regional affairs committee and, recently, in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. There is no doubt that the wool crisis is ricocheting through the entire rural community and industry. It is affecting not just the woolgrowers and their families; it is also affecting small country communities and rural Australia as a whole. Ultimately, it will have a very substantial effect on our balance of payments and, in turn, the entire economy and community in Australia.

         I am very pleased that Senator Calvert approached the Minister about some positive contacts that he had made with the Latvian Government in an attempt to sell wool. I am glad to see that Senator Calvert made such a positive contribution to the debate. Senator Watson referred to fewer bodies administering the wool industry. I think he picked up the theme to which Senator Campbell referred. Senator Watson raised a new issue that should be remembered; that is, the two stockpiles that we face—the official one and the unofficial one.

         The legislation before us tonight is relatively simple. It increases the amount of time for the sale of the stockpile from 7 years to 8 years. That is a responsible measure. We cannot extend the debt repayment period indefinitely. That would simply compound many of the problems that we face. The Opposition has suggested that we extend the debt, but that simply would not address the problem. Being conscious of the time, I conclude by suggesting that the legislation should be supported. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 was being debated under General Business and the time for General Business has now expired. We were about to go into committee. There are two ways around the dilemma: one is easy and the other is a little more difficult. The easy way would be, with the concurrence of the Senate, to extend the time so that we can go into committee and complete the remaining stages of the Bill. I ask whether that has the concurrence of the Senate. There being no objection, it is so ordered.

         —I will not detain the Senate too long at this late hour to consider the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill 1993 and related Bills. Basically, the purpose of these Bills is to give effect to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971. The subsequent legislation to ratify Australia's compliance with this international convention basically means that nine Australian oil companies which import into Australia 150 tonnes of contributing oil per year will be required to pay a combined total in the current year of $138,000, and just over a half a million dollars annually, to an international fund which will ensure that, in the event of a catastrophe involving oil spilt from an oil tanker, we will receive compensation of up to half a billion dollars to help in the cleaning up of oil spills.

It will give effect to the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage and to the subsequent protocols to the convention which have increased liability limits.

         The current situation is so grossly inadequate that any improvement has to be seen as a major step forward. The Australian Democrats certainly support this package of Bills. However, the convention and associated protocols are not as stringent as they ought to be and certainly do not represent international best practice. The amount of compensation that could be claimed under the convention, as amended by the 1992 protocol, is still woefully inadequate when contrasted with the cost of the clean-up of a major oil spill. Senator Campbell has already mentioned that it cost $1 billion for the

         Australia has been relatively lucky so far, given our huge coastline and the volume of traffic passing along it, particularly in certain areas. We can refer here to the 2,000 large ships which pass through the Great Barrier Reef each year, including more than 100 tankers carrying crude oil, petrol and diesel. I said in a press release earlier this year in response to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Braer

         oil spill off the coast of the Shetland Islands that only good luck had prevented a similar accident on the Australian coast. Should it happen, and again I reflect the words of Senator Campbell a few moments ago, it seems as though our ability to get to those sites quickly and prevent serious damage is woefully limited.

         The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimates that there is a 48 per cent chance of a major oil spill from tankers in Australian waters over the next five years and a 93 per cent chance over the next 20 years. In other words, there is roughly a fifty-fifty chance that a major oil spill will happen in Australia in the reasonably near future.

         The Government has certainly made some significant changes to regulations to improve ship safety in recent years. One of these has been the introduction of compulsory pilotage in that part of the Great Barrier Reef between Cairns and the tip of Cape York. Given that the Torres Strait and the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef have the highest accident rate in Australian waters, this was a very welcome move. However, the system only applies to the northern half of this inner route. Treacherous and hazardous areas in the Torres Strait and further south along the reef also need to be protected.

         These changes highlight the fact that the best approach to combat oil pollution at sea is to set in place stringent preventive measures—that is, prevention rather than attempting to pay the cost of clean-up after a spill has occurred. Australia has in place a national plan and a reef plan specifically designed to cope with a spill in the Great Barrier Reef. However, the reef plan is being revised to cope with an oil spill of only 10,000 tonnes. The
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Kirki
         </emphasis>
         spilt 17,700 tonnes off the coast of Western Australia in July 1992; the

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Braer
         </emphasis>
         spilt roughly 60,000 tonnes of oil into an area renowned for its wildlife. Clearly, there is potential for a very large spill. The plan is inadequate and should be upgraded, because there is a very real threat in this area.

         Prevention also requires that the recommendations of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety

         report be implemented without delay. The report has been highly praised by interested parties and deserves international recognition. Whilst rust buckets and `lepers of the sea', as Senator Collins so aptly described the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Kirki
         </emphasis>
         , traverse Australian waters, even the toughest liability and compensation provisions could not prevent a serious pollution accident from occurring in our waters. A strict international regimen is, however, extremely important. As long as we maintain our addiction to oil, and as long as there remains an international shipping trade in this non-renewable resource, accidents will happen.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That brings me to the Bills before the Senate. The Democrats have some concerns over the stringency of the regimen contained in the relevant international conventions. Firstly, the fund convention, as amended by the 1992 protocol, does not make compensation available for damage to natural resources where these resources are not traded in the marketplace.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In 1980 the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution stating that the assessment of compensation `is not to be made on the basis of an abstract quantification of damage calculated in accordance with theoretical models'. The assembly established a special working group to explore this issue. It found that compensation for environmental damage could only be granted where the claimant sustained quantifiable economic loss. We believe that is a defect in the present system.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This was a very strict interpretation of damage and did not allow compensation for non-traded natural resources. The 1992 protocol to amend the fund convention addresses this issue further; it uses the definition of `pollution damage' contained in the 1992 protocol to amend the civil liability convention. The latter document has an improved definition of pollution damage. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . compensation for impairment of the environment other than loss of profit from such impairment shall be limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        This new definition avoids the task of quantifying the decline in value of a natural resource as a result of an oil spill, but it continues to limit liability for natural resource damage. The key issue that has not been addressed in the protocol, and hence in this legislation, is the problem of assessing the monetary value of loss of aesthetic value, wildlife or ecological systems that have no economic value. Mans Jacobsson, the Director of the IOPC fund, actually said that `the marine environment does not have a direct economic value'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problem is essentially one of property rights. Property rights tend to be either deficient or non-existent for clean water or clean air, and too costly to enforce when they do exist. The fund assembly, along with shipowners and insurers, has clearly rejected the notion of compensation for other, more ecologically oriented, economic values such as option and existence values. Admittedly, these are very difficult to define. The Resource Assessment Commission has made some progress on this issue by conducting surveys using the contingency valuation method, which was used during the Kakadu inquiry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is impractical to expect that this kind of definition of pollution damage to natural resources will be adopted in the very near future in any further protocols amending the convention. However, the US Oil Pollution Act of 1990 does provide some guidance as to how an improved definition could be used. The OPA 1990 allows for the cost of restoration, rehabilitation or replacement, plus the diminution in value of resources pending restoration. The diminution of value aspect contrasts significantly with the limited definition in the 1992 protocol. The OPA 1990 also provides that the cost of assessing harm to natural resources is added to the total cost to ensure that natural resource damage cases do not fail merely because funding for assessments is unavailable.

         Secondly, there is also major doubt over whether indigenous people would be able to use the convention to claim for loss of natural resources where the legal ownership of the natural resources is in doubt. This bears very much on the Mabo case. If a local community hunts or gathers food as a livelihood, there is no guarantee that the community would be able to claim for the loss of untraded goods—that is, goods in which there was not a dollar value.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In addition, where a community uses a natural resource for cultural or spiritual reasons there would be no recourse for compensation. In contrast, the OPA of 1990 specifically allows Indian tribes and foreign governments to recover damages through legal action.

         Thirdly, the compensation limits set out in the protocol are too restrictive. The amount of compensation available under the new legislation will immediately increase to some $120 million, according to the Minister's second reading speech. We will have to wait at least five years for this amount to be raised to $400 million depending on when the 1992 protocol comes into force. It is worth restating the fact that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimates that there is a fifty-fifty chance of a major oil spill from tankers in Australian waters in the next five years.

         In contrast, the US OPA-90 established a federal oil spill liability trust fund which allows compensation of up to $1 billion per incident. Of this amount, $500 million can be paid for damage to natural resources. In addition, $1 billion can be authorised by the federal fund. Although this seems a very high limit, it is sobering to remember that
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Exxon Valdez
         </emphasis>
         spent $US3 billion on cleaning up the Prince William Sound spill and a further $1 billion in settlement of law suits by the US federal and Alaskan governments.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, there is the question of the limits to liability. The 1992 protocol to amend the civil liability convention states that a shipowner is not entitled to limit liability if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his or her own act committed with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and knowing that damage would result. This definition is far too strict. The US OPA-90 allows for unlimited liability where gross negligence or wilful misconduct occurs on the part of the responsible party or the party's agent, employee or contractee. Gross negligence allows for liability other than that contained in the 1992 protocol amending the civil liability convention. The 1992 protocol amending the fund convention does not allow unlimited liability as the protocol relates to oil importers rather than shipowners; however, the issue of whether importers of oil should be made jointly liable for damages, rather than shipowners alone, is a matter which should be given consideration.

        The reason for this, quite simply, is that there are a number of groups wanting to give evidence to the industry, science and technology committee. Those groups would find it quite impossible to do that before Monday, which is the current reporting date. I understand that both the Government and the Opposition are quite happy with extending that time limit. It  allows sufficient time for the Government to meet the 20 February deadline by which time this legislation must not only come into effect but also have been notified internationally for at least 90 days.

         —The possibility of oil pollution in Australian waters has not been considered a great risk by many in the oil industry or in some Federal government departments until very recently. An indication of a change of attitude on this question is the package of legislation that we are debating here tonight. Certainly the

         There is no doubt that this package of legislation, which implements the provisions of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971, is an integral part of the international and national legislative program that has been established to ensure that safety standards are maintained and that compensation is available to third parties when pollution damage occurs. However, it is disappointing that after all these years this legislation is now being pushed through at the last opportunity to enable Australia to comply with its international obligations.

         This legislation and other legislation associated with the International Maritime Organisation and the oil industry is very complex and requires careful scrutiny to ensure that the interests of all Australians as well as the Australian environment are protected by their provisions. Senator Coulter has already gone through some of the complex and important questions that need to be addressed. I will not go over them at this point, but I do intend to support the referral to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which I hope will have an opportunity to engage in a further discussion of these issues.

         —The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 is not opposed by the Opposition. One might say, `Well thank you very much. You can sit down', but I would like to make a few brief remarks. The Bill seeks to remedy a constitutional defect in the Bankruptcy Act 1966, as amended only recently in this chamber. If the Act is not amended in accordance with this Bill, the process of collecting compulsory contributions from bankrupts will be weakened.

         The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill, which we are dealing with now, and which amends the Bankruptcy Act, seeks to fix this constitutional defect I have referred to. It came into effect in 1991 under the compulsory income contribution regime introduced at the time. Under that regime, a trustee is able to make an assessment of the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during the period of bankruptcy. Where the income is assessed at being above a certain level or threshold, the bankrupt is liable to make contributions from his or her income of 50c in each dollar above that amount. A particular section of the Bankruptcy Act enables a trustee to file a certificate in a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of amounts of these compulsory contributions which a bankrupt has refused or failed to pay.

         The Bill which made amendments to the Act in 1991 provided that such a certificate would operate and would be enforceable as if it were a final judgment of the court in which it had been filed. It is that section that this Bill seeks to amend. The reason is this: the validity of that section is being challenged in the High Court, and the Government believes that challenge will be successful. If it is successful, then the income contribution regime of bankrupts will be put at risk. So it seems appropriate that we make the change.

         The challenge rests on the trustee's certificate being given the status of a judgment of the relevant court, thereby allegedly allowing a person who does not hold judicial office to exercise judicial power in that the trustee files this certificate and it is then a judgment of the court. That defect will be remedied when this Bill is passed. The trustee will still be able to file a certificate stating the nature of the debt and the amount owed, and in any proceedings that are instituted that certificate will be prima facie evidence of those things, but not a judgment as though proceedings had been carried and decided in favour of the trustee. In other words, in order to get a judgment, proceedings will have to be carried out. The trustee will not have, in effect, the capacity to make a judgment of a relevant court.

I happen to be on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and it did not so adequately scrutinise the bankruptcy amendments in 1991 to pick up this problem. Nor did anyone in this chamber pick it up. The reason it was not picked up is that, as has happened every November-December since I have been in Parliament—that is, since 1985—a huge number of Bills suddenly appears out of I do not know where and these have to be considered in a rush. Every year we on this side—and I am told it has been the same when we have been in government, so I do not make these remarks in any partisan sense—say, `This is ridiculous; mistakes will be made'. And every year the Government says, `You are a bunch of incompetents. You have held up our program. You are responsible for all of this. We want these Bills'.

Two years later you are fixing up a fundamental mistake. As soon as it is pointed out to you it is as obvious as the days are long. It should jump out from the page at any of us. The reason you have made that mistake is that you will not slow down and give legislation the proper consideration it deserves'.

         —I do not want to detain the Senate overly long. However, I feel that I ought to make a few comments on the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 at the second reading stage. The intention of the Bill is to rectify a technical problem with the existing legislation. As Senator Vanstone has said, the technical problem is that, under the current legislation, a trustee who makes a determination as to the contribution which a bankrupt should make is making a judicial decision without being a judicial officer. For a long time it has been accepted that a trustee in bankruptcy is an officer of the court, but that is very different from being a judicial officer, because the trustee does not have judicial power.

         I have a couple of suggestions in relation to this process. I still feel that we do not have it right. The reason why we do not have it right is simply this: the amendments before us tonight will make the certificate of the trustee prima facie evidence of the amount which the bankrupt has an obligation to contribute. The consequence of this amendment is that an application still has to be made to the court, because that is the competent authority. That, of course, costs money. The reason why trustees are generally very unsuccessful in getting contributions from bankrupts is simply that in many cases they are appointed to an estate that does not have any money in it, especially in complex cases where the bankrupt has so arranged his affairs that, at the date of the appointment of the trustee, there are not even any realisable assets or apparently realisable assets that will put money into the trustee's hands so that he can then proceed to carry out a proper investigation.

         The intention behind the original amendment to the Act, which we had in 1991, was to streamline the process so that a trustee could get a determination of a bankrupt's obligation to pay without having to go to the expense of commencing an action in the Federal Court or in the Supreme Court, say, in Queensland, under cross-vesting legislation. What we now have is a halfway house. I understand—and Minister Bolkus may correct me if I am wrong—that the trustee still has an obligation to commence an action and to make an application to the court. All this legislation does is reduce the evidentiary obligations of the trustee upon making the application. The best way these particular matters can be resolved is in the same way in which the Act currently deals with the continuing effect of bankruptcy after the normal three-year discharge period.

         As honourable senators know, a bankrupt is automatically discharged after a period of three years. When Senator Tate was Minister he made changes to the Act such that a bankrupt could be discharged early if it was shown, under certain circumstances, that the person concerned had adequately, sufficiently and in good faith discharged his obligations as a bankrupt under the Act and there was no public policy reason for maintaining him in bankruptcy.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There were also changes made to keeping bankrupts in bankruptcy longer. But the underlying principle of discharge from bankruptcy was not displaced. That principle is that a trustee generally can object to the discharge of a bankrupt by lodging an objection to discharge with the registrar in bankruptcy of the Federal Court in the jurisdiction in which the sequestration order was made.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I suggest that an appropriate way to deal with this may well be that a trustee in bankruptcy makes an application to the registrar for a declaration along similar terms that the bankrupt has an obligation to contribute a certain amount of money per week, per month or per annum. That declaration can then be overturned by an application, by the bankrupt or on the bankrupt's behalf, to the court itself so that the trustee is not actually making a judicial decision. The effect of that would be to enable trustees to quickly get an obligation from the bankrupt to make a contribution, and then it rests upon the bankrupt to make an application to the court to vary that determination or set it aside.

         A bankrupt is able to get legal aid, but a trustee in bankruptcy, who is appointed to an estate that has no assets or no apparent realisable assets, cannot get legal aid to bring the application to court, notwithstanding the fact that the application may well be for the benefit of numerous creditors as individuals. Of course the argument could be made that the trustee would have a right to get money under section 305 of the Act from the former office of Inspector-General in Bankruptcy which is now ITSA—the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia.

         The problem with that is that section 305 funding for trustees is very limited. Some five or six years ago moneys were easily obtainable by trustees under section 305, but as a result of urging from the then Inspector-General of Bankruptcy, Mr Wenn, there were a flood of applications under section 305, and as a result it is now very difficult to get funding under section 305 of the Act. We cannot say that it is easy for the trustee to make an application; it is actually very difficult. The reason I say all of these things is that frequently there are cases where the estate is very complex and there are no apparent realisable assets but where the bankrupt still has a strong earning stream that derives from various investments or other business activities associated with the bankrupt and where it is not possible to succeed under the trust busting provisions that were introduced into the Act 1987-88.

         I hate to say this to the chamber, but I think we may not have it right yet and I think some further consideration needs to be given. I am loathe to say that for the simple reason that we have changed the Bankruptcy Act so many times in the past couple of years that it is getting very difficult for the profession adequately to administer the Act.

         The reason it is more difficult for a trustee in bankruptcy to administer the Act than it is for an ordinary accountant practising in some other area of accountancy is that in accountancy generally there are clients who are volunteers in their fate. But in the case of bankruptcy, where a private trustee is appointed, the situation almost invariably arises where bankrupts are anything but a volunteer in their fate. In those few cases where the bankrupt has presented a debtor's petition and a private trustee in bankruptcy has been appointed, frequently the allegation is made that the trustee is going to go soft on the bankrupt.

         It is very, very difficult for a trustee to actually enforce the Act when many changes are made. Because bankrupts are not willing participants in their own bankruptcy, they frequently look for every possible avenue to avoid compliance with the Act. That is why the Act has to be simple and that is why we have to minimise the number of changes that are made. Over the next 12 to 18 months we will probably see more changes to the Act. I would only hope that, when those changes occur, they are comprehensive and properly done, and that the Act is then left as it is so that the profession can get on with the job of administering the Act as it is intended, to the benefit of the general public. Proper administration of bankruptcy is very important for the business community, for confidence and for ensuring the economy functions properly.

It is a matter which not many people would be aware of but one which is of vital importance to Australia's rural communities. This matter relates to sales tax paid by primary producers and farm machinery dealers.

         Honourable senators may be aware that primary producers can register with the Tax Office for exemption from sales tax. The intention is that our farmers, who contribute so much to our export earnings as well as our quality of life, will not be burdened by sales tax when buying goods for use in primary production. In addition, farm machinery dealers can register with the Tax Office for an exemption from paying sales tax, on the basis that they are selling mainly to exempt primary producers, and this is commonsense. If a farmer can buy goods from a supplier and not pay sales tax, it makes sense that the farm machinery dealer who sells almost exclusively to primary producers can buy those same goods free of sales tax.

         Last year I, along with many senators, fought to ensure that under the new sales tax legislation the right of farm machinery dealers to register for exemption was retained. We fought so that dealers already suffering a massive downturn in business due to the rural recession would not have to pay an extra cost that they said would put them out of business. So it saddens me to have to bring to the attention of the Senate an apparent anomaly in the current sales tax legislation which means that our rural communities will contribute an extra $10 million a year in sales tax.

         The problem with this new streamlined sales tax system, which is a contradiction in terms, is that farm machinery dealers, and ultimately primary producers, will end up paying sales tax on reconditioned farm machinery. This is because dealers must pay sales tax on spare parts bought to recondition farm machinery. A farmer buying a spare part to repair a tractor or any other piece of machinery can buy that spare part free of sales tax but the farm machinery dealer must pay sales tax. Who will the dealer most likely sell a second-hand tractor or harvester to? A sales tax exempt primary producer, of course. The end result is that dealers will put up the price of reconditioned farm machinery by the amount of sales tax that they have to pay on those spare parts.

         One dealer has told me that he spends an average of $3,000 reconditioning each piece of second-hand farm machinery that is traded in. It is not uncommon for a dealer to spend $10,000 reconditioning a header. Sales tax applied at 20 per cent means an extra $2,000 per second-hand header. Because of the reduced number of dealerships in the country now, even if a dealer sells only 50 reconditioned headers a year, on average he will have to pay out $100,000 in sales tax, which cannot be refunded. I use this case as an example to stress the seriousness of the situation for all rural Australians. How many farmers in Australia at present can afford to pay an extra $2,000, or anything extra, for a second-hand piece of machinery? How many dealers can afford to absorb an extra $100,000 in sales tax?

         My office was first alerted to this apparent anomaly in the sales tax legislation when we contacted many dealers throughout rural South Australia to inquire how the new system was working. We were told that dealers were confused about the new system because it was poorly implemented and poorly explained. These dealers had each implemented the streamlined sales tax system differently. All dealers expressed fear of an audit in case they had got it wrong. One dealer complained that he had used three systems over the last three months and he still was not sure whether he had got it right.

         Fortunately, this situation is now being clarified and at last information is getting through to dealers; however, I cannot be so positive about the situation regarding sales tax on spare parts. Because of the downturn in the rural economy, the price of new machinery is out of the reach of many farmers and they now look to reliable reconditioned machinery. Naturally, the proportion of second-hand machinery sold by farm machinery dealers has increased. Anyone who has seen the statistics that have been released in the last few days will realise just how much they have increased.

         One dealer on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula—an area that over the past three years, during this rural recession, has suffered greatly due to drought, high interest rates and the fall in commodity prices—has told me that 75 per cent of the machinery he sells now is second-hand. Farm machinery dealers provide an invaluable service to farmers across Australia. They sell new and used agricultural machinery to farmers as well as provide parts and maintenance.

         As a normal part of business, dealers buy used machinery such as tractors and harvesters from farmers as a trade-in on new machinery. Dealers have to recondition that traded-in stock to make it acceptable to a prospective buyer. Some repairs are only minor but, because farmers and primary producers are holding on to their machinery for much longer, most of the traded-in machinery requires major repairs and a substantial outlay by the dealer, who has no guarantee that that piece of machinery will be sold.

         I do not think I need to spell out how farm machinery dealers across Australia have reacted to the news that they will have to pay sales tax on all spare parts used to recondition second-hand machinery. It is of little comfort to them that the Australian Taxation Office has advised the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia that sales tax is payable because dealers are using the parts for the business's own use and the parts have not been sold directly to a sales tax exempt primary producer. As with everything else the dealer stocks, the spare parts could be sold directly to the primary producer free of sales tax. There is not even a chance of a refund of the sales tax when the machinery is sold to an exempt primary producer.

         —I am getting through it all; do not worry. Farm machinery dealers must carry the cost and pass it on to farmers. I think we all know that dealers cannot afford to carry the cost. The whole situation is ridiculous because the dealer will ultimately end up selling the reconditioned equipment to an exempt farmer. Surely it is perfectly logical that a dealer buying spare parts to recondition machinery which will be sold to a tax exempt primary producer should not pay sales tax on these parts.

         The Government gave assurances through a Senate committee that no additional sales tax would be imposed on farm machinery dealers, but there is no doubt that dealers will be forced to pass on the cost of this sales tax impost to the primary producers. This indirect tax will cost Australian farmers an estimated extra $10 million a year. This is a conservative estimate. Try explaining that to farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, who are experiencing drought, or to farmers in South Australia, who are currently desperately waiting for rain to sow their crops. As I said, this $10 million figure is only a conservative estimate that has been provided to me by the Tractor and Machinery Association. With the increasing number of farmers buying second-hand machinery, it is only feasible that this figure will rise considerably.

         I cannot stress enough the importance of the farm machinery dealers to farmers across Australia. Australian farmers are some of the most efficient in the world and in order to maintain this efficiency they need a support network of manufacturers and dealers. Dealers not only provide a valuable service to farming communities, but they also provide jobs in country centres throughout Australia.

         Farm machinery dealers have suffered alongside farmers in this rural crisis. Figures from the Farm Machinery Dealers Association show that the number of dealers in Australia has declined from 2,400 in 1986 to approximately 600 at the current time, which is almost a quarter of the number of dealers that there were in 1986. This is not surprising when one looks at the drop in sales of machinery in the 1980s. In 1983 there were 1,685 retail sales of combine harvesters—that is, both power take-off and self-propelled harvesters—in Australia. In 1992, this figure had dropped to 450, which was actually an improvement on the disastrous figure of 1991 when only 220 machines were sold Australia wide.

         Almost 12,000 tractors were sold in 1983 and only 5,798 were sold in 1991. Overall, 16,500 people have been lost from farm machinery dealerships across Australia since 1984. That is 16,500 people our rural communities could not afford to lose and 16,500 people our unemployment queues could not afford to gain.

         Statistics released by the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia for the first quarter of this year indicate that the industry is once again facing a tough year for tractor and farm equipment sales. After some signs of recovery in 1992, this year's opening quarter is little better than in 1991, the worst year on record for the industry.

         The downturn in farm machinery sales has implications for agriculture as a whole. Farmers are aware of the vital role that machinery plays in supporting agriculture and the effect that modern equipment has on farm productivity. The Government must also recognise this connection. The TMA is concerned that several years of dismal sales have caused a major downturn within the farm machinery industry and the survival of its remaining manufacturing and service base looks very fragile. The TMA's president, Mr John Henchy, has stated:

        However, far from giving incentives, all the Government has given the industry is a new tax worth $10 million. If this causes more farm machinery dealers to close, even more farmers will be left with a depleted service. Not only will they have to travel further to their dealer, but also their productivity will also drop because they will have to wait longer for spare parts and service when their machinery breaks down.

         Australian farmers have always prided themselves on their efficiency compared to the rest of the world. But we risk falling behind other countries if we let farm machinery dealers go out of business and we allow farm machinery to run down further. The Tractor and Machinery Association has sent three letters to the Federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) about this situation. Apparently this issue is not deemed important enough even for a reply. I call on the Government to respond to this matter immediately. This apparent sales tax anomaly is nothing more than a revenue collecting exercise, but it is one that will have tragic consequences unless it is removed.

         The Australian Taxation Office has apparently been very helpful to the farm machinery industry, despite the confusion caused by the legislation. But the Tax Office has been powerless to act because it is the legislation that is at fault. I therefore call on the Government to immediately remove this extra $10 million burden on the farm machinery industry—a burden which any sane person would know cannot be carried by Australia's rural community.

         Weeks before Dr Chapman came out with this politically based lie, with other leaders in the racing industry he had attended a meeting with me accompanied by an accountant who was advising the racing industry. This accountant had clearly explained to these racing industry leaders, including Dr Chapman—who, as I said, appeared to spend that time listening open-mouthed—that there would be no GST on prize money earned by amateur owners who make up more than 90 per cent of all owners in Australia. Because of that knowledge, no other leaders of the racing industry in Australia supported Dr Chapman's lies. They would not support him and that is why he was the outspoken hero. He was the only leader of that industry who kept on repeating that lie and kept on getting massive media cover for that lie.

          —Before I call Senator Faulkner, I would like to refer to a point of order that was raised during Senator Baume's speech. I ruled that there was no point of order, and that was correct. But I would like to remind honourable senators, although only a few of us are here, that certain resolutions were agreed to by the Senate on 25 February 1988 in relation to parliamentary privilege. I think it is worth while reminding ourselves of them occasionally. Resolution No. 9 states:

         I am not concerned, as I have said on previous occasions, about the senators themselves. I wish to refer to previous speeches that I have made in relation to this very serious matter: first on 5 May 1992, and subsequently on 12 November 1992. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 imposes a duty of care on Commonwealth employers to `provide a safe and healthy workplace for staff, and to design and plan work schedules which minimise any unwanted effects on the physical and psychological wellbeing of employees'.

         Senator Faulkner, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, has an obligation to ensure that these absurd working hours for the staff of this Senate are not continued. I believe that he shares my feelings about the Senate's hours of sitting. But there is an obligation. It seems absolutely incredible hypocrisy that this Government—which is composed of shop stewards, union representatives and former State secretaries of the Labor Party and which occupies the treasury bench—should impose on the people who work in this place work practices that any employer would be prosecuted for in the courts of the land. Yet, the Government is imposing these work practices not only on senators themselves but also on its own employees.

         One may think that this is just the ravings of somebody who is trying to make a point that is perhaps of no great significance. I understand that these practices have gone on for years. I have been here three years and I have been approached by senators in a medical capacity to give advice on their stress-related disorders. I know that some senators from both sides of the chamber are suffering at the moment because this chamber has been sitting for three weeks. Yet here we are still sitting in the early hours of Friday morning. I understand that last week some estimates committees sat until 2.30 a.m.

         In October 1991 the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff engaged a consultant to review its working environment and work practices. The key consideration was the hours of duty worked by
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard

         As at 30 June 1992, the department had 16, or 4 1/2 per cent of the total staff, active compensation claims against it. That was an increase of six over the previous period. In other words, there are the equivalent of 16 full-time employees off at any one time within this department.  I have estimated the cost of compensation claims to be about $15,000 a week in relation to this department. This is much higher than any other industry that I am aware of. So, apart from anything else, there is a financial consideration to be looked at.

         There are only three reasons that the International Labour Organisation says are acceptable for night work: one is technical, in other words the continuous operation of industrial processes; the second is economic; and the third is social—for example, hospital workers, police and people who work for newspapers. Many people can acclimatise to this providing these conditions become an habitual part of their occupation. If they are not acclimatised to these situations, decreased well-being may be associated with night work and in up to 15 to 20 per cent of cases the symptoms actually progress to health disorders. Night work is the most difficult part of shift work and extended hours.

         One only has to see Senator Collins's behaviour today and his reactions through the week. Admittedly, I understand he is living on a lettuce leaf at the moment—he said that he has lost 17 kilograms. Not only is he hypoglycaemic, that is fairly obvious from his behaviour, but he also erects this wall of sound to counteract debate. If ever there were a wall of sound that becomes a primeval scream for help, Senator Collins is the best example I can give. He is emitting a primeval scream for help and the wall of sound is a reaction to the stress that he is under. He is obviously under stress. I commend the surrealist paintings that are going around at the moment to you, Mr Deputy President, because they give a fair example of what I am referring to in relation to Senator Collins. There are stress related disorders primarily related to this. They may help Senator Collins in some respects because they include reduced appetite, but they also cause sleep anomalies, nervous disorders, fatigue, gastric and digestive disorders, et cetera.

         Think of the effects on the social and family life of the people who work in this building. The feeling of being cut off from the community and of not participating in the social life and collective responsibilities that occur. That also happens  to senators. We have it in this whoopee land that is our work environment; we ourselves, and the people upon whom we inflict the way in which we behave. It prevents the formation of normal social contacts. Do not tell me that there is normal behaviour in relation to social contacts in this place when one comes in in the morning at about 8.00 a.m. and leaves, if one is lucky—and I again apologise that it is now nearly 12.30 a.m.—the following day. Mr Deputy President, what sort of social contact have you had today, other than controlling the Senate?

         I noticed one of the Ministers was sharing a bottle of wine with one of the reporters when he got called back here. I thought that he was doing pretty well, from what I observed of him in the dining room at the time. He has the reputation of doing pretty well in the dining room at times with some of the reporters. He got cut off in his prime—if that is the word—when the division bells rang. I saw he was still here at midnight, so I suspect that all did not go as well as he might have hoped.

It is a fact of life that there is a circadian rhythm within the human being.

         It is important to note that politicians are worse off than shift workers because the night work and extended hours of work are not constant. We never quite know whether we are going to be here at midnight or whether we are going to be here at 3 a.m. We can even go on in an interrupted fashion not being aware as to what is going to occur from one moment to the next. This has been fairly evident in behaviour tonight with the adjournment being abrogated and then a disruption as to whether we were or were not going to have particular Bills debated. There is a problem associated not only with the extended hours of work and the inconstancy but also with the fact that politicians, in particular, do not have time to condition themselves to the conditions of work as do shift workers.

         Mr Deputy President, people are not machines. We cannot expect these people who work within the confines of the department to turn on and turn off just as we switch the lights on and off. I note tonight that the Deputy Clerk of the Senate has been frequently coughing and needing to clear her throat. It is believed by many people that an illness is going through the department at the moment. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, in most cases it is not at all physical. I have had to stave off people who want antibiotics for this illness. It is a classic stress-related disorder where people get run-down and start getting coughs and colds or similar symptoms.

The obligation is on the Government to control the business of the Senate so that this does not occur. I seize this opportunity tonight. It is very early in the legislative program; it is time to take remedial action before it becomes an absolute scandal, not only in relation to the stress-related disorders of the workers within this department but also in relation to the associated costs because, ultimately, the taxpayer will have to pay.

I therefore take the opportunity to put on the public record that it is the lack of respect shown by coalition senators for the program of Bills under discussion that has led both to the lateness of the hour for discussion of Bills which were scheduled for much earlier in the day and to delaying all their colleagues from going home. Coalition senators spent hours on repetitive and tedious questioning of Senator Collins, then they spent hours repeating themselves on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill. It is exactly this game playing that has resulted in the cynicism and despair of Australian people with politicians and the irrelevance of the political agenda to people's real concerns.

        (2) During the past 18-months Ministers issued 287 media releases. The cost of NewsNet for that period was about $71,000. For the period October 1991 to October 1992 the Department mailed out approximately every two months a publication of major media releases at a cost of about $2,000 an issue, including external printing and mail house costs. A new system was introduced in November 1992 and a summary of media releases is now prepared monthly. The approximate monthly cost of this is $85 for in-house printing and distribution. This gives a total of $83,425 for the 18 month period. Therefore the approximate average cost of distribution of each media release is $291.

        (4) Mr Doohan's facsimile dated 16 November 1992 to the Office of the Prime Minister referred to correspondence from the Minister for Defence dated 8 October 1992 responding to claims made by Mr Doohan concerning the sinking of HMAS

        . The Minister had informed Mr Doohan that there was a limit to the amount of resources his Department could expend on this issue. He therefore advised Mr Doohan that unless irrefutable evidence was produced which disproved the accepted version of what happened to HMAS

        he now considered the matter closed. In his facsimile Mr Doohan confirmed his `intended compliance' with the request for such evidence.

        (5) At this juncture there is no justification for an inquiry. As far as the Department of Defence and the Naval Historical Section is able to ascertain, no such evidence exists. Nor has Mr Doohan as yet provided relevant, verifiable evidence. The Minister for Defence in his correspondence to Mr Doohan of 8 October 1992 noted that defence historians believed there is insufficient  hard evidence to warrant the type of open-ended research Mr Doohan advocates. The Government has no objections to Mr Doohan pursuing his private investigations through the Australian Archives and other avenues, but believes his case would be best assessed by reputable historians and their academic peers in relevant fields.
