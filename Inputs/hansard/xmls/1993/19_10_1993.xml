         —I endorse the comments of Senator Collins in that respect. A claim can be made about anything. Whether it succeeds is the question. The truth of the matter is that so far as freehold title is concerned there is no question of any claim being sustainable. So far as leasehold titles are concerned, the High Court decision makes it absolutely clear, for land in respect of which valid leases have been issued in times past,  that there is no credible basis on which it could be believed other than that native title is extinguished.

         For claims made in respect of leasehold land where there is some reason to believe that the grant of title might conceivably have been invalid—as I said yesterday, that is only a tiny percentage of all the leasehold interests that have been granted in this country—the legislation will make it perfectly clear that the validation procedure carries with it the extinguishment of any such claim to native title. The only residual native title that will be able to be claimed in respect of land which has already been alienated in the past, whether by way of freehold or leasehold, will be in respect of leasehold interest that is vested in Aboriginal people in situations where, as has been announced, they themselves can establish a properly based claim to native title. Under those circumstances there is an option for native title to be vested in them.

         In this context, I recently had a meeting with representatives of various members of the financial community, including a senior executive from a German bank. He was discussing European and international financial community reaction about investment. He said that no-one in the international financial community was talking about the investment uncertainty flowing from Mabo—after all, many European countries are having to deal with similar issues after the collapse of the Iron Curtain. However, he emphasised that the international financial community is talking about the uncertainty flowing from the obstruction in the Senate of the government's medium term deficit reduction strategy.

         But the IMF has said that it is very important that governments everywhere acknowledge that the re-emergence of large budget deficits would be a cause of great concern—I am paraphrasing there—and a failure to reduce substantially these imbalances over the medium term would likely cause renewed upward pressure on long-term interest rates, reduce capital formation and the scope for new job creation in the private sector, lower the rate of growth of potential output and income, and continue to impede the flexibility of fiscal policy in the event of adverse cyclical developments. It went on to say further:

        As recent experience in several countries shows, early announcement and legislation of credible medium term deficit reduction measures have immediate beneficial effects on long term interest rates and on economic confidence, even when recessionary conditions make it difficult to undertake significant deficits in the short run.

        I welcome the fact that the opposition recognises that the stock market, consumer confidence and the dollar are all going up. All those are significant pluses for the economy, just as it is a plus that we are growing faster than any other country in the Western world; all those things are pluses. But it is not an excuse for irresponsibility. It is not an excuse for trying to undermine the medium-term deficit reduction strategy which is fundamental to the long-term economic success of this country. The opposition's irresponsible approach puts in grave danger the job creation priorities that the medium-term deficit reduction strategy makes possible.

         One way of describing native title is to say that it is like a deck of cards, in a sense, with a number of different components in it, depending on the context. But the particular context that seems to trouble the opposition is the effectively exclusive occupancy characteristic of native title in respect of particular tracts of land. So far as that is concerned, the position is as we have described it: that native title right will have to be established through the court system. It will then have to run the gauntlet of a process in the state court and tribunal system in determining the economic uses to which the land in question, the subject of the established native title claim, can be put. Whether those uses are mining uses or other kinds of uses will be a matter for determination by the relevant state and territory tribunals.

         There will be certain consequences that flow from particular kinds of uses being allowed for particular kinds of native title land. There will be compensation consequences in some contexts; there will be other kinds of non-monetary compensation remedies or compensation available in other contexts. It is impossible to succinctly summarise what the particular residual content of the native title will be after it has run the gauntlet of all those processes. It depends on the particular process that is adopted and the particular result of that process in the particular context.

         The precise content of that title might be some sort of residual sliver of rights or, for example, perhaps some formally acknowledged recognition of what previously has been a common law right of occupancy, or a statutory reservation that has been granted to Aboriginal people in respect of some particular tract of land. It is possible in some contexts to imagine that being acknowledged now as a result of these processes as a form of native title. Beyond that, we are talking about the kind of interests that are enjoyed by ordinary non-Aboriginal people in respect of land in question given the nature of the particular interest that is involved.

         It is also true that the Office of the Status of Women is the area of government that has put violence against women on the political agenda.

         Compensation is payable, of course, in the context of where existing grants have had to be validated by the operation of statute. That validation process does not result in any liability for compensation on the part of the actual lessees; it is a matter for government to pick up the tab. What the size of that tab will be is impossible to quantify at this stage, but our expectation is that the sum will be very small for exactly the reasons that I have spelt out previously.

         In the case of valid grants, which are presumed to be the overwhelming majority of those that have been made in the past, no question of compensation will arise. Extinguishment, according to the High Court judgment, has been already accomplished. It does not need a statute to do that. The only context in which the statute has bite of its own and where compensation accordingly becomes payable is where there has to be a validation process occurring in order to correct some defect that the court might find.

         As I said yesterday at great and nauseous length—and I hope I do not need to repeat it—it is our expectation that there will only be at best, if any, a tiny minority of cases where it will be able to be established that something in the nature of validation was required because the original grant was invalid. Post-1975 it is conceivable that a grant would have been invalid because of a failure to apply the principles applicable under the Racial Discrimination Act, but even that is highly arguable. And, of course, only a very small number of relevant leasehold interests have been granted since 1975 anyway.

         Otherwise, before 1975, the argument becomes even more tenuous as to what the nature of a possible invalidation may have been. It has to be based on the existence of native title and some other law—presumably a law of fiduciary duty or something of that kind—in respect of which there is very little reason to believe that any plausible case will ever be able to be mounted. Against that background and that being the context in which compensation may be payable—although it is impossible to quantify, and will remain so in advance of the event—there is no reason whatsoever to believe that a large sum will be involved.

It shows that it is concerned about some of the things that have been going on and is willing to respond in a way that will satisfy international opinion, and rightly so.

         —The very nature of the grounds that have been mentioned here are such as to make them extremely unlikely to arise in practice. It is impossible to  quantify that. One has to satisfy a series of criteria before one can even get to first base. First of all, one obviously has to have a credible native title claim in respect of the particular land in question by a current group of Aboriginal people who can establish the necessary connection with the land. That would exclude the overwhelming majority of leasehold interests around the country from even prima facie exposure to such claims.

         Secondly, one has to have some kind of basis for suggesting that there was some breach of duty or some other legal principle offended in conjunction with the availability of native title in order to have given rise to some invalidation. The legislation that we are proposing—both the government's and that which we are inviting the states to enact, and I am sure they will—will result immediately in the up front, here and now validation of any such potentially invalid leases.

         The effect of that legislation will be to remove any ground for concern so far as any individual leaseholder is concerned anywhere in the country. It is just conceivable that in some isolated cases nonetheless members of an Aboriginal group may decide that they think they have some basis on which to mount a claim. They can do that. They can make their claim in the courts. If in the extremely unlikely event—and every lawyer I have spoken to in the country takes the view that it is an extremely unlikely event—that they happen to succeed in that claim, then there would be a question, as I said earlier, of compensation arising. But again it is not something which would, in any way, affect the position of the leaseholder. It would be a matter for the government to provide.

We cannot legislate against people bringing claims, but we can legislate in a way to make it absolutely clear, in accordance with accepted principles, that there will not be any adverse consequences flowing from that—either the claim being made or even in the extremely unlikely event of that claim being upheld.

         With respect to the last part of Senator Bourne's question, our policy does prohibit the disposal in Australia of other countries' radioactive wastes. That has been applied through the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, under which radioactive materials are listed in schedule B. Importation is not permitted unless authorised by the relevant minister. While we do intend to introduce legislation to prohibit absolutely the importation of high level radioactive wastes of foreign origin, we import a number of goods whose classification as radioactive or waste may be difficult to resolve.

Those provisions make very clear that, in the case of native title sought over existing areas the subject of mining operations and so on, title will be subject to all sorts of determinations and limitations that will ensure the continuity of the present operations. So far as title grants are made now in respect of land over which subsequent exploration or mining licences are sought, it will again be a matter of the relevant interests being weighed and balanced through the tribunal and court process that is being set up.

         Basically, two streams of activity go on. One stream of activity is to determine the existence of the native title in the particular context, with the content of that title depending on the nature of the traditional association and all the rest of the things that have been spelt out in previous discussion papers. But the potential of other forms of economic activity nonetheless to take place, although that title has been acknowledged, will then depend on the second stream of determinations through the economic use tribunals, if I might so describe them, which will be essentially the existing mining wardens' courts in the present state.

         It will be the state and territory tribunals that determine the economic uses, including mining uses of all kinds, to which the particular land, the subject of native title, can be put. Certain consequences flow from that in terms of rights of negotiation, compensation and all the rest of it, but that equally is determined by those tribunals. It will be perfectly possible for these various interests to coexist in that sense. It is for that reason that I think one will find that the final reaction of the mining industry to this package of legislation will be quite muted, if not indeed supportive. We will have to wait and see. It is always possible for scaremongering campaigns to be mounted in that context or any other, but the government is very conscious of the need to get this balance right between the national economic interest and the Aboriginal interest. That is one of the things we believe we have achieved with this legislation.

        He then goes on to talk about the time limits. In the minister's previous capacity as minister for energy, he will appreciate the detail involved in the application for mining exploration areas and then going on to a lease. It seems to me, from reading the Prime Minister's statement, that in practice the minimum amount of time required for anyone seeking an exploration licence and then going on to get permission to develop a mine would be in the order of 18 months. That is before any other approvals can be sought. I just seek the minister's views on that matter.

         These figures are a dramatic improvement on the 3,800 fatalities recorded in 1970. A number of measures and events have contributed to sustained reductions in the road toll from that totally objectionable level in 1970. These have included the introduction of blood alcohol limits; the compulsory wearing of seat belts and motorcycle safety helmets introduced in the early 1970s; the introduction by most states of random breath testing in the early 1980s, which I think has made a very significant contribution, particularly, to change community attitudes to drink driving; the federal government's 10-point package of road safety measures adopted by all states and territories from 1989, which introduced uniform blood alcohol concentration levels and the compulsory wearing of bicycle helmets; significant improvements in vehicle safety design encouraged by ongoing development of motor vehicle standards by the federal government; and perhaps most importantly, a marked change in community attitudes to road safety which many of the initiatives that I have just mentioned had a role in forming.

         The basic point is that the government will maintain the integrity of both the immigration program and the SAC program by insisting that people who apply to come here, first, will be in Cambodia when they apply and will have been there for some 12 months before being eligible to apply under the SAC program and, secondly, will be sponsored by family or close links within Australia.

         This program is at the moment running at some 6,300 strong; it applies in compassionate circumstances to people from a number of countries. I think the biggest intake under this program now comes from former Yugoslavia. But the Cambodian SAC recognises that the Cambodian people have suffered hardship due to the political and social turmoil over recent years, and that that hardship has denied them the educational and social development that may have enabled them to obtain the qualifications required under our family reunion program. The SAC package is a compassionate response to their plight.

         In deciding that only those who are within Cambodia can apply to come to Australia for permanent residence under this program, we should also keep in mind that already the UNHCR has supervised the resettlement of some 380,000 Cambodians back into Cambodia from border camps in places such as Thailand. The advice from the UNHCR officials is that the human rights situation within Cambodia is such that those 380,000 people who have returned are in safety and that others who return would not be imperilled because of any aspect that would make them refugees.

No-one who is in Australia will be able to apply from within Australia to access this program. As both Senator Teague and I know, those who are in Australia on detention now are people who have been refused refugee status and are now pursuing cases through judicial review.

        I thank the minister for the longer reply which he provided today, but I am disturbed by several matters which he raises in his answer, namely, that this waste was reported to contain: strontium, presumably strontium 90, which has a half-life of some 28 years; cobalt, presumably cobalt 60, which has a half-life of some 10 years; and caesium, presumably caesium 137, with a half-life of about 30 years. So although the materials which are being dumped are in small amounts in terms of their total quantity—and the total quantity is given as 2.18 curies—these materials will be present in the marine environment for quite a considerable length of time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These are all materials which are taken up by biological systems and can therefore undergo very considerable bio-concentration. Strontium, particularly, is taken up into bones and therefore can be concentrated in that form. Caesium is preferentially taken up into muscles and, of course, can be concentrated there. If they were to enter food chains, the amounts of radioactivity imbibed by humans who eat fish or other material from the ocean could be quite considerable.

         The minister goes on to explain that the Australian uranium which entered Russia was provided to third nations and simply underwent the increase in the concentration of the fissile uranium and that the material which went into Russia was all subsequently removed from Russia. The minister does not, however, indicate where the depleted uranium—the uranium 238, which had a smaller amount of uranium 235—went. I would be very pleased to hear where that went because we have subsequently learnt that the Americans, for instance, used depleted uranium in some of the shells used in the recent Iraqi war, and that has resulted in very considerable amounts of radioactive contamination in the areas of Iraq and Kuwait.

         Not only was the coalition excluded yesterday from the release of the report—a very important report in the history of the Office of the Status of Women—but so too were a number of women's groups. The minister might have used the excuse that this was a particular briefing for women's groups. However, while the press and Labor members were at the launch of the report by Mr Keating, coalition members and senators were not invited. I found that fairly perplexing and difficult to understand, given the fact that Senator Crowley has expressed to me the need for bipartisan support on many issues in the women's affairs area, and I have been cooperative with her in that regard. I hope this will be the last time that we are excluded.

So that was not new. We also found that the Department of Finance does not have the computer software to do what the APPOINT system, heralded a couple of years ago as an important development, was supposed to do. That software has never been installed in the Department of Finance. So it was not news that the APPOINT system was breaking down. As Senator Newman says, we have already asked about that.

Late last week my office offered Senator Patterson a comprehensive briefing of the report on the review. She actually chose not to respond and we again rang her office. So I do not believe that there is any mileage in Senator Patterson whingeing and complaining about not being offered the opportunity to hear about the review; indeed, she was offered a comprehensive briefing, as were her colleagues the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) and Senator Chamarette. Some of her other colleagues accepted this invitation. So Senator Patterson was offered a comprehensive briefing.

What if we had not measured the outcomes and seriously examined the structure and procedures in that office?

         I know this will surprise the minister: I welcome the review, but I have two criticisms. My first criticism is that it has taken this government so long to realise that there are no outcomes of the Office of the Status of Women to review. It is timely that there be a review of the office to make sure that in future it does a good job for the women of Australia.

         I point out that the Office of the Status of Women was singularly invisible when it came to doing something meaningful for the part-time women workers of Australia and the women who work in the home who have no access to meaningful retirement income. The opposition came up with some valuable policies for women in the retirement income area. But the Office of the Status of Women was totally silent on that issue. In any meaningful debate we have had in Australia in recent years the Office of the Status of Women has been invisible. There was clear evidence of this when Dr Anne Summers on the eve of the election suddenly tried to pull the government's failure on women's issues out of the fire for the Prime Minister as he was going to an election and she tried to show that the government had some sort of record for producing policy in this area.

The minister did not even invite the spokesperson from the opposition on the status of women. We all would like to have been invited. It seems very strange that the press gallery is invited en masse but the minister cannot even invite the opposition spokesperson on the status of women.

He would be much better served to walk humbly behind the procession, grateful for the sacrifice that was given under our flag. He should simply remember that many Australians have given in a way that he will never give and stop trying to denigrate all the things that are fundamental to this country.

         —I see. This is an indication of the sort of passion that is generated to the point where Senator Robert Ray needs to ask who wrote a question. The important thing is what questions were asked and what answers were given. I think we have a very real problem. Those questions were deliberately designed to elicit information in order to find out the basis on which these grandiose proposals were announced yesterday and to try to ascertain some fairly sensible answers to questions which are disturbing vast numbers of people around the countryside.

         In that sort of spirit, if this government is serious about Mabo as an issue—instead of engaging in some sort of cheap point scoring exercise, as Senator Robert Ray thinks it ought to be—I would have thought it would be very concerned to spell out, for example, the proportion of landmass which could be subject to native title claims; what analysis has been done; the extent to which there might be compensation payable; what rights attach to native title; what the cost sharing arrangements will be; and the effect on crown land of native title claims.

         The answer given by Senator Gareth Evans on that last point was very enlightening. He said that it will be decided on a case by case basis, meaning that it will be some years before many of these claims are finally determined by the courts. In the meantime, there will be all manner of claims. Whether they are serious or otherwise will not really matter to those who are subject to these claims because they will have that sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. They will be particularly anxious to try to bring certainty back into the exercise, particularly if they are conducting very substantial pastoral properties or mining activities. Therefore, they will effectively be compelled to negotiate settlements.

         That, of course, has nothing to do with the merits of the claims; that simply has to do with the fact that a claim has been brought. That is a very serious matter of concern, particularly to the many thousands of people who are likely to be affected. Yet all we got was a torrent of abuse from Senator Gareth Evans. I think we were called scavengers today; we were called all sorts of unmentionables yesterday. The riffraff opposite were constantly interjecting and trying to belittle the questions as though they were not serious and therefore not deserving of answers.

         Members of the government should not go around this countryside blaming us for whipping up scaremongering when the fact of the matter is that the government is deliberately choosing not to provide answers which it clearly ought to know. One assumes, despite all the triple backflips with pike that we have seen in recent times, that somewhere someone has been doing a bit of research and has come up with some basic information and statistics, but for the government's own reasons it is not prepared to release that sort of information to the public. It cannot really blame us or anyone else for being concerned about where these policies are likely to take Australia.

         I think it is a matter of profound regret that the government seems to have embarked on a course and has no idea how it will end. It has no idea what it is likely to cost. It has no idea who is likely to be affected. It has no idea how long it might take for claims to be resolved. In other words, the end result will be massive uncertainty brought about quite purposefully on the government's part presumably for some political advantage. If the government were fair dinkum about this exercise it would be swamping us with facts and figures to demonstrate that these claims are very containable. Instead, all we get are throwaway lines such as, `The cost will be very small' and `There will be a minuscule number of claims'. If that is the best the government can do, it deserves to have the Australian community very concerned indeed.

         —What we have been shown in this chamber today is that the opposition does not have a view on Mabo other than how it can exploit it for political purposes. That is just absolutely typical of an opposition that has thrown overboard and disposed of every item of policy since the last election. What those opposite are seeking to do with the aid of their ally, Premier Court, in Western Australia is whip up Mabo into a scare campaign. They have had only one success in the past 10 years and that was to oppose the four referendum proposals. This is an issue that the Liberal Party in particular seeks to exploit for political reasons. Yet, for all the opposition's questions today, we have not had one definitive statement on Mabo from those opposite.

        Before dealing in more detail with the last two matters, which are of greater significance, I would like to make a few observations on the other amendments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The superannuation determination amendments are simply to ensure that there is proper authority for determinations dealing with ongoing superannuation benefits for members of the Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The conscientious objection amendments would modify a right of appeal. Where a Conscientious Objection Tribunal has determined an application, there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") then to the Federal Court. At present, the Federal Court could hear a conscientious objection appeal from the AAT on a question of law and, with the leave of the Court, on any other ground. The amendments would eliminate the right of appeal on grounds other than questions of law, to accord with current administrative law policy whereby the AAT provides final merits review.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should add that, although these amendments are necessary to reflect administrative law policy, they are not expected to have any practical effect. This is because questions of conscientious objection arise only in the context of conscription, and there could be no conscription unless Australia was under direct threat of attack.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to streamline command and discipline procedures where forces of Australia and other countries serve together will avoid the requirement for a series of formal declarations where ongoing cooperation could be anticipated. A standing declaration, to cover a particular country, would invoke mutual powers of command and discipline whenever the forces of that country were serving together with ours. Of course, this facility would only be used for close allies where we could anticipate ongoing international cooperation, for example, in peacekeeping activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to enable a Minister instead of the Governor-General to appoint trustees of welfare trust funds are part of an ongoing process of relieving the Governor-General from involvement in the detail of Defence Force administration. The trusts in question administer welfare funds for each Service of the Defence Force and retirement units for ex-Air Force personnel.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I now turn to the two more significant matters in the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to remove a double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme will correct a drafting omission. The error would allow some members who elected to transfer from the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme to receive a double benefit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments have retrospective effect to the commencement of the new Scheme on 1 October 1991, to  remove the liability for the double benefit for members who have retired since then. Recent changes to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Rules have removed the problem for affected members who retire after 21 April 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are two groups of members eligible to receive double benefits: Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme members who had retired with a pension; and members who had separated from the Defence Force and transferred their benefits to another superannuation scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Where a member of either group re-entered the Defence Force and then transferred to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the drafting error would allow the member to retain the benefit derived from contributions paid in the first period of service and also to be paid those contributions again with interest. The amendments would remove the entitlement to the unintended double benefit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        43 former members are affected. They have been advised in writing that any payment of the double benefit would be recoverable but, as no additional monies have been paid to date, it is hoped to avoid the need for recovery action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On a more positive note, I come to the amendments to provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force who have been allotted for warlike service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In May of this year the Government agreed to a framework for conditions of service where members of the Defence Force are deployed overseas. The Government's aim is to ensure that members who are deployed overseas will be assured of consistent and timely benefits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An important element of the agreed conditions is an enhanced home loans benefit for personnel allotted to service declared as "warlike". This benefit will apply to members involved in the recent operational service in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. The same benefit will be available for members allotted for service in any future overseas operation of a comparable nature.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The additional benefit comprises waiver of the requirement for a qualifying period of 6 years service together with an additional subsidy period ranging from 2 to 5 years, depending on the length of warlike service. For example, members who have completed operational service in Somalia will now qualify for waiver of the 6 year qualifying period and an additional subsidy period of 3 years. The maximum subsidy period is also increased from 20 to 25 years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I have indicated, these benefits will be available also to all personnel allotted for future service declared as warlike and represent an ongoing commitment by the Government to see overseas service by Defence Force personnel appropriately recognised.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The kinds of operation in question are an essential element of Australia's determination to play a fitting role as a good international citizen. As the burden of that role often falls on members of the Defence Force who are deployed in extremely difficult circumstances, I am sure the Senate will support the Government's measures to establish a suitable framework for the associated conditions of service.

         That the Senate take note of the report.

        This report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure relates to the proposal by the government in this budget to extend the fringe benefits tax to business travel. The evidence presented to the committee, which is contained in the report, clearly shows this to be a flawed proposal both in revenue terms and in equity terms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As the report indicates, it has been very difficult for the committee to meet the terms of reference given to it by the Senate because of the indeterminate nature of this proposal, in particular, the rate which is to be struck to be regarded as a reasonable level beyond which fringe benefits tax is to apply to business travel accommodation. With that rate not having been provided to the committee, indeed, not having yet been formulated by the government, it was impossible for any accurate assessment to be made by the committee of the impact of this proposal on the tourism industry, the accommodation industry and related industries.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course, as a consequence of that the government has now withdrawn this particular part of the bill and, it is reported, will reintroduce it at a later stage. In terms of revenue, I simply say that all the evidence given before the committee indicated that, if this legislation were to be introduced, it would not raise revenue because business would ensure that whatever provisions were made for the accommodation of its employees were below the threshold. Therefore, fringe benefits tax would not result and the government would derive no revenue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other argument that has been put in favour of this proposal is that of equity—that it is an equity measure to ensure that what the government regards as unacceptably lavish standards of accommodation are not provided to business employees. In response to questions I asked of all witnesses before the committee—those from the accommodation and tourism sector, or the business sector generally, as well as the government representatives, the officials of Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office—they could not provide any evidence at all that businesses, in arrangement with their employees, provide a higher or more lavish standard of accommodation when those employees are required to travel on business activities in return for a lower salary. In other words, no evidence could be put forward to the committee that employees are substituting lavish accommodation arrangements for salary and thereby avoiding legitimate income tax on their salary. That is the first point to be made with regard to the equity argument—that there is no evidence of inequity in the current arrangements because no evidence could be provided that tax is being avoided through this process.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second argument in favour of equity put to the committee by the government representatives related to personal benefit—that, in their view, some personal benefit was derived by business employees when they travelled by staying in accommodation of standards above a prescribed level. I asked those representatives how that level of personal benefit could be measured, particularly in comparison with the situation of an employee who was not required to travel and was therefore able to remain in the comfort and familiar surroundings of his or her home. I asked how it was possible to assess the measure of personal benefit between one being accommodated at a certain level of accommodation when being required to travel away from home on business and being able to stay in one's own home. The response was that this was a subjective judgment. In other words, there is no objective basis on which this so-called personal benefit, which the government alleges is derived by certain business employees when required to travel, can be assessed. Therefore, on both aspects of the equity argument raised by the government, there is no case for this proposal.

         The minority report, which was prepared by my colleagues Senators Gibson and Macdonald along with me, highlights this as one of the obvious shortcomings in the government's arguments for this legislation. We also include in that minority report a number of other reservations that we have about this proposal which have arisen as a direct result of the evidence presented to the committee hearings. Therefore, we certainly welcome the fact that the government has now withdrawn this particular proposal from the tax bill within which it was included. That tax bill will proceed with other measures, but with this particular proposal to extend the fringe benefits tax withdrawn from it. It was suggested to us that this bill will return as a separate bill in the future when the government has undertaken further consultation with the industry and also has provided a discussion paper for the industry and, indeed, for us as members of the committee to consider.

         I might suggest to the government that it let this particular proposal disappear without trace. If it does reappear as a separate piece of legislation, that legislation should be subjected to the very closest scrutiny, as we have recommended in our minority report, to determine its impact on the industry and, of course, its equity circumstances. As I have said, in the evidence provided to this committee thus far, there is no justification for this proposal either on equity or on revenue grounds. That is why we have put forward this minority report which, while accepting the recommendations and conclusions reached by the majority of the committee, adds to it our particular concerns and our severe reservations about, and indeed opposition to, this proposal.

         The government's effort is rather a sad and sorry saga. While the objective—to ensure that the potential for any rorts in this area was excluded—was generally agreed, the government was not able to provide sufficient information to the committee or at any other stage to show that it had given adequate consideration to the effect of the proposed provisions on investment and employment in the accommodation and hospitality industries; nor, indeed, was it able to show that the objective would actually be achieved, or the extent to which it could be achieved, if such rorts in fact existed.

         While it is clear that the government had some anecdotal evidence and, clearly, there is an issue of equity involved in terms of the taxpayer subsidising benefits which may be granted to an employee by the employer—or, in the case of a self-employed person, in terms of expending what one could term `excessive amounts' on travel—the government has not been able to substantiate these arguments. To me, how the government proposes to address the reduction in investment and employment in the industry remains a very important question.

         We have had some evidence that when the tax deductibility of business lunches—as it was colloquially known—was withdrawn, turnover in the restaurant industry, which was catering for that trade, fell by 50 per cent; it recovered later to show a continuing reduction of 20 per cent. But here we have had no such assessments or no such figures.

         I think there is an additional difficulty in this particular proposal and the way the government went about it. The Senate was asked to approve the enabling legislation, leaving the actual threshold levels to be determined later by regulation. Clearly, that would have left the Senate in the position where disallowing the regulations was the only remedy, with a resulting uncertainty in the industry. But, to top it, the government expected the Senate to proceed to make that decision to pass the enabling legislation without providing the discussion paper which it is compiling on the basis of its consultations with the industry to determine what in fact would be a reasonable threshold level. I believe that such procedure is really quite unheard of. Obviously, the Democrats welcome the government decision, which we asked for, to withdraw these provisions relating to FBT on excess travel from the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and to reintroduce them in a separate bill.

         In my dissenting report, I make the point that I am calling on the government to include the threshold levels which it wishes to introduce as part of that legislation and not expect the Senate to give it carte blanche to introduce them by regulation later. However, it is to be expected that, no matter where the threshold levels are placed, some reduction in turnover for the Australian tourism, travel and hospitality industries will result.

         Therefore the second recommendation in my dissenting report is that the government include a provision in that legislation to remove tax deductibility for conventions held abroad by Australian companies. It is ludicrous that it is now possible for a professional or commercial organisation which is composed solely of Australian members to hold a convention or conference in Bali or Fiji, to spend Australian dollars in those places, supporting that nation's tourism and hospitality industries, and then to come back to Australia and ask for a tax deduction for the amounts expended.

         It seems to me that in this situation our industries need not only certainty—and we have asked for that in the legislation that is to be introduced; legislation which we will be able to scrutinise and, if necessary, amend—but also some tangible support. I believe that by removing the tax deductibility in this circumstance we would be providing that tangible support and encouraging Australian organisations to hold their conventions within Australia rather than take them to other countries in the region.

         The Australian Democrats do not resile from the need to find some appropriate measures to ensure that the potential for travel rorts of the kind that were claimed to be taking place is excluded. We will insist that these measures not harm our industries and we will expect them to be effective in achieving that objective.

         —This report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure concerns one of the pieces of budget legislation which, like much else in the budget, was ill-conceived and originated for all the wrong reasons. I think former Labor minister John Brown was correct when he said that this legislation was driven by the ideology of the Left, that the Labor Party had reverted to class envy of the worst kind for which it used to be known and which in more recent years, as a result of maturity, it had overthrown.

         It seems that this legislation, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, came about because the government was embarrassed by having slugged the poor, so to speak, with fuel tax and sales tax. It was a sop to the left wing element of the Labor Party, to the unions and to the social welfare groups. It appears—and John Brown gives credence to this—that the government said, `Oh, yes, but we're gonna get the rich businessmen too'. This piece of legislation was brought in on that basis.

         It became fairly clear during the inquiry that the government had neither considered fully all aspects of this legislation nor done any work on what the legislation might impose. I suppose the thought of getting at the rich businessmen appeals to most Australians. It became obvious that this legislation did not do that. But it would cost jobs. It was estimated that between 10,000 and 20,000 young Australians would be thrown out of work as a result of this piece of ill-conceived legislation. It was also shown that, far from being a budget measure that raised $60 million, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) adverted to in his budget speech, it would end up costing the federal government something of that order, if not more.

         The costs to industry of compliance would have been quite horrendous. Investment in the hotel and tourism industries, which we desperately need now, would have been stifled. There would have been difficulties in respect of investment in these industries, particularly at a time when Australia needs to expand in these areas. The hotel and tourism industries are two of the small number of remaining Australian industries that have anything going for them. They are two of the small number of industries in Australia that have been able to overcome the recession planned by the Labor Party. The tourism industry and the hotel and accommodation convention industry have been able to get ahead largely on the backs of overseas tourists and conventioneers who come to our country.

         This legislation, which was introduced without any thought by the government, is simply a sop to the left of the Labor Party. The industry became concerned immediately after it had worked through what the effects of the legislation would be. As a result, it raised this issue. The Liberal and National parties were concerned about the issue because we felt that sufficient thought had not gone into it.

         Naturally, on budget night we assumed that the government had looked seriously at and done some work on this legislation. That is what we expected, quite reasonably, on budget night. As it became very clear very quickly that that was not the case, the Liberal and National parties sought to refer this matter to a Senate committee. That is what happened, and the result is the report we are discussing today.

         I give credit to the committee, particularly its chairman, Senator Childs, who conducted the inquiry very fairly. I think the committee came to a very sensible decision in its report. As Senator Spindler has said, it became clear to all of us on the committee that we were being asked to report on certain aspects of the bill when the government really did not have any detail on which we could work. It was indicated on budget night that the allowance would be somehow related to the Public Service allowance, and so the industry used that as the benchmark for some calculations. Just as we started on this inquiry, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said, `Oh, well, I'm taking that back. We're not going to use that anymore'. So we did not quite know where we were or what was to be proposed.

         What the Senate was being asked to do was pass legislation that had no detail at all—the government would come along in two or three months time and introduce some regulations that had not been initially before this chamber; regulations which could impose taxes on the tourism and hospitality industries. Initially, the Liberal members of that committee certainly could not answer questions that were asked simply because the government did not have any details. The government had not done any work on the legislation and did not know what it was all about.

         It became clear from the evidence that the measure was certainly not a revenue measure. When Senator McMullan appeared before the committee, he tried to pretend or kid us that the legislation had revenue considerations and that there was big money involved. We got the old Labor Party line of `You're being irresponsible; you're holding up the budget; you're not going to give us all this money we need to pay for tax cuts'. That was the standard Senator McMullan line. But what he was saying in the committee hearing had been previously contradicted by the Assistant Treasurer who, in a letter, said, `This measure is not driven by revenue considerations'. By the end of the day, I do not think anybody believed there was any revenue in it.

         We heard different evidence which could reasonably have led the committee to resolve—some members may not have come to this conclusion, but the evidence was certainly before us—that a large number of jobs would have been lost in Australia. In the end, no-one even pretended that there were any revenue considerations in the legislation. The compliance costs could have been quite substantial. I think there was a fairly clear indication that investment in the hotel industry—much-needed investment, particularly in the run-up to the Olympic Games—would have been dealt quite a severe blow.

         It also became quite obvious to the committee that there had been no consultation between the government and the industry about how these quite horrific or quite substantial measures may have affected the industry. It also seemed from evidence—although Senator McMullan wiggled around the answer—that even the tourism minister was not drawn into the Treasurer's confidence when these measures were being considered.

         The Liberal members on the committee were concerned about any excesses that there might be in business travel. Nobody could give us any examples of it. People used to say, `Yes, it is there'. No-one from the industry, no-one from Treasury and no-one from the Taxation Office could give us any evidence about it. One of the witnesses to the inquiry listed a series of five possible rorts and suggested that there were other ways of overcoming those rorts. Curiously, when the Taxation Office responded to that submission, it said, `You do not need new legislation to get at those rorts because we already have legislation under the existing tax acts to attack those sorts of rorts'. If we do not need new legislation, if we have it currently, why do we need this legislation to try to overcome those rorts?

         I and my coalition colleagues on the committee agree with Senator Spindler that, if in the future any legislation is to come before the parliament regarding this sort of thing, it should be detailed legislation. The government should not bring it in here and say to the Senate, `You approve this in broad principle. We will not tell you what it is about. We will not give you the opportunity to investigate whether it will cost jobs, whether it will raise revenue, or whether it will cost a lot to comply with. You just approve it in principle. We will go away and do the regulations, work out the formulas and we will introduce them behind the closed door by regulation'. That is not good enough. We on this side agree with Senator Spindler—or he probably agrees with us, and it is part of the minority report that we have put in—that any further proposals should be contained entirely in the legislation and not be left to be implemented by regulation.

         In our dissenting report—although it is better to say the additional conclusions in the general report, because we do agree with the majority conclusions of the report—we thought it appropriate to make two additional recommendations, one of which I have just mentioned. The other one indicated that, from what we gathered from all the evidence given to us, no case had been made out for this legislation at all. We were very doubtful that there was a need for this type of legislation. So we have additionally recommended to the Senate that if legislation regarding the so-called excess business travel expenditures is again brought before the Senate, it should be subjected by this Senate to the most intense scrutiny to establish: firstly, the need; secondly, the purpose; and, thirdly, the effect of that legislation. Whilst it has been put in other words, all members of the committee—Labor members, Democrat members and certainly the Liberal members—agree that if this legislation were to come before us again, it should be subjected to the most intense scrutiny by this chamber.

         Although we in the Liberal and National parties have not had any time to seriously consider the second recommendation proposed by Senator Spindler, it would seem at first glance that it is not something that we could support. It is building up the tariff walls again, saying that any Australian conventioneers who go overseas will be penalised in a tax way if that happens. I think Senator Burns quite rightly pointed out that, if we start doing that, we will certainly get into a trade war with our trading partners and it would not be very long before all the Americans and Japanese and Asians who came to Australia for conventions would be subjected to tax penalties in their own countries for coming here. I really do not want to get involved in that; I suggest to Senator Spindler that he would have a lot of convincing to do if he wanted us to agree with that.

         As this matter has been left, the Assistant Treasurer—who seems to be in charge of all of this—is indicating that he will talk further with the industry. The Assistant Treasurer somewhat belatedly—nevertheless it is welcome—instituted some sort of dialogue with the industry and has called for and received submissions. It is the Assistant Treasurer's intention, as I understand it, to publish a discussion paper which he will then make available to members of the committee and to the Senate so the matter can be further considered. I certainly hope that the Assistant Treasurer will come to the conclusion rapidly, if he has not done so already several weeks ago. I suspect that is what it is all about; I think he realised a couple of weeks ago that this was all wrong and that what he needed to do was to try to extricate himself and the government as best and as quickly as he could. If he has not come to that conclusion, I am quite sure that, by the end of this consultation period, he will have come to that conclusion.

         I certainly hope that the government would think very seriously and very long about whether there is really any necessity to do this. If there are a couple of perceived rorts, then I think we have been told quite clearly that there are other ways of attacking it. It does not raise revenue. It could affect jobs. So why bother with it? I just hope this is another one of those pieces of legislation in this 1993 budget that will be thrown onto the ever growing discard pile. I think in this instance that is appropriate.

I hope they maintain that mature approach and that this is the last we see of this legislation.

         —I rise to continue debate on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 which concern the proposed increase in levy on fuels. As I said last night, I am very concerned about what this measure and other measures in the budget are doing to the investment climate here in Australia. Why is this important? It is only through investment that we are going to grow jobs in this economy. Unless we have an attractive investment climate, unemployment will not go down, and that is what we need to fix.

         Last night I made mention of the fact that virtually all the OECD countries are doing three things: they are containing their budget deficits; they are increasing savings; and they are deregulating their labour markets. What are we doing? We are heading in the reverse direction. With regard to the labour market, it is obvious that the government has given in to the ACTU on genuine enterprise agreements concerning non-union labour. It is now threatening to give in with regard to secondary boycotts, which is going in the reverse direction to that of the rest of the world. Those measures are sure to guarantee double digit unemployment in this country for quite a long time.

         In the June quarter of this year national savings fell by 1.2 per cent of GDP—about $1.2 billion. This was the largest single quarterly fall since 1974. National savings fell by $3.2 billion last financial year. The main culprit is the federal government. As the FitzGerald report aptly pointed out, the government's deficits are the main problem with regard to savings in Australia. Here we have a government saying that its budget is about jobs but its policies are heading in the reverse direction.

         Investment in Australia is in crisis. Investment in plant and equipment in Australia for the last two financial years has been less than six per cent of GDP—the lowest level since World War II. The level should be around eight to 10 per cent. That needs encouragement. We should compare this with our competitive country just across the Tasman—New Zealand—where unemployment is now below 10 per cent, capital expenditure is expanding quite substantially and the budget deficit and the current account deficit are close to balance. It is not hard to see that the New Zealand dollar will be equivalent to the Australian dollar in the not too distant future.

         What should we be doing? We should be lowering costs and increasing savings. We need to free up the labour market and lower costs in the transport industry. What are we doing in the transport industry? The increase in levies proposed in these two bills will increase transport costs substantially. The fuel levy will increase shipping costs. I will not go into the details, which my colleagues went over yesterday, but we are well aware that shipping costs will go up substantially. The estimates are that shipping costs around the coast will increase by 2.1 per cent—$360,000 per ship. It is a very important matter to my home state of Tasmania. It means that all goods in Tasmania will go up in price.

         Other transport costs for road and rail will also go up very substantially. The industry estimates that this fuel levy will increase road costs by three per cent across the nation. With our road and rail transport costs being so important in our huge nation, the cost of everything will go up. In addition, we will have an increased levy on fuel oil. Last night my colleague Senator Parer mentioned two mines in detail—Savage River, in my home state of Tasmania, and the Nabalco alumina refinery at Gove in northern Australia. Without going into the details, the problems at Savage River are serious. The excise will increase the cost of product by $1.15 per tonne when the value of the product is $36.60 per tonne. That will be a quite substantial increase in the cost of the product. Management has no doubt that this matter could easily cause the early closure of the mine. The feasibility study for taking the mine underground is certainly at risk.

         In northern Australia we have the extraordinary example of the Nabalco alumina refinery. In one fell swoop, its costs are expected to rise by $25 million per year. We might think that Nabalco does not matter as it is just a foreign owned enterprise. That is not true. Whilst 70 per cent of it is owned by Swiss Aluminium Australia Ltd and basically managed by that company, CSR owns about 20 per cent and the AMP Society, superannuation funds and similar groups own a further 10 per cent. It is one of 32 alumina refineries in the world, but unfortunately its energy costs are the fourth highest in the world. Here we have a government, without even conferring with it, putting a $25 million cost impost on that enterprise. Those are some excellent examples of the government, without really thinking about what it was doing, imposing substantial costs on business and providing a further deterrent to investment in Australia.

         How do we increase savings? As the FitzGerald report pointed out quite clearly, the federal government is the main culprit for decreasing savings. We applaud the government's aim to chase a one per cent deficit by 1995-96 but it ought to be chasing a surplus by then because that is what is really required to return Australia to a position where it is making savings. We cannot go on accumulating debt. We have to increase savings in Australia.

         The government is not taking this matter seriously enough. The investment climate here is extremely bad. Not many Australians really understand that investment is now a global business. Investment does not have to take place here in Australia. Neither Australian savings nor foreigners' savings have to be invested here. One interesting statistic I came across a while ago showed that over 50 per cent of Australian money put into trust funds of various sorts during the last quarter—the quarter ended 30 June—went off-shore. The AMP Society—the largest investor in Australia—is saying publicly that its policy is to put 25 per cent of its funds off-shore. Why? Because it does not have the confidence to invest here in Australia.

         Investors have to be persuaded—we are not talking about just big projects but small projects as well—that it is worth while to invest here in Australia. Until that happens, there will be no decrease in unemployment and no optimistic future for our children. Instead of imposing this additional cost on fuel, the government must cut its costs. We are expected to approve a levy on fuel which puts up all business costs across the nation when the government puts up its own expenditure by 3.9 per cent in real terms this year, on top of increases of 5.3 per cent and 5.5 per cent for the last two years. So we have seen a 15 per cent increase in real costs for the Commonwealth government over the last three years.

         In the real world, any managing director who could not cut costs by 10 per cent would be sacked. That is what has been going on right across the board if we take note of what has been happening in the private sector in Australia. Firms have been achieving that and much higher rates of cost reduction in order to survive against the harsh competitive world. Yet the Commonwealth government seems to be insulated from all of this. Even state governments are meeting those targets and reducing their costs substantially. So why is the government imposing taxes when we really should be tackling cost reduction within the Commonwealth government? That is the issue, and I support the Opposition's case against these bills.

A fuel tax, and the imposition of an increase in it, is an increased tax on every single good and service. Every good and service will be affected to a greater or lesser extent by the increase in the fuel tax. Because of our heavy reliance on road and rail transportation, the cost of the extra tax on fuel will be added to everything we buy.

         It is a fact that the fuel excise impacts disproportionately on people who live outside metropolitan areas. I recently conducted a survey amongst South Australian Farmers' Federation branch presidents and secretaries. I asked them to rate their level of concern in some 24 different categories of government policy which are influencing them. Honourable senators would not believe it, but what came out on top as the major concern to people who live outside the metropolitan area and to these secretaries was fuel tax—and that was prior to the introduction of the budget.

         As well as fuel tax, there were concerns about commodity prices, the wool crisis, European Community and United States subsidies, stamp duty and the cost of tertiary education, but it is a fact that the major area of concern to them was the effects of a fuel tax and, certainly by now, the increase in the fuel tax. Of over 80 per cent of the farmers' federation presidents and secretaries, the major concern from all those 24 categories is the cost of fuel and the impact of the tax.

         This fuel tax increase will also impact on tourism. It is a tax on tourism. This topic came up for discussion in the estimates on 26 August when both Senator Ian Macdonald and I questioned Senator Schacht, who was representing the Minister for Tourism, and the departmental officers about the impact of the fuel excise increase on regional tourism. At that committee hearing, Senator Schacht agreed that about 80 per cent of Australian tourists travel around Australia by motor vehicle and that the increase in petrol tax will increase the costs of people travelling to rural and regional Australia. But we were unable to elicit from Senator Schacht whether the Department of Tourism had done any work prior to the budget on just how fuel tax increases will impact on tourism in regional Australia.

         Senator Margetts spent a lot of time talking about the effect lead will have on the environment. Senator Coulter did also. The one thing that they did not mention, and it has been admitted by government ministers, is that the use of a fuel tax is entirely a revenue raiser. I do not know why they do not admit that it is a revenue raiser. It has nothing to do with lead in the environment and it has nothing to do with making sure that the money raised by the increase in the fuel tax is used for improving the environment. It would do Senator Margetts well to consider the impact this increase in fuel tax would have on regional areas particularly in her home state of Western Australia, where people have such vast distances to travel.

It has been mentioned before in this debate that we went through that last May when consideration was given to the importation into Australia of second-hand cars which use lead free petrol. That legislation was knocked out because it was considered that it would have too big an impact on the car industry. Now we have the situation where the government is thinking about reconsidering its position—or so we have heard—on the importation of second-hand cars which use lead free petrol. Senator Margetts need not be concerned about old cars being dumped in Australia. If cars do come here they are going to be five years old or less and will use unleaded petrol.

We also understand that taxes form the basis for raising revenue. It is important to make sure when raising revenue that the taxes that are raised are equitably shared.

These people have to use fuel in their farming enterprises and in every aspect of the running of their businesses.

         The explanatory notes indicate that these bills will result in the cost of leaded petrol increasing by 3c per litre from 18 August and a further 2c on top of that from February 1994 and again in August 1994. The cost of unleaded petrol will rise 3c per litre from 18 August and thereafter by 1c in February and August 1994. That will be the effect of these bills should they be passed this afternoon. The bills are the most significant and controversial part of the budget, as I mentioned before. As Senator Ferguson mentioned, they are nothing more than a fundraising exercise by the government.

Any price rises that occurred in commodities for those brief moments in 1988-89 were never passed down to the farm gate. Much of the profit was simply taken by the middlemen, the agents, the abattoir workers, the transporters or the exporters. But I stress that it never reached the farm gate. Because of this, there really is great social tension in rural Australia today. Rural Australia wants to know why it has to take another massive rise in petrol at a time when household incomes are at poverty levels and at a time when the export prices for commodities have collapsed to their lowest levels in a decade.

         I refer to the Commonwealth Bank's commodity price index, which has plunged by some 4.2 per cent in the last month. This is the lowest level on record, below the trough reached at the depths of the 1986 banana republic currency crisis. This is despite the value of Australian mineral exports increasing by five per cent. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics reveals that it is only the tumbling Australian dollar which has been cushioning the blow to the national income of sliding commodity prices and weak world demand. The rural sector, quite frankly, is being trashed. The anger about the deals done between the government and the Democrats with respect to petrol can be compared with the anger that the Italians showed towards Mussolini and his mistress.

         There is fast becoming a north and south divide in this country, as there was in America. The rural sector of Australia has become very much the defeated and the exploited south, with its carpetbaggers and all. The government continues to drive old Dixie down. I ask honourable senators to consider these figures: the latest DEET figures show that in my state of Victoria unemployment has doubled in some of the main regional cities. In Ballarat it is 18 per cent; in Mildura it is 18 per cent; in Maryborough it is 22 per cent; and in Morwell it is 16 per cent. The city of Melbourne has plateaued at a state average of around 12 per cent while rural unemployment continues to rise.

         Moreover, in my state of Victoria, the average rural income for a family—not a single income—is $28,000, and one should bear in mind the very high costs of living in the country areas. In the city of Melbourne, it is $40,000 and in the city of Canberra it happens to be $50,000. At the lower end of the scale in rural Victoria, those who earn less than $16,000 make up 23 per cent, while in Melbourne it is 12 per cent. At the higher end of the scale, families in rural Victoria with incomes above $60,000 make up nine per cent. In Melbourne it is 21 per cent. So the gulf between income and employment is greater than it really should be. A gulf really has opened up. As I said before, we are becoming a north and south divide.

This new tax, as described in the explanatory memorandum, will place it well and truly above that 20c per litre difference between city and country. The effects of this have been well described by my colleagues in the chamber this evening and yesterday.

         The facts are that these price increases will cause a disaster in the rural sector and will affect the rural sector much more than metropolitan areas. If these prices continue to rise in the country and if fuel and transport costs continue to rise, I wonder if it is not a good idea to take up the Industry Commission's recommendation and introduce a toll system. It does sound, at first blush, very unpalatable, but if it means relief from excise tax for rural people, then the day for consideration is drawing very close indeed.

The National Road Transport Commission has reported that non-metropolitan areas account for some 40 per cent of Victoria's petrol prices. Despite being major players in the market, rural communities and businesses receive no discounts and even pay freight costs which come free of charge to city customers. At times of heavy discounting in metropolitan areas, the price gap in the country has been larger still.

Any discounting in the city would be passed on to the country with only the transport costs added. Where there is a discount in the city, there would be a discount in the country. That is fair.

         Last month's budget has struck at the heart of rural Australia. It has placed another hurdle in the path of rural people as they struggle to survive. For the government speakers in this debate, the increase in petrol, diesel and other fuel prices was simply a revenue raiser and nothing more. The pathetic attempt to sell increases in fuel taxes for environmental or health reasons cannot be taken seriously. I think Senator Coulter would be the only one who takes that seriously. Certainly for the rural sector these taxes have presented another unanticipated blow to their livelihood.

We oppose aspects of this government's budget, particularly the fuel excise increases, for two reasons. First, the government has no mandate to introduce new taxes. On the contrary, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised as law—l-a-w—that there would be legislated tax cuts. Secondly, these increases are bad economics. The budget, as shown in the government's own papers, will not work—not one job created and inflation taking off. So much for the primary objective of this budget being jobs.

         A recent survey of average distances from services of families living on farms and in capital cities demonstrates the magnitude of the impact of fuel tax increases. The survey revealed that the average private distance travelled by farm families is just over 31,000 kilometres per year compared to just over 19,000 kilometres per year for a capital city family. On this basis the budget increase will cost a farm family about $160 a year extra—$60 more than their city cousins. Add to that the fact that country fuel is more expensive anyway and it makes the position even worse. Economic modelling by the Industry Commission of the effects of fuel taxes on the economy shows that these increases in fuel excise will reduce economic growth by 0.3 per cent, reduce exports by 1.4 per cent and increase unemployment by 0.4 per cent. On average they will reduce net farm profit by 10.4 per cent.

The government has been here for 11 years with all its bureaucrats devising these incredible taxes on ordinary Australians, forgetting that ordinary Australians live by the sea. One cannot even have power boats in Canberra. The government and its bureaucrats sit here and they never see a power boat. The public servants and the politicians would not know the effect that such a tax will have on the millions of Australians who actually use boats, because in this town people are restricted to sailing.

         This government probably is not aware—maybe some of its advisers are not aware—that most boats use petrol motors. They have an outboard on the back. One has to put petrol in it to make it go. Further, they just about all use leaded petrol. One of the most iniquitous things in this whole deal is that, under the guise of protecting the environment from the dreaded lead, leaded petrol is going to be made that much dearer. That is the latest treachery that has been played out on the people who indulge in boating and fishing.

The economy has been in an awful mess for a very long time. A lot of Australians, therefore, seek some escape from this misery by indulging in boating and fishing—pursuits which require petrol.

Every time they go down to their boat ramp, Paul Keating is standing on the ramp, ready to take his cut of the increase in the petrol price. The really terrible thing about this is that the further out people go to sea to try to escape Paul Keating and his tax, the more tax they will pay, because the further out they go, the more petrol they will use and the more Paul will take from them.

As soon as you walk in the door the boat dealer says, `Look, I'm sorry but the federal government has got a 20 per cent tax on outboard motors.

They can be seen down at the ramp driving in with their 15-year-old Holdens with the boat on the back. Now they are going to get slugged there.

However, the coalition's support for the government's irresponsible income tax cuts has greatly restricted the options available to reduce the impact of increased petrol excise as it is a major ingredient in paying for those tax cuts.

         One of our proposals was to balance the hike in petrol excise with a cancellation of registration and third party fees. We would replace these with a standard nation-wide scheme. The cost of owning a motor vehicle would be cheaper, but the cost of using that motor vehicle over a certain distance would become more expensive. By our calculations, that crossover point was 18,000 kilometres. However, in recognition that rural communities often drive great distances—and one study has set an average for rural families at 31,000 kilometres per year—we proposed that a full study of rural needs and costs, as well as measures to compensate, be carried out before imposing any higher excise. We believe this is the kind of process that the government ought to have put in place before introducing this measure.

         I would like to put on the record some other measures which would be feasible in reducing the extra costs associated with living in non-metropolitan areas. One possible option is to resurrect the petroleum product freight subsidisation scheme. This scheme, which has been around in a number of forms since 1965, subsidises the freight cost on petrol to remote areas. Currently it subsidises only those freight costs which are greater than approximately 15c per litre. That helps virtually nobody. It currently costs the government only about $3 million a year. At one stage in 1981-82 the differential between city and country was 0.44c per litre, and the cost for that year was $147.5 million—obviously a much more significant attempt to address the differential.

         We believe that one measure which could be introduced is an increase in the sales tax on energy inefficient cars. Whilst the argument would be put that rural people need powerful cars to travel on the highways, an extra tax could be justified on at least large capacity engines. Tying sales tax levels to fuel efficiency has been promoted by us for some time. An extra tax on large capacity engines could raise money to offset some of the above compensation measures or it could be made revenue neutral by a related reduction in tax levels on small fuel efficient cars.

One amount quoted is $3 every time the shopping trolley goes to the checkout counter. We would question the calculation of that amount; however, accepting that there is an increase in the shopping trolley cost, this means that increased freight costs have been passed on to the consumer. It seems strange to us that the road transport industry would then claim that it will have to bear the increased fuel excise on at least that proportion of the increase which is passed on.

The issues that are conflicting in the approach that has been taken by the government are social equity and environmental protection.

         It is appropriate to commence discussion with an examination of the environmental implications of this bill. Ostensibly, the proposal to increase the price of leaded petrol is designed to act as a market mechanism to encourage car owners to change to unleaded petrol wherever possible. This is undoubtedly a laudable aim, given the growing body of evidence that points to the detrimental health effects of lead on our children. We must, however, acknowledge the need to address the broader issue of the environmental and health implications of all vehicles emissions.

         There is a danger that, by concentrating only on the lead aspect of vehicle emissions, we may exacerbate the broader vehicle emission problems. There is scientific evidence which suggests that the adjustment of engines in older vehicles to allow them to use unleaded petrol will result in increased emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and other vehicle pollutants that contribute to the growing air pollution problems in our cities as well as to the global greenhouse problem.

         The approach that has been taken by the government also fails to address the more fundamental and long-term aspects of the problem of petrol usage. A price differential, as we have mentioned earlier, is useless if we perpetuate the urban sprawl that now dominates our cities and if we fail to provide planning options such as public transport, cycleways, urban villages and the like to encourage people out of cars.

         In the United States, for example, studies have found that general emission levels have been maintained at high levels despite a reduction in the emission levels in individual vehicles. This is due to the fact that the average urban miles travelled by vehicles is increasing substantially. An appropriate analogy can be drawn with alcohol levels in beer. If a beer drinker switched to a low alcohol beer but increased the amount of beer consumed, it is likely that the level of alcohol in the blood could remain the same as that when consuming a lower level of high alcohol beer.

         The question of social equity is vitally important. From the beginning, there has been nothing equitable about car ownership. The rich own new cars; the poorer people own old ones. Older cars cost more to run and are less safe and efficient. In the last decade the rich have realised that there is much to be said for inner city living. There are more services available, more sociability, a sense of character and amenity. As the rich moved into the cities, demographers pointed out that the poor have been pushed to the urban fringes. The urban sprawl which fits so well with car use disadvantages those without cars. It also makes provision of services and public transport outside the city core increasingly expensive. Without public transport the poor are doubly disadvantaged and so buy old cars and the vicious cycle takes another turn.

         A market based approach to this problem that does not contain measures to alleviate the impact of increased prices on those with low incomes is unjust. It is acknowledged that many of those who own the older cars that use leaded petrol are low income earners. These people are also often forced to live on the fringes of cities and, as a consequence, need to travel greater distances for work or social reasons. Not only will these people have to bear the additional costs associated with increased petrol prices but, if they wish to avoid that price difference, they will need to either buy a new car or modify their existing vehicles to allow them to use unleaded petrol.

         Beyond this—and the opposition speakers have referred to this consistently—there is the impact on the rural sector. While truck-in, truck-out rural towns do not foster local-regional development, there will be a major impact on these towns. Specific programs for rural development are also being cut along with many services such as schools, medical services and postal services, which are eroded within portfolios in the name of economic rationalisation. While not actually linking these issues to this bill, we feel that any government with integrity and the interests of ordinary people at heart cannot proceed with measures such as this unless it is also doing something to reduce the impact, through stimulating the local-regional economies that can reduce the dependency on long haul road freight.

         As I have said before, car use is inherently inequitable. The poor are excluded from cars; the slightly better off have old, inefficient cars. Yet our cities are designed around car use and penalise those who do not own cars. The poorest increasingly find themselves marginalised in the outer fringes where transport lines are longest and both services and public transport are least available. Car use will not ever be made equitable or sustainable. The way to achieve both social and environmental objectives is through restructuring our cities to reduce the need for private cars. This was the clear conclusion of the government's ESD transport working group.

         US studies have shown that carbon taxes that go into general revenue cost 10 to 25 times more than the cost of programs aimed at directly reducing energy use to accomplish the same reduction. We may force some people out of cars but it will be neither fair nor efficient. Using a small part of the revenue on the same basis as road funding to directly address the need for urban restructuring is a simple solution. Rural areas will be hit disproportionately at a time when they are suffering cutbacks in many other areas. Rural development programs will be halved in the next four years. While reducing the dependency on long haul shipping is a valid goal, it will not be achieved simply by making it more expensive.

         I have listened to this debate in all its entirety and it is now drawing to a close. It is with some sadness that I think of what Australia might have been. These increases in the petrol tax alone will add $580 million in tax to business and to our exports, which are what keeps Australia going. When I think how that makes us internationally uncompetitive and adds to the cost of the goods that we produce—which we have to try to sell overseas in competition with goods that are produced without those sorts of taxes—it makes me very sad indeed.

         In the federal election campaign we proposed to completely remove the fuel tax. One can only wonder at the enormously beneficial impact that would have had on business in Australia and our exporting industries—the things that would get Australia going—and the jobs it would create. If Australia had boomed as an economy because it was selling so much more overseas and its goods were internationally competitive, think of the jobs that would have been saved. Instead of having record unemployment and human and personal tragedy under this government, we could have had people working and a country booming. So it is with some real sadness that I speak in this debate, opposing yet another $580 million worth of taxes on jobs that will put even more Australians out of work.

         The range of these measures that are before the parliament at the moment have been very well debated and examined by my colleagues in this debate. They relate to an increased duty on imported tobacco, tobacco products and petroleum products. I, like most others taking part in this debate, wish to address the fuel tax issue. In passing, I will comment on the tobacco matter.

         In the federal election, I concede that we, like every other party, proposed increased taxes on tobacco, so we will not be opposing this measure at present. I come from the Mareeba area of North Queensland and we were subjected to a lot of submissions by the tobacco industry, which is facing a real problem. None of us can enjoy its predicament. Tobacco is the major industry of the Mareeba area, and its returns have been falling. The quantity of leaf that the industry has been selling is falling and it is in a real predicament. It really cannot grow much else successfully in that area, although it is getting into sugarcane at the moment.

         I mentioned this recently when travelling in a plane north with Mr Remzi Mulla, the head of the Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board. I said to him—I do not relate this as being Liberal-National party policy because it is not my responsibility to do that—that I would like the industry to find some proposal that would allow what is left of the Australian tobacco leaf industry to get a greater share of the tobacco that will forever be smoked within Australia. I do not know how to do that. I do not know which way to advise my friends in the Mareeba tobacco industry. I simply say to them that is what they have to look at. They have to turn all their attention to trying to find some answers to that so that we in this parliament can look at it and see if there is some way that we can help. There is no way that taxes on tobacco will fall. But accepting the fact that, no matter what tax is charged, some people will continue to smoke, I believe Australia has to act in the interests of the tobacco industry in Far North Queensland.

That means that the fuel tax currently paid by the Brisbane City Council is some $5 million. That amount is sucked out of the ratepayers in the Brisbane area. But the new tax, which it seems will go ahead, will put the Brisbane City Council in an even worse position. In one fell swoop, the Brisbane City Council will owe another $982,061 to the federal government in fuel tax.

This is one level of government paying a tax to another level of government. It seems incredible that the federal government could impose this sort of taxation on other levels of government. The first sheet that I have incorporated refers to Queensland councils. The second table that I have incorporated shows a range of councils around Australia. Ballina, on the north coast of New South Wales, will pay an additional $37,000-odd in increased fuel tax; Melbourne will pay an extra $548,000. Those figures are there for people to study.

The impact is even larger on a per capita basis because in the country people and councils use relatively more fuel. The tax burden in country areas is distributed between relatively fewer ratepayers—in some cases only a few hundred. The table shows the impact on some councils in Queensland. The council in the Barcoo Shire has only 189 ratepayers. The increase in the fuel tax will add an additional $14,000 to the rates in that locality, which averages out at another $74 per ratepayer.

The Coober Pedy shire uses 3.1 million litres of petrol and diesel. The figure is unusually high because the local electricity supply is run by diesel power.

         Once upon a time, in the Fraser days—the days of the previous Liberal government—things were different. Under the previous coalition government, almost all revenue raised from the fuel excise went towards roads. In 1983 under Fraser, about 6c of the 7c a litre excise was used to fund roads. Of the current 26c a litre of excise on fuel, about 6.5c goes towards roads—a disastrous and quite atrocious allocation to the road network from the fuel excise paid on the petrol that we consume.

Following this increase, only 18 per cent of the fuel excise we pay will be used on roads.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, I have almost run out of time. I emphasise that the impact of the fuel excise increase on local government is quite dramatic. This federal government continues to rip off another level of government with taxation increases from which it is not reimbursed. For all that the government says at election time about how much it is looking after local government, it seems to conveniently overlook the fact that it increasingly taxes local government in order to collect revenue.

But I emphasise that those of us who live in areas remote from capital cities have to use fuel more than our city counterparts. Many people who live in the cities would not understand that simply to go to a doctor, to a school or to a cultural activity requires a round trip of 200 or 300 kilometres. That is not done by choice; it is done because there is no other solution. Everything we use in the north is transported by road. The increase in fuel tax and the increase in sales tax which the government is introducing will impact upon country people. Because my time is up, I cannot give the attention I would have liked to that aspect of the increase in fuel tax.

         —in reply—There has been lengthy debate on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. These debates always generate a lot of concern and interest in the Senate. I do not think it would be unkind to the contributors who have made earnest and, in many cases, substantial contributions to say that, nevertheless, their speeches are essentially reiterations of known positions. I am not going to take the time of the Senate by responding point by point. I acknowledge the contributions that honourable senators from all sides have made in the second reading debate.

         Always when we are debating major revenue measures there are legitimate calls of apprehension about the consequences of the process by which the revenue is being raised. No revenue proposal is met with enthusiasm. People do not say, `This is absolutely right; it is a wonderful idea—please tax us a bit more'. I have not found that tax yet, and I have been looking for a while. I understand those concerns but honourable senators have to see this legislation in the context that this is another part of revenue which is an important aspect of the medium term deficit reduction strategy—a strategy which is very important and which is looking somewhat better than some people thought it might have been a little while ago.

         I am pleased to have those recent indications of support. I am also optimistic about the outcome of the vote. I think I have indicated to the whole Senate—I have certainly indicated to Senator Watson and other members of the opposition—that once we finish the second reading stage, it is our intention to adjourn the committee stage so that we can resume the second reading debate of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1).

         Because we are not going to move to the committee stage immediately, I will respond to a couple of foreshadowed amendments. Obviously, I do not agree with the opposition's second reading amendment, but that is a routine exercise. I will not waste any time discussing that; it is fairly standard action.

         The amendments foreshadowed by Senator Margetts fundamentally go to a concern about whether the government is serious about the lead abatement strategy. The answer is yes, we are. This measure, as well as raising revenue, will be beneficial in terms of its health consequences. I will be making that commitment clear in a package which I expect to be able to make public during the evening. I think that will allay people's concerns about the genuineness of the lead abatement strategy commitment of the government.

         Even though Senator Harradine has not spoken in the second reading debate, I understand that he has circulated a proposed amendment. I indicate that the government will be accepting Senator Harradine's amendment. That will allay some of the serious concerns that people had about the aspect of the bill which he is addressing. I reiterate that the government will be accepting and voting for the amendment to be moved by Senator Harradine. I indicate once again that, after the motion for the second reading of each bill has been passed, I will move the adjournment of the committee stage. I urge support for the second reading of this important package of measures.

         —I thank the Senate. We are continuing with the second reading debate of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993. I want to say at the outset that I think the package is in an unsatisfactory state because one of the key issues within the bill is that relating to credit unions.

         I understand that the government has significant amendments to its own bill resulting from, in part anyway, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that has just brought down a report, but I do not know what those amendments are. I know what the committee has recommended. I understand that Senator McMullan, to be fair to him, has given Senator Watson some idea of what the government is proposing. But it really means that the Senate is now in a second reading debate on a bill which will not be the bill that the government seeks to have carried. It is not as though it is a minor amendment; as I understand it, it is a substantial amendment that really changes the whole tenor of the bill in relation to credit unions, and that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.

         I understand that, as a result of another Senate committee which brought down its report, the provisions in relation to fringe benefits tax will be substantially changed. As we understand it, the provisions, as they relate to travel, will be removed from the bill. So that is not just a normal amendment that one gets in the committee stage of debate either; that is changing the structure of the bill as a whole in a very significant way. Therefore, for a second reason, the Senate is apparently being asked to debate something here tonight which is not the bill that the government will seek to have carried. That is highly unsatisfactory. If it means that the committee stage debate takes longer as a result of it, so be it, but what the government is seeking of us is simply not good enough.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, when the government initially presented its budget legislation to the parliament, as you will remember, many of the revenue raising measures were contained in one bill—the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The coalition received advice from several eminent constitutional lawyers that the bill, if enacted, would be vulnerable to a successful challenge under section 55 of the constitution. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of section 55. It states:

        The effect of the first paragraph of the section is that a law which imposes taxation cannot contain other measures. If it does, those other measures are invalid. Pursuant to the second paragraph, a law which imposes taxation cannot deal with more than one subject of taxation. If it does, the whole of the bill is invalid. The clear purpose of this section, combined with section 53, which prevents the Senate originating or amending money bills, is to allow the Senate to consider one taxation measure at a time.

         Therefore, we sought to refer the question of the constitutional validity of this bill, which contained measures including changes to the wholesale sales tax, income tax and fringe benefits tax, to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The fundamental issue was whether  any of the measures in the bill amounted to an imposition of taxation. While a range of opinions were presented to the committee on this question, only the government's principal adviser, the Chief General Counsel, expressed the view that there was definitely no imposition of taxation and, therefore, no risk of invalidity. The many submissions to the committee arguing that the bill may be unconstitutional divided broadly into two groups: those arguing that an increase in a rate of taxation amounts to an imposition of taxation, and those arguing that any increase in the incidence of taxation amounts to an imposition.

         In the light of these submissions, the committee unanimously concluded that there was a real risk which was significant that the bill, if enacted, would be found by the High Court to be a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55. At this point the government backed down and withdrew the bill. Its contents were then reintroduced in the other place in a series of eight new bills. Six of those bills—five dealing with wholesale sales tax and another containing the restructured l-a-w, law, personal income tax cuts—have already been considered. The remaining measures have been put into the two bills which are before us now.

         The coalition also received advice indicating that the constitutionality of Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 was doubtful. Both bills were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Four of the eight members of that committee, three coalition senators and one Democrat senator, came to the conclusion that both bills were of doubtful constitutionality.

         In relation to the No. 1 bill, the discussion centred on the new tax regime which is established for credit unions. Clause 41 of the bill removes an exemption which has previously applied to a large proportion of the income of credit unions, and clause 47 specifies a tax rate of 20 per cent for that income.

         The government's advisers argued to the committee that this is not an imposition of taxation; in fact, it amounts to a reduction, because the abolition of the exemption results in an liability to pay company tax at the general rate of 33 per cent, which is then reduced to 20 per cent by clause 47.

         The other side of the argument was ably put by Mr Tony Morris QC, who pointed out that the effect of clauses 41 and 47 taken together is that credit unions will now be liable to pay income tax at a rate of 20 per cent on income on which they are presently required to pay no tax. He considered that there is a real risk that the High Court would find that this amounts to an imposition of taxation.

         All four non-government senators accepted that there was a real chance that a High Court challenge to the validity of the bill may result in this provision being held to amount to an imposition of taxation.

         Further opinions provided to the committee suggested that there was also a risk, albeit a lesser one, that the extension of fringe benefits tax to excess domestic travel allowance may amount to an imposition of taxation. If the argument is accepted that any increase in the incidence of taxation amounts to an imposition, then the application of fringe benefits tax to a fringe benefit which was previously untaxed is an imposition of taxation. If the High Court accepted this argument, then the bill would be totally invalid as it deals with more than one subject of taxation.

         In summary, all non-government senators on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs took the view that there was a real risk that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, if challenged, would be found to be either partially or totally invalid. Given the potentially disastrous consequences for the government's revenues of such a decision, the coalition believes that it is irresponsible in the extreme for the government to persist in putting forward legislation of dubious validity.

         As far as the coalition is concerned, this also applies to Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993, the so-called test bill. In his second reading speech, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) stated:

        The argument put to the committee was that an increase in a rate of taxation may amount to an imposition of taxation. The bill consists of increases in the rates of two different subjects of taxation—fringe benefits tax and income tax. The coalition believes that it is improper practice to deliberately put before the parliament legislation which the government accepts may be unconstitutional. We believe that the bill ought to be put into a form which is unambiguously valid, and dealt with on that basis.

We were pleased that the government amended the bill in the other place to remove the retrospectivity in relation to lump sum payments for unused long service leave. The amendment to be moved by the coalition seeks to do the same in relation to unused annual leave.

Although it is obvious to all except the government, the No. 1 bill suffers the same constitutional defect as the No. 2 bill. The No. 2 bill clearly deals with more than one subject of taxation. The government has presented the bill in this form for the stated purpose of inviting a test case before the High Court before any of the provisions come into operation.

         In a budget compromised by the mendacity pursuant to which it was drafted and riddled with economically irresponsible and politically unsaleable measures, it is perhaps bill No. 2 with its dubious constitutional status that represents the highest development of the government's erratic and irrational behaviour over this particular budget. Never before has a government been so irresponsible, so careless of the costs it is imposing on the community, so shabbily desperate to save face politically as to draft a bill that is deliberately unconstitutional. The government should not wonder why people are suspicious about its planned constitutional changes to bring about a republic when it so readily displays such an arrant lack of respect for the constitution.

         I would like to deal with the government's behaviour in the drafting of the omnibus bill. The original bill, which has now been split into eight bills, was designed solely with a political although somewhat obscure purpose in mind. The solitary explanation of this strategy came from Senator Evans who stated that the bill's form was for demonstration and presentation purposes or to make clear the connection between tax changes. So, despite even the Tax Office expressing concerns about the constitutional status of the bill and raising its concerns with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel before the drafting stage, the government decided to risk its entire budget being declared unconstitutional, with all the financial chaos associated with such a decision. It is appalling that it made such a decision. The government can scarcely complain about its failures with these budget bills when its behaviour—certainly apparently, if nothing else—has constituted an attempt to do precisely that which section 55 of the constitution was designed to prevent.

         If the original omnibus bill was designed to put pressure on the Senate, all it succeeded in doing was to make the government look like a cabal of constitutional vandals. The government, in its confusion, fell between two stools in that, if the bill imposed taxation, section 55 would be breached; if the bill did not impose taxation, section 53 would not apply and the Senate could amend it freely.

         I now wish to deal with the purpose of the second paragraph of section 55 of the constitution. I think it is vital when we are looking at any statutory provision, in particular, a constitutional provision, to look at the purpose the provision is intended to serve. Section 55's existence, of course, is explained by first looking at section 53. In the words of Justice Dixon, as he then was:

        The second paragraph of section 53 of the constitution deprives the Senate of the power to amend taxation bills, although it may constitutionally reject them. However, if section 55 contained no other paragraph but its first, the House of Representatives would still be able to exploit the Senate's inability to amend legislation imposing taxation by sending to the Senate a bill containing a number of separate, unrelated taxes.

         To avoid this, the constitution requires that each proposed tax be contained in a separate bill. In this way, the Senate will maintain its right to examine and possibly veto each specific tax without having to reject taxes of which it approves or disapproves.

         I now comment on the result of the breach of section 55. Sir Owen Dixon may have referred to the `hitherto ineffectual menaces' of section 55, but the potential for chaos inherent in its breach should be apparent also to all responsible senators. To understand the consequences of such a breach, it is necessary to date the history of the provision. Clause 55, subclause 3 of the Commonwealth Bill 1891 provided that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with one subject of taxation. These provisions were adopted in the first draft at the Adelaide Constitutional Convention of 1897. The advocates for the change were impressive, including Sir George Reid, our fourth Prime Minister and great free trader, and Sir Isaac Isaacs, later a High Court Justice and Viceroy.

         The history of section 55 has a profound bearing on our understanding of the result of a breach of section 55. It contains the reasons why we should be prudent and responsible in dealing with a possible violation of the section. The founding fathers expressly rejected the possibility that such a breach could do anything but invalidate the whole bill—and I emphasise `the whole bill'. They were well aware of the grave consequences of such a penalty but they did not shy away from this severity, believing it to be an essential constitutional protection. The word `proposed' was deliberately omitted with the express intention that absolute nullity would attach to any offending act.

         Returning to Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1), its aspects are generally the same as those in the originating Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, except for a small technical change in the amendment concerning clause 47 of the Income Tax Rates Act. The proposals contained in this bill in many cases have created serious inequity for individual taxpayers and have imposed impossible administrative and financial burdens on business. I refer in particular to the lump sum leave arrangements, the non-deductible expenses changes and the changes to car parking expenses for the self-employed. As noted by the Taxation Institute of Australia in its submission to the government on the original deficit reduction bill:

        The submission continues by noting that the attempt to interrelate fringe benefits tax rules with the new rules designed to limit tax deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act appear to have been created at a theoretical level without regard to their practical application. In fact, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in its media release of 19 August notes that the government has created an entertainment nightmare with regard to the non-deductible expense changes. The proposed changes to the fringe benefits tax legislation contain a number of anomalies in respect of the provision of entertainment to employees by employers which are difficult to interpret and quantify, demonstrating a lack of commonsense and due regard for business practice.

         Currently, entertainment expenses are both non-tax deductible and not subject to the FBT. But from 1 April 1994, in addition to entertainment, a range of benefits—such as club fees, leisure facilities, travel expenses of accompanying relatives, HECS payments and student financial supplement scheme payments—will be an allowable deduction to employers and, consequently, will subject those benefits to a fringe benefits tax liability. I have received representations from a number of accounting firms and business constituents as to the practical effects of the government's decision to treat non-deductible entertainment involving employees as subject to fringe benefits tax; in fact, the legislation will create all sorts of anomalies.

         Firstly, entertainment provided to employees for the firm's benefit will now be more expensive due to the grossing-up effect used in the calculations of the fringe benefits tax. For every $1 spent on the provision of entertainment to employees, the total after-tax cost to the employer will be $1.27—the additional 27c being the grossed-up FBT amount, reduced by virtue of the FBT being allowable as a tax deduction.

         Secondly, an issue arises as to the interpretation of whether an entertainment benefit has been provided to an employee. For example, a self-employed person requested one of his employees to attend a business lunch with a client. In the absence of attending the lunch, the employee would probably have purchased sandwiches. Therefore, the employee has received a benefit by attending the business lunch. FBT is therefore payable on the total cost of his portion of the business lunch, while the portion applicable to the client and the self-employed person is non-deductible.

         It has been estimated that bookkeeping costs, including additional staff to maintain appropriate records and changes to the computer system, may well exceed the FBT payable. As the records are now needed for taxation purposes, they will need to show how much of the costs are related to the employee, which are deductible and subject to the FBT, and how much are related to the client, which are non-deductible. These business lunches are not big affairs. An example which has been cited to me is that they are usually counter meals at a hotel or sandwiches and coffee at a local cafe, with the average cost being about $40 for the entire lunch.

         The government's rationale for the change is that corporate entertainment, which is presently non-deductible and not subject to the FBT, is being used to package remuneration in a tax effective manner. If this is the real intention behind the proposed changes, a far more simple and less costly solution could be to make entertainment costs of employees incurred in the course of undertaking their duties as employees non-deductible and not subject to FBT—that is, subject to the existing rule—but to treat other entertainment of employees under the proposed new rules. Thus the government's stated objective could be achieved without imposing significant compliance costs on employers.

The proposed provisions would appear to discriminate against taxpayers who presently incur higher costs associated with the provision of car parking than those taxpayers who have lower costs; for example, when the facility is owned outright.

         On 17 August this year the government introduced its budget. In anyone's language, the legislation came in a novel form; that is, by way of an omnibus bill, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, which covered many subjects of taxation. As a result of constitutional queries, on 31 August this year the Senate referred that bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Initially, the committee was to report by 15 September 1993; however, this proved unrealistic and that date was extended to 20 September 1993.

The government realised this, and the result of the government's concern is mirrored in these two bills, one of which the government terms a test bill.

However, this was only by virtue of the chairman exercising his casting vote. By no means was that decision unanimous. In fact, it was uncertain, to say the least. I would venture to say that Senator Spindler, a member of that committee, shared the view of the coalition that this bill risked invalidity. It could be seen to impose taxation on two separate subjects of taxation, as well as dealing with more than one subject of taxation, thereby inviting the disaster of having it struck down should it be enacted.

I say that for the record so that not only the Senate but the people of Australia can know that the coalition went along with every effort to have these bills reviewed as quickly as possible. A complete review was done from 17 August this year to 5 October—a space of some seven weeks. In that time, the government took the advice of the Senate standing committee and redrafted its budget legislation.

Of course, we have seen a very different picture, have we not, over the last few weeks? The increase in the wine tax, as proposed by the government, was defeated. That example is perhaps on a much more minor scale because what we are looking at here are more wide ranging bills, more wide ranging measures, which would have a more profound effect on the financial welfare of this country should they be struck down.

         —It is a great pleasure to follow my colleague Senator Ellison in this debate because he has done a fine job of encapsulating many of the concerns which we on this side of the chamber have in relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993. If one was to look for a title to the tale of these two bills, that title would have to be `Ode to folly' because that is what the form of these two bills is about—the government's fiscal folly. It is about a government that had the opportunity to introduce these tax measures into the parliament in the appropriate fashion but insisted on not doing so.

         These two bills before the chamber tonight followed the splitting of the original Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. The government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to split that bill. Eventually a unanimous decision of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs forced it to do that. But, instead of properly splitting that bill, the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, insisted on having what he called a test bill—the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). This bill sought to lump together two tax measures which on their own are perfectly legal and perfectly valid, but taken together, prima facie, breach section 55 of the constitution, which requires that tax measures deal with only one measure of taxation. That means that we cannot lump them together. The Treasurer insisted on lumping these two measures together solely for the purpose of enabling this matter to be debated at great length and at great expense in the High Court of Australia.

         The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) is an attempt by the Treasurer to try to save some face. He is saying that it is absolutely crucial that this Senate pass a bill which is prima facie unconstitutional so that it can be raced off to the High Court and so we can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars litigating this when for the last 92 years no government has felt the necessity to lump together two measures in this form.

I genuinely believe that bill No. 1 is not the result of the Treasurer's overweening ego, as bill No. 2 is. Bill No. 1 was a genuine mistake in the way that the government has lumped together with other tax measures a measure which appears to impose taxation on credit unions. I am happy to say that that is probably just a mistake. But, having been pointed out, it ceases to be negligence and starts to become arrogance and contempt when the government could easily amend this bill in the space of less than one day to put it into a constitutionally valid format. The evidence that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs heard was that it would take the Office of Parliamentary Counsel less than one day to split that bill, take out that provision and put it through separately. That is all it would have taken.

We on this side of the chamber have no alternative. We do not believe in sloppy government; we do not believe that second-best is good enough. We believe that there is a way to do this, and this government should heed the advice, at least in relation to bill No. 1, of the coalition senators and Senator Spindler who are all of the view that the imposition of taxation in relation to the credit unions was prima facie unconstitutional when lumped together with those other matters.

         —Even in its different form, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) is an omnibus taxation bill covering many areas of the income tax and fringe benefits tax law. The first one is the Medicare levy increase. It is normal practice to increase the Medicare levy low income threshold at every budget, and that is what we are doing. Thank goodness that for once there is something we are not fighting about.

         Car parking expenses for the self-employed is another measure that is covered in Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). We had a very long debate last year in this place on the whole notion of taxing car parking. I think we came to a sensible compromise. Last year, as a result of that debate, car parking provided to employees was made fringe benefits taxable. But, in this budget, the government is bringing in measures to make car parking for the self-employed taxable on a basis comparable to car parking for employees.

         Probably the remaining contentious issue is the taxation of credit unions. There are really two strong cases to be made here. The bill removes the exemption from income tax enjoyed by credit unions since 1974. Credit union income to date, in the nature of the interest received on loans to members, has been exempt from tax.

         The government is arguing that this initiative will remove the competitive advantage that credit unions enjoy as a result of this tax break. It argues—I think it is true—that it is consistent with the government's general approach on tax neutrality between enterprises. Although they operate on a different commercial basis from that of banks and building societies, it is clear that some of the larger credit unions could be said to be in direct competition with these other financial institutions, particularly in the provision of housing loans and credit card facilities. It is true that the tax exemption on credit unions was never conferred so that they could be more competitive than banks or building societies in these markets.

         So, while we understand and acknowledge those arguments, we are concerned about the effect of the tax on the principle of mutuality and on the smaller parish credit unions. That principle of mutuality on its face requires that credit unions provide the socially beneficial services that banks and other financial institutions are much less interested in providing—namely, the less profitable and expensive to administer services, such as personal loans for less than $2,000 and the retention of less profitable branches in rural areas. All around us we can see banks closing in rural areas. A lot of rural Australians are concerned that the removal of this tax exemption will put great pressure on credit unions to follow the example of the banks and remove the remaining service that credit unions provide to rural Australians.

         Credit unions are able to operate without charging fees to their clients. They offer low balance accounts for clients in receipt of Department of Social Security payments. Banks are very reluctant to take on social security clients as customers or to give them loans unless they front up with the usual list of assets and liabilities. For $10, one can become a share owner and member of a credit union and secure a very small personal loan or the sorts of services that are just not available from the larger banks and some of the building societies.

         The other distinguishing feature is that, when credit unions do the right thing and make a surplus, they use that surplus to provide services that are not available to their members through other financial institutions. For example, they run seminars on the best way to finance, and seek finance for, housing loans. They offer second opinions on the purchase of second-hand cars. They offer travel services. They make a very significant, valuable and alternative contribution to the market. The important point to make is that diversity of financial services is surely to be encouraged, not rubbed out.

         I will now address the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). As the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has indicated, this is the test bill which increases rates of taxes on more than one subject of taxation. The passage of this bill will provide an opportunity for the doubts concerning the constitutionality of the original omnibus tax bill to be tested in the High Court. We heard Senator Hill move his declaratory motion. We supported it. It is the view of the Democrats that the constitutionality cloud is best dealt with by the passage of this bill and a subsequent High Court challenge, if that is what a taxpayer wishes to do to test the matter.

         The bill involves relatively minor revenue and policy questions. No serious threat to revenue arises if this bill is in an unconstitutional form. The bill also contains the following two measures: an increase in the rate of the fringe benefits tax; and a change in the taxation treatment of friendly societies. The legislation will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent. This restores the rate of fringe benefits tax to the top marginal personal tax rate plus the Medicare levy, following the increases in the Medicare levy on 1 July 1993. This measure will take effect from 1 April 1994, and the Democrats support it.

         From the 1994-95 income year, we will see a change in the taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations.

In 1994-95, the tax rate will increase to 33 per cent; in 1995-96, it will increase to 36 per cent; and in 1996-97 and subsequent years, it will increase to 39 per cent. In line with this change, friendly societies will be entitled to the same deductions allowed to life insurance companies for the costs incurred in gaining the investment component of life insurance premiums.

Nevertheless, it is a matter that is not a big revenue item. There were concerns so it seems appropriate that the government take a bit more time to get it right.

         I reiterate the advice I have given to Senator Watson, which as far as I can tell was accurately conveyed by Senator Hill, that we intend to move an amendment with regard to credit unions consistent with the committee's recommendation. The government is quite comfortable with that. It has minor revenue implications. We are not exactly as one as to what those revenue implications are, but in the great order of things they are not major. The top assessment is $7 million. Others say it may be as low as $2 1/2 million. At the end of day nobody knows until it comes into effect. Neither figure is going to break the budget.

         —I do not mind Senator Macdonald displaying his ignorance, wherever he sits! The credit union measure, as the committee essentially concluded, brings equitable treatment to the different types of financial institutions. It is clear that there is something unique about the very small credit unions that operate on the original common bond concept. I said that there were not many of them. There may be as many as 100, but they are not very big, they do not have many members and by definition they are very small in assets and income. That is why they will have a very small impact on revenue. My view is that had we not made this amendment, those organisations—given what they do, how they do it and what their income is—would probably have paid almost no tax. But they were apprehensive and it is legitimate to respond to that apprehension in the way that we have. I thank the committee for the way in which it handled this matter. I spoke in response to its report, so I will not do so again.

         I think there has been more heat than light generated about the annual leave and long service leave accrued entitlements taxation. The phrase `retrospective tax' gets tossed around sometimes without its being properly assessed or always being used absolutely rigorously. I think it is a great pity that the Senate is going to make the requests which it appears on the face of it the majority will support. The requests have not been and circulated yet, but I imagine they will be supported from what I have heard in the second reading debate. I am comfortable with the fact that everybody, as far as I know, is endorsing the principle of the way in which such accumulated sums should be taxed.

         That will be prospective and will have an impact on revenue for years to come. It is not going to have the short term revenue impact that the government sought. I think that is always a cause for concern. These are changes within the parameters of a normal budget. I am not sure about the annual leave provisions because that involves a bit more money, but the fringe benefits tax and credit union matters are within the normal parameters. The government is quite relaxed about those. We are not so happy about the changes to annual leave and long service leave.

Apart from proper tax measures—and I do not think there is much controversy about that—their importance is in their capacity to provide a test for the constitutional matter of significant moment, which should be clarified as a result of the way in which the bills proceed. In the unlikely event—in the government's view—that the High Court finds that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) is unconstitutional, we have ample time to legislate again next year to implement the measures within the already intended timetable.

         I want to say something about the two second reading amendments moved by Senator Hill. It is obvious that there is constitutional controversy about the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). In a sense, that is the whole purpose of its being there. The Senate has expressed the view, in dealing with a previous motion, that it is appropriate to be proceeding in this way and I will not say anything more about it.

         The opposition's amendment to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1), in effect, attempts to amend three clauses. The first two deal with the leave entitlements, about which I have already spoken and I will not reiterate that. The third one deals with  constitutionality in relation to the way this measure is presented. I regard that as a very extreme interpretation of the constitution as it relates to the Senate's powers concerning tax. It reflected, in our view, that the requests procedure is an abundance of caution in this matter. But we are quite relaxed about it because the possible impact for the Senate's powers is protected by those declaratory resolutions and, anyway, the net effect will be the same. Although we are opposed to the amendments, they are of no great moment.

The government is bringing down substantial amendments in relation to credit unions which we have not yet seen. I am prepared to acknowledge on behalf of the Australian Democrats that their amendments should logically follow the government's. Therefore, they ought to be entitled to see the government's amendments first. After that we ought to be entitled to consider the Democrats' amendments before we vote on them.

         In actual fact, if the government had acted with greater wisdom from the start, taken out the fringe benefits tax parts and reformed the credit union part in a way that is more likely to be accepted by the parliament, we would not be in a position of further delay. I can see that if we proceed now an unsatisfactory result will come out of this process. An unintentional result is the usual result that flows from a failure to circulate amendments and consider them with care. The suggestion that the committee stage should be delayed until the morning is very sensible.

The Senate will remember that income tax cuts were not a promise; they were l-a-w, law—and that is still the case, as a matter of interest. That was something that had to be implemented because the parliament had already passed the law and the Australian people were going to get tax cuts. It was hoped that that would flow through, add to incentive and provide some fillip to business and, hopefully, out of that some jobs would be created to improve the currently deplorable situation of mass unemployment in this country.

         On the other side of the ledger, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said on several occasions, `We will not be increasing tax' and `There will be no new taxes'. So the Australian people voted at the last election on the basis of clear promises by this government that, in fact, taxes would come down because it would put in place the income tax cuts and there would be no new taxes. Surprise, surprise! In the budget, in breach of that promise, the government brought down these four extended areas of taxation, demonstrating that it had clearly lied to the Australian people during the last election campaign.

         In those circumstances, we said we had no alternative but to attempt to keep this government honest, to at least demonstrate in the only way that we really could that we stood for at least some morality in government and in the parliamentary process in that the Australian people are entitled to not be lied to

        during election campaigns. So, for that reason firstly, we said we would vote against these taxes. Secondly, we said we would vote against them because, as I said, at a time of mass unemployment they cannot be in the national interest. It cannot be in the national interest, in particular, to impose new taxation measures on business when business needs to grow and expand and, therefore, offer job opportunities to nearly a million Australians who are out of work.

         The third reason that we said we would vote against these taxes is that they were basically regressive. They provided an extra penalty for Australians who were less well off. A Labor government, I remind you, Mr Temporary Chairman, brought down tax bills that particularly penalised the poor. At least we on this side of the chamber, the coalition, are prepared to get out there and fight for lower taxes for the poor, as opposed to this Labor government which has the policy, it seems, of increasing taxes on the poor, having introduced a particularly discriminatory and regressive tax in that form. We said we would oppose the tax for that reason.

         That is the history. We have not wavered from that position. Enormous pressure has been put on us from time to time to do so, but we have stuck clearly and unambiguously to that line from day one. One of those bills is now back before us, our earlier request—that is, to remove part of the wholesale sales tax—having been rejected by the House of Representatives.

The House of Representatives—this Labor government—has rejected that request of the Senate and has sent a message back to us tonight to that effect.

I agree wholeheartedly that the avenue for the debate of these matters is not the media but the chamber, so I welcome the opportunity to explain why the Green senators have decided not to vote against the second round of sales tax increases and why we have changed our position from the one we expressed last week. We then strongly opposed the introduction of a second tranche of wholesale sales tax increases in July 1995 when the government in its budget had failed to address the regressive impact of that and the impact on low income earners—those who would be really suffering.

         We felt that the government had made some effort and that is why we supported the first round and did not put an amendment rejecting it at that time. We felt it had made some concessions towards the budget which, we agree, was a very uncaring one. In the first round the government had made some measures. We felt that the principle of measures of compensation had been established in the first round. We felt that there was no logic whatsoever in supporting the second round unless similar measures were implemented that addressed the equity impact.

         This evening I wish to take up the announcement made today by the government that the 11 November Remembrance Day has been declared an event of national importance—and rightly so. As honourable senators would be aware, on 11 November, some 76 years on, the remains of the unknown soldier will be brought home from the Western Front and laid to rest in the memorial in Canberra. This ceremony will no doubt touch the national soul and remind us that we have shared national experiences which must be remembered and revered on both sides of the chamber.

         Up to 40 per cent or more—I believe that to be a conservative figure—of Victorian primary and secondary schools no longer observe the two-minute silence to commemorate Remembrance Day on 11 November, yet this year's 11 November is probably the most significant in the history of our Remembrance Days since the armistice. This is probably the final piece of the Australian identity being laid at a time when our identity is much questioned.

         I hope Mr Head and those that he represents do not have memories of some other 11 November Remembrance Day, such as the Whitlam sacking; I hope he is not placing that above this particular day. Perhaps not, but he leaves himself open to serious criticism. In particular, Mr Head should realise that Victorian schoolchildren have a very keen interest in Australia's military history. This is shown by the number of requests made to the RSL for school projects alone, initiated by themselves and from their own homes, I am told. The school system cannot afford to overlook the interests of students nor turn its back on the nation's history.

The Victorian parliament is very good at legislating and it can whip up a bit of legislation in 24 hours and have it through both houses, so perhaps Mr Don Hayward should legislate it.

         —I did not plan to speak tonight but I was moved to by the comments of my colleague Senator McGauran. I think the events of 11 November, which were mentioned today in the Senate, are enormously important in Australian history—the 75th anniversary of the tragedy of the First World War, a tragedy which marked many Australian families at the time. Indeed, there would barely be a person who cannot hark back to a grandparent or great-grandparent or who would not be able to at least recognise someone who at the time was marked by those particular events.

          I think it is a pity, as we are at the 75th anniversary, that the commemoration of these events has not been more obvious and public. I am delighted to hear that there will be a special day on 11 November, which Mr Keating has announced.

          Australian Victories in France, 1918
         </emphasis>
         . Truly, those events mark one of the great pages of Australian history. Whereas many feature films have been produced by the ABC and other organisations which perhaps unduly tend to attack the institutions of this country, this is really a time when one would have wanted to see some major feature films on the Australian victories in France in 1918.

         Anyone who reads General Monash's book cannot but be moved by the enormous achievement of the Australians which culminated, initially, in the push forward on 8 August and which broke through the German lines and destroyed a number of major German divisions at that time. It is surely one of the truly great victories. I think it is a pity that the cultural institutions of this country, of which the ABC is a major one, did not time show the enormous achievement and  courage of Australian soldiers at that time, and I hope this oversight will be fixed up on 11 November. Honour and courage do not come naturally to most people. It is a feature of those men and the women of 1914-1918 that they showed not only the great comradeship that is such an important value in Australian culture, but also enormous courage and commitment to their country.

There is time for the government to make sure that the lacklustre approach to these events is made up for. I hope that after the commemorative occasion on 11 November we will be in a position to feel that we have appropriately honoured the enormous achievements of previous generations of Australians.

         The book documents the failed promise of the disability rights movement that got under way in the 1970s and 1980s. It points to the fact that, for all of the talk, a lot of the parents in this situation say that there is an absence of vision, an absence of innovation, an absence of adventurous application of policies that might actually help them. At every turn they find that bureaucracies fall back on the defence that there are just not enough funds to go around. They acknowledge the competition for funds between many worthwhile causes in society.

These parents are left to survive as best they can, and largely on their own.

Surely a society should be able to step in effectively and intelligently to help lighten the load. Why can we not produce child-care reforms that really help families with disabled children? Why can financial assistance not be better targeted? Why can health care not be prioritised for women who literally break their backs with the physical effort of moving their children as they grow older and heavier or who are driven to the edge of madness? Should we not bite the bullet and honestly and openly question the extent to which medical intervention and costly technology is keeping alive babies who would in previous times never have survived?

Where are the programs to help marriages which collapse one after another under the strain of caring for these children? Why is there not a special case made to provide special housing for families that need it? Instead of just talking about the theory of integration in schools, why are education systems still so reluctant? Why are so many schools and teachers still threatened by integration? Why do we keep on applying the bureaucratic jargon of efficiency and cost effectiveness so beloved of the economic rationalists? Why do we not get back to some good old important and traditional precepts like fairness and human rights?

         This book has two important achievements. It sets out to link what it calls the `handicapping impact of disability on the individual and the family' with issues of public policy. I think that is lacking in our society and in our parliaments. But the major achievement of this book is to give a voice to people who for too many years have not been heard.

Unless we make fundamental changes to the way in which we structure paid work, community care will continue to be a euphemism for individuals being exploited for their care and concern and the economy will continue to hitchhike on women's sense of duty and capacity for affection.

        (1) It is generally accepted that a sizeable number of Burmese women are involved in prostitution in Thailand. Burmese ethnic leaders from the refugee camps in the Thai-Burma border region have told us that women from these camps may have been forced or sold into prostitution in the past, and that they are seeking to prevent this from occurring in the future. There are thirty camps for displaced Burmese people along the Thai-Burma border which accommodate over 72,000 refugees. While the Thai Government has ultimate control over these camps, Burmese ethnic group organisations administer the camps on a day-to-day basis. People are able to enter and leave the camps relatively freely and some of the camps are used as transit points for people leaving Burma to work illegally in Thailand. There have been instances of Thai job brokers entering Burmese refugee camps in Thailand to offer women in the camps jobs in Thailand. Administrators of these camps have reportedly put in place policies to restrict access to the camps to keep out job brokers and campaigns to warn women of the dangers of accepting such job offers.

        (2) One of the major priorities of the Thai Government is to address the problem of prostitution, particularly child prostitution, forced prostitution and the sale of women. The Thai Government is currently preparing legislation on the suppression of prostitution which it plans to submit to the Thai Parliament shortly. Thai authorities have undertaken a number of raids on brothels which have resulted in a large number of Burmese women being taken into custody and charged with illegal immigration and deported. Vocational education centres have been set up in some areas of Thailand to provide elementary psychological assistance and vocational training before deportation. The women are also tested for HIV/AIDS and given health advice. The

        (3) The Australian Government has made representations to the Thai Government, including at ministerial level, concerning forced prostitution in Thailand. The Australian Government works with the Thai Government by funding projects designed to assist Burmese women in prostitution in Thailand. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau funds two HIV/AIDS projects which have as a major target group Burmese women in Thailand. An AIDS education program in the south of Thailand targets Burmese commercial sex workers and their clients and involves building up the capacity of the Ministry of Public Health in screening, testing and treatment. Community education, counselling and training also form part of the project. A further project, in the north of Thailand, aims to increase and strengthen outreach prevention and control of HIV/AIDS among commercial sex workers and to mobilise village support groups for the care of those already infected. The Australian Government also contributes funding of $300,000 per year to Burmese refugee camps in Thailand.
