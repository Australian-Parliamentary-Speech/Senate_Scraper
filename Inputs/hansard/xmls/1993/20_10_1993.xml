        The purpose of this bill is to re-enact important provisions of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 (the Amending Act) in the Copyright Act 1968 (the Principal Act).

        The Government has recently been advised by the Chief General Counsel of Australia, Mr Dennis Rose QC, that due to the operation of section 55 of the Constitution the whole of the Amending Act has been invalidated as a result of a decision made by the High Court in March 1993. This opinion was provided after detailed consideration of the terms of the judgment and earlier cases on similar points.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That decision, Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v The Commonwealth (1993) 112 ALR 53, was concerned with a challenge to the validity of the imposition, in the Amending Act, of a royalty on blank audio tapes. The Court held by a majority of 4 to 3 on this point that the royalty levied on vendors of blank tapes was a tax. In consequence it was invalid by reason of non-compliance with s. 55 of the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first paragraph of s. 55 of the Constitution provides:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "Laws imposing taxation shall only deal with the imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In his advice Mr Rose notes that "The High Court majority went on to hold that since the "royalty" provisions are inseverably connected with some of the provisions that are invalid because of the first paragraph of s. 55 the "royalty" provisions are also invalid. The result is that all the provisions in the Amending Act are invalid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to the purported imposition of the blank tape royalty and associated provisions related to home audio taping, the Amending Act gave effect to a number of other very significant changes to Australia's laws on copyright and related rights. These were:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        adding new Parts VA and VB to the Principal Act providing for statutory licence schemes for educational and other institutions to copy, respectively, television and radio broadcasts and print copyright works;

        These amendments were the third stage of important copyright reforms begun in 1984. They were formulated after extensive consultations by the Government with consumers, educators and industry participants. Members from all parties generally supported the 1989 bill and its reforms as being significant additions to the Principal Act. While some aspects of the protection proposed for performers and various matters of detail in drafting were the subject of debate and subsequent amendment during the passage of the legislation, the amendments have been relatively uncontroversial in practice, apart from the blank tape royalty scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I do not intend to repeat a detailed examination of the changes wrought by the Amending Act. Apart from the blank audio tape royalty that the Government has promised to reintroduce separately and associated provisions related to home taping of audio media, an overview of the other provisions of the Amending Act that this Act will retrospectively validate is substantively set out in the Second Reading Speech by the then Attorney-General Bowen beginning at page 2392 in the Hansard report of the 3 November 1988 House of Representative proceedings and beginning at page 3008 in the Hansard report of proceedings of the Senate on  28 November 1988.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I wish to emphasise that the provisions of this bill do not effect any policy change or new initiative. They are directed solely to re-enacting all the amendments to the Principal Act made by the Amending Act except those imposing, and related to the imposition of, the blank tape royalty. The validation is retrospective, operating from the respective dates on which the various provisions of the Amending Act were proclaimed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is some variation in the form of the re-enacting provisions. This arises for technical reasons due to the fact that the stages of commencement of various Parts of the Amending Act and the actual dates of deemed commencement of particular sections are now known.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would be, in the Government's view, inappropriate to reopen any of the issues exhaustively debated late in 1988 and in the early months of 1989. A vast range of commercial and legal arrangements have been set in place, decisions made about the taking or assertion of legal rights and so on, all based on the presumption of the validity of the Amending Act, except, of course, the blank tape royalty. We do not envisage that any person would be unfairly affected by the reinstatement of the law by this bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I have said, the bill is purely technical in nature. The invalidity of these provisions is an unexpected and unfortunate result of a High Court challenge to just one part of a raft of significant measures. I would hope that the Parliament would see the value of their reinstatement and of doing so quickly now that the issue of the invalidity of the provisions has been raised.

         We have a lot of difficulties with the government's sales tax regime for the simple reason that the changes in sales tax, which the government introduces in the bills before us today, were not signalled to the Australian population during the election campaign. Much play was made by the government during the election campaign as to how it would save Australia from the goods and services tax. It was not, of course, talking about how it would save Australia from enormous reductions in sales taxâ€”the abolition of sales taxâ€”or how it would save Australian businesses from the removal of billions of dollars in costs, which is what the Fightback package would have achieved. We did not hear that. We did not hear the government saying, `By the way, we will add sales tax costs to business', which is the consequence of this. We will see increases in sales tax across the board, which will particularly hit this country's transport sector, and we have grave concerns about that.

         If we look at some of the figures, we find that the revenue loss to the government is really quite significant. In terms of winning and losing, it is quite true that the winemakers have received a considerable tax concession in reduced sales tax and increased depreciation allowances for the planting of their vines. But against that scenario, they are concerned that if the Liberal Party presses these amendments and they are successful, the government will threaten or blackmail them with a tax excise proposal.

But they are now expected to raise only $17 million in 1993-94 instead of $70 million, and so on. But at the same time the wine industry will be provided with quite generous income tax concessions.

         â€”When this matter of the wholesale sales tax was last before the chamber, I voted to support the opposition's motion to request the House of Representatives to amend the sales tax bills in order to delete the second tranche of the WSTâ€”that is, the one per cent increase in wholesale sales tax which is due to take effect in the middle of 1995. I did so in the hope that something would be done between the time the message left this chamber and the time it reached the House of Representatives. I have always indicated my view on the wholesale sales tax, which is that if the government believes it is the centrepiece of its long-term deficit reduction strategy, it is a matter that we should have regard to.

         It is now known that I have had discussions about these matters, as one would expect, because I represent the state of Tasmania.

         I was concerned and expressed in this chamber that the tax cuts did not have regard to the principle of horizontal tax equity. In other words, there are a large number of families, particularly one income families, who are battling, who are only just making ends meet and who are paying their way, but they are the ones being neglected. Those people are middle income Australians who are on one income, have one, two, three, four or five children and are paying their way completely.

         The tax cuts did not have regard to those people. The tax cuts were given to dual income families without children. They received the same tax cuts as single income families with children. In fact, a dual income family without children received extra tax cuts because of the operation of the tax free threshold. Those are the sorts of things that I have raised here and in other areas.

         Secondly, so far as the WST, the wholesale sales tax, increase of one per cent in mid-1995 is concerned, it is important that discussions be held to ensure that the impact of those increases does not harm families with children. In other words, there should be some compensation entered into. That is one of the reasons the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced yesterday that there would be a dollar per child placed into the additional family payments scheme from 1 January 1995. That will be some months before the one per cent wholesale sales tax will come into operation.

However, I am in a different position now, in that I need to have regard to this question of long-term deficit reduction strategy. I voted in support of the amendment moved by the opposition so that this bill could go back to the House of Representatives and so that further time could be bought, as it were, for the matter to be more maturely considered by all parties, including the government.

However, in fairness, there has been a readiness by the government to look at things in a more reflective way and to come up with a series of proposals that will ameliorate the effect of the one per cent increase in wholesale sales tax in mid-1995 on persons who can least afford to pay that. This is what the government has done. Under all of those circumstances, it is my intention to vote for the proposition that has been put forward by Senator McMullan.

I acknowledge that what the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens have done in respect of that has been important.

The position the coalition took the day after the budget was that we would vote against these measures because they would increase sales taxes. The Labor Party said during the election campaign that it would not do that, but we know what happened to that. I am glad that Senator Harradine gave us credit when he said that we were misrepresented during the election campaign. Now that is history.

         Senator Chamarette claimed last night just before the adjournment that the Greens had got out of the government a $3 a week increase for the unemployed and an increase of $1 per child in family allowance from January 1995. But by January 1995 who knows who is going to be in government?  Senator Chamarette then claims, according to this morning's biased report in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         , that this will cost the government about $17 million immediately and $144 million in a full financial year. I believe that the people of Western Australia have to be told what the two Green senators have put at risk by extracting this small measure out of the government. I suppose a $3 rise for the unemployed is something, although $3 does not seem very much.

For those who do not have much money, $3 is a lot. But people's jobs are being put in jeopardy. There will be $3 for the unemployed, but they are already unemployed. This increase in sales tax will put a lot more people on the unemployed list or maybe give them a good fright that they are heading that way.

         The legislation we are concluding debate on now is worth about an extra $1 billion in increased sales tax. If it is cut by $17mâ€”Senator Harradine said that that is not a great amountâ€”in a full year that will amount to $144 million. The revenue from the increased sales tax is all extra; it is not a total bill. So the $144 million will not make a great dent in the whole budget. I am very annoyed that the Greens of Western Australia built up a profile on our solid 36 votes. As I said before, they would have been irrelevant if it were not for our 36 votes that never wavered and never will.

         I will give the chamber some figures relating to the jobs that are being put in jeopardy. The transport industry aloneâ€”an industry that I know very wellâ€”employs 385,000 people directly and provides 2.4 per cent of GDP. How many of those jobs will be lost? I said in the second reading debate that a one per cent increase in wholesale tax does not seem very much, but when you are buying a new prime mover, for instance, to replace an existing one or as an extra one if you are trying to expand, it will cost you nearly $200,000 wholesale. That is an extra $2,000 immediately, then another $2,000 next March. So what will this legislation do to the transport industry?

         â€”That is correct. We have a rise of $3 for the unemployed. There is a bill yet to come before the parliament relating to changes in Austudy for 16- and 17-year-olds. It will have the effect of transferring 16- and 17-year-olds from Austudy to family allowance. We will have our day to debate that one, but I know that it will reduce country kids' Austudy allowanceâ€”to be family allowanceâ€”by $8 a week. I would like to know how the Green senators will vote when that bill comes before the chamber. If they have claimed great victory for getting an increase of $3 a week for the unemployed and an extra $1 in child allowance by 1995, how are they going to deal with that bill?

         In conclusion, the Greens claim that they are the champions of not only Western Australia but Australia. In relation to the wine tax, they gave certain undertakings to the wine industry in Margaret River, but I think they might have given the industry some false hopes. They have now backed down on that issue. All Western Australians who can hear me this morning should be questioning the Green senators, Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts, as to why, after having led people to believe that they were standing up like this solid opposition over here, they decided to turn around and abandon the people of Western Australia. Maybe it was because of the fear of a double dissolution; I do not know. If we are to have a double dissolution, then let us have it.

         Anyhow, the Green senators can explain that to the people of Western Australia. I urge people to question them as to what their motives are in this place. They have certainly put a lot of stable jobs in the transport industry, the mining industry and the rural industryâ€”which provide Australia with the majority of its export income these daysâ€”in jeopardy. The government should do something about the unemployed in other ways, rather than giving a paltry $3 a week. The government needs to get the economy going so that jobs can be created.

         â€”The Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1993 effectively delays the introduction of last December's parliament-approved Migration Reform Act in that the start up date, which is in place at the moment, is 1 November this year. The amending bill before us will delay that date until September 1994. Rather than giving 10 months for the implementation of the bill passed by the parliament last December, it gives a period of 20 months. An initial part of the reform act which related to the establishment of the Refugee Review Tribunal was implemented on 1 July this year, but all other aspects are to be deferred by this bill until 1 September next year.

         The bill also introduces some amendments dealing with transitional arrangements which arise because of the delay. These are technical matters relating to definitions of unauthorised boat arrivals and the powers of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider refugee status review applications made before 1 July 1993. These aspects are not controversial and the coalition has no difficulty in supporting them.

         However, the coalition is strongly critical of the main purpose of this billâ€”that is, the further delay of 10 months in the implementation of the Migration Reform Act. After all, the reform act is an important decision of this parliament, an important reform to migration arrangements. It makes significant changes to the legislative framework which currently underpins our migration program. It changes the regulation of entry to and stay in Australia as well as making changes to the provisions concerning detention and removal of non-citizens who are in Australia unlawfully. We in the Liberal and National parties strongly condemn the government for this further delay.

         We believe that there is an urgent need for solutions to the matters that were being addressed in our debate last Decemberâ€”which we thought had been resolved. This urgency continues, yet the government is unable to put a coherent solution before the parliament. The reason why the Migration Reform Act was considered so important last December was its urgency, yet the substance of that urgency is now being delayed by the government for 20 months.

         The reasons for deferral have been outlined in a number of informal and then formal meetings with parliamentarians by representatives of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). There is reference in the evidence of the special hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Friday, 1 October to a number of briefings that were given to members of the coalition, the Democrats, the Greens and, I presume, the government back bench on this matter. I participated in these briefings. There was not an immediate credibility in the briefings that the coalition received. So our questions persisted. This situation led to the coalition requiring a formal Senate committee hearing on this bill so that the explanations given by the minister's representatives would be clearly in the

        As a member of the parliament's Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations at the time when there was major foundational reform of migration law, I remind the Senate that there were 30 meetings. The then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, is in the chamber. He understands the enormous consideration that was given back in 1989. A lot of time has passed. It is clear from this hearing on 1 Octoberâ€”and we must acknowledge it in this debateâ€”that the government does not have a coherent approach to this, even now; and it is being put out yet another 10 months. Senator Ellison continued:

        The present minister, Senator Bolkus, made an announcement yesterday regarding a special arrangement for Cambodian boat people. This announcement has been made before the parliamentary committee has completed its inquiry into detention on the grounds of illegal immigration and arrival in Australia, due in December. We have carts before horses; announcements before reviews have been completed; and a lack of credible coherence from the present minister and from the government. In this context I take up a question asked by my colleague Senator O'Chee at the hearing on 1 October, which appears on page 85 of the

         and relates to the one major amendment to this bill that the coalition was foreshadowing. That amendment was to the effect that if the government wants the greater part of the reform act of December 1992 deferred for 10 months, there is one elementâ€”the matters that relate to the proposed section 4B, the grounds for judicial review of an immigration decisionâ€”that it should at least allow to be on time, on 1 November in two weeks time. What consequences would there be if our foreshadowed amendment were adopted so that this element would actually be on time? This is a matter which is of very real concern to Liberal and National party members and, I understand, to the government.

         It is no wonder that so many members of the Australian public are confused about immigration management by this government when this evidence lies before us, and when there is this 20-month delay for a matter that was regarded as urgentâ€”even by the government. The Australian people want to see an immigration program which has integrity, which is non-discriminatory, fair, sound and well-managed, with accountability for every element of its management. All of those matters are seriously lacking.

In the next few days, on behalf of the opposition, I will move a motion to recommend the setting up of a responsible Senate committee inquiry into all parts of the government's handling of immigration in this country. My colleague Senator Short has discussed the terms of such an inquiry quite widely in the community and with other honourable senators. I am concluding those discussions in the next day or so. At one stage I intended to move an amendment to the second reading motion proposing the establishment of a Senate select committee to inquire into the department's management of immigration matters, but instead I will give notice of a motion along those lines on one of the next few sitting days.

         The opposition is still concerned that part 4B, which relates to the grounds for judicial review of an immigration decision, has, on Dr Cronin's testimony, been seen as still inadequate to achieve the purposes that the Liberal and National parties would want it to achieve. There is an unsatisfactory legal foundation for this properly building in of the notion of natural justice to the whole procedures of review within the department that would limit the grounds for external judicial review of any immigration decision. We want to see, in the new year, the coherent approach that we are still waiting for after all these months from the government; we want to see that it will be watertight, sound, workable and capable of achieving the objective that we all addressed last December in this debate, as well as now.

         â€”I rise to speak on this important billâ€”the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited Sale Bill 1993â€”even though it relates to only a small entity. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited was originally started as a corporation following the end of the Snowy Mountains scheme in 1970. It has been a very successful corporation. It currently has about 240 staff and has completed over 1,700 projects in 54 countries. Eighty per cent of its work has been done offshore. It has an international reputation of the highest standing. This last financial year its turnover was $56 million.

         The corporation is in a business which has very good opportunities for growth in the futureâ€”in other words, selling engineering services out of Australiaâ€”particularly since the deterioration of the Australian dollar in recent years. The corporation changed to a company by a government bill in July 1989. At the time, the opposition moved the following amendment to the bill:

        The coalition agrees 100 per cent with the government in privatising this corporation. We also agree that equity should be offered to the staff of the corporation.

         There are two important constraints on the sale: the first constraint is that the head office of the corporation must stay in Cooma for at least five years; and the second constraint is that the staff should be offered equity.

         Our major concern is the valuation process. Here we have a company which, according to its annual report which came out a couple of weeks ago, has a balance sheet showing net assets of $10.2 million and a profit for the last financial year of $1.1 million. So it is a successful entity. I might add that it has not always been successful. Prior to its new board and its new management being formed in 1989, there was a series of years of substantial losses. The organisation has been turned around in the last few years.

         I turn now to the process of selling the corporation. In the absence of a tendering process, one would be forced to conclude that the sale price ought to be of the order of what is shown in the balance sheet. After all, the purpose of the balance sheet is to show the value of the corporation. In other words, the value of this corporation is around $10 million. But we do not know the selling price of the entity. The coalition insists that the government must advise the parliament of the details of the sale price.

         The negotiations have been going on for quite some time. It would appear that the purchase vehicle, Tinbury, may be in trouble in raising capital. I did a check with the ASC and in a report submitted to it on 4 June this year it appears that Tinbury has paid-up capital of only $119,000. That is rather minuscule for the vehicle seeking to buy an entity worth of the order of $10 million.

         One has to ask whether the staff are having trouble raising the capital. As an outsider looking at the situation, if we assume that Tinbury is having financial trouble, then an alternative would be for the corporation to offer an employee share ownership scheme to the staff. In that way the corporation itself could finance the employees into the entity. In order to do that, one would have to open up for public tender, or certainly public offers of purchase, a significant proportion of the entity to other companies.

As I said earlier, because of the change in profitability and because there is an effective board, I wonder whether the government has sought the advice of that board to seek a practical business solution for the privatisation of this entity. Consequently, I ask the minister whether the board has been involved in the sale and whether the advice of the board has been sought and acted upon.

         â€”I indicated at the second reading stage that I would be moving three amendments to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). Two of the amendments that I foreshadowed are relevant to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). The first is a request that the bill be split in order that it be put in a clearly constitutional form. I do not want to waste the time of the chamber by reiterating an argument that has now been put several times. I simply say that the opposition remains concerned that advice from leading constitutional lawyers in this country is that there is a very serious doubt as to whether this bill would stand challenge in the High Court. It is our view that it is the responsibility of government to put its legislation in clearly unambiguous constitutional form. The deficiency could be very easily rectified and the government should, even at this late stage, do that.

         That it is so easy is demonstrated by the detail of our amendment, which sets out for the government how it could split the bill to be clearly constitutional. The amendment is quite long. I am not sure whether my colleague Senator Short circulated it when the bill was last before the Senate, before he was taken overseas on parliamentary business.

         â€”Perhaps I will summarise the amendment. The argument is very familiar to the Senate; it is that the  bill be divided into four separate bills. Firstly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in relation to fringe benefits. Most of that, I think, is going to be withdrawn; nevertheless, to separate what remains of the fringe benefits area is constitutionally important. Secondly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in relation to the taxation of payments in lieu of annual leave and long service leave. Thirdly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 in relation to the taxation of credit unions. Fourthly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 in relation to Medicare levy low income thresholds.

         In summary, our advice is that this bill can be put in constitutional form by splitting it into four separate bills. We are therefore requesting that the chamber do thatâ€”not to delay things, because it could be voted on in correct form today; so there is no delay at all. To be quite fair to my friend Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, because I think there might have been some little communication breakdown, his position was that he would have liked to have supported our second reading amendmentâ€”

         â€”Yesterday's, on the first billâ€”correctâ€”because that was the position he argued before and that was his position on the committee. However, he has said to me that at this stage, the committee stage, the Democrats would not be inclined to support the request. So, in other words, they support the principle and they still would have preferred to see the government put the bill in constitutional form, but they will not be voting with us in the committee on this presumably because there is still some element of uncertainty, even if it seems to me there is really not because the government could take it out and split it exactly as we have said and have it back here within a matter of a couple of hours. So there would be no loss of time at all.

         But if I understand the Democrats' position correctly, that is it, and if I do not, Senator Kernot will no doubt correct me. So I will move the amendment.

         â€”In the debate on this amendment of Senator Hill's I am not going to detain the chamber long, as Senator Hill did not, because they are issues we have gone over on a number of occasions in this chamber. It is a very long bow that the opposition is drawing in its conclusion concerning the constitutionality of these provisions and, were it to be correct, it would have major implications for almost every tax bill that we have passed since Federation. That is not to say that it is impossible; sometimes things do occur that have implications for a whole lot of bills in the past and where an assumption has been made that is incorrect. Simply because it is different to all the prevailing interpretation this century does not make it wrong. But the government is firmly of the view that the balance of evidence strongly supports the view that this is a constitutional means of proceeding.

         We understand the argument about whether the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) should be the test bill. That is a separate question and I understand the concern about that. I think that is the appropriate way to go. That is a matter of some contention. With regard to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1), we think that an extraordinary interpretation would be required to provide some foundation or validity for the constitutional interpretation that underpins this amendment. Therefore, we will be opposing it.

        Clause 35 of the bill removes the concessional tax treatment applying to payments for accrued annual leave. The effect of my amendment would be to delete that provision. We have strongly opposed this provision since the bill first appeared following the budget. As a result of political pressure, there were changes in relation to retrospective accrued long service leave, but the government was not prepared to recognise the principle in respect of retrospective accrued annual leave. It is still our view that the concession should remain.

         We hold very strong views in relation to retrospectivity in tax laws. Annual leave may have been accrued in circumstances where people had a choice, but often they may not have had a choice. They would have understood that they were subject to a certain tax regime. The effect of the government's amendment is to change it retrospectively. We think that that is wrong. Therefore, we intend to continue to press our case by means of this amendment.

         â€”The government actually seeks to repeal the concessional treatment of unused annual leave. This must be questioned on grounds of equity and fairness. For that reason, I support the amendment to remove the retrospective elements from this legislation. At the same time, I acknowledge that the government has had a change of heart about taxing concessionally the long service leave component. In other words, the government's proposals in terms of the long service leave component will only apply as from budget night, 17 August.

         Naturally, the coalition is concerned that the retrospective element of the tax increase on annual leave was not removed at the same time as the long service leave component was. During the committee stage we will take the opportunity of supporting that amendment to remove the retrospectivity in terms of annual leave. The Liberal and National parties have always upheld the principle that changes in taxation legislation should be prospective and not retrospective.

         I urge the government to remember the rationale for these so-called concessions. When, on termination, an employee receives a payment in respect of unused annual leave, the amount received would force most taxpayers into a higher tax bracket. Thus, the taxpayer receiving such amounts would be required to pay tax on the accrued entitlement at a higher rate than would have been the case had leave been taken during their employment. We acknowledge that the top tax rate for individuals has been reduced over the years but, because of bracket creep, taxpayers are coming into higher and higher brackets. Personal tax scales are still based on the theory of a progressive taxation system. As a result of this budget change, in the absence of such a concession many taxpayers with accrued annual leave entitlements will face a higher marginal tax rate in respect of a lump sum payment.

         Present entitlements with regard to unused leave are also adequate when one considers the present economic climate. Many employees are being forced to resign with little prospect of another job in the circumstances. They may fall short of a bona fide redundancy and lose out on concession, depending on the circumstances of the business at the time. For that reason, I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the amendment to remove the retrospective element in terms of the annual leave component put by my colleague Senator Hill.

         â€”I, too, wish to support the amendment moved by Senator Hill on this point. There are two questions at hand here: the first relates to the retrospectivity, as Senator Watson pointed out, of the decision to remove concessional treatment of accumulated leaveâ€”and I will stick to accumulated leave in this case. The other relates to treating accumulated leave retrospectively dating back to 1978.

         I believe that leave is accumulated for some compelling reasons at times. As an employer, I have found that out. Families cannot simply take annual leave at a particular time for various reasons. They may not be able to take leave in a seasonal year, or they may be under financial pressure and unable to afford to take holidays at that time. It is recognised by the government and successive governments through the existence of leave loading that generally it is more costly to be on holiday, especially if people go away from home. So there are reasons why people accumulate leave, and I have only mentioned some of them.

         On another point, I do not believe that the proposed retrospective tax would amount to much. I do not think the government has told us what the difference would be to the tax intake of the government by retrospectively taxing accumulated leave. I am not talking about from here onwards; I am talking about the retrospective angle. I do not have an idea of what sort of figure would be involved. I do not think there would be too much leave accumulated from 1978â€”that is 15 years ago. I believe that leave would have been taken.

         I have no problem with the government removing the concessional treatment of accumulated leave and long service leave because I do not know the real reasons why it was treated concessionally in the past, except that it may have been to help the families who had to accumulate their leave rather than take it. I have nothing against taking it away, but I am certainly against taking it retrospectively because, as I say, I believe there is not too much accumulated leave. Those who accumulate leave should all be subject to the tax angle from the day the legislation comes into effect.

         The final point I would like to make is that there is still some concessional treatment of accumulated leave in the instance of death. If a person dies while still in the work force, accumulated leave is paid out after the date of death and it is still treated concessionally. Not only is it treated concessionally, but also it is treated as zero. Perhaps the minister could tell us whether he has any ideas to change that because I would certainly be against that sort of thing. It is never a great amount of money at the time.

         I know that from experience. Only a few months ago I was cleaning up an estate; it was under $10,000.

It created a great deal of concern amongst a lot of people with whom I am associated, particularly in the trade union movement.

         Take, for example, the armed forces. Many people in the armed forces cannot take their annual leave annually, so it accrues from time to time. One of the pieces of correspondence that I received on this particular measure referred to that fact. It seemed to me that it was a very real case for concessional treatment to be maintained. I think the government ought to look at those things in calmer moments and see whether something could be done in respect of those occupations by virtue of which, in many cases, people are unable to take their annual leave annually.

         Firstly, to answer Senator Panizza's question about the cost: the extra revenue from this measure in 1993-94 will be $80 million. Not all of that will be the product of the retrospectivity, but in the first year we would expect the overwhelming majority of it to be. So we are talking in that order. It is significant.

         I want to pursue this question. I thought, when I heard the debate, that I must have been wrong about what the old system used to be, so I went and checked. My recollection is correct: for low income earners, what we are doing here has always been the case. If a person's marginal tax rate is less than 30c and it changes, it impacts upon that person's accumulated annual leave. This has always happened to low income earners. We are just saying that the same thing should apply to everybody else. Those opposite are up in arms saying, `This is an outrage. What an attack upon the basic principles of equity in the tax system.

         â€”No, I am saying that what those opposite call `retrospectivity' applies to lower income people. If the parliament today were to say, `What are you doing changing the tax rate?', it would apply to annual leave already accumulated by lower income workers. If someone had 12 weeks leave accumulated and we changed the tax law, the tax rate would apply to those people and they would pay tax on leave that they accumulated when the rate was 20c; if the rate were to go up to 25c, they would pay 25c on it. At the moment the concessional rate is that we do not pay more than 30c.

         No-one has ever said that what we are proposing for people below that rate is retrospective. It is not, by any normal measure of what the word means. I am not going to try to persuade those opposite. Honourable senators have heard what speakers have said. I understand that honourable senators have considered the matter and formed their view. But I did not want it to pass as if in some way the government is being negligent about the interests of lower income people or working people. I want to make that point very clear. It does have more revenue implications than some thought, without exaggerating it into some new air of crisis which is entirely inappropriate. It is a profound cause of concern to us.

         What the House of Representatives will do with the request is a matter which we will decide when it goes there. Essentially, the reason I have spoken at a little more length than I usually would is to say that the government firmly opposes the amendment but, in the interests of expeditious handling, we are not proposing to divide on it.

         â€”by leaveâ€”The government has two requests for amendments to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993. I suspect it is easier to deal with the credit union amendments first. They are the ones about which there might be some debate. I think the amendments that relate to fringe benefits tax are agreed to by the whole chamber, so we can deal with them more quickly. I move:

         In the application of subsection 23(2) of the Principal Act as amended by this Act to a recognised large credit union for the 1994-95 year of income, the 1995-96 year of income or the 1996-97 year of income, the reference in the subsection to 33% is to be read as a reference to 20%.".

        These requested amendments reflect the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. On balance, they probably improve the bill; even if they do not, they improve its chances of getting passed, which is also important to the government.

         â€”The Liberal-National Party coalition will be supporting the government amendments. The government amendments to its own legislation acknowledge the point that was made in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that the very small credit unions had to receive a concessional tax treatment and the very smallest ones had to pay no tax whatsoever. We recognised that they had a social as well as an economic role. That was important. I think that as a result of these amendments 167 of the 332 credit unions will pay absolutely no tax or will receive a concessional tax treatment. I think that is significant.

         What the government has done, in line with the request from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration after it conducted a hearing into credit unions, has been, essentially, to provide an exemption or concessional tax treatment for the very small and medium sized ones. There was a difficulty, in that in recent times the very large credit unions have been seen to compete very effectively in the marketplace with building societies and banks. That appears to be growing at quite a significant rate. In terms of equity, fairness and ability to compete, I think that about the right sort of balance has been achieved as a result of these measures. We will not satisfy everybody, but that is the nature of politics. Under the circumstances, I think a not unreasonable compromise has been reached.

The credit unions are saying that they are not averse to paying tax, but they feel really strongly about losing mutuality.

I am afraid I really wonder about the government's intention in these areas because housing cooperatives too were formed for the very purpose of empowering people, so that those who have suffered as tenants for years might have a way of taking control over their own lives. I was involved in the formation of a number of those cooperatives in Queensland against incredible opposition from Joh Bjelke-Petersen's National Party government, which could not see any benefit in the cooperative movement.

         The social policy that the credit unions represent is played out through the credit unions' exemption from tax under section 23G. Even the largest credit unions in Australia are substantially smaller than the smallest bank; the vast majority of credit unions occupy a tiny proportion of the financial sector. While credit unions are small, they provide a significantly different style of financial services to their customers. Their customers are all members who are able to borrow money from their institutions while others are unwilling to lend. We do not believe that the government's proposal and the committee's proposal is needed to differentiate between smaller and larger credit unions.

This is a very important tenet of regionalism and community development and a very important basis to the Greens' support of credit unions.

         We will be supporting the Australian Democrats' request, because it will achieve the budgetary aims of the government while protecting and enhancing the mutuality principle, which is so important to the philosophical direction underlying credit unions. As Senator Kernot has said, it will increase credit unions' tax payments without disturbing the central principle in section 23D. The Credit Union Services Corporation (Australia) Limited has estimated that if this provision had applied in 1992-93, at the new corporate tax rate of 33 per cent the tax paid by credit unions would have amounted to approximately $23 million.

However, they have failed to support it.

         If there is any more tax paid as a result of this measure than is currently paid, it is probably tax that already should be paid under the prevailing arrangements and existing judicial interpretation of the current circumstance. That revenue measure is not of itself compelling because we are not talking about enormous amounts.

         We will not be supporting the measure. I do not think the revenue proposal is correct. More importantly, although we acknowledge that some very small credit unions continue to operate on the unique basis that lay in their origins, many of them, including some of which I was for many years a member, have grown away from that. They are very useful financial institutions and they will continue to be after this bill is passed. They will just be financial institutions participating in the system on the same basis as everybody else.

         â€”I support the amendment moved by Senator Kernot. On 30 August I asked Senator McMullan, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question which went to the history of this matter. I reminded the minister in that question about the taxation treatment which was applied by the Fisher Labor government in 1915 to the incomes of trade unions, friendly societies and credit unions. I left up in the air the question of what Labor principles motivated that decision. The Labor principles were principles of mutuality. The mutuality principles, in respect of credit unions, are contained in section 23G. I think it is very important to stand by the principles that have been held dear within the Labor Party for many years.

This former Labor member, who has a background of being involved in the labour movement for many years, is very clear about the principles which have governed this issue from the early days of the Fisher Labor government. The mutuality principle was reaffirmed in 1973 by the then Treasurer Frank Crean, who took action to overcome a High Court decision. Almost since federation the Labor Party has had a consistent platform of holding the mutuality principle sacrosanct.

        Again, the opposition is moving a request to split, in this case, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993 to put it into constitutional form. This is the so-called test bill which even the government acknowledges contains constitutional doubt. As I said earlier in relation to the first bill, our argument is that that is not the way to properly conduct the legislative process. If there is doubt as to constitutionality that doubt should be removed before the bill is put for passage in this place.

         My request is to remove that doubt by the bill being split into two separate bills: a bill for an act to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax; and a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 in relation to friendly societies. I acknowledge, regrettably, that the numbers are not with us on this matter; nevertheless we regard it as an important principle.

         We are surprised that the numbers are not with us because we would have thought that all parties and Independents within this place would believe strongly that bills should be put in an unambiguously constitutional form. It is not too late for this to be corrected. My amendment shows how simple it is to correct it and I have moved it in those terms. We hope that others might change their minds at the last minute, that they would agree to the principle that I have just put and require the government to remove the constitutional ambiguity in order that this place could then vote in a way in which we could be reasonably sure that what we are passing is constitutionally valid.

         It is departing from 93 years of parliamentary practice. Nothingâ€”no evidenceâ€”has been brought before the Senate chamber to show a necessity to introduce a new form of practice in relation to tax bills. Therefore, one has to say that the only necessity behind this test bill is certain people's egotistical or intellectual fascination. At a cost of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars, this churlish Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is going to indulge himself.

         â€”My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as Minister representing the Prime Minister and relates to Mabo. I refer the minister to the statement released yesterday by Lois O'Donoghue, the highly respected chair of ATSIC, and also made on behalf of the Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations working group. She said:

         â€”The answer is no different from the one that I have given on many previous occasions: compensation is payable in respect of the act of extinguishment only in relation to situations where invalid grants of title in the past are validated as a result of the legislative processes that will be set out in the Mabo legislation. It is the case that previously valid grants of title, which have had the effect as a matter of lawâ€”so the High Court tells usâ€”of extinguishing such native title as may have existed, will not give rise now to a claim for compensation.

         I repeat, the only claims for compensation that will be payable in respect of extinguishment are those that will flow from certain situations where validation now occurs. Those situations are limited ones in relation to pre-1975 titles. They are limited to the extremely unlikely situation of the court finding that the existence of native title in conjunction with some other lawâ€”for example, a law relating to fiduciary dutyâ€”has had that effect of invalidating the grant in question, and I do not think anybody really believes that there will be any such cases.

         In the case of post-1975 leasesâ€”there is a maximum of only 11 pastoral leases which would seem to give rise to this situationâ€”to the extent that there is any doubt about their validity, they will be the subject, of course, of validation by the proposed legislation. Whether there is any doubt about the validity of the leases in question will depend on determination in due course by the courts, if the matter is ever challenged. The argument would have to be that the Racial Discrimination Act applies either to require procedural justice which was not delivered or to require compensation at the time which was not paid. It will be a matter, of course, for argument as to whether that is so. But I repeat: it is only in a small number of cases that that situation will arise.

         Compensation questions, of course, do arise in relation to valid grants of native title that apply in the future where economic uses of a different kind are authorised by the process that is proposed. That will give rise to claims of compensation for impairment of the native title or in other contexts that are spelt out in the outline. I think there has possibly been some degree of confusion in references to compensation meaning to extend to that context as well as to compensation for validation of previously invalid grants.

I think those reports are very misleading indeed, essentially because they are based on the false assumption that Russia already had some kind of parliamentary constitutional democracy and as a result had something to lose from President Yeltsin's actions.

         The truth of the matter is that the parliament dissolved by President Yeltsin on 21 September was elected in 1990 when Russia was merely the largest administrative region within the Soviet Union and therefore subject to the rule of the Soviet government. Not only was there no thought then of this parliament acquiring a role in the government of Russia as an independent country; but much more importantly, even at the time of its election, the parliament's democratic credentials were extremely compromised by the Soviet Communist Party's manifest manipulation of the preselection and voting procedures. The Russian constitution was an equally discredited relic of Russia's Soviet past. Its obsolescence was highlighted by the fact that the Congress of People's Deputies amended it more than 300 times in the two years that it had the chance to work on it.

         As I have already said in the Senate, in the Australian government's view President Yeltsin made a sustained effort to find a workable compromise with the opposition leadership. But once that opposition leadership had resorted to force, he had no option but to respond in kind. Subsequently President Yeltsin imprisoned the leaders of the insurrection and suspended a number of media outlets which openly supported the insurrection. But over the following week he released all but 60 of the 1,200-odd people who were imprisoned, and some of the opposition newspapers are again being published, albeit under new livery. However, a ban does continue to exist on 12 publications and one television program. I certainly share the concerns that have been widely expressed about these bans and I hope they will be lifted very shortly.

In this respect it is a very welcome development that President Yeltsin has now reconfirmed that the elections for both chambers of the new parliament will go ahead on 12 December and has welcomed international scrutiny of them. The Australian government will continue to support action which helps Russia to advance down the difficult path toward democracy and a market oriented economy.

         â€”The reference to native title equivalent rather than native title as such is simply an act, I guess, of lawyer's caution in the sense that what is being proposed for the vesting of title in these existing pastoral leases held by Aboriginal people is the re-creation of a native title which has necessarily, as a result of the previous application of the law, been extinguished. If we are re-creating, in a sense, something which was previously there but has been extinguished, as a matter of caution, I guess it is appropriate to call it native title equivalent rather than native titleâ€”although that is essentially a matter of lawyers' semantics and that view may not prevail in the final drafting of the legislation.

         So let me make the point at the outset that there is no difference between the kind of native title that we are talking about at large that might be acquired in respect of presently unalienated crown land and the kind of native title that might be acquired as a result of the conversion of these existing leases. As I said yesterday, the content of just what precisely is involved in native title will necessarily vary according to the context and the circumstances. That was made perfectly clear as early as the release of the government's discussion paper back in Juneâ€”on page 15, paragraph 2.4. Senator Alston can read that for himself. I will not go through it. The notion of native title is essentially a rather flexible concept, depending on the circumstances.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But what is the situation so far as what I am asked aboutâ€”the question of inalienability? Is it inalienable or is it not? The bill will not provide for native title to be sold or leased and in that sense it will not be alienable in the same way as ordinary titles are in this country. But there will be a powerâ€”and this is set out in paragraph 29 of the legislative outlineâ€”for native titleholders to surrender their title to governments if they wish; for example, to facilitate commercial development by having a statutory title issued over part of the land. The new native title equivalent will essentially involve current rights to operate a pastoral lease plus any rightsâ€”but no more than thatâ€”which are held under the customary law of the native titleholders. It is that that introduces an element of uncertainty as to how much in the way of rights of that kind may in fact exist.

         Might I make clear also for the record that the new native title will not be the same as Northern Territory inalienable freehold title which does, of course, have a right of veto over mining associated with it. It will, however, attract the right of negotiation, to be provided by the Commonwealth bill, for all native titleholders when development of their land is proposed. Native title claimants will, under the proposal, be able to apply to either the Federal Court or a recognised state tribunal to have their claims considered. Might I say this further, although Senator Alston did not ask me: the government will be giving further consideration to the possibility of legal assistance to land holders whose land is the subject of native title claim. The bill will provide for conciliation to be available to the courts in considering native title claims, thus hopefully minimising any such legal cost.

         My understanding is that a number of the charts used by commercial and defence shipping today are based on charts produced by Matthew Flinders about 200 years ago. LADS has the ability to rapidly record accurate, high density and total coverage digital information of coastal waters up to 50 metres in depth. LADS is capable of surveying in excess of 50 square kilometres in an hour. This is up to 10 times faster than the present surface methods. In addition, it can provide a complete, safe coverage of complex and dangerous areas unsuitable for survey by surface vessels.

         The system is extremely impressive and it is no wonder that it has been drawn to the attention of the US navy. The US navy oceanographer Admiral Chesborough flew a survey sortie in the LADS aircraft out of Townsville last April. BHP has been funded by the US navy to undertake preliminary studies on a number of applications, including the fitting of LADS to some of the US navy's P3C Orions.

         Clearly, this system offers a variety of applications and opportunities in Australia for the production of accurate and up-to-date charts of the Great Barrier Reef, for oil and gas exploration and for the general safety of those who use Australian waters. Finally, interest can be generated overseas in what is potentially a very good export market.

        It is because the content of native title is so variable and contains so many different dimensions that it is impossible to say that it cannot be enjoyed completely during the tenure of a mining grant over native title land. It obviously cannot be enjoyed to the extent that there is a hole in a ground and ore is being dug out with appropriate roads, buildings and everything else associated with it. There may well be many other aspects of the titleâ€”hunting across the land and everything elseâ€”that are perfectly capable of enjoyment.

         It is an important and innovative program, in that not only does it enhance trade and investment opportunities between Australia and those countries, but, more particularly, it assists Australian lawyers to understand the systems of law, values and legal traditions of those particular countries. It also picks up the trend in those countriesâ€”Vietnam, Laos and Cambodiaâ€”towards market based economies, and the need for laws to regulate an expanding private sector in those three countries and to define rights and the extent of private involvement in both investment and trade.

         The committee's role will be to oversee the program. In doing so, it will also help advance Australia's standing as a model for the development of these new laws and infrastructures in these three countries. This week's meeting was chaired by Ms Elizabeth Nosworthy, a leading Australian commercial lawyer. In order to reflect the diverse support for this program, other members of the committee come from the private sector, from legal academics and business sector representatives and, of course, from government and the Law Council of Australia.

         The program has funding to the tune of $670,000 over 3 1/2 years. In pursuing the objectives of the program, AILC will collaborate closely with the re-established International Legal Services Advisory Council, of which Sir Laurence Street is primary member. The committee will be concerned with identifying suitable areas for Australian legal cooperation and will recommend priorities for funding to the Attorney-General. At the same time as recommending those priorities, I think the Attorney-General expects a number of existing government programs to be amongst those to be identified.

         This program is important in the continuing expansion of contacts and trade, particularly investment between Australia and Asia. It is particularly important because it goes very much to the foundation of business relationships between this country and the three countries involved. We are talking about setting up basic legal infrastructure in the three countries of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. When we talk about the need for a response in this area, we are talking about the direct interest of Australian business and, of course, those three countries which will be the subject of Australian investment and trade opportunities.

         â€”My remarks yesterday and those of the Prime Minister last night were both qualified. I said, correctly, that the compensation cost was impossible to quantify at this stage. The Prime Minister equally talked of probably a moderately sized amount, but over a long period. Those qualifications are appropriate. Nobody is in a position to make anything more than a guesstimate. The scope of those guesstimates between informed observers is bound to differ. We cannot know how many, if any, grants would be found invalid by a court. It is very difficult, as I said, to envisage any such grants being found invalid before 1975, but certainly, as the Prime Minister said, there are up to 11 in that category so far as pastoral leases are concerned between 1975 and 1993.

         Whether compensation will be payable in any of those cases depends on a number of factors which are necessarily unknown at this stage. Who has native title? Where? To what extent? Is the grant in question invalidated because compensation was not paid or because there was some purported procedural unfairness at the time? What amount will be appropriate for loss of native titleholders' rights, including special attachment to the land?

         It is entirely possible that the compensation bill will be relatively small. That remains my own view. Certainly it will be spread over a number of years. Neither I nor the Prime Minister was purporting to give definitive answers, as is perfectly clear from the context of each of our remarks. That the quantum of compensation is uncertain should come as no great revelation to the opposition or anyone else.

         Again referring to the discussion paper back in June, in paragraphs 8.8 to 8.13 of that paper that issue is dealt with in a clear and open and very frank way. Neither I nor the Prime Minister disagrees with the proposition that is contained here, which says that it is `impossible to make a confident estimate of the quantum of compensation payable in relation to past grants'. One's estimate would also have to depend on whether one has in mind compensation per se or the administrative and legal costs of setting up and running the institutions and processes that will be necessary to determine those issues.

         Finally, the fact that compensationâ€”which is payable by governments, not by industries; so to that extent it ought not to be a matter of concern for the pastoralists in questionâ€”cannot be predicted with certainty is of course no reason at all to shy away from doing what is necessary to provide security for grants and just treatment of native titleholders.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          While there are some residual areas that necessarily will remain uncertain even with the passage of this legislationâ€”and compensation is manifestly one of those areasâ€”undoubtedly the legislative package will create a great deal more certainty, infinitely more certainty, about the whole operation of the Mabo title exercise than would have been the case had the matter simply been left to be resolved on a case by case basis by the courts. That is why we have gone down the legislative track and that is why there is so much support for this result everywhere else in the Australian community except on the opposition benches.

They were appropriate for the time but have become increasingly unsatisfactory for the provision of defence housing. The Commonwealth has been renegotiating these agreements as one of its initiatives to address the longstanding problems with the standard of defence housing.

         This agreement will bring many benefits to South Australia. The housing activity arising from this renegotiation will have significant economic benefits for South Australia. Over the next three years the Defence Housing Authority plans to spend around $50 million on the purchase of housing, land development and house construction in South Australia. The authority will spend substantial funds improving the houses it acquires from the state. Some of the houses are no longer suitable for defence needs.

         From the Commonwealth's perspective, the renegotiation of the housing agreement has many benefits. It provides greater control over the management of defence housing, including a more responsive repairs and maintenance service to defence families. It also gives the Defence Housing Authority the flexibility to upgrade housing in the most effective manner. Ownership of the houses means that unsuitable houses can be sold to generate income for replacement dwellings. That will reduce the demand on other sources of funds.

There is even a question mark as to how many of them are properly to be regarded as newly granted leases as distinct from renewals or having some element of continuity. It is probably only in relation to those that some sort of prima facie claim could be made based on the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. Equally again, it is extremely unclear as to whether or not, as I said in answer to a previous question, the High Court would regard in these situations the Racial Discrimination Act as going as far as invalidating the grant in question made during that period.

         â€”It is interesting that Senator Woodley says the terms of reference of the inquiry are very wide because my advice is that the terms of reference have not been finalised yet. That is advice that I received only briefly, but, so far as I know, that is the case. There are ministerial consultations under way about what those terms of reference will be, so I cannot give any guarantees about that until at least the terms of reference are finalised and after that we will have to see what happens with the inquiry.

         I can tell the Senate that there has been considerable interest in this inquiry. I fully expect that the commission will have a very wide range of views put to it in submissions and public presentations. Honourable senators would know that the commission advertises each inquiry and draws up a list of prospective participants. My understanding is that a large list of individuals and organisations have expressed interest in the inquiry. In fact, some charities have welcomed the inquiry and have expressed their strong desire to put their views to this independent review. It is the independence of the review process that is, in this instance, seen to be the case for it to be conducted by the Industry Commission.

         The charity sector of our society and economy receives a large amount of government assistance. It is entirely appropriate that from time to time there should be an independent review about how that money is being spent. The inquiry is likely to explore options for maximising the benefits to be gained from such assistance. For example, it may well lead to enabling a government to provide greater assistance without increases in outlays. It is also important that this inquiry may possibly inform the general public about the direction and effectiveness of their donations to charities and encourage more support. That responds to the second point.

I ask the minister: what steps have been taken by the air force to formally notify all air force pilots involved in double asymmetric training, including 707, Hercules and P3C Orion pilots, of the causes of the accident and the procedures to be followed in the future? Exactly when will the 707, Hercules and Orion simulators, which cannot currently be used for double asymmetric training, be upgraded so that the 1991 tragedy in which five air force personnel lost their lives is not repeated?

If that is the case, I further ask: given that this training forms part of the routine practising of emergency procedures for the 707, the Hercules and the Orion aircraft, and in particular, given that due to operational requirements Orions regularly fly with one engine shut down to conserve fuel, when will the simulators be upgraded? Or will we be hoping that an Orion with 15 crew on board flying at low speed with one engine shut down will never experience an engine failure in the second engine on that wing, and that the pilots involved would automatically know what to do, despite being unable to practise the emergencyâ€”if it is the case that the training has been stoppedâ€”either in the air or in a simulator?

         The fact is that he was asked in an earlier question about the concept of pastoral leases and whether they absolutely extinguished native title. He said that this is a matter for determination by the High Court and that there are two possible options, one being that it does extinguish it permanently and the other being that it does it only to the extent of the inconsistency.

        Well what I said to the Aboriginal people I negotiated with last week, look, I will take to Cabinet the notion that, there are two notions, that a pastoral lease extinguishes Native Title absolutely, or a pastoral lease extinguishes Native Title to the extent that it is inconsistent with Native Title. That's what they asked me to take to Cabinet. This did introduce for some pastoralists some uncertainty, although, in fact the primacy of their lease was 100 per cent protected. But to remove it, the Aboriginal people made a judgment, really how much is in this for us, how many of these thin sliver of rights, of uncertain rights, would we actually get? And given that the Government then last night gave them a different offer to turn many pastoral leases owned by them into a form of Native Title . . .

        If we are recreating, in a sense, something which was previously there but has been extinguished, as a matter of caution, I guess it is appropriate to call it native title equivalent rather than native titleâ€”although that is essentially a matter of lawyer's semantics and that view may not prevail in the final drafting of the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, he has no idea what the government's current position is in relation to that, although later on he said what will be spelt out in the legislation. Then he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the content of just what precisely is involved in native title will necessarily vary according to the context and the circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, classic waffle. The point is whether or not it is inalienable. What he said was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there will be a power . . . for native titleholders to surrender their title to governments if they wish; for example, to facilitate commercial development. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, that means that, if they want to flog the land, they surrender the title to the government, the government reissues the title to those purchasers and the purchasers hand over the money to the native titleholders. In other words, they have sold the landâ€”whether or not the minister technically describes it in that way. Then he went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new native title equivalent will essentially involve current rights to operate a pastoral lease plus any rightsâ€”but no more than thatâ€”which are held under the customary law of the native titleholders.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, under customary law for native titleholders, they cannot alienate it. They cannot surrender it to the Commonwealth and pass it on and get their money through the back door. In other words, they cannot sell it commercially. Clearly, therefore, if we are being told, on the one hand, that it is inalienable and they cannot sell it why, on the other hand, were we being told by the Prime Minister that they  can?

He claimed that it had been praised by the mining industry, Aboriginals, church groups and the like, but Lauchlan McIntosh of the mining industry certainly did not confirm what was said. Furthermore, I doubt whether the farming industry agreed with what the minister read into the statement.

Under this system the land can then be converted to native title and the pastoral industry will be extinguished from that place forever. That is part of the agenda of this government, and the previous defeated, disgraced Labor government of Western Australia had the same idea.

         In reply to a question from Senator Boswell today, Senator Evans said quite clearly that in northern Queensland and northern Australia Aboriginals are still living on pastoral properties that they have always lived on, and in many cases they are the stock hands or live in the nearby town. They have not lost their link with the land. The pastoralists who hold a lease are not protected by virtue of the validation that will be given to the supposedly 11 leases that have a Racial Discrimination Act problem. They are still open to a common law claim.

This is an historic piece of legislation'. When we ask his minister in this place what will be the consequences of the legislation, how much it will cost us and who is affected, he says, `I don't know'.

         The problem for the government is that as soon as these pastoral leases get converted to native title, no commercial lender will lend to them because a mortgage over that title would be thoroughly and utterly useless because native title can never be sold. So a mortgagee who takes a mortgage will get absolutely nothing. Nobody will lend to that person. Any necessity for working capital must be met by the taxpayer or directly by the native titleholders. We are talking about people who do not have a lot of money to put togetherâ€”that is the whole basis of the government saying it needs some sort of social justice package.

As the government is bringing in legislation to make a fundamental change, I would have thought it not unfair to ask Senator Evans what proportion of the Australian land mass, in the government's assessment, will come under native title.

Is it going to be a matter of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars. The taxpayers of Australia are interested in that sort of question. This matter cannot be swept aside in the way that Senator Evans and Mr Keating have been trying to do.

         When these questions are asked of Labor ministers, we get the sort of reaction that we got from Senator Evans and Senator Ray yesterday when they called us rednecks. In the old days, rednecks were all Labor voters. Their necks were burnt because they were labouring hard in the fields and the mines. Members of the Labor Party used to respect that sort of person. But the modern Labor Party, full of the tertiary educated people of this world, simply does not care about those people, even though they are the people who will have to be taxed so that compensation can be paid. If the government does not want to ask that question in its party room, the opposition wants to ask it in this chamber because these people will be asked to pay the compensation.

         I put to Senator Evans that it is time the government was far more frank about this particular issue and made very clear the amount of land mass involved and the compensation paid. One only has to read the editorial in today's

         to see the great uncertainties. The heading of the editorial is `Mabo deal still leaves uncertainty'. Senator Kernot, who has just voted to increase taxes on all Australian people, allows a budget to go through which will increase taxes on all Australians. I thought Senator Kernot would have been worried about mining developments in Queensland which will help to provide jobs and the compensation.

         When one reads these editorials, one finds that, as a result of the statements by the Prime Minister, there is very great uncertainty as to whether major mining developments can be held up in this country and will ultimately not go ahead.

Every time they get up to open their mouths, they make it abundantly and evidently clear that they are profoundly ignorant about, or indifferent to, the basic concepts and principles that underlie this whole debate and the reason why we have gone about trying to craft this particular agreement. Alternatively, they have made it equally abundantly clear that they are not about seeking a positive and constructive solution to this problem of achieving reconciliation with our own original inhabitants; they are simply about making squalid political capital out of what they perceive to be opportunistic possibilities of generating a scaremongering campaign.

         Members of the opposition claim through their spokesman, their current leader, that they have an open mind on this legislation and that when they see it they will respond accordingly to its substance. They are demonstrating by every word that they utter in this chamber and publicly that their minds are not open at all. They are not approaching this in any constructive spirit of good public policy formulation. They are approaching it in a bitter, negativistic, opportunistic and scavenging frame of mind, determined to score what lousy bit of political capital they think they can among the remaining constituency in this country to whom they think they can appeal, and that is a very diminishing number indeed.

         The truth of the matter is that we were faced with both an opportunity and a problem by the Mabo case. When the High Court brought down the Mabo case, we were faced with a marvellous opportunity for the first time in the country's history to achieve a genuine reconciliation with white Australians and black Australians. We were confronted with the opportunity for the first time in our history to redress a fundamental and 200-year-old wrong; that is, the principle of terra nullius. The High Court gave us that opportunity, but at the same time it created one very large problem. It dealt only with a very small corner of the total issue and left many issues unresolved.

         Had it not been for the attempt to go down this path of crafting legislation, those outstanding issues could have been resolved only by a process of litigation that would have gone on and on and on and created an enormous degree of uncertainty and problems for investment and everything else, and in the mining and pastoralist industries in the country at large. We sought to reduce that uncertaintyâ€”not to get rid of it completely. That is impossible because there are too many unknowns still at the edges, in particular on the question of compensation, for all the reasons I spelt out fully, precisely and frankly when I spoke in question time. There are elements of residual uncertainty which simply are not capable of being resolved by anybody until they are dealt with on case by case basis. That is always the case with compensation issues. They cannot be resolved except on a case by case basis. So of course we cannot tell the opposition now what the quantum is going to be.

         The Department of Employment, Education and Training has presented a report to the Senate today on the data-matching program which the government has instituted in connection with a number of other departments to improve the level of public confidence in the department and the government's capacity to detect and deter fraudulent behaviour. There was enormous growth in computer-based record systems in 1980s. The perceived level of fraud has allowed some sections of the community to argue that government benefits are being directed to places where they should not be. This report indicates that the department has the capacity to recognise fraudulent behaviour and to identify means by which it can be detected.

          Interestingly enough, this scheme also has the capacity to identify where payments have not been made. That is where people have not been getting moneys that they are entitled to and as a consequence the necessary adjustments have to be made. This program has meant that individual departments have had enormous power to detect incorrect payments, but the various secrecy provisions in legislation up until 1990 restricted information flow between departments.

          The 1990-91 budget rectified this situation and enacted the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. The measures introduced in this legislation included the requirement for most people claiming government assistance to provide tax file numbers as a prerequisite for payment and increased computerised matching of data held by various government agencies. The first data exchange occurred in April 1991. The five government agencies involved were the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services.

          As the executive summary of this report indicates, the data-matching program has provided DEET with an effective tool in identifying and stopping fraudulent activity. The department has been able to demonstrate that for an investment of $1.2 million, it has saved just under $1 million and identified a further $6.6 million in debts. The executive summary goes on:

         The whole range of government agencies that this could apply to has meant there has been identification of discrepancies between various measures undertaken and the accuracy of information provided. Therefore, measures have to be taken to protect personal identity. The data involved with the Taxation Office has to be checked against the validity of data actually provided. This has serious privacy implications, and the Privacy Commissioner has had to be involved in regular audits of all the issues raised through this process.

          This data-matching program clearly demonstrates that DEET is prepared to go to elaborate lengths to successfully protect and stop fraud and, under the watchful eye of the Privacy Commissioner, to examine carefully the information supplied to the individual. However, we cannot say that the same parallel applies when it comes to the department's capacity to enforce agreements to systems. On the one hand, enormous lengths are taken to enforce agreements with individuals; but when it comes to the payment of very large sums of money to states, the same level of attention is not paid to enforcement. The same level of attention is not paid to the capacity of state governments to implement agreements that they have entered into with the Commonwealth.

In many cases funds allocated to states have not met the agreements entered into with the Commonwealth. Increasingly, particularly in Victoria, grave concern is being expressed about the level of funding that is going to national equity programs and is not being spent in accordance with the agreements entered into. The whole question of substitution arises in this regard whereby moneys which are provided to the states, and which are supposed to supplement moneys paid by the states for various educational programs, are not being spent effectively in accordance with agreements. There has been a case where Commonwealth moneys are replacing state moneys.

          It was indicated in those remarks at the time of that minority report coming before this chamber that this action would be resisted, it would fail and it was flawed both legally and politically. I think what has been demonstrated by the resolution which has been carried by the Legislative Assembly in Victoria is precisely the veracity of those points.

          It is not appropriate, under the principles of the parliamentary system in which we function, in terms of principles of comity, that there should be a mechanism whereby a member of parliament from one house can be dragged before a parliament in another jurisdiction. It is not appropriate that that should be undertaken. But if we do accept that notion, it would be appropriate, I suppose, if we followed the precedent that would be set, that members of this chamber could be dragged before the state chambers at some future point. So I am very pleased that the precedent has not been established in line with the majority report on the committee that led to this action.

          The fundamental points remain the same. There is ample material available for that committee to now produce its report. There is no need to continue this nonsense any longer. This is a totally unwarranted infringement of privileges of members of parliament in other jurisdictions and it is totally inappropriate given the number of witnesses that have already been heard by the committee of inquiry. My advice to Senator Coulter is that this question should be wrapped up immediately and that the report brought in as soon as possible.

          It was certainly reasonable for the Senate to pass the motion that it did. It was quite reasonable for the Victorian assembly to pass the motion that it did, but it might equally well have passed a different sort of motion, if it so chose. Certainly from the action which has been taken there is no vindication in relation to the ability of this chamber to call or not to call witnesses from other parliaments. Senator Carr simply cannot draw that conclusion. He cannot seek any sense of vindication of the government's objection to the action that the majority committee report sought to take, and I think it still leaves very much open the question of the relationship between the various houses of parliament in this country and the ability of one house to call witnesses from another.

        It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on alcoholic wine with an alcohol content greater than 1.15% by volume, from 20% to 31% for a designated period. That period will start on 18 August 1993 and will end on 31 October 1993, or the day before any earlier date which the Assistant Treasurer may announce in a statement laid before the other place. This will ensure business does not encounter problems with having charged the higher rate since the Budget announcement. From 1 November 1993, or any earlier date which the Assistant Treasurer may announce in his statement, the rate will be dropped to 22% rising to 24% on 1 July 1994 and 26% on 1 July 1995.

         â€”I wish to speak briefly to the second reading motion. The issues have been canvassed at length in this place and we do not want to unnecessarily take the time of the Senate. There are, however, a few points that should be made. The bills have come back to us, of course, in a different form from that in which they left us a week or so ago. They were then linked with the wholesale sales tax increases, and they have now been separated and changes have been made to them.

         We believe that the government's handling of this matter has been nothing short of disgraceful. A week or so ago in this place, the Senate passed a resolution opposing the increase in sales tax on wineâ€”and it did so for very good reasons. This in many ways is a fledgling Australian industry, but one with enormous potential as an export industry and with potential to provide jobs in Australiaâ€”jobs in an environment, I remind honourable senators, in which we still have nearly a million Australians out of work. It is a good industry; it is a high value added industry; it takes the best of our natural produce and the skills of our producers and creates wealthâ€”and with it, as I said, jobs and all the social benefits that obviously flow from being able to employ more of our people.

         The government's attitude to this industry with such wonderful potential was: `Here is an opportunity for us to rip more revenue out of this youthful enterprise'. This was to meet the embarrassment that has really been caused as a result of the lies that went back before the last election. There was no consideration of the consequences to this industry. There was no willingness on the part of the government to listen to industry representatives on what would be the consequence of its intended taxation.

         But that is a debate that we have had and I remind you, Mr Deputy President, that this Senate was clear in its majority view that the new tax should not be imposed. The bill therefore went back to the House of Representatives with our message to that effect. It is what occurred after that that is so disgraceful.

         In effect, what happened was that the Treasurer, Mr Dawkinsâ€”Treasurer for the time being, it would seemâ€”blackmailed the industry, with the support of this government. Together they held a gun at the head of the industryâ€”in fact, a double-barrelled gunâ€”and they were not concerned about the consequences of what they were doing.

         Firstly, they said to the industry, `Unless you are prepared to compromise, take what you know is not in the best interests of your industry, we will impose an excise'â€”with all the destructive effect that that would have on the industryâ€”`and we can impose it without it having to go through the parliament for a year. So we are prepared to put your industry at such risk for a year simply in order to pressure you to our position'. It was nothing short of political blackmail.

         Secondly, they said to the industryâ€”the second barrel of their gunâ€”`We do not care how long this process takes', knowing full well that the uncertainty was causing great damage to the industry in the marketplace. As everyone knows, the uncertainty has had a detrimental effect on sales. That was the second threat that they held over the industryâ€”`We do not care how long it takes; we will bring you to heel. We do not care what the consequence will be to the industry. We do not care what the consequence will be to employment. That is not our interest. We are going to beat you whether you like it or not'.

         Not surprisingly, in the end the industryâ€”and when I say `the industry' I mean at least some of the industry leadersâ€”had no alternative but to capitulate and to say that it would accept what has been described as a compromise, even though it knows that it could have a destructive effect upon this vitally important and growing industry.

         Those industry leaders were forced to accept this deal, knowing that it was not in the best interests of their industry, because the government threatened them that, if they did not, they would have this excise imposed without the opportunity of parliamentary scrutiny for a year and, furthermore, that the industry would be all but destroyed in the meantime by the uncertainty of the situation that was continuing. It is appalling behaviour by a government to simply try to win a political point.

         I believe that most honourable senators would have been aware of the expected order of business. There is a proposal that this matter be dealt with later in the day. We are honouring commitments we made about the order of business. The only surprise in any of this matter was that Senator Hill continued with a speech on the second reading, which I am entirely relaxed about.

         â€”As the whip for the opposition, I wish to make a point of explanation. Senator Faulkner is not quite correct in his belief that there was an understanding reached this morning that we would postpone this debate until a later hour this day. The arrangement was that we would see, when it came on, but that it was expected to be introduced after government business order of the day No.4, Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2). That was based on the assumption that the bills were going to be introduced after either item No. 2 or item No. 3. That did not occur, because the government did not have the bills ready to bring into the chamber, for some reason or other which we are not privy to.

         Accordingly, it was the very clear intention, as far as I understand it, that we proceed immediately to the second reading consideration of these bills, which is what Senator Hill has done. Certainly, that is the understanding on our side. It was always intended that these bills receive the second reading consideration before the committee stage of government business order of the day No. 5, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill.

         The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 focuses on implementing some 1993 Federal Election initiatives and initiatives announced in the 1993 Budget. The Bill also provides for some minor policy changes and technical amendments to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social security administration.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Prior to the 1993 Federal Election, the Government announced that it would introduce new payment arrangements for long term unemployed clients aged 60 and over, but below pension age. The commitment was made in recognition of the difficulties faced by older unemployed people in the current labour market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From 20 March 1994, any person aged 60 and over but who has not reached pension age, is unemployed, has been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for the last 12 months and who has been receiving income support payments for the last 12 months will be able to claim a Mature Age Allowance. The person will have to be in Australia and satisfy the age pension residency requirement of 10 years qualifying Australian residence. The person's partner might also be qualified to receive a Mature Age Partner Allowance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Transfer to the new Allowance will be voluntary. Unlike the conditions that apply to Newstart Allowance, a person being paid the Mature Age Allowance will not have to satisfy an activity test nor stay registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. However, a person might wish to remain registered so as to use any assistance the Commonwealth Employment Service provides. Mature Age Allowance will be paid at age pension rates and subject to the pension income and assets tests. Some of the other main features of the new Allowance are that allowees will have access to the pensioner earnings credit scheme and pensioner tax rebates will also apply.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government recognises that the need for the Mature Age Allowance could diminish when the economy recovers. To that end, legislation providing for the Allowance will be subject to a sunset clause of 30 June 1996 after which time no new claims may be lodged. Existing recipients will not be affected. Continuation of the arrangements will be reviewed in 1994-95 in the light of prevailing labour market conditions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill also gives effect to an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Investing in the Nation
        </emphasis>
        to provide an incentive for social security allowance recipients and their partners to earn moderate casual or part-time income without automatically affecting their income support payments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Job Search, Newstart and Sickness Allowance clients being paid at the maximum rate will be able to build up credit of up to $500 that can be offset against income from employment. Couples will be able to build up a maximum credit of $500 each. For a single person, credit will accrue at the rate of $90 a fortnight. Credit for each member of a couple will accrue at $80 a fortnight. The credits will not be transferable between partners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Credits may be used provided the person's earnings from employment and other income fall below the income test cut-out point for that person for the fortnight in question. For those earning above the cut-out points in a given fortnight, credits may not be accessed but will be "preserved" for up to

        Newstart Allowance was introduced in July 1991 with the objective of assisting the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed and those with labour market disadvantages, to return to paid employment and so reduce their dependency on income support.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A requirement of Newstart's implementation was that an interim evaluation report be presented in the 1993-94 Budget context. The report indicated that Newstart has produced some impressive results, including 1.7 million job referrals, over 430,000 placements on labour market programs and 320,000 job placements. As part of the interim evaluation, a post implementation review was conducted. In general, the review found that both staff and clients see Newstart as an improvement on the old arrangements, but officers of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service felt that the positive aspects could be better used.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The measures to be implemented progressively from September 1993 to September 1994, will reinforce the key objective of the Newstart strategy, namely, to help those on social security payments to maintain their job search efforts and move into jobs. In summary, those measures will:

        The implementation of some of these measures requires legislation and the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 provides the first step in doing this.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 provides for the introduction from 1 January 1994 of a $200 Education Entry Payment for Newstart Allowance clients and Job Search Allowance clients under 18 who have been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as unemployed for at least 12 months and who enrol in a full-time course of education that is an approved course under the AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY schemes. The payment will assist with the up-front costs of taking up study, such as enrolment fees, purchasing books, student union fees and course fees.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some people, such as those who have lived or worked overseas, may be entitled to income support from another country. Presently, it is not a general requirement for the grant or continued payment of an Australian pension that people claim or pursue their entitlement from another country, even from countries with which Australia has social security agreements based on shared responsibility. From 20 March 1994, if the Secretary to the Department of Social Security thinks a person or their partner would be entitled to a payment from a specified country, it will be necessary for the person or their partner to take reasonable steps to obtain the maximum payment from that country.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The overall result will be a reduced dependence on Australian social security pensions when payments are also available from specified countries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is concerned to ensure that the debt recovery provisions set out in the Social Security Act 1991 operate not only efficiently and effectively but with fairness. With those objectives in mind, the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will amend the Social Security Act 1991 from 1 January 1994 to implement a number of initiatives announced in the 1993 Budget relating to debt recovery.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently, Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance and Sickness Allowance clients are paid according to the number of days for which they are entitled to payment. If a client does not tell the Department they have started work or received income, any calculation of overpayment begins from the day after this `notifiable event' occurred. Amendments will provide for the calculation of the overpayment to start on the day the notifiable event occurs, rather than the day after and will bring the treatment of overpayments into line with the payment of arrears.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Dual payments, for example, where a client obtains a replacement cheque (on the basis that the original cheque has not been received) but subsequently obtains value for not only the replacement cheque but also the original, will be recoverable in the same way as many other debts, for example, from continuing payments or by garnishee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The recovery of debts arising from fraudulent negotiation of cheques by a third party will be streamlined  by allowing recovery using existing powers under the Social Security Act 1991. This will avoid the need for costly civil action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Social Security Act 1991 generally excludes dual entitlement to social security income support and other government income support payments such as compensation and service pension. However, unless a client commits a breach of a provision of the Act or misrepresents their situation, a debt arises only where there are dual social security payments or concurrent payments of a social security payment and a service pension. Amendments will extend the debt recovery provisions to allow recovery of all payments covered by multiple entitlement exclusion provisions, such as AUSTUDY and war widows pensions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present, fraudulently obtained payments can only be recovered from the Department of Social Security client who actually received them unless another Departmental client agrees to recovery from their own payment. The Department of Social Security has been criticised by the Courts in a number of casesâ€”specifically, for not taking action against partners who were knowingly involved in payments being fraudulently obtained by Department of Social Security clients.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments will allow a debt to be recovered from another person, usually a partner, where that person has benefited from and been knowingly involved in the fraudulent obtaining of monies by the Department of Social Security client, provided that the involvement of the other person has first been established through criminal proceedings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill provides for a number of measures concerning the treatment of compensation payments for social security purposes. They are intended, generally, to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing provisions. One of the more significant measures will be to bring within the provisions, lump sum compensation payments whether or not they contain an economic loss component. A great majority of lump sum compensation payments contain economic loss amounts. Those payments are, and will continue to be, covered by the compensation provisions. The so-called 50% rule will remain whereby half the total lump sum will continue to be disregarded for social security entitlement purposes. It is clear, however, that compensation settlements are being entered into such that they avoid, or attempt to avoid, the compensation provisions. The Government has acted and will continue to act to ensure that people who receive compensation payments use them for their support, at least for a reasonable period of time, before calling on the taxpayer funded social security system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another important change is to use a new divisor within the statutory formula that deals with the treatment of lump sums. The employees (all persons) Average Weekly Earnings figure is to replace the "all male" figure. The all persons figure is more likely to reflect the level of ordinary wages in the occupational classifications most likely to sustain work related injuries and recognises the fact of women's participation in the workforce and the incidence of motor vehicle accidents across the general population.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another change will limit the exemption from the provisions dealing with personal sickness and accident insurance policies. Some of these policies pay policy holders an amount less an amount of income support received from the Department of Social Security in the period covered by the policy. It is not acceptable that insurance companies should be able to shift part of their costs in this way onto the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also, among other things, standardises the treatment of wife pensioners in compensation cases, clarifies the `event' that might give rise to the entitlement to compensation and tackles certain cost-shifting type provisions in State and Territory legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Rent assistance waiting periods were abolished from March 1992 for nearly all eligible clients. However, at present, young people under 18 who have lodged a claim and are qualified for the homeless or independent rates of Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance must serve a waiting period of 18 weeks before rent assistance is payable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to abolish the 18 week waiting period for this latter group from 20 March 1994. This measure will make it easier for these young people to access secure accommodation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has decided that from 1 January 1994 all secondary school students born after 31 December 1977, apart from those students who attract AUSTUDY paid at the independent or away from home rate or who are homeless, will instead remain within the social security system until they turn 17. Most students will become eligible to attract Family Payment at the new rate that will apply from 1 January 1994 of $123.90 a fortnight for their care giver. Those secondary school students who are homeless will be eligible for Special Benefit. On their 17th birthday, secondary school students will be able to claim AUSTUDY. This Bill gives effect to that decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Department of Social Security issues millions of statutory notices each year to various groups of clients. Most of the notices require clients to notify certain relevant changes to their circumstances and an overpayment results if a client fails to do so. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the SSAT) has indicated what it regards as potential technical deficiencies in the Department's notices with the result that the SSAT has found against the Department in many overpayment cases on the grounds that the notices are deficient. Given that the cost implications for the Commonwealth are significant, probably in excess of $50 million per year, it is proposed that prompt legislative action be taken to resolve this problem.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments contained in the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 make it clear that a notice will not be invalid merely because it may fail to specify the manner in which a person must comply with it or because it does not describe itself as a `recipient notification notice' or `recipient statement notice'.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to protecting the revenue, these amendments are important as a matter of equity. Many people responded to these notices and gave the Department information that brought about a reduction in their social security payments. Others ignored the notices and failed to notify the Department of named events or changes in circumstances. It would be unfair to those who did comply with the notices to relieve others from the consequences of their failure to notify.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since 1991, the powers of the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to waive a debt have been guided by Ministerial Direction in two successive disallowable instruments tabled in and allowed by the Parliament. Only very recently, the Federal Court decided in Riddell v Secretary to the Department of Social Security to set aside the 1991 Ministerial Direction on the grounds that it was invalid and indicated that it would do the same to the 1992 Direction if it came before the Court. This has left decision makers and Tribunals with no guidelines on how to decide if a debt may be waived and, potentially, has significant cost implications for the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill addresses these problems by amending the Social Security Act 1991 to include the grounds for waiver in the Act itself. One of the grounds in the Act will be more generous than previously. Waiver of a debt will occur where the debt arises solely because of administrative error of the Commonwealth and the money was received in good faith. Previously, it was also necessary that recovery would cause financial hardship before waiver could occur. On the other hand, there will now be no general power to waive because of special circumstances. The circumstances listed in the Bill provide a code for making waiver decisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 provides for data-matching between specified agencies so as to detect where two inconsistent payments are made to a person by the same or more than one agency, to detect where inconsistent income data is held about one person by two or more agencies and to detect possible tax evasion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Ideas for changes or improvements to the Act are constantly being made as a result of the unusually large number of agencies with a direct interest in the Act and the level of scrutiny given by parliamentarians and others. As a result, the Act has been amended on several occasions since its enactment in 1990. The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 makes further changes to the Act to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data-matching by, among other things, permitting tax file numbers to be used by assistance agencies in discussions with the Australian Taxation Office when following up discrepancies, better clarifying certain definitions and the source of authority for payments of Commonwealth assistance and correcting some minor oversights. However, the most significant change will be to repeal the sunset provision in the Act so as to permit the data-matching program to continue beyond 22 January 1994.

         The purpose of this bill is to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 (the ESOS Act) to strengthen the protection afforded international students' pre-paid fees. The need for this was highlighted by the closure of the Australian Business College in Perth in February 1993. This closure and the absence of money from the special account meant that about 350 overseas students in Australia and up to 100 still off-shore lost moneys totalling up to $2.2 million. Because of the special circumstances of the closure, this loss was made good by a special Commonwealth appropriation.

        Another major amendment will introduce prison penalties for current monetary penalties for certain breaches of the act. This follows from advice from authorities investigating the closure of the Australian Business College in Perth that penalties needed to be stiffened. Increasing the penalties to imprisonment allows the court to impose a monetary penalty in addition to, or instead of, the term of imprisonment in accordance with the formula provided in the Crimes Act 1914.

        Additional amendments include: Allowing more flexibility in rolling back the financial regulation sections of the Act in favour of equivalent state and territory arrangements: Providing a sanction when a suspended provider ignores the act's requirement that it not recruit new overseas students: Changing the definition of an `overseas student' so that it clearly excludes those studying on a visitor's visa.

         â€”This place has been puzzling this afternoon, I must say. Firstly, for weeks the government has been saying to us that we are delaying its tax measures and it brings the wine tax bill in here today and then wants to adjourn it. It even went to a division to have it adjourned rather than debated and disposed of in this place. The way this government carries on its business is very puzzling.

         Secondly, we find a government in such shambles this morning that it could not even raise its numbers on a vote so critical as a vote on these tax bills. It is interesting and fortuitous in some ways that it was on this particular issue that the government failed to rustle up the numbers because this issue was the test band which the government acknowledged was likely to be unconstitutional. Yet it wants the parliament to deal with something that is probably in an invalid form and wrong in principle. It deserved to lose the vote that it lost immediately before lunch.

         Anyway, the government has now said that it erred in its counting or in rustling its people and has sought leave to put my request to the vote again. We will grant leave, firstly, because we are a generous lot and, secondly, because we know that if we do not, it will go back to the House of Representatives and then come back here and that simply wastes time. It is this side of the chamber that is seeking to deal expeditiously with the government's taxation program, not the other side.

         The other interesting thing is that when this vote is put this time we will be able to find out what the Greens do. Do the Greens agree that the government should bring to the parliament a bill which the government acknowledges is probably in an unconstitutional form in order that there might be a High Court test? Who will pay for that High Court test? Why is that necessary when it is so easy for the government to put this bill in a clearly unambiguously constitutional form? This amendment requests the government to split the bill into two parts so that the constitutional ambiguity is removed and so there can be no doubt. Is it not reasonable to expect that of the government? I would have thought so. If the Greens are going to vote against it, I would like to hear their explanation for doing that.

         This morning, as honourable senators may be aware, there were some distractions involving the Speaker in the other place. The meeting did not take place. The pairing arrangement was not formally put in place by the staff members concerned as a consequence of the meeting not going ahead. The President, quite frankly, was five seconds away from the chamber and could have come in here but he believed he was paired and it was inappropriate for him to do so. That is how the mistake arose. It is just one of those things that happens from time to time in the best managed governments and in the best managed oppositions.

I agree and that is why I am voting for the opposition's motion to split the bill. There will be a lot of time and a lot of expense wasted with the High Court action that will inevitably follow if this bill is not split. As I indicated earlier, who will be paying for that? It will be the taxpayers of Australia. It will not come out of Senator Evans's pocket; it will come out of the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia at a time when I believe that the government is very interested in a deficit reduction strategy.

       <para>
        This request, which has been circulated in my name, omits section 11(E)(3) from column 1 of the table. Section 11(E)(3) of the Excise Tariff Act refers to fuel oil, heating oil, lighting kerosene and power kerosene. Those are the only fuels that the act refers to. In effect, this amendment is requesting the House of Representatives to defeat the provision of this legislation that provides for a 1c increase in excise on those fuels in February of next year and a 1c increase in August of next year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The measure I am proposing substantially affects bunkering oil, which is required for ships. There has already been a 3c increase since budget night. The increase of 1c in February of next year will represent an increase of 12 per cent in the excise tax on bunker oil and the other oils I mentioned. The increase of 1c in August of next year will represent a further 11 per cent increase in that tax. I am suggesting to the committee that that is absolutely beyond the pale.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         From memory the current tax on those fuels is 5.44c per litre. Since budget night a 3c increase has been imposed and it is proposed that there will be two 1c increases next year. That is a 5c increase in total. That represents a 92 per cent increase on those fuels that I mentioned.

         One might ask about the increase on the other fuels. Presumably, that will be a matter that will be debated when we come to the next bill. From memory that increase of 5c will represent something like a nine per cent increase in total. The minister will correct me if I am wrong.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There is an argument that if one is going along the path of a long-term deficit reduction strategy, one should not impose an unfair taxation burden on certain types of fuels. In my view, under those circumstances a special case can be advanced for the fuels I have mentionedâ€”bunkering fuel, heating oil, lighting kerosene and power kerosene.

         The package of Greens (WA) amendments demands some measure of gain for the pain imposed. For this reason we are attaching three conditions to the bill. The government has said that by making the tax conditional it can achieve real reductions in the lead levels found in petrol. These amendments put this commitment in writing. They use the government's timetable of achieving the goals by 1995. The government at least has to show that it has had an honest try. It also says that the government should work out a timetable to phase out leaded petrol completely.

         The second condition says that the government should set emission efficiency and safety standards on new vehicles at a level as high as those set elsewhere. Under the proposed amendments, it has until 1995 to do so. The third condition is that the government should set up moderately funded programs designed to implement the recommendations of its own ecologically sustainable development transport policy study by 1995. These include a range of measures designed to reduce the need for and use of private cars while increasing amenity and equity. This would be funded at the rate of 1c per litre. This in some way counteracts the scheduled reduction of funding for urban development and public transport of over $1.6 billion over the next four years. In addition, the amendments would exempt freight, shipping and rail from the increases, and these will be mentioned later.

         The current levels of lead in petrol are controlled by state law. Maximum lead levels vary between 0.30 grams per litre and 0.84 grams per litre. Lead levels vary to match the standards. Internationally, many European nations set their levels at 1.5 grams per litre.

The USEPA did a study with industry that was fully justified and the result was that lead levels could be reduced from 1.1 grams per litre to 0.1 grams per litre at a cost of 0.16c a litre, although this may not include constant octane requirements.

         The petrol industry in Australia has given a non-justified costing of 2c a litre to drop lead to 0.15 grams per litre, whilst retaining the octane level. There was a round table discussion between industry, the Federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, and the states on 29 July, in which it was recommended that New South Wales and Victoria go to 0.2 grams per litre in 1994 and that other states go to 0.3, with all states setting a limit of 0.2 by 1995. Industry would be allowed to drop the octane level by one unit, making the  change  virtually  value  neutral.

         This was the result the amendment requires. Currently, however, the Commonwealth has no direct powers over lead levels. It remains up to the states to implement the recommendations. The Commonwealth does have persuasive and coercive powers and potential powers for the proposed national EPA. Due to the uncertainty, the amendment will allow evidence that the government has genuinely consistently used its powers to try to attain those goals accepted by both houses in the event that it fails to attain the results. In many respects, the current problem is a result of the fact that cars using leaded petrol are not old; they are pre-1986. In the USA, legislation prohibited lead petrol engines from 1974. This means that its old polluting car fleet is 20, rather than eight, years old.

         The initial legislation in the USA was not about lead. It was about emission standards. Lead poisons catalytic converters, so it was banned.

         In terms of the full package that we are suggesting, in relation to ecologically sustainable cities, the government conducted a major policy study running up to the Earth Summit in 1992. It was called the ecologically sustainable development policy study. It was one of the most expensive policy exercises done in this country with extensive consultation between government, industry and the environment movement and with opportunities for public and academic input over a long period. It was supposed to set the framework for Australian policy into the next century, to set the direction the country would go. The transport working group set forward a number of recommendations after over a year of intensive effort. I therefore urge the chamber to support these requests for amendments to this bill.

Nobody, at least on this side, is opposed to pursuing ecologically sustainable cities. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) has put a lot of his time and effort, intellectually and physically, into moving in that direction.

I realise the request is trying to come to grips with that difficult question, but that is where the inherent flaw in that part of the amendment lies. It seems to me that seeking to ensure that both houses of parliament acknowledge that the government has put all the pressure on the state governments to pass the necessary legislation is a very strange legislative mechanism.

         â€”I want to make two points. The first is that it seems to me quite a legitimate approach from the Greens to the extent that the government did dress up this measure as an environmental move when in actual fact that was not its primary objective at all; it was a tax raising revenue measure, a revenue raiser. When an analysis was done immediately after the budget, even the government had to back away from its claim that it was principally environmental. If we are going to differentiate further between the fuels, leaded or unleaded, one way we can do it in an environmentally sound way is to reduce the tax on the unleaded. But the government was not going to do that. It wanted to gain further revenue.

         That leads me to the second point I wanted to make, and that is that it was a revenue raising measure that was particularly going to hurt the less well-off in our community. It is this aspect, this regressivity in the budget, a Labor government attacking those whom it would claim to be primarily its own people, the lower income earners in our society, that so astonished so many Australians and that has contributed to that enormous slump in the opinion polls away from Labor. The one thing the so-called true believers did not expect was this government, immediately upon being re-electedâ€”re-elected on lies, I might sayâ€”thanking the true believers and then coming in and attacking them with this budget.

As my colleague Senator Watson said, regrettably we have some concerns with the detail of this proposal. We do not agree with the leverage, which is really the design; it is a legitimate political measure for the Greens to promote. We do not believe that it is a legitimate leverage in terms of, in particular, what is in the best interests of the poor. Therefore, we are not prepared to support it on this occasion.

We have sought to go down a somewhat different road, and that is to seek to encourage the government to provide a non-lead alternative to leaded fuels.

They need to be informed that their make and model of car can make that transition without any change. There are additional sums for the assay of blood lead levels in the community and the development of standards. Also, very importantly, a small amountâ€”half a million dollars 1993-94 and 1994-95â€”will be provided for an investigation of other devices which are claimed to be suitable for cars otherwise requiring either higher octane or leaded fuel.

The Government seems to be very mindful that any hitches in the use of the new fuel may reflect on the Government and for this reason also it should seek to adopt a proven standard as quickly as possible.

We are very concerned, as are I am sure all other honourable senators in this chamber, about the enormous price differential between petrol for country people and city people. We understand that the government is carrying out an investigation into why these differences exist. Once the results of those inquiries are complete, we would urge the government to seek to pass legislation such that country people do not pay any more than city people for petrol.

Last night she at least acknowledged that the only reason they could negotiate and get any of the deals that they managed to gain from the government was that the opposition took a stance that enabled the Greens to have a base to negotiate from. Had we not taken that stance, there would have been no room for either Senator Chamarette or Senator Margetts to negotiate with the government over the various issues; there would not have been anywhere near enough votes. I am very pleased we were able to give Senator Chamarette that opportunity.

The women in our society will suffer most. If the Greens look at the last publication of the Australian Automobile Association, they will see that it concludes that the increase in the costs of motoring hurt women more than men. I would have thought that was something that the Greens would have been very conscious of.

It has only become an issue because of people like Senators Chamarette, Margetts and Coulter, who, because of the stand that the coalition has taken in opposing these taxes, have been able to use that as a springboard to negotiate whatever they think is best for their own particular causes.

Virtually the whole of the North West Shelf has been discovered in the past 20 years. Twenty years only takes us back to 1973. That was the year of the big fuel price hike because we were scared throughout the world that we were going to run out of hydrocarbons. That was the reason that world parity pricing came in at the time. I think Doug Anthony flagged it at the time in the double dissolution of 1974. It was a pity that he flagged it before the dissolution because the coalition lost that election and then the Labor government brought parity pricing in anyhow.

         I have listened to Senator Coulter over the years, and especially over the past few days, talking about the grain alcohol technology that he says Australia should be using instead of the present hydrocarbon fuels that we are using. But that technology has been around since about 1942. It was developed during the last war to try to make up for the fuel shortage in Australia. To my knowledge it was revived in the 1960s and in about 1973 when we suffered a supposed petroleum shortage in the world. In fact, I can remember corresponding with a crowd of grain growers in the United States at length to find out whether we could do it.

         The answer was that we could make our own fuel alcohol, but the cost was virtually twice what we were already paying. What is more, its performance was not so great, but I was prepared to put up with that. However, what turned me off it was the rate at which one could make the product per day. After importing a still or whatever they call it from the United States, we would be burning three times the amount we could make even if we ran the plant 24 hoursâ€”and it is quite easy to run a plant for 24 hours.

If the Western Australian Greens think the same, I suggest to them that they look into this technology. I can give them my records and my correspondence from about 1976. In fact, I was going to go to the United States then to have a look at the technology to gain a better understanding of it. An unfortunate situation happened in the family and I put off going, so I never got there. I have kept in contact with the technology, and I think Senator Coulter is playing with the fairies at the bottom of the garden if he expects too much of it.

         Let it go on the record once again that if the government had been up front with its election promises, if it had indicated during the election period that it would impose a substantial excise on fuel, it would not be in government today. That is why people say time and again that this government lied its way into office. It did, and there is no question of that. I suspect that when Senator McMullan gets up to reply he will not answer that question because it cannot be answered. Senator McMullan did not go around in the four or five weeks of the election campaign and say, `Yes, here is the taxation agenda of the Labor Party. We are going to put up fuel excises and raise a massive amount of money'. So one of the issues the Australian Democrats have to address is whether they will keep the government honest.

         In the first instance, the proposition of an extra 2c levy by this government under the guise of an environmental measure, a health measureâ€”that is, to encourage people to move from leaded petrol to another way of propelling themselves around the countrysideâ€”was immediately transparent. It was put forward not for that reason at all but rather as a revenue raising effort, which Senator Margetts and Senator Coulter identified. In fact, the instant it was proposed the Democrats identified that as being inequitable. The people who are driving such vehicles that apparently need to use leaded petrol would have had the choice of modifying their vehicle at great cost, selling a devalued car at a great loss, or meeting the extra imposition. That was the question we immediately addressed.

The path which is outlined through, first of all, the substitution of gasoholâ€”10 per cent alcohol in petrolâ€”for lead moves us in the right direction. It is recognised by other nations. In terms of the technology, eight to nine per cent of all the fuel being consumed in the US todayâ€”far more than the total consumption of Australiaâ€”is alcohol-petrol mixes. There is no problem with the technology. We need to establish it in this country, we have the opportunity to do so, and the package to which the government has fortunately agreedâ€”and I thank it very much for thatâ€”moves us in that highly desirable direction.

         The other point is an economic point in relation to that: if we cannot match United States standards, we will never be ready for export of this particular productâ€”that is, engines and car manufactureâ€”which is supposedly one of the kinds of things that government is expecting. If we are prepared to allow industry to hide behind inadequate processes and standards simply because we do not have the political will to expect and demand better from it, then it is up to the government to look very carefully at its real desire for industry to export.

         Interestingly enough, I have heard about costs but nobodyâ€”apart from the Democrats, whom I thank for their words of supportâ€”is prepared to talk about the benefits accruing to such policies. They are obviously health benefits and environmental benefits, but they are also economic benefits associated with an integrated package of reduced car use and reduced lead production. The social cost of lead poisoning obviously is well known, which is why we are talking about this in such a public way.

But here we have the possibility for both employment creation and benefits to the community which will bring other benefits and cut down costs in the future.

However, I point out to him that those who are experimenting with the diesohol mixâ€”that is, 15 per cent alcohol in dieselâ€”which, interestingly, is now being trialled in Sweden under Australian patents, found that the Australian diesel was so poor in quality that even in a very low concentration it could not be used to mix with the alcohol for export to Sweden. The experimenters had to import diesel from Sweden, mix it with the alcohol and then re-export it to Sweden. In our diesel we have very high levels of sulphur and also of polycyclic hydrocarbons, which are carcinogenic.

         â€”The government, with minimum notice, reintroduced measures to impose a sales tax on wine; with even less notice, adjourned debate at the second reading stage; and, with even less notice still, brought on the debate again. I think this gives some indication of the lack of order and preparedness in the government's presentation of its bills this afternoon. The imposts in these new bills are at a lower rate than the original 1993 budget imposts on the wine industry which ranged up to an increase of 55 per cent. In other words, the government has now structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matters beyond constitutional challenge. I only wish that it had adopted such a responsible attitude earlier today with the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2).

         There is a significant contradiction in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner). The government has been at pains to point outâ€”and the minister points out in his second reading speechâ€”that the government does not accept that any of the bills in this package impose tax. This has been a central thrust of what the government has been all about in terms of its presentation of the constitutional debate. However, within a few lines of the second reading speech, that statement is contradicted. It is amazing. The speech states:

        And it goes on. So here in the government's second reading speech is an inherent contradiction of its own argument throughout the whole of this constitutional debate. We are seeing an internal inconsistency, a contradiction; one wonders really whether the government understands what it is legislating for. There is a great deal of confusion.

         A 31 per cent rate of tax on alcoholic wines will apply between budget night and the end of October, but from the end of October there will be a decrease in the rate of tax to 22 per cent, which will operate for only eight months. How much wine will be sold between today and 1 November? Who is going to pay a rate of 31 per cent when in the next month they will pay the rate of 22 per centâ€”a clear difference of nine percentage points?

         But it does not stop there. From 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995 the rate will increase to 24 per cent and from 1995 onwards it will increase to 26 per cent. This government is trying to get most of its tax imposts introduced early to overcome debate closer to the next election. Today we are seeing part of a package which increases indirect taxes to pay for the income tax cuts. In other words, income tax cuts are being subsidised and financed as a result of increased indirect taxes.

         Had it not been for the stance taken by the Liberal and National party coalition, Australia would have had the highest taxes on wine anywhere in the world. The wine industry has to thank the Liberal and National party coalition for its stand on this. There have been significant reductions and they have been welcomed. From our perspective, the government promised no tax increases in this area, and it broke that election promise. In breaking that promise, at the same time it adopted thuggery and blackmail and tried to intimidate the industry. It tried to divide the industry between the small producers and the large producers. It was rather pathetic because the tactics employed actually did split the industry and they created divisions and concerns.

         The government's blackmail was to threaten to impose an excise proposal. An excise proposal is an increase in tax at a time when it does not have to have legislative support through this parliament. What would that do to the wine industry? It would decimate its sales because one would never know when the legislation would come in and get knocked off. This was the dilemma faced by the industry. It could not afford such a hiatus, and it buckled. It is not surprising because a lot of the wine producers were facing bankruptcy, peril and division amongst their colleagues. This is a terrible state of affairs.

         This division is typical of the Keating administration. We have seen it in Mabo, in the tax bills and in the thuggery of the negotiations and the blackmail that takes place. No wonder the industry is bitter and frustrated. We should remember that it was faced with that 55 per cent increaseâ€”a terrific impost. I only hope that the Greens and others will be able to produce a similar percentage reduction when we come to the excise duties. In that case people are facing not a 55 per cent increase but a 92 per cent increase in tax. This tax will severely impact on our export performance.

         Indirect tax hikes of this magnitude are anathema to the Australian people and Australian business. We are really seeing a GST without the benefits to industry of the GST rebates. This government is imposing costs and making industry uncompetitive. I put it to the Senate that the Liberal and National party coalition will continue to oppose these increases if for no other reason than that we cannot endorse the sorts of tactics employed by the Labor Party in getting its alleged mandate on the books. It will not receive anywhere near its budget level of revenue. It will have a win but at great cost to the Australian community and at great cost to its own revenue.

         â€”As we are hoping to get this package of bills through tonight, I will keep my remarks as brief as possible. I found it very interesting listening to Senator Watson when he said that he acknowledges the damage that all of this is doing to the industry and the damage it has done to the industry. It is estimated that lost sales have amounted to $75 million. I certainly agree that the Labor Party embarked on a whole series of actions that can best be described as holding not one but two guns to the head of the industry. There was the threat, as has already been outlined, of an excise proposal, and there was also the threat of people stopping buying wine, which is what the community has been doing. So there was a financial impost that the wine industry found unbearable.

         Therefore, I have to ask the Liberals why they want to prolong this matter. Why does the opposition end up in a position where it is totally out in the cold? If we do not support this package, as objectionable as we find the government's actions in terms of the means by which it was arrived at, we will be stretching out this agony for month after month. All the government will do is let this bill ricochet off to the House of Representatives where it will probably sit around. It does not have to bring it back for three months if it is defeated. Then we are looking at February.

         The busiest period for the wine industry is coming up shortly, with Christmas. Indeed, it makes about one-third of its sales between now and 25 December. It is extremely urgent that we give this industry some respite. So it is beyond me to understand why the Liberals continue to pursue this agenda. It was through their opposition that the industry was able to get into a position where there could be some resolution. But now there is some resolution across the entire industry, bar perhaps four per cent of its work force. I am not talking about just the winemakers, who have been united from the start, but also the grape growers, who have consulted amongst their industry and brought that section almost on board, and the retail sales people, who perhaps at the moment are the most desperate to get this package through because they are the ones whose pockets are being hit immediately. The winemakers are being hit particularly with cellar door sales, and as yet the grape growers do not really understand the financial impost of what has been going on over the last couple of months.

         I would like to suggest to members of the Liberal Party that now they are basically just acting as spoilers. They have lost this debate. Therefore, they are in a situation of digging themselves into a larger and larger hole by opposing this package which, I stress again, has been agreed to by the industryâ€”an industry which, I suggest, is probably more united than it ever has been before. That is saying something about an industry that has already achieved an enormous amount without any government interference and without any direct government assistance.

         The one positive thing that has come out of all of this is that an industry plan will now be developed. If we look to the old saying that `every cloud has a silver lining', the silver lining in this, as well as the fact that we now have an industry that is united across its various sections, is that we will have an industry plan that will hopefully put in place something that the industry will be proud to work towards and which the government will accept and not try to tamper with again by any impost, be it tax or any other alterations.

         The reason we must pass this package is so that sales can start again. Most of the wine that has not been sold over the last few weeks will not be sold. Consumers will not now go out and buy and drink the wine that they have not drunk over the past weeks. If they did, the whole country would end up legless. But planning can begin. The wine catalogues for Christmas are sitting there simply waiting for the prices to be put on them before they are sent out. Planting can resume. In the several areas in South Australia where it was stopped, the various processes involved with arranging those plantings will now go ahead.

         I cannot leave my remarks tonight without commenting on the activities of the Labor Party. I believe it had absolutely no idea of what its impost would do to this industry. The previous debates on the original bill showed that it had done no planning. Indeed, I cannot understand why the government has criticised us for listening to the wine industry, because it has no better source of information. Hopefully, after we have had this inquiry, all of us from all parties will be able to see where the wine industry is going, what support it needs and, hopefully, what interference it does not need in order to succeed.

         The government could not challenge industry claims because it simply had no better source of information. As we went through the previous debate, it seemed that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) did not really know anything of the plan to increase the sales tax on wine until it was all decided, signed, sealed and printed. I believe the government stands condemned for what it has done to the Australian wine industry. Hopefully, it has now learnt some lessons about process and about how one goes about developing an industry policy.

         The claims that have been made about the industry being forced to negotiate are quite true. I certainly do not condone the methods which the government used. But that does not mean that we now work around, or try to walk away from, the only means of getting this industry back on its feet. I urge the Liberals to think again, to stop this mindless opposition for the sake of opposing, and to look at what they are doing to one of Australia's most successful industries.

Many of those issues still have not been resolved. However, what has finally come through is a message, but not from all these people.

        There is really no other rational choice than to proceed with the recent Winemakers Federation of Australia's agreement with the Treasurer. No matter what transpires, the Treasurer will get increased taxation either as the wholesale tax, or an ad valorem excise. The industry cannot "win".

        Is this the kind of negotiation and regional development strategy that this government wants? I am disgusted and so is the industry. It is not a win. It is a lose-lose situation. I hope that all those who were involved in this kind of dreadful exercise are ashamed of themselves.

         We reluctantly support the package. It has some benefits for some sectors. It does not fully address the problems of the industry. However, we have asked the government to make sure that the inquiry that is part of the package is not just for show. As such, I believe that the government will be announcing, as part of the minister's speech, the agreement that it has reached with the Greens in relation to the minimum requirement that we believe is necessary for a regional based study of the impacts of this kind of government policy on the wine industry.

Some people are still asking us to hold out on this legislation.

         â€”I can sympathise somewhat with Senator Margetts because when one considers the plight that this industry has been put in by the efforts of the government over the past two months, one can understand that when it comes down to a situation of blackmailing and bludgeoning the industry some people in the wine industry have found themselves in a desperate situation. I understood the concerns of Mr Croser and the people who belong to the Winemakers Federation when this government first came up with a 31 per cent sales tax on wine. I can understand the industry reaction and I can understand the grape growers reaction. I think the coalition was quite right to announce immediately that we would be opposing this tax. We have consistently opposed this legislation, and we will continue to oppose extra imposts on wine.

         The fact that we announced that we were going to oppose this legislation gave other people the opportunity to start negotiating.

         I can understand that over that period of two monthsâ€”and we all know about the drop in sales and the difficulties the industry was going throughâ€”something had to give. The way the government treated matters was that the people who were going to give first were the big wine makers who had the most to lose through their sales and who were in the strongest position to negotiate. We have a government that is prepared to negotiate with the big wine makers and big wine sellers but it is prepared to forget about the small grape grower and small wine producers so that it can raise revenue.

When it comes to the crunch the people who will suffer the most, as always, will be the people at the grape growing end and at the primary production end. Those groups will be squeezed in the same way that any other primary producer in any other industry in Australia will be squeezed. Eventually they have to bear the brunt of any taxes or extra imposts that are placed on the industry. The wine makers, particularly the large wine makers, are in a situation where the government can put the squeeze on them. It is the grape growers who will be most effected because they cannot do anything about the prices that they receive for the commodity they produce. The wine makers will be the ones who will eventually decide what price they will pay for that commodity. If they feel they have to squeeze the grape growers, then they will squeeze them.

We know he will vote against it eventually. In South Australia we are particularly concerned because something like 60 per cent of the grapes that are crushed are crushed in South Australia. We are particularly concerned because it is a major industry in South Australia. It is a major industry that is doing well in South Australia. When there is a state that is in the economic situation that South Australia is in and an extra impost is going to be placed on the one industry that looks like it is succeeding and doing well, we find that the economy of South Australia is going to suffer even more greatly than it is at present.

         The other thing the government said in this budget was how this budget was all about jobs. I have read this over and over again and we heard again yesterday that this budget is about jobs. How on earth there is ever going to be any increase in jobs in the wine industry while there is an increase in costs and an increase in tax on the wine industry I am at a loss to understand. It will take this industry some time to recover from the impact this proposal will have on it.

          In conclusion I say that the way the government has handled this whole deal over the past two months, the way that it has blackmailed the industry, the way that it has been heavy handed with the industry and, in particular, with the big wine makers in order to get what it wants from those who it knows can afford to pay, is unacceptable. Some of the big wine makers have admitted that they can afford to pay. It is only the people at the lower end of the scale who are going to suffer. They are the ones that I am particularly concerned about. I am concerned about the Riverland of South Australia where we already have one of the lowest incomes per capita in Australia and struggling grape growers as well as struggling fruit growers. In the Clare Valley and the Barossa Valley many people are suffering because that area has among the lowest income per capita in Australia. The wine industry is undeserving of the extra imposts that will be placed on it. From the start we have been consistent in our opposition to it.

         I thank the chamber for its support of the measure. I indicate that an amendment to give effect to the outstanding element of the package will be introduced into the House of Representatives next week in the context of a tax measure. In broad terms, it means that the capital cost of establishing grapevines in Australia for use in a business of primary production is to be evenly deductible over four years. The deductions will be available once a vine is planted in the land and they will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993.

Will this concessionâ€”the write-off over four yearsâ€”also be applied in a similar fashion to orchardists and berry growers? The acknowledgment of this four year write-off will have implications in terms of fairness and equity so far as other industries are concerned. I certainly welcome the initiative. Can the minister signal whether the government will follow this initiative in terms of equity and fairness with other growers, particularly in the orchard area, where apples, pears and berry fruits are grown?

         â€”I feel that some comments ought to be made in relation to this matter before it is finally put to rest one way or other. A good deal has been said about the ramifications of a tax for the wine industry. I will not go over that in detail. I want to concentrate on the position of the Western Australian winegrowers. Initially the position taken by the winegrowers in the west was that they were totally opposed to the proposal of an 11 per cent increase in wine tax. More recently, there have been press reports that the Western Australian winegrowers gave in and agreed with the proposal as put forward by the government today. I wish to advise the Senate that that is not the case.

         In the last week or so it was put to the Western Australian winegrowers that they should accept the deal struck by the federation with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). They had no input, no warning. In fact, to my knowledge the only community meeting which has ever been held on this point in the country was held in the south west of Western Australia, at Margaret River, last Sunday. A meeting of more than 100 people, involving community people as well as winegrowers, passed a motion in the following terms:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Margaret River/Swan Valley, Pemberton members of Great Southern wine communities are philosophically opposed to any increase in wholesale sales tax on wine. However, in the interests of industry stability we are prepared to accept an increase to 22 per cent from 1 November 1993 or at an earlier date if agreed by parliament, provided that an industry inquiry is instituted. No further wholesale sales tax increases are to be implemented without the approval of parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        That says that because of pressure brought to bear on them and the threat that it would destabilise the industry, they gave in to an increase to 22 per cent only. They did not agree to subsequent increases of two per cent for each year for the next three years. Nor did they agree to any retrospective ratification of an increase to 31 per cent since 17 August this year, when the budget was brought in.

         From the dealings I have had with the growers thereâ€”and I have spoken to the president and a number of other people who were at that meeting in Margaret River last Sundayâ€”I know that they would welcome an inquiry, but they feel that to increase taxes over the next three years prior to any inquiry or the result of any inquiry is prejudicial, to say the least, and is prejudging the issue in the extreme. In fact, honourable senators will note that in their motion they stated that there should be no further wholesale sales tax increase without the approval of parliament. They have all said to me that they welcome an inquiry. They have no problems with that. They have nothing to hide. But they all stressed to me that they had been coerced into this position. The law of contract states that duress or fraud can void a contract. In this case they had a good deal of duress. They had the threat from the Treasurer saying, `I will impose an excise on you if you do not agree.'

As well as that, there was the package under this heads of agreement, which I understood some winegrowers in Western Australia saw for the first time last Sunday, despite it having been negotiated over a period of time. That package, which does not form part of this bill but which forms the backdrop to the negotiations to bring it in, holds some inducement to the larger winegrowers because it provides for a capital write-off for acquisition of vines and vineyards.

         If you are a large winegrower, that is a great incentive. Large winegrowers simply want to get bigger. It gives them an opportunity to acquire smaller vineyards. A letter was faxed to me from one of the larger vineyards. It is dated 6 November 1992, from Petaluma Ltd to its investors, and signed by Brian Croser. One sentence in it says:

Western Australia is in an unusual situation because it has so many small winegrowers. I am not criticising the large winegrowers because they want to acquire further vineyards and expand their production. That is natural; it is in the course of things. But I query whether this package is designed to protect the smaller winegrowers or whether it has been designed to induce the larger winegrowers to participate in this package and to bring their fellow winegrowers, the smaller ones, around to agreeing to this package.

         I address my comments to the press. I say to them, `Your reports that the Western Australian winegrowers gave in to this package are wrong. You should get your facts right and go back to the drawing board'. What I say to the people who say that the Western Australian winegrowers agree with this package is that they are absolutely wrong. The motion that I have read grudgingly concedes the two per cent increase and freely acknowledges `let us have an inquiry' but it does not go along with a package, or the heads of agreement that was entered into by the federation and the Treasurer. In fact, that motion was passed 98 to 2. All the small winegrowers backed it because they did not see that they had any choice.

        A report which was commissioned by the state government of Western Australia concluded with the following remarks:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By increasing the wine tax, growth in the wine industry will be lower. This will set back an industry which is increasingly generating exports and which is a major source of regional rather than centralised growth in Western Australia and Australia. Western Australian wineries which are smaller than those in the eastern states will be particularly vulnerable to reduction in revenue resulting from the tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the Senate that whether it be two per cent or 11 per cent, it does not matter. Any increase in the tax on these small wine growers will be disastrous. In fact, as one small winegrower put to me, a bottle of wine has $2 tax on it but a cask of wine has 22c tax on it. It is the larger wine producers who produce the casks of wine. The small wine growers that I am talking about in the south-west of Australia produce bottled wine. Therefore, they suffer an already disproportionate rate of tax compared with cask wine.

         The record needs to be set straight. This was a very grubby deal which was put together. Anybody who says that the coalition is being obstructionist needs to look at themselves before they accuse us of being obstructionist in this matter. If others want to go along with grubby deals whereby small wine growers are coerced into agreeing, and if they want to go along with a threat to blackmail them and bring in an excise, let it be on their own heads. For the coalition's part, we see this as a corrupt political exercise whereby the small business men and women have been caught in a vice.

         I might say, these people are out of the ordinary because they do a lot more for the community than the average business does. In fact, at that meeting in Margaret River there were people like the refrigeration fellow who supplied the refrigeration on the vineyards and people from the tourist industry. In 1991, in the south-west region of Western Australia $84 million was spent by tourists on overnight stays. They went there mainly because of the vineyards and the pleasant environment that these wine growers have helped to create.

The considerations which apply to them are different from those applying to the larger winegrowers. The coalition opposes this tax on well considered grounds which we have maintained consistently throughout the debate.

It was put to me, `Enough is enough. We've achieved what people wanted'. At one stage I was nearly satisfied that we had. I thought, `Yes, perhaps that's it. We should go along with this proposal'.

        As I said, I will run through them briefly. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Watson for some of this detail. The first seeks to omit proposed subsection 6AAA(4) from pages 5 and 6 of the schedule. This proposed subsection provides that, where indexation will take effect, the increase in excise duty for petroleum products with a lead content greater than 13 milligrams per litre will be the product of the rate that last applied to those goods and the rate of indexation as published by the statistician plus the amount specified in table 1 in subsection 6AAA(4) of the bill. That would be removed.

         The second is to omit from page 6 of the schedule proposed subsection 6AAA(5). This subsection provides that, where indexation will not take effect, the increase in excise duty for petroleum products with a lead content greater than 13 milligrams per litre will be the sum of the rate that last applied to those goods and the amount specified in table 1 of subsection 6AAA(4) of the bill.

I think that subsection has already been amended by Senator Harradine's amendment earlier which was to take out item 11(E)(2) from that schedule. As that has already been taken out, I think my amendment can remain in the form that we had earlier contemplated. If surprisingly we get the numbers, the balance of the provisions will be taken out. I think that is the correct interpretation. Certainly that is the advice that I have been given.

         I commend those amendments to the Senate. As I said, they have the effect of removing substantially the increases that the government unwisely seeks to impose on the Australian public. Those increases will substantially add to business costs, detrimentally affect employment and also, as I said in an earlier debate, they will particularly affect the less well off in our communityâ€”the regressive part, again, of this budget. This Labor government does not seem to be particularly concerned if, through its tax changes, it hurts most the poor within our community through its tax changes. This is the chance for the Senate to get rid of these increases. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

I find the figure rather interesting because the American studies have shown that 0.018 grams per litre or 18 milligrams per litre is sufficient to protect engines.

         It seems passing strange that this level is just below that level. It seems to meâ€”and perhaps I am rather suspiciousâ€”that the government is well aware of the level to which it could go down and is using it in relation to defining what is leaded and what is unleaded petrol. The government has consistently for the past 20 years not been prepared to very substantially reduce the level of lead in petrol, which it could have done and as many other nations have done.

At the same time I point out that as part of the government's amendments we not only have had an increase on budget night but a further increase on 1 February 1994, and a further increase six months later in August 1994. In addition to that, these prices will also be enhanced by an inflation factor. I think this is important. Effectively, this government has introduced a GST without the benefits of a GST through the excise mechanism. I think it is to be deplored.

I am particularly thinking of road transport. I am thinking of all those small Australian haulage companies that work, I think, in one of the hardest fields. For small business people, they are forced to outlay large capital sums. They work incredible hours. They scrape by in my experience, if they get by at all, and they really need every opportunity to make a living.

In many cases, as my friend Senator Panizza would confirm, there is no choice but to use road haulage for the purpose of getting product to market or goods and services out to farms and to regional areas. I hope that, on reflection, the committee will recognise that also and will vote down the increase in that area.

Perhaps the Greens are under the misapprehension that, by loading up costs on road, more freight will move to rail.

         Of goods transported in Australia, 70 per cent is carried by road. A lot of the time the same goods are carried more than once, perhaps three times. Seventy per cent of the goods transported must go by road; they cannot go any other way. What is more, 70 per cent of goods transported in Australia are transported less than 70 kilometres.

So if they want to stay in businessâ€”road transport has to go aheadâ€”they will have to hand the costs on to consumers. So it is the consumers at one end and the producers at the other end who will have to pay for it. So their profit margin come down and more people lose their jobs.

         â€”I would like to ask a question of Senator Panizza. If one takes a 10-tonne truck, which uses about 25 litres of fuel to go that 100 kilometres, my estimation is that the increase would mean the trip would cost an additional 75c. Dividing 10,000 kilograms by 75c makes it very hard to make up $3 on a trolley load of food. The figures do not stack up. Would Senator Panizza justify his figures a little further?

         â€”A better accountant than I did that calculation of $3 per shopping trolley. That is well documented. I know that the average truck operator, buying in bulk, would pay in the vicinity of 54c a litre. An additional 2c is a one twenty-seventh increase which, to me, without going into finer detail, is roughly a four per cent increase in the cost of fuel. That is a sizeable increase that has to be passed on.

         â€”I will be brief, but there is just one issue that I wish to raise tonight. In question time today, I asked the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, a question regarding the tragic crash of the RAAF Boeing 707 aircraft and subsequent actions taken by the air force to notify pilots of the potential dangers of double asymmetric training. I asked this question because of my concern that there appears to be a misconception that only 707 aircraft are involved in the double asymmetric training when, in fact, Hercules and Orion aircraft also perform this procedure.

         In his answer to my question, Senator Ray said that the RAAF will upgrade its Boeing 707 flight simulator and that tenders will be called next year. No mention was made of upgrading the Hercules and the Orion simulators and, on contacting Senator Ray's office this afternoon, it was confirmed that the Minister's answer only related to the 707 aircraft. However, I believe that, despite what Senator Ray said earlier today, Hercules and Orion aircraft regularly carry out double asymmetric training. As with the 707 simulator, neither the Hercules nor the Orion simulators are capable of simulating the conditions necessary for double asymmetric training.

         Being from South Australia, I am particularly concerned about this situation as it affects Orion pilots based at the Edinburgh air force base in Adelaide. I certainly do not pretend to be an expert on this topic. However, I am informed that double asymmetric training forms a necessary part of training in emergency procedures for aircraft such as the Orion.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I stated in my question to the minister, Orions regularly fly with one engine shut down to conserve fuel. This is because Orions in their surveillance work cover large distances often over oceans. Naturally, Orions are often flying low and at low speeds. With one engine deliberately shut down, there only needs to be one unplanned engine failure on the same wing for the pilot to need to recall the double asymmetric training.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not want to make this sound overly dramatic but, firstly, if a second engine on the same wing does shut down, perhaps due to a bird strike or something similar, the normal procedure is to relight the other engineâ€”the one that had been deliberately shut down. Secondly, as we have learned from the Boeing 707 crash, as long as the aircraft does not go below the minimum control speed, there is no reason why it cannot be flown safely. However, for the plane to be flown safely under such circumstances, obviously, the pilot must be familiar with the emergency procedures and the limits of the aircraftâ€”the most important limit being the minimum control speed.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Without wishing to play down the importance of this issue to 707 and Hercules aircraft, I think it is important to point out that Orion aircraft regularly fly low over water and land and at low speed; they fly long hours over vast distances; and, most importantly, they regularly operate with one engine deliberately shut down. Because of this, it stands to reason that Orions are the aircraft that are most likely to have two engines fail on one wing while they are flying at a low speed.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition to that, Australia has 19 Orions which would cost over $100 million each to replace; we also have 24 Hercules worth tens of millions of dollars each. By contrast, I believe we only have five Boeing 707s worth about $8 million each. Orions also have the largest crew of these three aircraft usually carrying 15 flight crew on board plus any passengers; yet there seems to be some doubt that the Orion simulator will also be updated.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If the RAAF is to improve the standard of double asymmetric training, the same standard must apply across the air force. Otherwise, how can the RAAF justify to Orion pilots that their need for a simulator is less than that of the 707 pilots? What would happen if, several years down the track, an Orion pilot who was prevented from taking part in double asymmetric training, accidentally and through lack of knowledge and practice, let a plane go below its minimum control speed and crashed, killing those on board? When the RAAF is sued by wives of 15 flight crew, how will it justify Boeing 707 pilots being able to practise double asymmetric training in a simulator but Orion pilots not being able toâ€”and, worse than that, the Orion pilot not having known what to do because he or maybe she had never been allowed to do the training in the air?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These are very serious questions and, if I have understood Senator Ray's answer to my question correctly, I believe the outcome is most unsatisfactory and I am sure that Orion pilots will be justifiably very angry. To bring the RAAF in line with current practices, both in the military and civilian world, Hercules and Orion simulators must also be upgraded without delay. This will lead to a reduction in the need, or maybe the elimination of the need, for RAAF flight crew to undertake double asymmetric training in the air.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the meantime, while the simulators are being updated, the Minister for Defence and the RAAF hierarchy should ensure that all pilotsâ€”particularly Boeing 707, Orion and Hercules pilotsâ€”are formally notified of the chain of events which led to the tragic crash of the Boeing 707 in 1991. To this extent, I welcome Senator Ray's comments that written and video material is currently being prepared. But I would point out that it has been two whole years since the 707 crash and, as at yet, air force pilots, including those involved in double asymmetric training, have not received formal written advice as to the probable cause of the crash.  This begs the
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        question: what if another crash similar to that had occurred during this period or what if one happened tomorrow?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I acknowledge Senator Ray's comments about the risks of double asymmetric training. But I think this only strengthens the arguments that, firstly, pilots are properly trained in this procedure, which the Boeing crash vividly demonstrates; and, secondly, as acknowledged by overseas Defence Forces and international airlines, it is preferable to practise this procedure in a simulator.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In conclusion, while I welcome Senator Ray's statement that tenders will be called for a level 5 simulator for the 707 aircraft, I believe this is only the beginning of the process. There is no doubt that Australia lags behind international standards on double asymmetric training and, until they are all upgraded, the risk of a similar incident is not diminished.

        ATSIC Offices in Western Australia do not have data in a readily accessible format to directly answer this question. When ATSIC was commenced in  1990, there was a need to merge data systems previously used by the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. This led to problems in developing a new uniform system within ATSIC, which has created difficulties in extracting and aggregating data in the form requested.

        Furthermore, the total allocation of funds to living area development via States Grants and grants through State Agencies requires input from those sources.

        Data currently on hand in ATSIC is aggregated by Communities. In some cases funds listed include development costs for both the major community and a related living area excision, without separation. This is particularly so where there is a great deal of interaction between the main community and a living area excision. To separate this data would require ATSIC to devote a considerable amount of time and resources, which the Commission believes would be inappropriate given the impending introduction of a data base for Aboriginal land areas in W.A.

        (1) The new support arrangements for Woomera and Nurrungar were introduced in response to a Government directive that the Defence Commercial Support Program (CSP) would be implemented in the Woomera township. CSP is a Government initiative aimed at maximising the value for Commonwealth money spent on providing support services to Defence activities. In-House Options, such as that prepared by the Defence Support Centre Woomera, have been encouraged to allow Commonwealth employees to use their expertise to compete against commercial tenderers for CSP work. Encouraging In-House Options also broadens the range of options available to decision makers when awarding this work.

        (b) The support contracts at Woomera were awarded using established CSP procedures. Under these procedures, a Source Selection Team studied the various commercial and In-House Options and made a recommendation to the appropriate Department of Defence delegate, the Deputy Secretary, Strategy and Intelligence (DEPSEC S&amp;I). The Woomera Source Selection Team did not include a representative of the Defence Support Centre Woomera so as to ensure no conflict of interest issues arose. The Source Selection Team did, however, seek expert technical assistance from DSCW employees when required.

        (2) The DSCW submitted its partially successful Preferred In-House Option in accordance with established CSP principles. As stated in (1) above, these principles encourage In-House Options so that Commonwealth employees can use their expertise to compete against commercial tenders for CSP work. In-House Options also broaden the range of options available to decision makers when awarding this work. The Source Selection process under which this work is allocated is designed to minimise the potential for conflicts of interest by separating the decision-making process from the formulation of In-House Options. This was the case at Woomera.

        (7) Food irradiation is used to preserve food. Depending upon the dose administered, the effect can range from pest disinfestation, through elimination of storage organisms, akin to pasteurisation, to industrial sterility. Irradiation can destroy micro organisms present in food but it cannot destroy odours, taste or the off-appearance of spoiled food. The process cannot therefore be used to restore or enhance the appeal of foods which have deteriorated beyond saleable condition.

        In my press release of 31 August 1993, I released the results of a distributional analysis which incorporated as large a number of 1993-94 Budget measures as possible (including the modification of the personal income tax rebate that was announced on 30 August 1993). The analysis was conducted by the Treasury using the Price, Revenue and Incidence Simulation Model, PRISMOD. The press release, which should be read in conjunction with the model's results, provides a description of the type of Budget measures included in the distributional analysis, the operation of the PRISMOD model and caveats on the interpretation of its results. Importantly, the PRISMOD analysis is based on households, not individuals, so that in any one household there may be one or more income earners claiming the $150 rebate.

        Table 2 of the press release shows estimates of percentage changes in real disposal income of 14 household types by income quintile of the budget measures modelled by PRISMOD. As discussed in paragraphs 10 to 14 of Attachment A to the press release, changes in real disposable income are likely to be a more useful guide to the impact on households than net cash gains shown in Table 1 of the press release, because the former avoid the use of implied saving ratios in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Household Expenditure Survey.

       the basis of the 1993-94 Budget measures modelled by PRISMOD, real disposable income will increase on average by less than one per cent in a majority of the 14 household types and income groups shown in the table, while for the remaining household types and income groups, there is a small loss in real disposable income of less than 0.15 per cent. The result for families in the lowest income quintile group is in line with the overall result for all households and income types, with real disposable income increasing on average by less than one per cent in almost all of the 14 household types in this income quintile.
