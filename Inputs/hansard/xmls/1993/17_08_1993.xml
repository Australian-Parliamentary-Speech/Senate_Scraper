I know that is something of a minority view, but I am sure it will be confirmed by your performance in this high office. I guess it had better be confirmed because there are, conceivably, one or two hot breaths breathing down the neck if it is not.

He showed particular interest in this House, serving on House committees.

You have seen him work in that regard through joint house committees and other such formal and informal bodies. With that strong background, I am pleased that the Senate has elected Senator Crichton-Browne to this office today. We on this side of the chamber wish him well.

The President, of course, is also a strong supporter of this institution and, with both of those honourable senators there at the helm, I think this will be very much appreciated by the people of Australia who regard this chamber as a necessary chamber of review and Senator Crichton-Browne's work as Chairman of Committees will be very vital to the exercise of that function by members of parliament.

Senator Colston's work in this chamber—he came here at the same time as I did, in 1975—has been exceptional. He has been able to manage this chamber in circumstances in which another person may well have foundered. He has allowed discussion and debate to take place. One has always known when it was time to cut because Senator Colston used to just prop, and that was it, one could not possibly get past it. It was very instructive. I only saw him do it once to me and I did not press it any further on any other occasion.

        It is incredible that members of the House of Representatives today have the opportunity to question ministers, yet in this place the government has failed to provide us with an opportunity for question time. All I can get from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) as to why this is so is that today is a day of ceremony. Today is not just a day of ceremony. We have just had many senators giving notices of motion; petitions have been presented in this place; we are about to have the tabling of documents. This is a day of ceremony but it is also a normal day of business. We should be entitled today, on the first day back here, to ask ministers the question that we wish to ask.

         This will be a test—the first test of this sitting—for the Australian Democrats and the Greens. If they are here to help keep this government honest, they will want to question and probe this government now at the first opportunity, and they will vote with us to suspend standing orders in order that we may be able to do so. If the Democrats and the Greens say, `No, we are too busy having afternoon tea' or whatever and are uninterested in this matter, unwilling to come in here and take the opportunity to question the government, they will do what we suspect they will do; that is, vote with the government and not take up this opportunity. We give notice by this action today that we intend to take every opportunity to probe and question this incompetent government. Our first opportunity is now, and that is why I have moved this motion. The government may well say, `But we have our minds on the budget and you will simply want to ask budget questions'. That is not correct. There are so many other issues before the Australian people that we want to probe and question. For example, there is the inaction of the federal government in relation to the Mabo decision—the total incompetence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his unwillingness to draw the state premiers together in a way which would seek a constructive resolution of the very major difficulties that come out of that High Court decision. Why are we not being permitted today to question the government in relation to its handling of the Mabo issue?

Notices of motion were given in relation to Senator Schacht's incredible intervention in the workings of the CSIRO.

He should know perfectly well—and he does know because I have told him—that it has been absolutely standard practice in this place, whoever has been in government, for as long as I can remember and certainly for as far back as I have checked, which is to 1976, not to have a question time on the first day back for a new Senate when a Senate is being sworn in and when a new President and Deputy President are being elected.

         For a party which goes on at such nauseous length about history, tradition, norms, forms, standards, procedures and conventions in this place, it is the height of rank hypocrisy for Senator Hill to come in here and seek to tear up those conventions and practices as they have evolved over many years. They have evolved for very good reason. We have 11 new senators in this place, 10 of whom were newly sworn in today. They are here with their families and they want the opportunity to behave in a way that is appropriate without the kind of exercise that Senator Hill wants us to engage in.

         Let me make very clear for the record that this has been the practice. If one looks back at what the practice has been every election year going back to 1976, one will find that there was no question time on the first day back in these situations in 1990, 1987 or 1981—and I will fill in the gap in a moment—and nor was there in 1978 or 1976.

         Equally, there was no question time in 1985 because the election for the new Senate had taken place back in the latter part of 1984 and budget time in 1985 was in fact the first day back for the new Senate. It was dealt with in that way following that particular election. That has been the practice, the history and the tradition for the very good practical reason that I have already described. As I have already said publicly, this is in the dim hope that there will be some improvement in Senate standards in future and that Senator Hill will find more credible grounds for his attempt at procedural disruptions.

But I can tell the Democrats that 80 per cent of the people out there in Australia are most dissatisfied with the government. They want to know what the government intends to do on so many issues, such as on the unemployment issue. One million people out there are unable to get a job. Hundreds of thousands of kids are bottled up in tertiary education, on pretend jobs, and they want to get a real genuine job.

This is just pathetic grandstanding from people who are destroyers not builders—the people who have decided that there is nothing left for them in Australian politics other than to be negative.

         It is quite clear that the opposition is not even going to make any pretence of aiming for a workable Senate or a workable chamber. In fact, those opposite are not even interested any more in worrying about what mischief they might put in place in the unlikely event that they ever win government. They are into spiteful, vindictive, self-serving actions to do nothing more than disrupt the government. The opposition is trying to punish the Australian people for re-electing the Labor government. That is all it wants to do. The opposition will never ever come to terms with its comprehensive rejection by the Australian people at the polls. Those opposite were done like dinners.

         —Mr President, this motion is for the suspension of standing orders. I would have thought that the government would have realised that if it did not agree with the suggestion that we should have a question time, half an hour would be taken up in this chamber debating the suspension of standing orders so that we could have a question time. I do not know when the government was given advice of this, but I suggest that it would have been reasonable for the government to have agreed with that. This afternoon we were not going to resume until 3.30; but we resumed at 3.15. The government would have only lost a quarter of an hour—and what is a quarter of an hour between friends and people who need an idea that this parliament is being run properly? If only a quarter of an hour is involved, I do not see that it is a disruptive measure, but now it has become slightly disruptive because of the intransigence of the government in refusing to accede to the request for a question time.

         I think a question time is necessary today. Why should it be necessary? Because I believe that we are in crisis in this country today. That crisis was highlighted after we received Senator Faulkner's letter outlining what the procedures were going to be here. That was last Thursday, 12 August, when the unemployment figures came out showing continuous record unemployment levels; a loss in one month of 37,000 full-time jobs; and that every Australian losing a job now, on average, will be unemployed for 58 weeks—and in Tasmania 80 weeks. If that is not a crisis, I do not know what is.

         I would have liked the opportunity to ask questions about certain things of the minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I believe that many people in this country, many ordinary people in the community, do not believe that we are in a recession; they believe that we are in a painful transition to a situation of continuous drops in the standard of living, with a permanent underclass of unemployed and underemployed.

         I have raised question after question about the need for the government to look at the paid work force, and to see who is in the paid work force who wants to come out of it and who has better reason to come out of it. Thousands of people in the 50 to 60 age group, where there now are many unemployed, want to retire but cannot because they would be faced with an unacceptable loss in their standard of living. Why force those people to stay in the paid work force when there are so many outside wanting to get in there and take those jobs? Again, there are thousands of mothers with young dependent children who, if they were given true freedom of choice, would want to come out of the paid work force but cannot because one-income families are discriminated against and will be discriminated against in respect of the home child care allowance.

Those remarks together should be enough to show the Australian Democrats that there are important matters to discuss. I can tell Senator Kernot that the line, `We can do it tomorrow; manana, manana' simply is not good enough. The crisis is here today. Tomorrow, everyone in this place will want to question the government about tonight's budget. Today is the time to ask the government about things prior to that budget—the lies that it told at the election; the divisive nature of the Mabo debate; and the whole structure of the work force and the crisis that it finds itself in and that people who want a job find themselves in. These are all legitimate matters for an opposition to want to raise—for a parliament to want to raise to check on the executive. Some of those on the back bench opposite also have this job, poorly though they perform it when they are here.

         Senator Evans offers the debate that this side of the chamber has—as I think he referred to it—some sort of nauseous support for history and tradition. Let us turn to the other side of that debate. It is people on that side of the chamber, like Senator Gareth Evans, who want to chuck that out all the time. They say, `Let's do what is appropriate now; let's not worry ourselves with the past'. I would have thought that even Senator Gareth Evans could see the crisis that this country is in, and what is appropriate for now is for us to have a question time.

We do not let used car salesmen make the misrepresentations that those opposite were a party to.

Two or three times she had to stand up and say, `I don't know what you're talking about'. Senator Schacht, who was unkindly referred to by one of my colleagues the other day as `Schacht the clot' for the messing up that he has done in CSIRO—I do not make that reference, of course—should be here to answer for that. What about old Collins over there—the bellicose bullyboy of the chamber? He should be here to answer, too.

         That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Friday 30 July 1993, of the Honourable Sir Condor Louis Laucke, KCMG, member of the House of Assembly of South Australia from 1956 to 1965, Senator for the State of South Australia from 1967/to 1981, President of the Senate from 1976 to 1981 and Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia from 1982 to 1992, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

         In 1967 Sir Condor entered federal parliament as senator for South Australia. His time in the Senate was characterised by his good humour and unfailing courtesy toward his colleagues on both sides of the chamber. It was these qualities that led to his election as President of the Senate in 1976 and he filled this position with distinction until his retirement in 1981. He was universally well regarded and praised for his honesty, his sense of fair play and his personal charm.

         Sir Condor Laucke was President of the Senate during my first three years in this place, and I personally remember him very well and very affectionately. He insisted, of course, as those on the other side still would if they had the chance, on wearing his full regalia of lace jabot, cuffs and ruffles and full bottomed wig, which made him look, as can be seen from his portrait in the Members' Hall, rather like a rakish, elderly gentleman in a Restoration comedy. He obviously thought I was a bit of a wild young man, particularly in my attitudes to the Senate, but he seemed to nurture the hope that I would grow more moderately and gracefully disposed towards the institution as I grew older in it. I am sorry to have disappointed him.

Sir Condor Laucke had a long and distinguished career in South Australia state and federal politics. With his election as the secretary of the Greenock branch of the Liberal and Country League at the young age of 19, Sir Condor embarked on what was to become a lifetime involvement in politics. His background in business and primary production made him a great asset to the South Australian Liberal Party and he served his state electorate of the Barossa well from 1956 to 1965.

         Sir Condor made a successful transition from state to federal politics when he entered the Senate in 1967 as a Liberal senator for South Australia. His nine years of hard work and his intrinsic integrity and decency were formally recognised by his parliamentary peers when he was elected President of the Senate in 1976. Sir Condor served five fruitful years in the office of President. One of his greatest achievements was his success in restoring peace and order to a place where turmoil had previously raged. Describing himself as a progressive conservative, Sir Condor was an ardent advocate for the pre-eminence of the Westminster system and parliamentary convention.

         In 1981, after 48 years' commitment to politics, Sir Condor resigned his Senate position. However, he found himself unable to settle down to his family flour business, sheep farming and rose growing pursuits that would more than adequately occupy most retirees. Unable to curtail his extraordinary drive and energy, these retirement activities were promptly abandoned when he was summoned back into public life to take up the position of lieutenant-governor for South Australia.

I never knew Sir Condor Laucke; he was only a name to me.

He was quite clearly a gentleman in every sense of the word. He was spoken of repeatedly, both in the pages of

         of December 1978, which I think shed a very interesting light on another aspect of Sir Condor's character, was the occasion on which he was notified that a knighthood would be bestowed upon him. Evidently, according to this account, headed `A tear, some wine, then off yabbying', he went down into the cellar of his house, broke out a bottle of `78 Bundawunda—the name of his home—Rhine riesling, drank that and went off with his two grandchildren to catch yabbies in the local dam.

When I heard of his death I was very sad and also very sad that I could not attend his funeral in South Australia. I had to attend a meeting of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards.

         Condor was a very charming person with very shrewd political gifts. Senator Boswell mentioned that he brought peace to this chamber after a period of some difficulty and disruption, and he did. He did it in a very fine and nice way; those of us who were here know what I mean. He was always polite and courteous to his staff or to anybody with whom he came in contact. His Christian charity and his generosity were legend. I recall very clearly one occasion when this came to the fore. After my first wife died I was taking six of the children through South Australia and wanted to go through the Barossa Valley. I rang Condor up and he said, `Rose has put on the cakes' and my children and I had a wonderful time.

Sir Condor has been described as a popular political and business figure in South Australia. Anyone who knew him would very much ascribe the word `popular' to him. He had a distinguished service in this place, in the state parliament and as Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia; and, of course, he was quite prominent in business in South Australia, particularly in the Barossa Valley.

         Condor was very much an old style gentleman. He believed very much in God, Queen and country, and he was very sincere about it. In that context, it is strange for someone with my politics to claim that he was someone with whom I had a personal relationship. Sir Condor was very much a man of the people, and it is in that context that I first came across him. I must state that at the time that I met him I would not have been over the age of 10 or 11. Condor was then a state member of parliament in South Australia. At the same time he was still running his flour mill in Greenock. Through that flour mill he had a very close relationship with a couple of bakers at the continental bakery in Adelaide who were very close to my father.

         Through them, a friendship developed, very much because of the culture and laws of the time. We had 6 o'clock closing at that time. Dad had a shop next to the Cumberland Arms Hotel where, after the pub had closed, people would drop in for a drink before they went home. Condor would escape from the state parliament and come and meet with the Platis brothers and have a drink in the shop. On a number of occasions I thought to myself that his usefulness in parliament would not have been all that great, having spent a few hours in the greengrocer's shop having a quiet drink amongst friends. Condor would come quite frequently and spend time and talk with people who were very much not part of the Liberal party in that state, not part of the Barossa Valley society and not part of the business community, but people with whom he felt a very strong affinity.

         On a number of occasions I would go into the shop late at night, after having allegedly finished homework, to see that not only had they had a few beers but also that they had managed to knock off most of the vegetables, having got drunk after a few drinks. The sort of character that Sir Condor had, allowed him to interact quite freely with people—spend a lot of time with them and pay a lot of attention to them—and to enjoy himself in doing so.

         I attended the funeral and memorial service. The church was packed. Many current senators, especially from South Australia, and former senators were present. Mr President, you were very much with us, as were former presidents McClelland and O'Byrne. I noted some of Condor's immediate peers—Gordon Davidson, Sir Harold Young, Don Jessop and Peter Ray.

         When I attended the funeral I was struck by the authentic Lutheran service—the reading of scripture and, as the words of the service said, the consolation of the Christian in seeing death as an entry to a continuing life in paradise. The singing by a choir of Barossa residents, especially from the town of Tanunda, was a very moving part of the service. The eulogy given by the former Governor of South Australia, Sir Donald Dunstan, summed up all our thoughts admirably. He was our Governor in South Australia for about nine years. In all that time, Sir Condor was his deputy as the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia.

         The first occasion on which I met Sir Condor was at his own home when I was 21 and attending his daughter's 21st birthday. Rosemary was amongst a set of friends from her mid-teenage years until now. I was delighted to go to the family home. At that time, Sir Condor had served 10 years as the member for Barossa in the state parliament. He moved on from there to be a federal senator for some 14 years and, of course, for the last five or six of those years, he was a very distinguished President of the Senate.

It was endearing that we came as a family when we came to the rooms of the President of the Senate. That graciousness, courtesy, cheerfulness and kindness was extended not only to colleagues such as me—a South Australian, a Liberal—but also, I believe, to all of us in the Senate chamber. Senator Gareth Evans, who is nodding in agreement, started on the same day as I did, and he and others have said that of Sir Condor as well.

         There are two incidents that I wish to recall briefly. The first occurred in my first month in the Senate when I had to make my first real political decision. I had to decide whether I would vote against a budget bill of the government. Those who are aware of my speech in September 1978 will note that I commended the Fraser government, of which I was a backbench member. I drew particular attention to one element of the budget of that year which I regarded as a mistake and a penalty upon the people of South Australia—not least, a penalty on the grape growers of the Barossa Valley. There was to be a massive increase in the brandy excise. As honourable senators know, brandy is made from grapes that are left over. Those grapes, which are sold for a low price, can be used for the production of straight alcohol.

         Although the grape growers of South Australia were suffering, my government was going to impose a bigger tax on brandy, which would have meant that less brandy would have been sold and stocks would have grown. I had gone through the econometric models. It was demonstrated to me overwhelming that this decision would be counterproductive to the tax collection revenue plans of the Fraser Government. I believed this so strongly.

         Sir Condor, our colleagues and I made up a special delegation to the Prime Minister. This was the first time I had ever visited a Prime Minister's office. At that time—not now—Malcolm Fraser was a forbidding, tall, quiet, difficult Prime Minister for a young back bencher to face. Because I was fired up and they had heard my arguments, my colleagues asked me and put the case, which I did, I thought, clearly and logically. There was no response. After there had been some other discussions, the Prime Minister said, `This is an integral part of the budget. The budget is whole and it is, rightly or wrongly, to be supported'. We left.

         I then had to contemplate whether, in my first months as a senator—and following my remarks in my first speech, which I thought were very appropriate, about the 99 that were safe and the one that was endangered—I would cross the floor on the brandy bill. My good friend Sir Condor took me aside and said, `Baden, you have done everything that can be expected of a senator. You have argued the case. You have talked about it with your colleagues. You have put it to the government. It is unreasonable to expect that you would need to demonstrate your case by crossing the floor and voting against your colleagues'. I took the weight of that advice very much into account when I did not vote against the budget measure.

As I said, there was a convincing case not to support this measure. With every personal courtesy, Sir Condor gave to me a wiser political perspective.

Illustrative of this was one occasion when they were representing Australia in the Republic of South Korea.

All of the other Korean guests said what a person this person from South Australia must be if she can so change the normal style of such a serious man. It was of no surprise to me to hear such excellent reports of the way in which Lady Rose, by her ordinary conversation and her direct cheerfulness, made a very human and totally successful evening of such a visit in which her husband was representing Australia.

Indeed, one of my many memories which stand out was when Condor accompanied me the first time I made a public speech as an endorsed Liberal candidate.

         Over a long period Sir Condor demonstrated his strength as a successful businessman and politician representing South Australia. He was born in 1914, and having been educated at Immanuel College and the School of Mines in Adelaide, he returned to his beloved Greenock in the Barossa Valley to join the flour and feed milling business which his father had bought in 1899. He later became managing director of that business and successfully extended its operation to various parts of South Australia before turning his hand to parliamentary politics. This followed many years as an office bearer in the Liberal Party in South Australia.

         He won the seat of Barossa in the House of Assembly in the South Australian Parliament in 1956 serving three terms there, a total of nine years, until his defeat in 1965. Barossa was originally a rural seat which, over the years during which Sir Condor represented it, gradually became subsumed into the metropolitan area by the growth of the suburbs to the north-east of Adelaide, this growing urbanisation completely changing the character of Barossa into a marginal metropolitan seat.

         Sir Condor's loss in 1965, which accompanied the first ever defeat of the long serving Playford LCL government in that state, was therefore no negative reflection on his own effort or ability. Indeed, on the contrary, between 1962 and 1965 he served as government whip and was regarded by many of his colleagues in the state parliament as a potential future leader of the South Australian Liberal parliamentary party, the LCL as it then was, and hence a future premier of South Australia. Sadly, his defeat in 1965 prevented that potential being realised.

He entered the Senate early, in November 1967, following the death of Senator Hannaford. In the Senate he served this chamber, the people of South Australia and the Liberal Party well, bringing his wide counsel to many deliberations. He was a shadow minister from 1972 to 1975 and then, as I have said, in February 1976 he was elected to the high office of President of this Senate. He performed the duties of President with great distinction until retiring in June 1981, being scrupulously fair and polite but nevertheless firm in his deliberations from the chair.

So it is no wonder that on the last Saturday night in June 1981 some 1,300 friends gathered in the enormous Tanunda show hall to pay tribute to Sir Condor on his retirement from the Senate.

To put it mildly, it was not a particularly good year for Labor. There were only six new faces from my party that year, two in the House of Representatives and four in the Senate.

         I mention this because it helps to explain why the government of that time had a majority in its own right. In that respect, Senator Laucke as President was probably fortunate. I deliberately use the word `probably' because the government was in no mood to have its legislative program frustrated, and I have no doubt that from time to time Senator Laucke was leaned on by the government leader in the Senate. I do not for one minute imply that Senator Laucke responded to such tactics but it would not have made his task particularly easy.

Despite that rocky start I often consulted him on matters of procedure and, irrespective of the fact that I was from a different party, he was courteous and helpful whenever I sought his assistance. In those days there were some rough and ready characters in the opposition and it was not unusual for a senator to be suspended. Senator Laucke would almost bend over backwards to have the offending senator apologise rather than be suspended and, when suspension did follow, he actually became upset when he was required to order a senator from the chamber. I would like to mention that I was here when Sir Condor Laucke was elected President in 1976. I can assure Senator Chapman that the newspaper report to which he referred was totally incorrect.

         The second incident which I would like to share occurred when there was a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate to choose a senator to represent the Australian Capital Territory following the death of Senator John Knight. It is history, of course, that the Senate appointed Senator Reid. Senator Laucke presided and the proceedings were telecast—an unusual occurrence in those days. Senator Laucke conducted the proceedings using a forthright delivery to fit the occasion. When the proceedings had concluded, he announced to members of both houses and to the public watching on television, `I now declare this joint sitting open'. After a perceptible pause, he corrected with, `closed'. I suppose that in our role as senators we are asked to open so many activities that his error was understandable.

I do not think I have ever seen a person with official duties to perform who was so meticulous about the quality, the standing and the correctness of those duties and how they were carried out.

He would ring them up after they had made a speech and make suggestions as to how they may or may not deal with a subject in future. It did not matter whether they were government or opposition; he would still treat them all the same.

         Sir Condor Laucke was the government whip in the South Australian parliament when my father entered state parliament in 1963. I still well remember my father's words after his being in parliament a short time. He came home and said, `Condor Laucke is a gentleman and a gentle man', and I think that he will be remembered by South Australians and certainly by his colleagues as both a gentleman and a gentle man. In 1965, when he lost his seat in state parliament, I remember my father coming home and saying, `Well, my boy, you haven't seen the last of Condor Laucke'. That proved to be a fact in later years when he sought preselection for the Senate, entered the Senate and then made a major contribution in this place both as a senator and later as the President of the Senate. His contributions were then recognised when he became Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia.

Above all, I think his greatest achievement was the way in which he was known and loved in his own Barossa Valley by his family and those he came in contact with closely. He was respected and put a tremendous amount of effort into the life of that valley, particularly the three major towns that are concerned; he will long be remembered in the Barossa Valley as one of their greatest sons.

My first impression of Condor Laucke was that he was a courteous gentleman, and that impression never changed. As a new senator I felt that he went out of his way to assist me. At the end of every session I usually received an invitation to his office to try out his new vintage, which he then distributed to all senators at our farewell function.

        Dame Marie was born in 1902—91 years ago—at St Kilda, Victoria, and educated at St Michael's Church of England Girls Grammar School. She was elected to federal parliament in 1961, although did not take her seat in this chamber until mid-1962. Her time in this place was but a small part of a career dedicated to welfare work for women and children.

         Her life in the public arena began in 1941 when she became, for a short, time the Mayoress of Brighton. From 1954 until 1958 she was President of the National Council of Women and for her outstanding work with this organisation was awarded the Order of the British Empire. Dame Marie will be remembered for her efforts during that time in gaining government subsidies for child care facilities. That is something that may be taken for granted today, but in the 1950s Dame Marie was certainly breaking very new ground indeed.

         Her maiden speech in this chamber reflected her great concern for the welfare of Australian families and left no doubt as to what she saw as her priorities: the standard of living of rural Australians, medical care for all Australians and the fight for the stability of family life. She was a member of numerous organisations such as: the Family Planning Association; the Victorian Family Council, of which she was President from 1958 to 1978; and, a little ahead of her time, the Australian-Asian Association of Victoria, of which she was also President from 1956 until 1974. These are but a handful of the organisations with which Dame Marie was involved in the course of her very long and very distinguished career. In 1979 she was made Dame of the British Empire for distinguished community service. On behalf of the government, I extend our sincere sympathy to her family in their bereavement.

It is indeed rare for a life to be dedicated to community service to the extent that Marie Breen was. She was born and bred in Melbourne and I understand that she lived there all her life. In 1941, when Mayoress of Brighton, Mrs Breen, as she then was, began a 36-year involvement with the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association. She represented the Baby Health Centres Association on the National Council of Women. Her involvement with the National Council of Women expanded to becoming honorary international secretary from 1948 to 1953 and later President from 1954 to 1958.

         In 1944 it was Mrs Breen's approach to the Victorian state health minister that led to an amendment to the Local Government Act enabling municipalities to employ home help assistance. While much of her work focused on the areas of women and children's health and welfare, Marie Breen was also champion of the importance of the family unit. Through her involvement with the mothers union of the Church of England from 1938, she came to be, from 1946 to 1960, convenor of the Church of England Marriage Guidance and Education Council. She helped to train the first marriage guidance counsellors and was herself a counsellor until she became a senator.

For two years in the early 1950s she was chairman of the federal executive of the Liberal Party. She was elected to the Senate in 1961, taking her place the following year.

She continued to serve the community in a multitude of ways, which included a stint as President of the Family Planning Association of Victoria from 1970 to 1971 and membership of the Housing Builders Registry Board from 1972 to 1979.

She always saw those women as being the primary focus of her work and as having first call on her time. In that she set an example to us all. Her death is a loss to Victoria and Australia. I extend my sympathy and that of my Democrat colleagues to her daughters, and to her family and friends.

I regret not having had the opportunity to meet Dame Marie, but the tributes paid by Mrs Jean Cheshire, Dame Phyllis Frost, Father Dan Conquest and the Reverend Lawrence Reeve at her funeral moved me greatly and reflected the deep regard and affection which she inspired from all who knew her. In recent days I have had the opportunity to speak to members of Dame Marie's family and learn more about the magnificent contribution that she made to this community—not only, of course, to the Liberal Party but to the wider community. I should mention that in the gallery this evening we are honoured with the presence of Dame Marie's daughter, Pru, and granddaughter, Virginia.

         Dame Marie Breen was a Liberal senator for six years, from 1962 to 1968. It is a great source of pride for the Liberal Party that it was in the forefront of endorsing women for parliament. In the early 1960s there were five women in the federal parliament, four of whom represented the Liberal Party. Dame Marie Breen was among that path-finding group of Liberal women, which included Senators Wedgwood, Buttfield and Rankin, who firmly established that women had an important role to play in the parliament of this nation.

         Perhaps inspired by Dame Marie Breen's magnificent community record, the Victorian Liberal Party approached her to stand for the Senate in 1961. In seeking women candidates, the Liberal Party was well in advance of community sentiment. Dame Marie Breen herself, in an interview she gave, summed up the prevailing community attitude in the following way:

        There is no doubt that Dame Marie Breen was a remarkable woman with great strength of character. From my conversations with those who knew her, a picture has emerged of a person with very strong personal values, and particularly the great Christian values of family, public service and community. In many ways, her life, which was dedicated to building and strengthening voluntary organisations, embodied one of the great traditions of the Liberal Party. I refer to the commitment to voluntary work as the basis for building a strong community.

        Dame Marie was born in 1902 and educated at St Michael's Church of England Girls Grammar School. Her earliest recollections, which were recorded in an interview conducted with her in 1983, foreshadow a life of service to others. She speaks `of being allowed to help in small ways' with the patriotic efforts pursued by her parents during World War I.

         In 1928, Dame Marie married Robert Breen, a solicitor. They were a devoted couple, and the marriage formed the focal point of Dame Marie's life for the next 40 years. They had three daughters, Jeannette, Prudence and Marie—two of whom followed their parents into the world of politics. Jeanette served in both local government and as a member for Brighton in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1976 to 1985. Prue was also active in local government while the youngest daughter, Marie, pursued an artistic life as a painter. It was Robert who introduced Marie to the world of politics, and both of them were founding members of the Liberal Party. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        —Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is delivering in another place his budget speech for 1993-94. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the government. Mr President, the greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work; too many have been out of work for too long. The primary objective of this budget is jobs—jobs in the short term by providing a further stimulus to the economy this year to sustain Australia's economic growth until the motor of the world recovery kicks in, and jobs in the medium and longer term by boosting the capacity of Australian business to expand production on a world competitive basis. This is a budget to strengthen the recovery and make it sustainable.

        Australia has had a number of economic recoveries in the post-war period only to see them taper off prematurely, but this recovery is different. It is different because firmly embedded into Australia's economic structure we now have two vital ingredients—inflation at levels lower than seen for 30 years and interest rates at their lowest in 20 years. These have been the twin goals of every government for a quarter of a century, but it is this government which has attained them, and harnessed them for the future benefit of all Australians. That makes this recovery different. This will be a quality recovery—a durable recovery.

        Mr President, this budget establishes an economic framework over four years; a framework for continuing low interest rates and continuing low inflation which, combined with reduced company tax and generous investment incentives, will support increased business investment for future growth in production and employment. This budget sets us on a prudent path leading to lower government deficits and higher national saving. This budget proposes measures which, overall, will cut the deficit four years from now by $9 billion. These steps will see the public sector directly contribute some $17 billion to the improvement of national saving over the three years to 1996-97.

        The budget also takes action on government programs put forward in the context of the last election. Well over 100 separate spending commitments will be implemented. These will be funded over the course of the next four years. These commitments give effect to the government's plans to provide extra help to families with children, extra assistance to those out of work, improved health services and other initiatives to make this society even fairer and more cohesive.

        The budget also provides relief for middle Australia by lowering marginal tax rates for those on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000. This will reduce the tax paid by a person on $600 per week by $8 per week. Not only will this promised tax cut be delivered, but also it will be delivered eight months early, commencing on 1 November 1993—just eleven weeks away. This early payment is largely made possible by higher dividends from businesses like Telecom and the Reserve Bank. It is only right that taxpayers should benefit from the higher earnings of these public bodies.

        The government has decided to go further with the tax cuts by extending the benefits to low income taxpayers. Those on incomes below $23,200 will receive a new rebate paid on assessment. This will relieve about 90,000 taxpayers of their entire tax bill and ensure that a tax cut of $100 or more is paid to all other taxpayers annually. The combined effects of the budget measures will result in a deficit of $16 billion this year. This will provide an extra stimulus of around $2 billion to Australia's economy at a time when a stimulus is needed to sustain the recovery.

        Australia's subdued recovery in part reflects the time taken to recover from the sapping effects of the debt build-up and falling asset prices of the late 1980s. Of more importance, though, is the continuing weakness of the world economy. Whereas a year ago growth in the industrialised economies was expected to be three per cent in 1993, it is now expected to be only a little over one per cent. Japan and Germany, the world's second and third largest economies, have yet to emerge from recession. Against that background Australia has done well and will continue to do so. Our GDP growth in 1992-93 was 2 1/2 per cent—a rate the envy of the industrialised world.

        Our relatively good performance can be attributed to two factors. First, the government's foresight in building up budget surpluses in the late 1980s, and then using that capacity to provide a major stimulus to the economy when it was required; and second, our growing trade and investment links with the fastest growing region of the world—the dynamic economies of Asia.

        Mr President, the short-term outlook for the world economy remains subdued and, therefore, places a constraint on our own growth. The world outlook, however, is expected to improve during 1994. Australia's challenge is to position itself to take full advantage of stronger world growth as it comes on stream and to continue our integration with the Asian economies. Above all, this requires the further development of world class industries able to seek out and exploit new opportunities. That assures the best long-term prospect of reducing unemployment and raising Australian living standards.

        Policy will have its part to play by building on the substantial structural reform achieved over the past ten years; by maintaining the much improved competitive position of our export industries—especially through low inflation; and by adjusting fiscal policy so that sufficient domestic saving is available to fund the additional investment required.

        Mr President, at the July Premiers' Conference all Australian governments agreed on the key challenge for fiscal policy today. The conference benefited from a major report on national saving commissioned from Dr Vince FitzGerald, a response to which the Treasurer is releasing tonight.

        From next financial year, the process of withdrawing the stimulus and cutting the deficit will begin. While the growth path of the economy will assist, on its own it will be insufficient to accomplish the task. This budget therefore contains measures which will accelerate the process.

        This meets a key election commitment of the government. It will be achieved through five complementary steps. First, the second round of tax cuts will be deferred from 1996 until a time when fiscal conditions permit, probably in 1998. Second, outlays will be reduced by $2 billion. Third, the income tax system will be tightened to remove or reduce certain concessions, and to tax non-cash benefits in a manner more equivalent to the taxation of the ordinary income of wage and salary earners. This will raise over $600 million. Fourth, rates of excise on petroleum products and tobacco will be progressively increased. Fifth, wholesale sales tax rates will be increased in two stages over the next two years.

        The effect of these outlays and revenue measures will reduce the prospective deficit for 1996-97 by $9 billion, but these changes will do more than that. They will halt the erosion of Commonwealth indirect tax revenues, thus preventing Australia's tax system becoming lopsided. The share of tax revenue, other than from income tax, has fallen by almost a third—from 8.3 per cent of GDP in the mid-eighties to 5.9 per cent last year. Failure to act on the indirect tax side would create pressures for more weight on income tax, a weight which would fall most heavily on middle income earners.

        The government will meet its announced objectives without the introduction of a massive new indirect tax. The government will maintain indirect tax exemptions for the necessities of life. The government will maintain the system of higher tax rates for luxury items such as fur coats, jewellery and expensive cars. Compared with the taxation situation applying last financial year, the benefits flowing from the income tax cuts plus the new rebate amount to $1.7 billion this financial year, rising to $3.8 billion.

Excise on petroleum products will rise by 3c a litre from tonight and a further 2c a litre a year later. An additional increase on leaded petrol will commence in February 1994 at 1c per litre rising to 5c per litre by a year later. This recognises the harmful effect of lead in petrol, particularly on the children of Australia, and will accelerate the conversion of the motor vehicle fleet to unleaded petrol.

        Mr President, this budget also contains a number of initiatives additional to those raised in the election context. The government said in the election that it would not forget the unemployed, nor leave them behind. To address this problem more fully, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has established a committee on employment opportunities, comprising recognised experts in this area. The committee is examining current policies on unemployment, and possible alternatives, and will prepare a discussion paper by December this year.

First, the total number of labour market program places available in this financial year will be increased to over 500,000. Two-thirds of these are for people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Second, we will increase by $6 per fortnight the rate of newstart allowance paid to single adults without children, unemployed for more than 12 months.

        One sure way to reduce unemployment is through the expansion and development of Australian industry. That requires business investment. And to secure that business investment, Australian governments need to create the most favourable environment for the expansion of productive business and jobs. Creating that environment requires the establishment of a stable framework for business planning. Crucial to that, there must be confidence that Australia's prospective budget deficit is being reduced substantially over the medium term.

        Nowhere is Australia's economic transition more evident than in our trading performance. Exports now account for 20 per cent of the total goods and services we produce, compared with 13 per cent a decade ago. The composition of our trade has changed and matured. Exports of the more sophisticated manufactured goods have grown at 20 per cent annually over the last seven years. The destination of Australia's exports has also shifted dramatically, with Asia now taking almost 60 per cent of our merchandise exports. This partly reflects the much higher growth rates in Asia than in the older industrialised world. It also reflects our developing trade successes in the region.

        McKinsey's recent study of emerging exporters revealed that much of the impetus for our recent export growth has come from 700 small to medium sized manufacturing exporters. These exporters earned over $8 billion in 1990-91, double the level of four years earlier. According to that study, 90 per cent of Australia's manufacturers—more than 6000 businesses—are not yet exporting, but most could be, suggesting an undeveloped source of potential exports and employment.

         —I rise to say a few words in tribute to the late Dame Marie Freda Breen, former Liberal and Country Party senator for Victoria from 1962 to 1968, who died on 17 June 1993. As a senator for Victoria, I am fortunate to follow a distinguished line of women senators, one of whom was the late Dame Marie Breen. Today that line has been augmented with the swearing in of my colleague Senator Judith Troeth. I am sure she will continue that tradition that has been left to us by women such as Dame Ivy Wedgwood, Dame Marie Breen and Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I am sure that, had Judith made her maiden speech, she would be joining me on this occasion but since she has not, I am sure she will agree with all I say.

         In her lifetime, Dame Marie worked assiduously to improve the lives of Australian women and children and she took a keen interest in the welfare of others, especially those overseas. She helped advance many causes, such as marriage guidance and family planning, at a time when they were not fashionable. We have heard a number of times tonight that she was a woman ahead of her time. Her strength of spirit and level of commitment were admired and commented on by many. As President of the National Council of Women from 1954 to 1958, she was active in gaining government subsidies for creches and nurseries for children at a time when no such facilities existed.

         So often our Prime Minister has tried to change history. Some of the women on the left side of politics forget our history and forget the contribution of women such as Dame Marie Breen—women who are ahead of their time and who not only talked about issues of social justice but also acted on those things. They actually committed their lives and dedicated much of their time to areas such as women's affairs, health of women and children, overseas students and overseas issues—the sorts of things that many women on the left now claim they were the first to talk about. That is not so. We should never forget history and the calibre of women such as Dame Marie Breen who set the standard and provided role models for many of us who followed in their footsteps long before it was fashionable to do so.

         It was chiefly for her community work that Dame Marie Breen received an OBE in 1958 and was later made a Dame of the British Empire in 1979. As we heard, she was mayoress of Brighton in 1941, state President of the Victorian Liberal and Country Party in 1953 and was elected to the Senate in 1961. She served in the Senate as a member of the printing, library, parliamentary and government publications committees and the Senate select committee on the metric system of weights and measures.

         As Senator Kemp has said, had Dame Marie not left the Senate to care for her husband, who was very ill after a tragic accident, we may well have seen her bring her skills and attributes to bear more fully in the chamber. I am sure the chamber and Australia would have been richer for it had she been able to stay here longer. She was remembered fondly when she retired from the Senate in 1968. Former opposition Senator Cohen said at the time—I think it is always telling when we find someone from the other side saying these things—`She is a lady for whom I have a great deal of affection and respect'.

         Of her work, Dame Marie said in an interview as late as 1991 that she hoped that there would always be a volunteer spirit because it typifies the caring for each other that people need to express—a lesson we could all well remember. Dame Marie also said—this is another lesson we should remember—that she should soon be forgotten after her death but that hopefully the organisations she worked for and helped to establish would survive. Not only have those organisations survived; they have flourished. As I said in my maiden speech, we ought to all remember the temporary nature of our tenure here and on this earth. Dame Marie Breen was only too well aware of that. Her contribution has remained and will continue in those organisations.

         —I, too, would like to express my regrets at the passing of Dame Marie Breen, a Liberal senator for Victoria for six years from 1 July 1962 to 30 June 1968. She died on 17 June this year aged 91 and was, on anybody's reckoning, a very remarkable woman. She was nearly 60 when first elected to the Senate. She came into the Senate after the 1961 election. Honourable senators will recall that this election was a very narrow squeak for the then Menzies government. It was a very important time to be coming into politics.

Indeed, she was chairman of the association's women's group from 1957 until she entered the Senate in 1962. Her chairmanship of that association's women's group was but part of her wider involvement with women's issues and movements. In particular, she was also President of the National Council of Women from 1954 to 1958. It was particularly her welfare work for women and children which led to her being honoured with the award of OBE in 1958 and, later in 1979, she was made a Dame of the British Empire, or DBE.

        In recent weeks all Australians have mourned the loss of Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. He was 85. Through his work as a surgeon in prisoner of war camps in Asia during the Second World War and his postwar work assisting veterans, Weary Dunlop, as he was universally known, was a figure not just honoured and revered but genuinely loved by his fellow Australians. I certainly feel privileged to have met and talked with him on several occasions over the past few years.

         He was born into a farming family in northern Victoria in 1907. After an active and purportedly happy childhood, he gained qualifications in both pharmacy and medicine. His student days in Melbourne were full to the brim, as he was also a brilliant sportsman and became a champion at boxing and rugby union. He was in London undertaking postgraduate work in surgery when the war began. He loved his work, but the outbreak of war made life at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington seem like, as he said, a `charmed circle'. By pulling some strings, he managed to enlist in the 2nd AIF from London, and was posted directly to Jerusalem in November 1939 with the rank of captain.

         During his two years in the Middle East his appetite for adventure meant that he was rarely far from the centre of action. He served in Libya, Greece and Crete, and volunteered for service with the 2/2 Australian Casualty Clearing Station in besieged Tobruk. He declined command of that unit, preferring to retain the surgical post of major. On his way back to Australia with the 7th Division, his ship was diverted to Java in a desperate bid to stem the Japanese move southward. He was taken prisoner of war in February 1942. He was moved to Batavia, Singapore, and finally to Konyu camp, along the route of the now notorious Burma-Thailand railway.

         At Konyu and at further camps along the line, Dunlop and his fellow prisoners faced some of the most appalling conditions ever experienced by Australians at war. Men were daily forced out to work, clearing the jungle to make way for the railway. Malaria, dysentery, tropical ulcers, cholera and beri-beri were all common, exacerbated by malnutrition and brutal punishment by Japanese and Korean guards.

He saw his men out in the morning and was there to greet them when they arrived back exhausted at night. He was often sick himself and was punished and three times threatened with execution for his intercessions on behalf of the sick. Although forbidden to do so, he kept a radio and a detailed diary.

         His experience as a prisoner fostered in him insights into humanity that shaped the rest of his life. In his diary he allowed himself only snatches of despair and ill-feeling towards the Japanese. In May 1943 he admitted to a `searing hate' arising in him whenever he saw a Japanese. He was as capable of hatred as he was of love, but ultimately he could not suppress a deep compassion from developing for the Japanese when he understood the wretchedness of their position by the end of the war. At the end of his war diary he wrote:

        Sir Edward resolved then to make the welfare of ex-prisoners of war a life-long mission. In the postwar years, as he rose to prominence as a surgeon in Melbourne, he was tireless in the service of his former comrades, once again intervening on their behalf whenever he could. Remarkably, he lacked any sense of bitterness or desire for recrimination against the Japanese. Instead, he set about promoting links between Australia and Asia, and with Japan in particular. He was active in the health programs sponsored under the Colombo Plan, initiated by Australia in 1950 to promote cooperation with and assistance to South East Asia. In 1969 he led an Australian medical team into South Vietnam to provide care for civilians injured in the war.

         The outbreak of the war found Sir Edward wanting to enlist in the 2nd AIF. In his autobiography he said that he had some delay before he could enlist because there were no facilities for him to enlist from London. Nevertheless his service number was VX259. So the delay must have been measured in hours or at most one or two days; it certainly it did not run to many months. When people enlisted in the 2nd AIF they were given a number serially for each state—V was for Victoria and Q was for Queensland. His number of VX259 meant that he would have been the 259th person who enlisted from Victoria. There would not have been too much of a time delay there in the process.

         I would like to dwell for a moment on his time as a prisoner of war because, as I said, he was not only a medical officer looking after prisoners; he was also the commandant of a camp. He worked tirelessly, although he was sick and malnourished himself, and with great courage looking after the men under his command. One of the characteristics of the incarceration of the Australians and all the allied prisoners who suffered under the Japanese was that they were subject to brutal attacks by their guards. One of the procedures adopted by those of senior rank, whether corporals, sergeants or officers, was that when the privates were being bashed by the guards—as they frequently were—the person of superior rank would stand in and take the bashing for them. Weary Dunlop did this on innumerable occasions as a colonel. It is also a matter of record that, on several occasions, he was sentenced to death by the Japanese and his execution was stayed only at the last moment.

         The camp of which he was the commanding officer was characterised by having one of the lowest death rates of all the large camps in Thailand. Dunlop himself explained that that was not because of the medical skill that he and the other medical officers in the camp possessed and delivered to the troops under their command. He explained it on the basis of leadership and he did that in a very self-effacing way. It was true.

         Leadership today is a very undervalued commodity in contemporary Australian society. It is not absent from society but it is relatively rare; it is relatively scarce. What we have in this country today is a collection of what could best be described as managers, not leaders, in so many levels of human activity. They are worried about getting things done without a fuss and they are worried about the bottom line. There is not the respect nor the reward for leadership that there should be in this country. There is very little understanding of its value. Those attributes of leadership—dedication; energy; knowledge of what needs to be done; devotion to the cause; ability to comfort and cosset those they are leading; ability to inspire those they are leading to rise to achievements that they would not normally attain; selflessness; preferment of the interests of those they lead before their own, even to the extent of laying their own lives on the line—are the qualities that Weary Dunlop had in abundance.

         All of those qualities today, of course, are in contrast to the teaching of contemporary sociologists. They do not fit in in a country where human relations are run under the aegis of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because it sees leadership as being elitist and authoritarian. Leadership, as Dunlop demonstrated, does not diminish anyone's human rights in any way at all; in fact, it enriches them. It is an essential attribute for a country to possess. It should be evident at all levels in society. Society is not great because of a prime minister or a president. A society is great because the community works together for common goals and because it stays together in small, cohesive units, all led by someone who is a leader of that small group.

Those with superior rank in the Australian Defence Force always led by example, whether they were corporals or colonels.

          I was surprised at the public response to Weary Dunlop's death. I had the privilege of meeting him on only one occasion some years ago and had a long talk with him. I read his book when it was published and I have read a large number of articles about him. But the response of the Australian community was absolutely unrehearsed. It was a natural and an overwhelming expression of admiration for this man and his life. It was not developed in any way at all by any special interest groups, least of all by the government, and yet the media were totally dominated by his death for days afterwards. Those of us who were in St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne for that huge funeral service will never forget the tangible expression from ordinary Australians—the expression of respect for, and admiration of, his life.

People were moved out of respect for this man and the work of his life. I hope it is a sign that this country is growing up and maturing, that the buccaneers of the stock exchange or the commercial world and the Ned Kellys are no longer taken as the heroes of this country, and that this country recognises real worth in human character. If we all keep the example of his life before us, I am sure that this country will be a much better place for it.

         Sir Edward Dunlop—surgeon, soldier, scholar and sportsman—was a brilliant and abundantly gifted man who excelled in each of these roles, yet always remained self-effacing about his many achievements. One of his greatest achievements—and certainly that for which he is renowned and revered—was the unfaltering and superb leadership he provided for his fellow POWs during his incarceration in Japanese prison camps for the latter half of the Second World War.

The publications of his war diaries in 1986 was not an attempt to reopen old wounds, but, rather, to put a new complexion on what he went through. His hatred had long since died and he had been able to find forgiveness for his captors. The diaries were to be a tribute to the men who languished under the incessant spectre of death, disease, starvation and torture, with the hope that as long as this dreadful history is remembered it will never be repeated.

His physical strength and fitness, his training as a surgeon, his knowledge of men, his ability to lead and inspire others to follow—which is probably more important—to deal with his captors and to organise the foul disease-ridden camps the Australians found themselves in were remarkable qualities which he displayed during this time.

His involvement in the development of Australia's role in the Colombo Plan was another.

         Like Weary, I also played rugby union at Melbourne University although, unlike him, I never made it as an Australian representative against the New Zealand All Blacks. But as patron of the Melbourne University rugby union club, Weary Dunlop made it a practice to attend a match every Saturday. While he was marching up and down the sidelines in the wet winters of Melbourne, in that dreary drizzle—I can say that now, having gone back to Queensland—we could hear the thundering crowds at the MCG attending that other game. But there would be the tall, lanky figure of Weary Dunlop cheering on the Melbourne University side.

To a man who had been on the Burma railway, using jam tin lids to amputate limbs with or without anaesthetic, this was a bit rich. I can remember his saying to this anaesthetist, `Doctor, every time you give an anaesthetic it is a crisis in your life. Give him the pentothal now'. So they put me straight onto the anaesthetic.

         I was one of those people who had the rare privilege of crossing the path of one such as Weary Dunlop. So it was a pleasure for me that I was able to renew his acquaintance right here in 1988 at the opening of the new Parliament House. I think it was fitting that a man of such distinction should have been present at such an event.

But it was interesting that the only person my sons wanted to meet was Weary Dunlop. I think it said a lot for the man that in this day and age young men of 17, 18 and 19, upon seeing all of those great figures in the Great Hall, said, `Look, Dad, all we want to do is meet Weary Dunlop. We understand that you know him'.

         Notwithstanding the cruelty and suffering that Weary Dunlop incurred as a POW, when the war was over not only did he not harbour any hatred or have any desire to carry out a campaign of retribution but he forgave his enemies. He went out of his way to befriend the Japanese who, only a few short years earlier, had inflicted such incredible cruelty not only upon him but also upon his close mates on the Burma railway. That, I think, reflected the man.

He was a remarkable man not only during the war but also during peace.

         I consider myself fortunate to have met him, even if it were only once. It was a quite recent meeting. In April this year I was transiting through Bangkok on my way to India when I saw him in the Bangkok airport; he and I had been on the same flight from Sydney. I took the opportunity to introduce myself and told him that I was pleased to be able to speak to a living legend. We had a short conversation and then went our separate ways. Neither of us were to know that, in a few short months, crowds would gather in Melbourne to pay their last respects to this truly remarkable Australian.

         Weary was a wonderful character. In his honour I am wearing the tie of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons of which he was one of our most famous members. He annually attended the scientific congress to keep abreast of things; even as late as last year he attended it and gave us his wisdom, but always in a deprecating way. Senator Boswell has alluded to the fact that he was also a distinguished fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and he maintained that membership throughout his life.

         In addition to Weary Dunlop's humility, he had a great sense of humour. I was once sitting next to him at a conference and said to him, `Weary, as you get older, do you find your progress impeded in relation to your activities?'. Weary said, `Well, I am reminded of a fellow I was sitting next to at a dinner in London who called himself the Lord Privy Seal. The funny thing about him was that he was neither a privy nor a seal'. Weary added `But I said to him, "Lord Privy Seal, how do you find things as you get a bit older?". The peer said to me that he had been sitting next to some lady at a dinner one night and this lady had asked him the very same question: "How do you get on as you get a bit older?" The peer told me that he had said to the lady, "Well, my dear, as I get a bit older, I find that I am losing touch with my limbs". She said, "My Lord, if it is any consolation to you, the limb that you are losing touch with at the moment is not your own".' That was Weary; he was a wonderful character.

         He dedicated his life based upon what had occurred to him in the prison camps, but he did it in a self-effacing way. He became loved by everybody with whom he came in contact—and I think that was due to the essential humility he displayed in everything he did. He passes on now. He left a legacy behind that is an inspiration, as Senator Parer said, to the young men of this country. He did what he could, as a good doctor does today, despite the denigration of his profession. Despite that denigration, there are literally thousands out there who are doing the same today—and they should not be denigrated by those who seek to make political capital out of them. Weary deprecated that trend too in many conversations I had with him. In many respects I thought in this context of the film

Being one of the last speakers for the evening, I wish to offer my heartfelt condolences today at the death of Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. Like others who have spoken here this evening, I stood with many thousands of Australians at St Paul's Cathedral in July to pay tribute to the late Sir Weary Dunlop. Like others, I was acquainted—albeit fleetingly—with Sir Weary, having met and spoken with him on several occasions at several functions and having exchanged correspondence with him from time to time. But ours was not to the extent of Senator Parer's acquaintance, which goes back many years.

         The reason I rise to speak tonight is that my generation was fortunate enough not to be called to arms. We were not called to serve in many of the great conflicts that have scarred the 20th century. Not having been called, as were Sir Weary Dunlop and his comrades, it is nevertheless our duty to remember the deeds and the actions of those who gave so much for our country. My generation is duty-bound to remember, to recall and to bring to life in the present the experience of the past.

         As evidenced by today's condolences, the Australian nation is engaged by Sir Weary Dunlop as it has seldom been by any other public figure. There was, after all, something in the essence of the man—some constant value—that touched all Australians across all spectrums of life. Like others who have spoken before me today, I do not find it hard to isolate those very values. The public record boasts of a life lived to the full, and there are few distinctions and honours achievable which eluded the man.

         Finally, there was something else in Weary Dunlop that I believe drew people towards him and kindled their confidence and enveloped their trust. There were many sides to the man. To my mind, his capacity to appeal to such a wide cross-section of society was based on his very Australianness. He embodied all the qualities that Australians aspire to and share in to differing degrees.

         These seem to be days of doubt and confusion as to what we mean by our `national identity'. Increasingly, we seem to be questioning what it is that we stand for and what qualities we ought to hold up before the world. This is a wasted feeling, and wholly unnecessary when we look at figures such as Weary Dunlop who selflessly expressed the simple but hard-won values of the past. Weary Dunlop reminds us that we must not sever the long line of collective national experience which marks the men and women of the nation and stamps the traits of the nation.

         At St Paul's Cathedral, when we mourned the passing of Weary Dunlop, we grieved for the passing of an era, for a loss of the past. We grieved for the man but the national hurt was even more than that. It was a sense of dislocation from our past that swallowed us up, the sense that something precious from our history was gone forever. Australia needed Sir Edward Weary Dunlop. It needed him to sustain the links with the nation's history, to keep alive the great continuity of nationhood which links one generation to another and which moulds us together as a people.

         Like Weary Dunlop, so much of the Australian character was forged in war. The better qualities of his nature, like those of Australia, represent a triumph over suffering and adversity. This is remembered by the nation when it recalls the Gallipoli campaign, the approaching 75th anniversary of the western front campaigns, and equally its modern day hero such as the VC recipient `Dasher' Wheatley. This has been the Australian story and one which should be renewed for every generation.

         Weary himself saw to that. I recall an incident at the Canberra airport some years ago. He was in his early eighties at that time and a small girl, approximately eight or nine years old, approached him through the crowded airport simply for an autograph. Weary cheerfully obliged, so his story and the story of his generation was passed on to the newest of Australia's generation. We have to hold on to the memory of Weary Dunlop in the same way that we have to hold on to the memory of our past.

         This is not empty nostalgia or misplaced melancholy for some bygone era, nor is it an empty romance. If we are searching around for embodiments of values, we need not invent an image of ourselves or adapt some contrived bureaucratic self-perception. We only need to go back to our roots and our origins. If we are lost and thrashing around to affirm our identity, it is only because we have stopped remembering or else we have swallowed some national lie about ourselves which has written the likes of Sir Weary Dunlop out of our history. To this end, I honour Sir Edward Weary Dunlop and extend my condolences to his family.

        The AFC does not have the financial flexibility to allocate the amount requested in the letter of 26 November 1992 from the major Brisbane-based film culture and support organisations. As a matter of policy, a proposal of this kind would require substantial development by the applicant and analysis by the AFC before any decision to provide support is taken. The applicant would be required to provide a detailed outline of the project, including the proposed budget. Information about the aims and objectives of the organisation, management and financial structures and program delivery strategies would also be required.

        However, there have been funds earmarked to begin a process aimed at assisting organisations in determining the most appropriate way to share limited resources, to reduce duplication of administrative structures and to establish a structure which will assist in establishing and maintaining a strong, vital film culture for Queensland. It is envisaged that both the AFC and the Queensland Film Development Office will have input into the process and that possible long term funding will be considered in this context.

        Releases are circulated to national and local electronic and print media; to the veteran and support community through Ex-service organisations at national and state level only, and to their own publications; to Pensioner News, Senior Scene and other similar specialised papers, the medical and allied health community and any other target audience appropriate to the media release. Targeting varies according to the media release. For example, a release on a local Joint Ventures Scheme presentation may go only to the local media and ex-service community, whereas a release on a national Government program would be disseminated more widely.

        (9) No. Reviews run by the IAEA specifically related to research reactor safety come under the Integrated Safety Assessments of Research Reactors (INSARR) Program. This Program began in the 1970s and has applied mostly to developing countries to assist in the formulation of their regulatory standards. Before INSARR commenced, the IAEA periodically reviewed the safety of research reactors provided to member states under project agreements with the Agency. These circumstances did not apply to HIFAR. HIFAR's exemplary safety record, as attested by ongoing independent review, has not warranted an INSARR review. In any case, in accordance with Australia's view that ultimate responsibility for the safety of nuclear facilities rests with the sovereign state within whose territory the facilities are situated, final responsibility for the safe operation of HIFAR rests with the Executive Director of ANSTO.

While Norway's decision is regretted, under provisions in the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946) Norway lodged an objection to the 1982 vote on the moratorium on commercial whaling, therefore allowing them to legally proceed with commercial whaling if they so chose.

        Approval requires clearance by both the Environment and Forestry Appraisal Committees of the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

        The Government of India has advised in relation to the forestry provisions currently being applied to the project that mining at Piparwar can proceed on forestry land provided the State Government has received and accepted compensation for pockets of land as they are progressively mined. Thus, in 1991 the construction of a river diversion channel was stopped when the channel reached the boundary of a portion of forest land. Construction did not resume until the Forestry Department had accepted from CCL 13.1 hectares in compensation for an equivalent amount of land to be absorbed by the diversion. Updated advice from the Government of India is that CCL has now found sufficient land to compensate the State Forestry Department in full and that the project now meets the  forestry requirements specified in the EPA.

        Although the recent election saw a significant drop in most parts of the country in informal voting for both Houses of Parliament (nationally from 3.19% to 2.97% for the House of Reps and from 3.4% to 2.56% for the Senate), it is the Commission's intention to carry out an examination of informal papers from this election in order to learn what they can from these papers about the reasons for the wastage of votes through informality. It is the results of surveys such as these that assist the Commission to shape its public information and advertising programs which have been successful in reducing the informal voting rate in recent elections.

        (4) Looked at purely from a statistical point of view the results in four divisions in South Australia (Adelaide, Grey, Hindmarsh and Kingston) could have been affected by informal voting. That is, if all informal votes had been formal and had been cast for the major party which lost the election, that party could have won in that division. Based on the results of earlier informal ballot papers surveys, however, it must be said that such a result is highly unlikely: these surveys showed that informal ballot papers, to the extent that they can be read, were intended to go to all parties, but with more of them intended to be cast for the ALP than for the Coalition parties.

        (1) The primary role of the North West Cape Communications Base is Very Low Frequency (VLF) and High Frequency (HF) communications. The Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) transmissions from the United States mainland, as referred to by the honourable senator, provides a complimentary, not an alternative, channel of communications for US submarines. In general terms, lowering the transmission frequency allows greater penetration of the sea by radio waves and this, for instance, would enable communications to be established with a submarine at greater depth. However, the increased penetration comes at a cost in terms of data transmission rate and consequently the major utility of ELF transmission is as a `cueing' signal to call the submarine to a shallower depth to receive more detailed communications by other means (such as VLF, HF or satellite communications). Australia has no perceived requirement for, and is not pursuing, ELF communications technology but has an ongoing requirement for the VLF and HF capability supported by the North West Cape Communications Base.

        Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, who undertook some consulting work for the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force, developed a preliminary estimate of around $10m to dual gauge an existing track.

        QR's option will provide it with greater scheduling flexibility, and will improve nationwide transportation movements and waterfront efficiency. The flexibility for QR to schedule coal, grain and freight trains in the day time was identified in the course of the Queensland Impact Assessment Study (IAS) as a significant operational benefit. This is noteworthy because the IAS found that the single most common source of complaint against the existing rail line is the noise from diesel-electric locomotives hauling freight trains, particularly late at night.

        (1) No. The Authority determines a salary range for each position based on the application of a proprietary job evaluation methodology. This method is supported by Jacques Martin Hewitt International and various market surveys performed by that company from time to time. Following a competitive selection process, and prior to signing a contract of employment, each General Manager appointee negotiates a salary package within the pre-specified range with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The procedure then involves the CEO discussing the proposed salary package with the CAA Board Chairman before completing the appointment of each individual.

The CAA Board reviewed all the proposed salary ranges with the then CEO prior to the first set of General Manager appointments in 1991. The question of any salary "increments" outside the predetermined range has not arisen. The Minister is not involved in the selection process other than to approve the creation of the positions in the first place prior to them being publicly advertised.

This figure includes special purpose areas, eg public contact areas, hearing rooms, storage, etc. Excluding these areas, leaves 60,685 m squared. The figure represents a peak in accommodation holdings, as in Victoria and New South Wales the Department is in the process of moving accommodation in some offices. During the transition period there can be some short-term duplication of holdings which are reflected in the figures. By 30 June 1994 the portfolio's gross holdings should be around 66,230 m squared and the space net of special purpose areas should be around 56,106 m squared.

        (1) and (2) Advice from the National Program Manager and the majority of State and Regional Managers is that these organisations are not known, and are unlikely to have been funded. However, as ATSIC does not maintain a national database of unsuccessful funding applications, ATSIC is canvassing its 7 State and 32 Regional offices to ascertain whether any applications have been lodged by the organisations in question. In the unlikely event that a thorough canvassing does in fact reveal funding applications, supplementary information with relevant details will be provided.

        Official statistical publications from the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research refer to "Former Yugoslav Republics". This is an interim measure as, often, no further detail is available. The standard footnote reads `including the now independent republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia'. This practice of statistical reporting follows the policy adopted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

        The departmental usage described here dates from the recognition of Croatian and Slovenian independence in January 1992, at which time it became inappropriate to refer to `Yugoslavia' as a single state or country of origin of migrants to Australia.

There were then three Social Security programs. The attribution of resources to this structure, therefore, is not comparable to the attribution for 1992-93. In addition, client population and eligibility changes and an organisational restructuring of the Department which included the abolition of State Offices have contributed to changes and refinements in the attribution model.

These funds represented printing ($18,700), artwork/typesetting ($1,500) and film separation ($2,000). A total of 1.1 million tray liners were printed and distributed to 106 stores across the country. These tray liners were used for eight weeks during October and November 1992. There was no fee paid to Hungry Jack's for the promotion. The service was offered as a community service activity sponsored by Hungry Jack's.

        Professor Lea argues that aid has failed to alleviate poverty because its essential purpose is to preserve a system which damages the interests of the poor and supports privileged elites. These arguments had more validity in the past but aid programs now, including the Australian aid program, pay greater attention to poverty alleviation.

        In the post-Cold War period, there is widespread recognition that poverty alleviation is a global priority. Poverty alleviation is now a major theme in the work of multilateral development organisations such as the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program. The links between sustainable development, environmental issues and poverty reduction are highlighted in Agenda 21, the internationally agreed plan of action arising from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.

        From 1960 to 1990, key human development indicators for the least developed countries, that is the very poorest countries, have shown considerable improvement. Average life expectancy has increased from 39 years in 1960 to 51 years in 1990. Infant mortality has decreased from 170 per 1000 live births to 114 per 1000 in 1991. The percentage of people with access to clean drinking water has risen from 21 percent in 1975 to 47 percent in 1990. Adult literacy has increased from 29 percent in 1970 to 45 percent in 1990. Real GDP per capita has increased from $580 in 1960 to $740 in 1990, based on measures of purchasing power parity.

        The fact is that many developing countries borrowed large amounts from private banks during the 1970s and early 1980s. When real interest rates rose dramatically in the early 1980s, debt-servicing became a major problem for many developing countries. This, in turn, substantially reduced the ability of developing countries to attract private financial resources.

        As a result, private financial flows to developing countries fell from a high of 52 percent of net financial flows in 1980 to 34 percent in 1987. At the same time, official development assistance (ODA) flows to developing countries increased from 29 percent of net financial flows in 1980 to 54 percent in 1987. Thus foreign aid had a critical role in underpinning resource flows to developing countries in this period.

        Loans from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) to eligible developing countries are highly concessional, with no interest charges and 40-50 years to pay back the loan, including a ten year grace period. IDA further helps severely indebted countries, particularly in Africa and South America, through its debt-reduction and debt-servicing facility. The Asian Development Bank's soft-lending arm, the Asian  Development Fund (ADF), is also highly concessional.

        (3) Providing aid through non-government organisations (NGOs) is one way of directly meeting the needs of the poor. However, NGOs alone are not the answer to poverty. Helping the poor requires a combination of strategies. While small-scale, localised activities directed specifically at the poor have an important role, they also need to be accompanied by measures which result in increased economic activity, improved services and better infrastructure.

        (4) In 1991-92, 4.5 percent of Australia's aid budget was administered by NGOs. In 1992-93, the proportion was approximately 5.7 percent. This compares to 2 percent in 1983-84, 2.6 percent in 1987-88 and 4.3 percent in 1989-90.

        (5) Australia's aid to individual developing countries is based on the needs and requests of recipient governments, and Australia's capacity to assist. This results in a mix of activities, some small-scale and some large, which varies from country to country. There is no merit in deciding at the outset that a certain proportion of Australia's total aid budget will be earmarked for small-scale projects.

        The question of people's participation extends far beyond small-scale activities. The obstacles to the full participation of women in development remain one of the greatest development challenges. For this reason, women's needs are taken into account in the planning and implementation of all Australian aid activities.

While there is some foreign interest in the use of the DAWR, it is too early at this stage to quantify any likely additional foreign use of the range. US aircraft will operate primarily from RAAF Base Darwin when using the DAWR. To a lesser extent they will also operate from RAAF Tindal and from US ships.

        (3) In addition, the Council on Overseas Professional Qualifications (COPQ) and the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation also came within the responsibility of the portfolio at the time of the Labor Caucus motion of 21 August 1988 but are no longer part of the portfolio. At the time of the motion,  there were 8 Ministerial appointments to COPQ of which 2 were women, but of the 2 Ministerial appointments to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation none were women.

        Therefore, at the time of the Labor Caucus motion, 66 of 185 Ministerial appointments were women. This compares with 24 women of 48 Ministerial appointments as of 1 June 1993, which is already the Government's target for the year 2000 of 50 per cent. This is a 39 per cent increase in the representation of women in Ministerial appointments to bodies within the portfolio.

As at 7 June 1993, one of these organisations had forwarded a formal registration of interest. The closing date was not extended. Under the Commercial Support Program process the Invitation to Register Interest is used to provide comment on the Statement of Requirement with a view to refining it before the tendering process. Accordingly, late responses to the Invitation to Register Interest can be accepted provided the purchasing delegate is satisfied that no advantage is derived from the late acceptance.

        (1) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will install a new automated light at Point Perpendicular in February 1994. The existing Point Perpendicular lighthouse and associated buildings will then no longer be required by AMSA and AMSA has offered the site for sale to the Commonwealth. AMSA proposes only to retain sufficient land (some 200 square metres) for the new light and for a helipad for maintenance access.

        (1) Following discussions between relevant Ministers, I directed on 24 December 1992 that the Department of Defence commence planning immediately for the closure of Newington Armament Depot and the associated ammunition supply line between Kingswood and the anchorage in Sydney harbour, based on a timetable assuming Sydney will be successful in the bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. Should Sydney's Olympic bid be unsuccessful, the intention is still to vacate the depot and close the supply line, and to sell all or part of the site to the New South Wales Government or other bidders on the basis of a commercial decision. The precise timing for this can be decided after the International Olympic Committee decision in September 1993.

        In clarifying the timing for closure of Newington, I further directed that an interdepartmental committee be set up, chaired by Defence, to examine and report to me on options for relocation of the depot and associated supply line. This committee should complete its report by the end of June 1993. I expect that the Government will then be in a position to decide the terms of a proposal for a new east coast armament complex (comprising a depot and a wharf) for submission to the statutory environmental impact assessment process prescribed under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974.

        (1) No review of alternative location for the Newington Armament Depot has been put to the Prime Minister or Cabinet since 1990. However, I received in 1992 an internal Department of Defence review, initiated at the direction of the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in October 1989. Subsequent to this internal review, I have directed that an Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) be set up to examine and report further on the issues associated with relocation of the armament depot and associated ammunition supply line.

        (3) Strategic factors are always an important consideration in any proposed relocation of major defence facilities. In this case, notwithstanding the northern focus of Australia's defence strategy and the consequential imperative to locate some operational bases in forward areas, Government endorsed strategic guidance confirms the need for major bases, support facilities and training areas to be located in more southerly areas, less vulnerable to attack and close to essential Defence and civil support infrastructure. A critical function of the armament depot in question is to provide an Explosive Ordnance (EO) service to ships of the Royal Australian Navy. Such a service includes regular replacement of ammunition expended in practice, rotation of EO stocks for maintenance and removal of ammunition outfits from ships about to undergo major maintenance. All of these functions need to be carried out predominantly in a benign support environment prudently remote from the anticipated area of potential hostilities. Some EO, sufficient for short term operational needs, is indeed stored at or near the forward bases, but the requirement for a less vulnerable wholesale ammunition depot, more proximate to the primary support and training areas, is fundamental.

        (6) The warship repair and maintenance requirement is only one factor influencing EO transfers to and from the fleet. The fact that AMECON might be well placed to perform such work is acknowledged but, similarly, it is Government policy to seek value for money through open and effective competition. Hence Navy does not envisage awarding any one organisation exclusive rights to all east coast repair and maintenance work. With regard to any security or strategic advantages of Port Phillip Bay, it should also be noted that the entrance and approaches to that bay would be difficult to protect from mining in the event of hostilities. All such factors will be taken into account during the Government's evaluation.

        (2) Under the National Forest Policy Statement, State governments have adopted the policy of avoiding the clearing of public native forest for non-forest or plantation establishment wherever possible and, where this is not possible, ensuring that the clearing does not compromise regional conservation and catchment management objectives. Governments have also agreed to protect the nature conservation and catchment values of forests by ensuring that the activities of all agencies will be undertaken in accordance with effective and legally enforceable codes of practice, consistent with those currently applied to forest harvesting.

        The Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 does not place any legal constraints on the actions of owners of private property or on State or local Governments. Only the actions of the Commonwealth Government are constrained if a place is on the Register of the National Estate. Therefore, while the Commission can provide State governments with advice concerning the protection of National Estate values, it is up to the State government to decide what it will do with this advice. The Commission has not been formally asked by the Western Australian Government to comment on the Manjimup route.

        (2) The total cost of printing and publishing of the Defence Report 1991-92 was $37,910. This does not include however, the cost of drafting and preparation of the Report within the Defence organisation. Given the wide range of draft inputs received from all areas of the Defence Organisation and the coordinating effort involved, it is not possible to estimate the overall cost of preparation of the Defence Report. It is not possible therefore to provide a total cost per copy or the components of such a cost. Nor am I willing to authorise the diversion of the considerable resource that would be required to attempt to record such costs in future years.

However, a function of the appointment of a person under Section 10(1)(c) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 is to provide a report on the matters set out in Section 10(4) of that Act. These matters include the adequacy or otherwise of the processes used by the State, and by other relevant parties such as BHP, to ensure the adequate protection of significant Aboriginal areas and places which may be under threat of injury or desecration.
