It concerns the response from Mr Dennis Rose QC, an eminent QC from the Attorney-General's Department, which was made during a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Mr Geoff Petersson became most concerned when a person of Mr Rose's eminence passed what he saw as a slighting remark about his professional ability.

        I have raised this matter with Senator Cooney, who is the chairman of the committee. He tells me that the committee will be producing a report shortly, but cannot specify the exact date. It is right and proper that the record be put straight as soon as possible and I feel correction cannot await the uncertain date of the report. Accordingly, I now take steps to put the record straight for the benefit of Mr Petersson.

        I have a letter that was sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs relating to its reference on the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The letter reads:

       At the hearing of the Committee in relation to the above reference on Thursday 9 September 1993, during the course of his giving evidence, Mr Dennis Rose may have, perhaps inadvertently, misled the Committee when referring to a submission to the Committee prepared by me on behalf of the Taxation Institute.

       At page 15 of the transcript Mr Rose is reported as saying:

       "Mr Morris talked of the opinions that have been given and the opinions by Dr Howard and himself and Mr Petersson. I suppose one can regard that last one as the Taxation Institute opinion.

      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I find it surprising that Mr Rose could have stated that he was not aware whether I had any expertise in constitutional law given that I have worked closely with Mr Rose over the 17 years in which I worked as a lawyer in the Attorney-General's Department between 1972 and 1989. During that time I held various senior positions in the then Advisings Division (now Office of General Counsel) working within that Division in the Constitutional and Financial Branch, the Constitutional, Broadcasting and Administrative Branch, and the Constitutional and Electoral Branch. During that period I spent two years as Principal Legal Officer, Assistant to the Solicitor-General assisting in the preparation of cases and opinions, many involving

      <para font-size="-=2">
       questions of constitutional law. During the time I spent in the Advisings Division, Mr Rose held positions of Branch Head and Divisional Head. On more than one occasion, Mr Rose and I occupied adjacent offices.

       I think it is fair to say that by any measure I have had considerable experience in dealing with, and advising on constitutional law matters over a long period of time. Whether this experience may be said to give rise to expertise in constitutional law is another matter. However, Mr Rose's response implies that he is unaware as to whether I have had experience in advising on constitutional issues. This is clearly not so.

          I support Senator Panizza's motion because of a number of things which have been brought to my attention with regard to ATSIC and which, I believe, need investigating from the point of view of the accountability and the management of that body. As Senator Panizza highlighted in his speech, a number of leaders in the Aboriginal communities in Western Australia also support this motion. I particularly refer to Robert Isaacs, a prominent Aboriginal in Western Australia, who also happens to be on the shire council of Gosnells.

          I want to highlight a couple of points here about the accountability, the spending, the functioning and the operations of ATSIC. The first issue brought to my attention—which, I am told, is fairly typical of what is happening in many instances—revolves around an effort by a group of Aboriginals to develop a business in a country town in Western Australia. I will not name that country town because people will know who I am speaking about and those individuals could be put under some unfair pressure.

          That group endeavoured to get assistance through ATSIC to purchase a tyre business in which they had worked for a number of years in conjunction with the owner, who wished to sell the business. After some 18 months of effort, toing-and-froing and not being able to get satisfactory answers as to what had happened to their application, how it was being accounted for and how it was being processed, finally, that particular operator had to sell the business.

          It seems to me to be not quite right that a group of Aboriginals, who were totally self-supporting but who needed some capital assistance to give themselves the opportunity to become commercially viable in their own business, was denied that assistance purely and simply because of the financial management and accountability processes within ATSIC. Even to this day, as far as I am aware, they have not received a satisfactory answer to their problem.

          The other points I wish to raise in this debate come from some documents which were given to me—or to use the commonly used term from the newspaper, were leaked to me—just last week. They refer to the operations of ATSIC in Western Australia. I find the issues I raise particularly despicable and disappointing.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Western Australia has some 1,300 Aboriginal families currently seeking assistance to get into their own homes or to get a roof over their heads. These documents were presented at the meetings of ATSIC commissioners from 9 to 12 August 1993. We see in terms of community housing development that of the $48.6 million allocated to Western Australia for Aboriginal housing, only $40.8 million was spent. One must ask, when you have a situation where, as I said, there are some 1,300 Aboriginal families currently seeking to get their own homes or a roof over their heads, why $8 million was returned to the Commonwealth.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I put on the public record that I believe that three most important things in dealing with Aboriginal problems or concerns that we have in this nation are housing, health and education. The first is housing. I think it is absolutely imperative that this particular aspect be addressed in a sensitive and fair manner and that it be done in such a way that it caters not only for the community Aboriginals who, basically, live in the north or central Australia, but also for regional Aboriginals and for those termed `fringe dwellers'. I do not particularly like that term, but that is the term that is used consistently.

        <para first-indent="16">

          It was recently reported that in Kalgoorlie one-third of the Aboriginals under the age of 40 had passed on in the last 18 to 20 months. We can see that this question of housing is, indeed, a very important one. It is something that I believe this committee could look at in terms of accountability, functions and expenditure, and in terms of why, when we have this serious situation in Western Australia, this money was returned to the Commonwealth.

          I have already mentioned the housing situation. In order of importance, the next matter is health. I believe that housing and health are linked inextricably together. Next on my list is education. These documents highlight that of the $11.7 million which was allocated for health in Western Australia, $700,000 was not spent. Substance abuse is another problem that, unfortunately, the Aboriginals have had to deal with. Some $1.4 million was spent in this area.

          On the other side of the coin are major Mabo bids. This document shows quite clearly the government's position as far as Aboriginals are concerned. The emphasis is not on the matters that I raised, which are very important and which Aboriginal people consistently bring before me and Senator Panizza and other colleagues of mine in Western Australia. This document says:

        <para>
         I think this highlights very clearly the importance of this inquiry. First of all, we are seeing the government directing that $10 million be taken out of ATSIC's global allocation, which could and would be spent on such things as housing, health and education, and holding a gun at its head, threatening, `Unless you spend the money this way, we will take it away from you. You will not get it'. The government is hiding behind ATSIC and trying to make ATSIC the bad boy for what I believe in many instances to be the false expectations that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has built up around the Mabo decision. I emphasise that for the vast majority of Aboriginals there are far more important things than Mabo.

         —I thank the minister. Just to put my own thoughts in perspective, I will reiterate some of my opening remarks with regard to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993. The stated purpose of the original Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was unclear other than to encourage expenditure on the lease of new capital or the upgrading of existing capital in certain large enterprises. It must be remembered that the cost of imported capital has already decreased as a result of decreases in tariffs. Employment creation was obviously not a criterion.

         The Commonwealth legislation claimed that the allowances were for industries with an effective rate of assistance of less than 10 per cent. Up until 2 September 1993, 80 per cent of projects registered are in the manufacturing and mining sectors. To give honourable senators an idea of what the allowance was meant for, let me quote the One Nation statement:

        The broad criteria intended to identify such projects relate to the absence of any substantial assistance or protection. This was mentioned in relation to the rate of assistance being less than 10 per cent. The broad criteria state:

        How does this link with the states actually work? In Western Australia it came out in a report called
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The WA Advantage
        </emphasis>
        . I was somewhat horrified at the time because, according to that report those projects which would be disadvantaged would be the ones that would not receive special attention and administrative assistance. Those were projects with a capital investment of less than $50 million; those employing less than 100 people—that is, the majority of Australian businesses; those producing for the local market; and those not requiring significant infrastructure to be provided by the state.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is one of the major rubs. The state government in Western Australia, in linking with the Commonwealth legislation, said, of the projects to be identified, that one of the identifying criteria was the creation of significant infrastructure which was required by the state. That is assistance, but somehow or other it did not get added in. If, as part of the criteria, the state were required to provide cheaper inputs like electricity and water, that is also assistance, but this somehow or other did not get added into the 10 per cent. The other criterion was that those people who were disadvantaged were those who were not requiring an environmental clearance, including many who were helping to repair the environmental damage. The other people who were disadvantaged by this package were those not impacting on Aboriginal reserves, national parks or areas of major land use conflicts.

         The way it worked in Western Australia was that the Commonwealth legislation worked in with Western Australian legislation which actually singled out large, imposing projects which had major environmental impacts or major impacts on Aboriginal land, or which required large amounts of state government assistance. The way the actual legislation worked in Western Australia was contradictory. In other words, apart from fast tracking and reduced tariffs on electricity and water in Western Australia, the selection criterion was that the community had already contributed to the projects' infrastructure costs.

         Considering that in Western Australia there are already a number of other built-in subsidies, such as reduced royalties, it would appear that the development allowance has already defeated its own purpose. In other words, this so-called development allowance is operated as a job shedding subsidy to industries which are already heavily subsidised by the community, even without costing in the environmental costs of such subsidies. In the absence of any real information that such an allowance is not simply allowing large corporations to benefit even more at the expense of employment, the Greens (WA) senators cannot support the expansion of this scheme.

         —The purpose of the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993 is to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle and printing production industries. Somewhat surprisingly, there is a further amendment to this amendment bill to extend the proposed definition of the `ancillary printing plant' to include units placing inserts into magazines, newspapers and periodicals—an amendment which, to the cynical eye, has all the elements of pressure from particular vested interests.

         The Senate will be aware that the principal act had its genesis in the February 1992 One Nation statement. The development allowance measure currently before the Senate provides a tax deduction of 10 per cent on eligible plant during the first year of installation or use. The allowance is in addition to the generous depreciation allowances. Eligible projects must have a capital cost of over $50 million and be approved by a special statutory authority called the Development Allowance Authority.

         The government's objective at the time was to provide an incentive to promote an early upturn in investment, especially in the state-of-the-art technology involving new plant and equipment and, thus, the shedding of jobs—in summary, projects which offered benefits to improve Australia's competitiveness in world markets. That was the theory through the One Nation statement.

         But even then, in 1992, the Liberal-National Party coalition had a number of difficulties with the original bill. Firstly, it discriminated against projects with a capital cost of less than $50 million. Secondly, it did nothing for investment in plant and equipment in the poorest areas of the economy—those that need fixing. But due to its haste of passage and shortly after its enactment, the principal act, not surprisingly, was amended because it was too restrictive. It needed to allow a greater flexibility to permit the aggregation of two or more joint venture projects involving new and existing plant. In other words, it was so hastily conceived that it was unworkable.

         A change was effected to permit a combination of long-term lease arrangements with short-term owned equipment. We have before the Senate today an amendment to the proposed amendment to extend the allowance to include the motor vehicle industry and the print media. We are extending it even further to allow installations to include the newspaper folding machines so that these big newspapers can get a bigger segment of the advertising market; they will be able to compete with others because their costs of production will be much more efficient.

         By the end of June 1993, registered projects were worth something like $14.5 billion. That might appear to be a significant figure but, compared with the estimate, it fell far short of the original figure. While the government is still confident—this government is always confident—of reaching the much touted figure of $130 billion, the attainment of such a venturous goal is dependent on the overall level of confidence in the global economy. That is certainly beyond the par of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The next two years do not indicate an environment of strong growth to sustain such an optimistic outcome. We are used to predictions of optimistic outcomes and the subsequent revelation of those outcomes not being achieved.

         During the election campaign, the Prime Minister gave great prominence to the impact of this alleged $130 billion investment that would bring in the much needed recovery. In fact, the new measures introduced in the amendment bill originated during the heat of the 1993 election campaign when the Prime Minister, in desperate measures, was determined to try to woo back the business vote to his government. Mr Keating believed that a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to 33 per cent, plus an extension of the development allowance to include the motor vehicle industry and the print media, would catch the corporate vote. But we have now found that there has been a bit of a sting to the 33 per cent corporate tax rate because it has created a whole lot of anomalies.

         Good taxation law requires an adherence to the concept of neutrality and equality in that, in the determination of taxable income, all taxpayers in the same industry should be entitled to the same deductions and they should be assessed on the same taxable income. But it is not so. This government positively discriminates against the smaller operators and positively discriminates in favour of the big barons.

I do not mind companies becoming more internationally competitive, but let it be in terms of the legislation that we put before this house, a house which supposedly looks after people's interests, neutrality, fairness and equality. We should make sure that when we pass legislation it will reflect that degree of fairness and not give a competitive edge to the big players vis-a-vis the small players.

It is merely amending the principal act to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle industry and certain printing production aspects of projects in the print media. I think there is a very reasonable prospect that this will lead to even further welcome investment, as the Development Allowance Authority already has, and as the potential in the areas covered by the original bill would suggest. I am sure that, notwithstanding differences that senators may have about matters of detail, it will be welcome to the extent that it engenders new investment and new jobs.

        This amendment to page 3, clause 5, effectively removes the $50 million threshold, a topic that I addressed during the second reading debate. I urge the Committee to support the removal of this threshold in the interest of ensuring that our tax act reflects neutrality and fairness irrespective of the wealth or potential wealth of the taxpayers.

         —Senator Watson said that he was horrified at the thought that the minor parties might not support him. I suspect that some of his colleagues, if they ever thought they would be in government, would be horrified at the thought that they might support this amendment. The last thing they would want is for this amendment to be carried.

         I in no way reflect on Senator Watson's integrity in putting forward the proposal because we have debated these sorts of issues too often; I understand the approach he takes on this matter. But the opposition collectively puts forward rhetoric to the effect that it wants to reduce outlays, but it involves proposals that will always cost a lot of money. We get rhetoric that it wants to reduce the public sector, but in the form of proposals that will always require massive increases in the administrative burden.

         We are talking about a fundamental change to the nature and whole purpose of the proposal at great cost to revenue. The proposal will not produce the benefits which are the underlying rationale for the Development Allowance Authority, which are not just to generate investment and jobs, as fundamental as that it is, but to do so in a way that encourages large scale, world competitive investment to assist Australia in the increasingly competitive international environment in which we find ourselves.

         Regardless of what happens in the GATT and the outcome of international trade negotiations, communications and technology changes mean inevitably that countries will have to compete internationally. There will be more competition in areas that we do not currently envisage. The old boundaries of geography are breaking down and we need to provide assistance, within the limits of our capacity, to investors in Australia to use this as a base from which they can compete successfully in that environment. We are increasing the cost beyond that which the government believes is responsible in budgetary terms—there has been a significant increase in revenue forgone for the government—and we are reducing the focus and targeting of the benefit.

         —I remind the Senate that a number of the earlier benchmarks have been revised to accommodate the new entrants. This is where it differs significantly from the original One Nation proposal. Those benchmarks were removed admittedly as a result of pressure during the heat of an election campaign. Both the motor car industry and the print media were previously excluded from the development allowance in the 1992 legislation because they failed the eligibility test in the principal act. The mechanics of the matter are that both industries now have until either 30 December 1993 or 28 days after this act receives royal assent, whichever is the latter, to lodge the application.

         I admitted during my speech on second reading that if the Senate accepts this amendment, the smaller operators will have to act pretty speedily. So the concept that was raised in the very thoughtful contribution of my colleague Senator McMullan was that it would cause a problem for the deficit, et cetera. There will not be too many people who will be in a position to actually take advantage of this situation. Again, it is a question of fairness. So I remind the Senate that the initiatives will assist the development of greenfield site projects.

         Such amendments should be viewed with suspicion by the smaller operators, particularly in the printing industry, who will see their share of the market eroded as a further result of the lower costs of production by those who have access to capital and who now have access to this very generous concession—a concession that is not available to the smaller, though maybe entrepreneurial, more successful competitor.

         The government is trying to further entrench the newspaper and other print media in the hands of what I might call an entrepreneurial elite. The problem I see with this amendment and another reason why we believe it is fair and equitable to extend it to all people to ensure that we do not give a positive discrimination in favour of the entrepreneurial elite is the criterion of contributing to export income. The government has deliberately removed such a benchmark—it was admirable in the One Nation statement—to suit particular vested interests. I do not think this is fair to the rest of Australia and those other participants in the print media.

        The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill 1993 and the three cognate bills provide for the legal regime that will enable Australia to become part of the International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution. While the Greens (WA) are not opposing the legislation, we are moving this amendment to the motion to express some of the concerns raised by the environment movement to the convention and the two protocols.

         As has been said before, the convention establishes a fund for the compensation of oil pollution damage. The fund has a number of problems. Firstly, the fund, even if the 1992 protocol is adopted, limits claims for compensation to $400 million. Whilst this may seem a significant amount, this is the maximum that can be claimed for any one spill. Some have estimated that the clean-up bill for the Exxon Valdez spill alone was $US3 billion. The figure of $400 million would have to cover all economic and commercial losses, as well as clean-up and remediation costs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, the fund defines oil pollution damage in a way that excludes compensation for non-economic loss and damage to the environment. This also excludes the possibility of Aboriginal groups claiming for loss and damage to areas of cultural and spiritual significance and for loss of natural resources for non-economic purposes.

         Thirdly, the convention does not establish a provision for liability by negligent acts or omissions. The convention is about compensation; it is not about prevention or liability. It does not alter the actions of shipping companies who use flags of convenience to register substandard or poorly maintained vessels, nor does it provide a disincentive for Australian based companies who profit by placing Australia's environment at risk in this way.

         In particular, we would like to acknowledge the very successful work of Australia's international negotiators in implementing the compulsory pilotage scheme in the Great Barrier Reef. The introduction, under international law, of such a regime demonstrates that Australia has a significant role to play in the development of an international regime for environmental liability.

         I would like to add that the rest of Australia is not included in such a pilotage scheme. In Western Australia we have a very significant reef at Ningaloo which is not covered by any such pilotage. There are many other sensitive areas around Australia which suffer the same risk. It is not that pilotage itself prevents an accident, but it reduces the risk significantly. Therefore, we are not actually doing anything which will necessarily stop the risk of this happening in most parts of Australia.

In the first part, we acknowledge the views of both the government and the opposition that Australia should not go it alone in developing a comprehensive liability regime. While we acknowledge this position, we do not support it.

         This does not mean that we will abandon attempts by organisations such as Greenpeace Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation to promote the necessity for uniform national laws covering marine pollution from both land based and sea based sources. Indeed, it is useful to place on the record the need for such legislation and suggest that it is appropriate that the final report of the Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into coastal zone management, soon to be presented to parliament, be given serious consideration by the government to the repeal of the various acts implemented by the Offshore Constitutional Settlement in 1980. The restriction of the motion dealing with marine based oil pollution and not land based pollution has been done to avoid any need for the matter to be referred back to cabinet due to land based marine pollution being a matter of a different department.

I want to make three points reiterating some of the points that she made in her speech, which, as she said, I made back in May. We are concerned that there are limitations under this regime. It is quite conceivable that there could be losses which far and away exceed the amounts covered. We recognise, however, the danger to fuel imports for a small nation like Australia if it should seek to have unlimited liability. For those sorts of balancing reasons we have supported this legislation.

         We are also concerned about the non-economic loss. Senator Margetts has pointed to traditional uses of the environment which may be damaged. I do not think one need even extend into the Aboriginal area how the sheer enjoyment of the environment by many people can be damaged in non-economic ways. There is no compensation within this legislation for those sorts of losses.

         The final point I would like to make is that at the request of some of the conservation groups, I was responsible for sending this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I want to put on the record that I believe the Senate committee system, which allows people to come in and have an input into legislation at the very point at which it is being debated in this parliament, is a very important one. It is a very important part of the democratic process.

         But in this particular case those conservation groups which had indicated an interest in appearing were rather lax in coming forward and one group failed to appear altogether. If this Senate has provided that mechanism for such groups, a mechanism that I strongly support, I think they need to recognise that the business of the Senate is complex and time consuming, and they need to respond to those opportunities. I was quite disappointed that in this particular case that opportunity was not fully taken up and accepted. Having said that, I support this amendment put by Senator Margetts.

         —The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948. Firstly, it seeks to insert a preamble, to quote the government, `giving recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship'. Secondly, it seeks to amend the citizenship act to abolish the current oath or affirmation of allegiance and to replace it with a so-called pledge of commitment. Thirdly, and consequent upon that second amendment, it seeks to remove all reference to allegiance to the Queen as head of state from the commitment made by new citizens on taking the grant of citizenship.

         So far as the last of those three objectives of the bill is concerned, this is not the first time that the Labor government has attempted to delete reference to the Crown from the oath and affirmation. It was attempted in 1973 and again in 1984. On both those occasions the attempt was defeated in the Senate. In 1984 it was defeated by the coalition with the support of the Don Chipp led Australian Democrats.

I do hope that, in the course of this debate and before a final vote is taken on the bill, the Democrats will reconsider their position.

         At the time of its introduction into the parliament on 6 May this year I said, on behalf of the coalition, that we considered this bill to be premature and that it was designed to pre-empt the debate—in particular, the republican debate—on possible changes to our constitution. I stressed that so long as the Queen remains our head of state and the Crown remains the centrepiece of our constitution, new citizens should continue to be required to state publicly their allegiance to the Crown and, therefore, to the constitution and all the institutions that underpin our nation.

The majority of the committee, being Labor senators, supported the bill. The coalition members of the committee—Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp and Senator O'Chee—expressed their opposition. Nothing that occurred in that committee and in its public hearings has allayed the coalition's concerns about the bill or has in any way altered the coalition's formal position of total opposition to the bill at this time.

         With this bill, the government has put the cart before  the horse. It has done so quite deliberately. It is a deliberate, calculated attempt by a calculated, opportunistic government and Prime Minister to hijack the republican debate. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has totally misread the mood of the Australian public on this and, in his desperate push for a republic, has quickly proved himself to be the most divisive Prime Minister in Australia's history. That will come back not just to haunt him and his government; it will be of very grave concern to the future of the Australian nation and Australian society.

         It represents a further significant weakening of the commitment required of new citizens. A `pledge'—which is the word now being used to replace the oath or affirmation which is going to be abolished—involves very much less commitment than an oath or affirmation. The wording of the proposed pledge itself is a significant weakening of the present situation. It contains no reference to the head of state, to the constitution or to any of our other basic institutions. Rather, it makes vague allusions to `Australia and its people' and contains such ambiguous concepts as `democratic beliefs'.

         The coalition's position on the question of citizenship has been very clear for a long time. Our last policy statement on the matter was made in 1988 and our position has been essentially unchanged since then. We pointed out that it was essential that the requirements of acquisition and awarding of citizenship should be strengthened to ensure that intending citizens understand more fully the meaning of their commitment to Australia.

         We made the point then that, compared with most other countries, Australian citizenship requirements are amongst the least rigorous in the world. Indeed, it is interesting to compare them—even our existing ones, let alone the changes now being made—to, say, the United States situation. To become an American citizen, an applicant must have been physically present in the United States for at least half of the required five-year residency period.

         Every applicant for what the Americans call naturalisation—we use the term `citizenship'—has to go through a two-stage process. First of all, the applicant has to demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write and speak words in ordinary English language usage. People who are aged or who have particular disabilities are exempted from that. The applicant for citizenship has to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, the principles and form of government of the United States.

         At the preliminary hearing, the first-stage hearing in his citizenship approach, the applicant may be represented by a lawyer or a social service agency.

        I am not suggesting that in Australia we follow the American wording to that extent. The point I make, though, is that a new citizen of the United States is required to make a very strong commitment. This bill seeks to remove an already insufficiently strong commitment in Australia for new citizenship. We are weakening that commitment still further and I think that is a very dangerous trend.

         As well as that, though, the coalition has for a considerable period advocated a major overhaul of the current citizenship act to better reflect Australian citizenship as a privilege which has an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia and its basic structures and principles.

         We are not by any means on our own in that sense. Earlier in my speech I mentioned the words of Archbishop Hollingworth. Many other people and bodies have spoken even more directly about those issues. A very important report—the so-called FitzGerald report entitled

          Immigration—a commitment to Australia

         which, I regret to say, this government has ignored—was produced in 1988 by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. In this very notable report the FitzGerald committee made a similar recommendation to that which the coalition has in mind. It produced a draft suggested declaration to be adopted at citizenship ceremonies, linking the grant of citizenship with respect for fundamental institutions and principles in Australian society.

         The FitzGerald committee also recommended that ways be examined to restrict certain public benefits to non-citizens as a means of enhancing the value of citizenship.

         That FitzGerald report also recommended that a group of eminent Australians be appointed to advise on further ways of making Australian citizenship a more meaningful commitment to Australia and of encouraging its acquisition. We on this side of the chamber have always felt that that recommendation has considerable merit and that it warrants follow-up action. Accordingly, in January earlier this year the Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, announced that a coalition government would establish a national council on citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multilateral society.

         Another very important critic of the existing citizenship act has been the very eminent, very distinguished and universally respected former Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen. In a very important address to the Alfred Deakin Society on 26 August of this year—the Alfred Deakin lecture—Ninian Stephen described our existing citizenship act as `a masterpiece of legislative incoherence'. And he is absolutely right. The act is almost incomprehensible. It has enormous deficiencies. It does not really set out at all who are Australian citizens and what is required to be an Australian citizen.

         For example, the only reference in the existing act to a citizen in the sense of defining who is a citizen is in section 10, which deals with citizenship by birth. That section states that someone is a citizen if that person was born in Australia after 26 January 1949, which was about the date of proclamation of the Australian Citizenship Act. Indeed, 1949 was the first time we had a citizenship act as such. In the current act the only reference to citizenship by birth occurs in section 10 and it relates only to post-January 1949 births. That is a classic example of why this act needs major change. The act is arcane, incomprehensible, unfriendly and does not set out clearly who are citizens.

         For all of those reasons and, in particular, the point that the bill is premature at this time given the state of debate on our constitutional arrangements, we on the coalition side are totally opposed to this legislation. To proceed with it in advance of any change in our constitutional arrangements would be divisive, pre-emptive and of questionable legality. The citizenship act requires a complete overhaul—not the partial, piecemeal, confused, politically motivated and divisive amendments being proposed in this bill. For all of those reasons, the coalition very strongly opposes this bill in its entirety.

         As has been stated, the main argument against replacing the current arrangements with a new pledge of commitment is that it is a first, and fairly significant, step towards making Australia a republic. The Australian Democrats support the move towards a republic, but that is quite different from the consideration that applies to this bill. One needs to consider whether it is appropriate at this particular time to take this step. If it were a step that affected the substance of government in Australia, I think the position that the Democrats are adopting, which essentially is one of support, would be different.

         The view we take is that a reference to the Queen and the swearing of allegiance to the Queen in a new citizenship ceremony is somewhat of an anachronism. We believe that new citizens who have entered Australia intending to make this country their home see Australia as the country to which they swear allegiance. It is Australia that they want to make their new home. To them, I believe, reference to the Queen is of some historical interest but, in terms of everyday life, in terms of pledging their commitment to their new home country, it is not of great relevance.

In considering the wording, and in being a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which had a reference on this matter, I felt—and the Australian Democrats felt—that it would perhaps be useful to look at a variant to emphasise more the commitment that new citizens are making. I put forward a wording which read:

         I do not say that there are not a number of people out there who think that it might be extraordinary to pledge allegiance to the Queen. There are people out there; it would be stupid of me to the deny that. But the fact of the matter is that those very same people also find it quite extraordinary to think that they do not even have to pledge allegiance to the constitution under the proposal that has been put forward to us today. They look at comparisons with other countries. Take United States, for example, which Senator Short mentioned earlier. The situation there is very different. They have to pledge allegiance to a whole range of things, which makes this oath or affirmation look like something that would be said in kindergarten.

         One of the overriding and important observations about the whole debate on the oath of citizenship is that it needs to be made more relevant to Australian society. If the government is so sure that it has the support of the public, why cannot the public be allowed to decide the nature of a solemn oath when people become new citizens of this country?

         It was interesting that a little while ago Senator Spindler made mention of Mr Les Murray's contribution. Senator Short and I said to him that that very same man, Les Murray—the poet—now thinks that this is wrong. I will just give him what he said. Mr Murray is a poet and a former literary editor. He is best described as a poet who has an enduring admiration for the quality and sanctity of Australian rural life. He is also a man who displays such attitudes as devotion to the Australian rural scene, respect and affection for the ordinary country man, and a conviction that modern society relinquishes at its peril the values that are enshrined in the land and the lives of those who live in intimacy with it. I will quote Mr Murray—and I must emphasise that the words are not necessarily parliamentary. He said that the government has `stuffed up' his original poem by turning it into `bureaucratic gobbledegook'. They are his words.

         If Senator Spindler thinks that Mr Murray is still in favour of this when he uses that type of terminology, I would be awfully surprised. Mr Murray did not support the pledge in its current form and said Australians would not support Mr Keating's vision for a republic if a referendum were held now. I assume that if a referendum were held for the so-called `pledge of commitment' it would suffer a similar fate because it is so wishy-washy. Let us face it, that is part of the problem and that is the concern that is being expressed to the people of this parliament today. Mr Murray also said, `Not unless they'—Australians—`trust it'—the republic—`and they sure can't trust the one they are being offered at the moment'.

They do not see that it is a relevant thing to be just ramming down their throats. These are the people who will be affected, but these are the very people that this government refuses to consult. I suspect the reason the government wants to radically change the oath and affirmation through legislation is that it knows that no-one can trust the bearer of the changes. I think the question is: what is it that the government is dreading and fearful of in relation to this issue?

         —I rise very briefly to support my colleagues on the stand that the coalition has taken in relation to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993. I would like Senator Spindler to know that I am part of a migrant family. I did not have to take the oath because I was born in Australia—but only just.

         I find Senator Spindler's remark that the present oath is a relic of the past quite insulting. There are many migrating families, like my mother and father, who were proud at the time and are still proud today—in the case of my mother; my father has passed on—that they took the oath they did. If we are going to change how Australia is run—whether it is run by constitutional monarchy or as a republic—we should do it all at the same time. We should not try to get the republic in by the back door or in any other way by starting off with the oath and going on to the flag—the flag of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was ashamed the other day in Monaco. The Australian flag was thrown around when Sydney won the bid, and the Prime Minister was reported in the

If Australia decides to become a republic after a proper and informed referendum, I will accept that. Of course, if we change to a republic we may change the flag and if Australia wants to improve the flag after a proper referendum, I will support that. The only real condition I have on the flag is that the Southern Cross never comes off it; that was where I was born and that is where I still live.

They may have entered this country on a resident visa or with PR status, seen what sort of a country Australia is and the opportunities that are here, and decided to become citizens.

I believe that if one wants to be admitted to a club—and I think Australia is a pretty good club to belong to; my family considers that it has been a pretty good club to belong to—one takes the rules as they are. In time, if Australia decides to change its flag, its constitution and its head of state, let it be done then, and not before, in bits and pieces and by trying to put it all over Australian citizens.

         The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which we are discussing in the Senate today is not a bill which in any way relates to democracy. It is not a bill which in any way relates to the will of the Australian people. It is nothing more than a blatant attempt by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once again to impose upon the community his will, and his agenda alone. If I remember correctly no public outcry instigated this bill. There were no representations that called for changes. Rather, our Prime Minister decided that in his endeavour to push Australia towards a republic he would pre-empt any constitutional referendum and any decision of the parliament and, as usual, impose his own views.

         When the proposed new oath and affirmation of allegiance was announced by the Prime Minister in his usual press release method, on 17 December 1992, he stated that the new oath and affirmation would better reflect the contemporary reality of Australia and our nation aspirations. It should be remembered that once again these comments were made without any public support. Naturally, when Labor was returned to government following the March 1993 election, one of the first bills to be introduced to the parliament was this Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which, as we have heard today, deletes all reference to the Queen and any reference to the constitution or any of our other institutions from the oath of allegiance required of people on being granted Australian citizenship.

         As can be seen from the newspoll released today, the initial support for the republic is quickly dwindling. That is because the Australian community has had an opportunity to come to terms with what exactly it means to be part of a constitutional monarchy. According to the figures, only 39 per cent of Australian citizens support the concept and 44 per cent are against a republic. I have no doubt that this trend will continue. Our Prime Minister has absolutely no right to pretend that he represents the views of the majority of Australians on this issue. The decision by the Labor Government to delete any reference to the Queen or to our constitution from the oath of allegiance is totally unfounded whilst Australia remains a constitutional monarchy and whilst the debate which is occurring at present continues.

         When I speak on this matter of citizenship, I do so with a certain amount of personal experience. I was the elected head of a local government area in Tasmania. I conducted hundreds, if not thousands, of personal and collective citizenship ceremonies in my then municipality of Clarence, which is now the city of Clarence. During all that time, I never once met a prospective citizen who was concerned about the oath or affirmation that they were going to take. All they were worried about was being a good citizen of Australia, and they were very proud to partake in that ceremony. I can recall only too well the numerous occasions on which I saw pride in the eyes of individuals when they repeated the words which obviously meant so much to them, coming to a country where they could be free.

You naturalised me. I remember that ceremony; it was a wonderful occasion'. At the ceremonies in our city, people were presented with a native eucalyptus tree. I usually asked them how the tree was going and, in most cases, they said that it was growing well. They look after it; it symbolises the event and reminds them of the happiness and pride they felt at the ceremony.

         As Senator Panizza said earlier, the receipt of Australian citizenship is probably the most important event for any migrant who has chosen to call Australia their home. As such, the oath or affirmation of allegiance should be a  meaningful occasion for the new citizen which reflects their loyalty to Australia. There is not one person who applies for citizenship without the knowledge that the Queen of Australia is our head of state. Therefore, I believe that we will create confusion in prospective migrants if we ask them to make a pledge of commitment that in no way refers to that head of state.

Senators know that, when enlisting for the defence forces, there is a requirement for an oath or affirmation to Her Majesty the Queen to be taken. Similarly, there is a requirement under section 42 of the constitution that members of the House of Representatives and members of this place make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Queen.

         This bill will guarantee nothing more than a situation where we have different statements of allegiance by different categories of Australians. This is hardly the evidence of a well thought out and considered initiative. Rather than strengthening our existing citizenship oath, this new legislation will merely weaken it. The pledge which is contained in the government's proposal reflects much less commitment than the oath or affirmation which was previously used. A pledge makes no reference to our head of state, our constitution, or any of our other basic institutions. It completely ignores the heritage on which our nation was originally founded. The vague allusions contained in the pledge to Australia and to its people, or to other concepts such as democratic beliefs, create no sense of sureness in the prospective citizen.

His recent outburst over the Olympic Games further demonstrates his willingness to ignore reality. When I witnessed members of the Australian community celebrating the selection of Sydney to host the 2000 games, it was quite obvious from the way they proudly paraded the Australian flag that they had no intentions or thoughts of changing this particular act, the flag or anything else—they were just proud to be Australian.

         —I rise to speak with a feeling of some anger. This morning I attended a citizenship ceremony in Canberra because a friend of mine was making an extraordinarily important decision in his life to become an Australian citizen. He was not a new settler; he had been here a long time. He loves this country and he wants to be a citizen of it. Interestingly enough, the person who drove me to the ceremony has lived here for 40 years and is also in the process of becoming an Australian citizen. One could say that it is one of the most important days of one's life when one makes a decision to become a citizen and to swear one's allegiance and loyalty to a new nation, to uphold its rights and duties and to give one's pledge that one will honour the country that one is becoming a citizen of.

         This is the nation's capital. As I sat here and heard earlier in the day from those on the government benches what I can only describe as cant—superficial language and superficial arguments as to why we should remove the whole concept of owing fealty and allegiance to an individual, and about getting rid of the concept of taking the oath or affirmation and replacing it with something called a commitment when one is pledging one's loyalty for the rest of one's life to this great nation—I thought once again that the attitude is downright un-Australian. We have a Prime Minister who is un-Australian. We win the Olympics and he comes home and says that we are all second-rate. We had just taken on the world and said that we are proud and have won and he comes back and says that we have to change everything because we are all second-rate. The only person who is second-rate in this whole equation is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As my colleague Senator Calvert has said, the so-called modest advertising budget that will be made available to go out and advertise—allegedly—this change in how one becomes a citizen will just be more of the unintentional or unrecognised hidden funding for the republican push and the changing the flag push of the Prime Minister.

They are proud of the sacrifice that others have given in the name of the nation and under that flag. At the end of the day, it is always well to remember that it is us who bring credit to our flag and not the other way around. The flag is there for us to rally to, not for it to bring glory upon us. If there has been a failure to take the Australian reputation and its symbols to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world recognise what they mean, the failure is the failure of the person in whom we have placed executive power—the Prime Minister. It is his responsibility to say that he is proud of his country and his people, but he cannot even do that. He cannot even fly his own flag on his automobile. What sort of a leader is that? He puts himself first and Australia second. This is just part of the continuing subterfuge of finding more money to promote the great crusade to become King Paul I of Australia.

I could see the pride within them because they had fulfilled their ambition to become an Australian citizen. I thought they deserved better and I think we should seriously look at having those ceremonies in this parliament. Two hundred people were to be done today. What a gathering and what a celebration that could have been. If only we could think first about how good we are, how strong we are and how magnificent it is to decide to become an Australian citizen.

         Senator Newman's question conveys the understanding that all of those families are social security pension beneficiaries. That is a misunderstanding of the payments to those families. Approximately 90 per cent of Australian families enjoy a family allowance payment that is also paid in the same way. I urge Senator Newman to be cautious in respect of what those statistics mean.

         Amongst other things, the assistance given to help rear children is a fair recognition by government of the importance of children. That is why we have the family payment and the family allowance supplement. When the family allowance supplement was introduced, the government did something that the opposition never did: it set benchmarks for the assistance of children. Those figures have been set; they are indexed; and they are there forever. I suspect that the opposition, if it ever were in government, would not remove them. So it is important to understand the meaning of that simple statistic which Senator Newman dropped into this place.

         In response to the second part of Senator Newman's question, it is quite clear from dealing with any people at all in the community that people who have a sense of confidence, a sense of their own place in the world and a sense that they are making decisions about their own lives are the ones who manage better. That is what this government recognises. It recognises the right of people to be assisted and the right of people to be able to stand on their own two feet, define their lives and make choices. That is the exact analogy of what the Prime Minister is saying to this country. When this country is standing on its own two feet, defining itself, confidently facing the rest of the world and winning Olympic bids, it is meeting the challenge that is faced by women in this country. Senator Newman should know that. As women are defining themselves and becoming more confident, so is the nation.

         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Did the government's humiliating backdown on the budget proposal for FBT on business travel, announced by the Assistant Treasurer in 1993, occur as a result of an analysis by Access Economics? Does the government and the minister agree with Access Economics that the proposal runs directly counter to the claimed job creation focus of the budget, undermines the government's deficit reduction strategy and, rather than reducing the federal deficit by $60 million, could increase the deficit by as much as, or even considerably more than, that amount? Will the government now back down further on its original backdown and completely abandon the proposal?

         —It is not the government's view that the measure concerned is likely to run counter to either job creation objectives or the deficit reduction strategy. It is always the case that every time there is a proposal to increase the tax on those best off, the opposition leaps to their defence with alacrity. I can say with 100 per cent accuracy that that has been the record of those opposite every time there has been a proposal to increase the rate of tax on those who are well off. Whether it be capital gains tax, the original introduction of the fringe benefits tax or whatever, they have at least been loyal on every occasion in their defence of the wealthy and well off.

         It has always been true that if one says to any business, `Could you employ more people if you did not have to pay any tax?', that business could always say yes. The net result of that is that revenue would not be raised. In net terms, there is no acceptance by the government that this proposal runs counter to its job creation strategy and it will, in our view, be quite—

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. That is a very interesting answer in view of the industry assessment that 20,000 to 30,000 jobs would be lost, not gained, as a result of the proposal. How does that fit in with the job creation process? In addition, even John Brown, a former Labor minister, said that this proposal was not about revenue. Even the departmental officials concede that. I think John Brown was right when he said that the tax was an `antiquated, philosophical dogma of the ALP, where Labor appears to have ceased its social maturation process and reverted to the worst aspects of envy and class warfare'. Does the minister agree?

         —As I understood it, the honourable senator asked something else. But I am very happy to respond to that question. The situation is simply this: I have been involved in public debate of public issues for 20 years and I have never heard an industry come forward and say, `This increase in tax is a great idea and we will create more jobs if only you would do it'. So coming forward with industry analyses which say that the industry does not think putting a tax on it is a good idea is not actually very unique. They all say that, and history usually proves that Chicken Little lives in most industries. They always say that the sky is going to fall in, and it very rarely does.

         The results of the meeting were to the following effect: it has been agreed that Australian Stevedores must achieve a level of labour costs which will allow it to achieve profitability and to compete effectively with other stevedores in the industry. A range of measures were explored this morning with a view to achieving this objective. Offers of voluntary redundancy will be made to employees of Australian Stevedores within one week in accordance with the retirement/redundancy agreement between the parties. Further meetings are planned, in accordance with a strict timetable, with a view to finalising an agreement by 29 October 1993. The parties will seek an adjournment of the current industrial commission proceedings to allow this to occur.

Although this house was originally envisaged by the founding fathers as a states rights house, that disappeared very quickly when political partisanship came into this chamber, as inevitably it must. Therefore, what this chamber has evolved traditionally as its historical role is that of a house of review but, again, that has always been governed to some extent by party discipline.

         I must say to Senator Kernot that some of the problems in terms of the powers of this chamber, the House of Representatives and the broad question of mandates would be better served if we had simultaneous elections rather than a hangover from elections several years ago which can well not reflect the meaning of the people. Under simultaneous elections it would be hard for a government to argue, where people voted separately in two elections held on the same day, that they did not intend a more diffused power structure.

         What goes up comes down. Does anybody think any of these opposition tactics will apply to the opposition if it ever wins government? Does anybody think any of those opposite would want any of the restrictions that are placed on us? Some of the changes that those opposite seek to put on us are applied now by way of sessional order; standing orders are never applied.

         The ABS publication says that last December, Australia's retail sector created an additional 35,000 to 40,000 seasonal jobs—jobs additional to the underlying pattern of an increase in employment. December 1993 has the potential to see an even bigger seasonal boost than in previous years. The government's fiscal policy is designed to provide an additional stimulus just so that there will be more available for people to spend in the retail stores this year, while laying down a firm schedule for reducing the budget deficit in the medium term.

         The key ingredient of that additional stimulus is the personal income tax cuts scheduled for 15 November. That will contribute at least $300 million in extra retail outlays to pump into the retail stores this year. It will be a great tragedy if the intransigence, the lack of cooperation—the sorts of problems that Senator Ray so articulately outlined in the Senate—and the fiscal irresponsibility of the Senate were to lead to the situation where those personal income tax cuts could not go ahead on time.

One of the values of the second parallel runway is that it will no longer be necessary to maintain simultaneous operations at Sydney airport. The use of both of the parallel runways will provide an extra 30 per cent capacity to Sydney airport. As I say, all of those matters were factored into the planning of the second parallel runway to the extent that the use of the east-west runway is not required to achieve that capacity unless the wind conditions provide that it is essential to use it.

         Last week I met with the President of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as part of my regular consultations. I would suggest that the president, Dr Hinde, might have a bit better idea of what is happening in his specialty than Senator Herron. Dr Hinde informed me that it was not true. He said that, while the increased cost of medical defence was putting a great deal of fear into the specialty, they had not been leaving it yet, but they might in the future if something was not done.

         In terms of Senator Herron's exact remarks, it is certainly true that in the USA there has been a greatly increased tendency for people to take out cases against obstetricians, although there is no evidence of increased cases here. I think there are two reasons why the medical insurance funds have put up the premiums for obstetricians so much. One is that they were shockingly underfunded in recent years and they have had to try to make up for that underfunding in a short period of time. The second is that while the number of cases has not been great, it is true to say that sometimes the payouts, the damages awarded, are very large indeed. While the college of obstetricians is prepared to concede that there is a danger that people might leave the field in the future unless we do something about it, it is certainly not of the view that such an exodus has already occurred.

         I intend to look very carefully at a study which hopefully will be published by about March of next year on this question and to try to deal with it in the first half of next year. Obviously we do not want obstetricians to leave in the future. It is a specialty that is of vital interest to all of us.

         In the four years from 1988 to 1992, Medicare data shows that there was a decline of only 3.7 per cent nationally in the number of specialists who perform more than five confinements or caesareans annually. The number of obstetricians practising in Australia in 1984-85 was 722 full time and 151 part time; a total of 873. By 1992-93 that was 748 full time, 167 part time and 18 others; a total of 933.

Senator Troeth asks: how can any tax stimulate employment? What we are doing to stimulate employment goes to the general macro-economic approach in which we are arguing, in this particular year, that we should have a budget deficit of $16 billion—and that will certainly have a stimulatory effect.

         It is also true to say that if we took taxes off all businesses, there would be some growth in employment. But there would also be a massive shortfall in revenue to any government. It is always easier to say, `If you do not have a tax covering this or that particular industry, you will have wider employment'. The main factor in the government's thinking is to make sure that the tax falls fairly right across-the-board and that the tax mix is right. That is something that Senator Troeth's party has no conception of at the moment because of the policy vacuum that exists.

As Minister Kelly acknowledged yesterday in the House of Representatives, today's 10- to 17-year-olds—our school children—will make up the bulk of the Olympic team for the year 2000. Will the federal government make a commitment to implement the 40 recommendations of the Senate inquiry into physical and sport education? This shows how the federal government can turn around the disastrous state of decline of physical education in schools across Australia and so not only help us to find the athletes for the year 2000 but also prevent a further decline in the health and well being of Australians.

         I refer to the locomotive economies of the world, the ones we have traditionally relied on to lift economic performance globally. The economy of Japan will probably return, in the year ending 30 March 1994, a negative growth of about half a per cent. The locomotive economy in Europe is Germany. This calendar year the German economy will contract by about two per cent. The United States, the other great pillar of economic growth in advanced industrialised economies in the world, is batting along at about a 2.3 to 2.5 per cent growth.

         It is salutary to recognise that the growth figure for Australia as at 30 June 1993 was 3.3 per cent—at the head of the OECD table. That is to say, in the face of the world economic recession that has bedevilled the West, Australia's rate of growth is the highest of any developed country in the world. Let us hear a comment of approval for Australia. Let us hear a bit of economic patriotism from those opposite. Let us hear a bit of analysis that encourages Australians to take advantage of the massive export opportunities that are growing in the Asia-Pacific region. Then this question can be seen for what it is—an attempt to slight those who have performed well for Australia and to confuse the rest of the community.

         The good news is that Australian rice growers have in store sufficient stocks to meet whatever demand is called upon to be supplied into that Japanese market. The Australian government has, of course, consistently registered with the government of Japan the need for it to open its rice markets and to regard the Australian product as a product that it can draw upon to meet the needs of its own consumers. We are competitive as a rice supplier in the world, both in terms of price and in terms of the quality of our product. Indeed, it can be said that Australian grown rice suits the needs of Japan almost more than other rice from any source. It is not, however, appropriate for a government to be grateful that weather conditions have created a marketing opportunity. While one should take advantage of that marketing opportunity, there are some structural issues about the Japanese market that need to be addressed here.

In my role as trade minister, I put to all three of them that it was important that Japan cease its policy of self-sufficiency and adopt a policy of food security, that is, not to try to produce all their food needs domestically but, rather, to have a mix of imports and domestic production as well and open their market accordingly.

         Secondly, the issue that begs for a comment here is the issue of the Uruguay Round. Both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Industry and Trade in Japan are firmly committed to the completion of the Uruguay Round by 15 December. They reassured me solidly on that point. But for the round to properly be completed with a balanced outcome across all sectors and in a fair way, it is important that the issue of agriculture be addressed. Specifically, in Japan and Korea that means addressing the closed rice market. The views that Australia has consistently argued—that the market should be opened—were again put by me as a means of successfully concluding the Uruguay Round. That means a commitment by Japan for comprehensive tariffication of its market barriers for rice across the board without exception. In view of this shortfall in domestic production, I hope that can be something that the government seizes on as a positive signal to help complete the Uruguay Round this year and reduce the price for Japan's own domestic producers in the interests of freer trade.

         —Last week I had the honour of presenting awards, on behalf of the Australian government, at a function hosted by the Business and Professional Women's Club of Canberra as part of the ACT small business week. During my speech, I referred to the published research, entitled

          Employment patterns and practices in small firms in Australia: an assessment of skill deficiencies and training needs
         </emphasis>
         , undertaken by Professor Alan Williams of the University of Newcastle. In his research he found that, of the more than 11,000 businesses surveyed, 38 per cent were owned and operated by men, 33 per cent were owned and operated by women and 28 per cent were jointly owned and operated by men and women.

         He also indicated that there was a marked shift towards women owning and running their own firms. If this trend continues, it is anticipated that certainly by the middle to the latter part of this decade a majority of small or micro businesses in Australia will be run and owned by women. We still do not have enough research on why this is occurring, but it is quite clear from anecdotal information around the place that women are more successful at running their own businesses than men.

         We believe that women are better at customer service and industrial relations. From what I have been told in discussions with the financial institutions, women are more cautious in their financial arrangements. They are better managers of the finances of a small business. They more thoroughly prepare their business plan for their small businesses than do men. One banker told me that if he had to choose between lending money for a small business to a man or a woman, he would lend to the woman because, on balance, according to the figures available, women are more likely to be more successful in running a small business.

         I think this is one of the significant changes in our society that has not been recognised. As small business is already providing the biggest part of economic growth and employment growth in Australia, we have to give due recognition to the fact that it is women who are doing it to ensure that we get the job growth for all Australians.

         The only area where we would like to see some increase in women's activity is the area of export oriented industries. A survey by the export access program shows that only about two per cent of those businesses that are successfully into export are actually owned and run by women. That is one area in which we would like to see an improvement in women's participation. Overall, this trend is very good for women but, above all else, it means a good outcome for Australia.

         I should point out what happened when the original question was asked, and I hope that Senator Sandy Macdonald noticed it. A barrage of interjections came from his colleagues on the opposition benches, who were clearly praying for an extension and continuation of the dock strike. It is totally consistent with the expression of their obvious disappointment that the industrial disputation would not be enlarged and would not continue. It is consistent with the permanent opposition mentality that has developed in the opposition here in the Senate and the completely negative approach it is taking to anything in here, despite the impact that it might have on Australia.

         Sheryle Bagwell says that she could not find a head-hunter willing to put any money on there being a woman chief executive for the Sydney Olympic Games organisation. Sadly, that is still not surprising. Despite the enormous gains made by women over the last decade, there is still not one woman chief executive at the helm of any of Australia's top 200 companies. The top 10 companies do not have one female board member. Women make up only 1.3 per cent of senior managers.

Apart from the ways in which Senator Ian Macdonald significantly misquoted me, the situation is simply as follows. The budget is predicated upon conservative assumptions about growth which indicate that 100,000 jobs net will be created in the next 12 months. That is what most people expect and that is what the trends are consistent with at the moment.

         This particular measure has several objectives, as have most tax measures, as Senator Watson at least would know. It is quite clear that on the evidence available this measure will raise some revenue. It is a revenue raising measure—that is not very remarkable; it will do so. It is true that it also has some distribution and equity aspects.

         I do not apologise for the fact that it is a tax measure that has some distribution and equity measures. I do not see any reason why I should apologise. I understand why Senator Ian Macdonald is upset because it has some distribution and equity measures and he is always leaping to the defence of the upper income people rather than being concerned about ordinary Australians whose tax cuts he is conspiring to delay. Any reasonable assessment of Senator Ian Macdonald's economic analysis would quite clearly indicate that he is way out of step with any economic analysis of these measures.

Of course, as Senator Robert Ray and I have said several times, every industry in Australia would rather pay less tax and, if there were no tax on the industry, every industry could establish how it could probably create more jobs. That is undoubtedly the case. However, one would have to get more revenue from elsewhere, which would have an adverse effect elsewhere. One has to realise that we need to balance the competing objectives that governments have to raise revenue and to fund the necessary services of government, including the construction projects that Senator Hill despises which create hundreds and thousands of jobs here and around Australia and about which I am very pleased.

         It does Senator Ian Macdonald no credit to analyse one bit in isolation, but nobody should be surprised about that.

It will continue to be a part of that and for that reason I welcome it.

Senator Ian MacDonald attacks our policies about fringe benefits tax and the impact it may have on small business when his party, at the last election, proposed a 15 per cent GST on the performance of every small business in Australia. His party was going to impose a tax that, in administrative terms, was much more wasteful in time and effort and resources for any small business than the FBT that we are talking about today. At the last election a large number of small businesses voted for the Labor Party for the first time, because they did not want to spend every Sunday night doing the bookwork on the GST—

The debate in this chamber concerns the imposition of tax by this government on small business. This is the government which said that it would not impose any new tax and then has proceeded to do so.

         If that is not good enough, it has a backdoor version as well. Today there was a draft ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation defining local council car parks as commercial car parks for the purposes of the fringe benefits tax for parking arrangements. In other words, by not having the ruling system subject to the parliament and tabling and disallowance, by discretion, the government is able, through its agency, to get further taxes imposed and collected by the Commissioner of Taxation. There is no way in the world that a local government car park which is provided for the benefit of shoppers and other community benefits is a commercial enterprise in terms of the legislation that was debated in this chamber.

         I think all of us remember back to the last election when the opposition did have the honesty and the integrity to come forward with a policy which would have radically changed the tax system. We think it would have helped the tourism industry. It was widely disliked by many people in the tourism industry. We had a very public fight with the tourism industry before the election, but we stood by our guns. Before the election, even many people in the opposition might have thought that it would be a lot easier to cave in to the tourism industry and to back off on the GST on tourism. We did not do that.

         Being on the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, week after week I see all of these tax policies weaving their way through our committee. One of the reasons—and it goes to the core of what Senator Macdonald was saying—why we get these taxes is that very few people in the Labor government, and particularly people in Treasury, have much idea of what makes small business tick. Senator Ferguson and I were discussing a question to the Minister for Science and Small Business, and that is, `How do you really get a small business in Australia?'. We were going to ask Senator Schacht. Of course, the answer is, `Give him a big business and just wait'.

         If the government continues to try to introduce all of these little taxes which impose new liabilities—and shock liabilities—on these small businesses, it will destroy the very engine that drives Australia and the small business sector. I believe Senator Schacht when he says that he cares about getting new small businesses going, but we really have to spend some time out there in the community. Those of us who work in Canberra for hundreds of days a year do not get to do that very often. If we do go out there and see the impact that these taxes have on these small businesses, we will realise that we are very much killing the goose that lays the golden egg.

It was in terms of the amount of time that we are obliged to spend in Canberra, particularly in this chamber, dealing with various matters. That does prevent the vast majority of us from doing other things we would prefer to do in terms of staying in contact with our constituencies, including the small business constituency, which is very important in Australia as a generator of investment, jobs and economic growth.

         Part of the reason we have to spend so much time in the national capital, in the Senate chamber, is the gridlock that has enveloped the Senate since the chamber resumed after the election of 1993. Circumstances have changed. We heard today that five straight election losses have caused the coalition to embark upon a totally negative campaign of destruction and vandalism. That is the main reason we are obliged to spend so much time here in Canberra in this insulated and isolated political environment. There is no doubt about that. If one looks at the amount of time spent on frivolous and fatuous points of order during question time, on nonsensical notices of motion and so on and so forth, one can see that gridlock in the American style grips the Australian Senate already. That is one of the main reasons we are not able to stay in touch with those parts of the Australian constituency which are of greatest significance.

         This debate has to be seen in the context of tax policy overall—in the context of taxes having come down since 1983 from the high period of Fraser, Howard and Stone when taxes routinely were over 60 per cent. They have dropped dramatically. We can now say, with absolute clarity and certainty, that the OECD has made the observation that Australia is the lowest taxed country in the western industrial world. That is not an assessment of the Australian government, although the government is happy to endorse and underline it. That is an assessment of the OECD—the lowest taxed country in the western industrial world.

         We had another wonderful exercise by the coalition, in this immediate debate subsequent to question time today, of yet another post-mortem where it publicly agonised again over why it lost the general election. It is an exercise in delusion to say, as some have said during the course of the afternoon, that it was simply the GST. I was pleased to hear Senator Bishop, as shadow leader of the opposition, yet again announce what opposition policy is—the GST no longer applies.

         That raises the question of which parts of Fightback still do apply. Is it still committed, for example, to the destruction of Medicare? That was a costly mistake that the coalition made in trying to sell that to the Australian people. The Australian electorate will never accept the destruction of Medicare. I would be particularly interested in Senator Herron's view on that. I know he is on record in the Senate as saying that the American health system is the best in the world for those who can afford it. I think I quote him accurately in that respect. So we are happy to contest that ground yet again.

All I have done during the course of this debate is take up points that have already been made by those opposite in their contributions—a simple matter of making judgments in respect of tax policy overall. It is true that in the context of the general election last time around much of the small business community not only voted for the ALP for the return of the Keating government but also actively canvassed the vote for the return of the Labor government. That is not something that happens routinely in Australian politics. It was unusual in that circumstance but, given the sorts of contributions we are seeing opposite, it would not surprise me in the least to see that repeated in 1996.

It is interesting that over the last 10-year period the number of jobs in the hospitality industry has grown by more than 100,000. So where is the enormous loss of jobs as a result of that measure?

        After two recent cases in Western Australia, the (then) President of the Australian Medical Association . . . , Mr Michael O'Halloran, quoted in the media figures which demonstrate that less than half the 80 or so specialist obstetricians and gynaecologists in Western Australia practise obstetrics, and further, that there are only three privately practising obstetricians in Western Australia who are less than 40 years of age.

        At the present time in Australia, there are approximately 2000 medical providers of obstetric services, of whom about 750 are specialists and the rest general practitioners.

        TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 1) 1993

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr. President, this bill is part of a package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, which was introduced into the Senate on 7 September 1993. That bill contained the Government's key Budget taxation measures.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As part of its campaign to obstruct the passage of the Government's 1993-4 Budget, the Opposition referred the Deficit Reduction Bill to a Senate Committee. The Committee was asked to determine whether, by combining measures dealing with several subjects of taxation, the bill contravened section 55 of the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Parliament has been passing taxation bills combining several subjects of taxation since at least 1984. Only now has this been raised as an issue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's senior legal advisers, and Parliamentary Counsel, gave advice to the Committee that the Deficit Reduction Bill was clearly valid and that none of its measures imposed taxation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Senate Committee concluded, correctly, that only the High Court can determine issues of constitutional validity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee also concluded that there was a risk that the bill would be declared invalid. This conclusion was contrary to the advice of the Government's Chief General Counsel and of other experts who presented their views to the Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government does not accept the Committee's conclusion. Moreover, the Committee gave no reasons for its conclusions and gave the Government no guidance as to how to split the bill.

        Views put to the Committee that the bill is invalid fall into two categories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        first, that any increase in the formal rate of a tax is an imposition of tax. This view draws an illogical distinction between a rate increase and an enlargement of a tax base.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        second, that any increase in liability to taxation is an imposition of tax. If this argument is accepted, then most of the tax laws passed over the past 50 years are also invalid. This is an absurd argument.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is entitled to rely on the clear and unequivocal advice of its legal advisers.
       </para>

        Nevertheless, the Opposition's actions on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill have created considerable uncertainty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has decided to remove that uncertainty and withdraw the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and to re-introduce the Budget measures in a package of related bills.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Apart from the measures included in the `test case' bill, the re-packaged bills would not be challenged by those who argue that the only amendments in the package which impose tax are those which increase a rate of tax.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has deliberately rejected the extreme view that any increase in the incidence of a tax is an imposition of tax. It has, therefore, refrained from structuring these bills to avoid a challenge from this quarter. If that view is correct, then virtually all of the Commonwealth's tax laws are invalid. It would be pointless to address those concerns without rewriting the corpus of all the existing tax laws.

        The Government also believes that the constitutional issues must be resolved once and for all, so that the Parliament can focus on the substance, and not the form, of Government initiatives. To allow the issue to be settled quickly, and without affecting the integrity of the Budget package, one of the bills (the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993) has been drafted as a test bill to facilitate a High Court challenge. This has been done by combining 2 minor rate increases involving different subjects of taxation. These measures do not affect revenue until after 1 July 1994.

        Mr President, I now turn to the three sales tax changes covered by this bill, and the other sales tax bills in this package.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first change will increase all sales tax rates by one percentage point, with effect from 18 August 1993. This is expected to raise $435 million this year and $585 million in 1994-95. A further one percentage point increase for all sales tax rates will come into effect on 1 July 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second change will increase the rates of sales tax on wine, also with effect from 18 August. Compared with beer and spirits, wine is lightly taxed. While it is presently subject to sales tax, it does not carry any excise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on wine with an  alcoholic content of greater than 1.15 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The rate of tax on low-alcohol wine, that is wine with an alcoholic content of 1.15 per cent or less, is to increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95, $105 million in 1995-96 and $110 million in 1996-97.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The last sales tax change will vary the rate of tax applicable to luxury motor vehicles, also with effect from 18 August 1993. Luxury vehicles are currently taxable at 30 per cent on their entire wholesale value. The current sales tax treatment results in a substantial pricing distortion:  the addition of one dollar to the wholesale price of a passenger motor vehicle now priced at the threshold would increase the sales tax liability by $4873.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is proposed to remove this distortion by applying a split rate of sales tax to luxury motor vehicles. Broadly, the ordinary rates of sales tax applicable to motor vehicles will apply up to the wholesale luxury threshold. A rate of 45 per cent will apply to that portion of the wholesale value over the luxury threshold.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $5 million in 1993-94 and $10 million in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.

        Mr President, the Qantas Sale Act 1992 received royal assent on 21 December 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At that time, it was expected that the sale of the Commonwealth's entire equity interest in Qantas would be completed in October/November 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In line with this expectation, and the requirement that all legislation should be proclaimed within a reasonable period after its passage by Parliament, the Qantas Sale Act contained provision for any of its unproclaimed sections to be automatically repealed if they had not been enacted by 31 December 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's recent announcement that the proposed initial public offering of shares in Qantas would be deferred until 1994-95 means therefore that, in the absence of any legislation to remedy this situation, the provisions intended to commence on the dates on which 50% and 100% of the airline are sold will, in fact, lapse on 31 December 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of most concern to the Government in this regard, naturally, are the employee-related provisions of the Qantas Sale Act—which are planned to come into effect on the day on which 50% of the airline is sold.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These provisions either "save",  post-sale, certain existing employee entitlements and rights arising from pre-sale service, or else they remove airline employees from the ambit of legislation applying only to employees of entities that are owned or controlled by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The premature removal of airline employees from the ambit of such Commonwealth legislation while the Qantas group remains 75% owned by the Commonwealth, and the failure to put amending legislation in place to retain those employees' already accrued benefits, gained pre-sale, would clearly be inequitable and could not be supported by the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is imperative that these provisions not be allowed to lapse.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To prevent any such inadvertent removal of the rightful entitlements of the airline employees concerned, I propose that the date of automatic repeal in the Qantas Sale Act be altered to accord with the rescheduled timing for the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth's shares in Qantas in 1994-95.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, the bill before the House amends the date of the automatic repeal of the unproclaimed sections of the Qantas Sale Act from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The opportunity is also being taken in this bill to make a minor amendment to the Qantas Sale Act to remove any doubt about the intended operation of section 37 of that Act.

         The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is a portfolio bill which will make minor amendments to the Commonwealth's anti-discrimination legislation, the Privacy Act 1988 and the High Court of Australia Act 1979.

        Last year, amendments were made to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984  and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992  to simplify and streamline the procedure for enforcing determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court. Briefly, that procedure provides that the determination, on being registered in the Federal Court, becomes enforceable as an order of the court after 28 days, unless the respondent to the determination applies for review of the determination within this period. I am concerned that this strict 28 day time limit may cause injustice in some circumstances, so I have introduced amendments to allow the Federal Court to review a determination outside this 28 day time limit in exceptional circumstances.

The guidelines to be formulated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist funds to develop non-discriminatory options were not finalised in sufficient time. Accordingly, I have introduced an amendment to delay commencement of the provisions until 1 July 1994 to allow time for the funds to be in a position to comply with the new regime.

        Workplace arrangements

        The bill provides a framework for employers and employees to cooperate and consult in addressing health and safety matters in the workplace. It does this through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees, and the selection of health and safety representatives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        An important aspect of the bill, in terms of the government's commitment to encouraging a uniform national approach to OHS, is that it provides for the adoption of suitable standards and codes of practice which have been declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The purpose of this Bill is to complete the process of bringing Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which Australia is entitled under international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Bill makes changes to existing law in four principal areas. These are establishment of rights in an exclusive economic zone, adoption of a revised definition of the continental shelf, assertion of rights in a contiguous zone and adoption of new international legal provisions for the drawing of territorial sea baselines.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principal legislation to be amended is the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. The Bill amends, in a consequential way, a number of other pieces of legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present the Seas and Submerged Lands Act refers to the 1958 Geneva Conventions on Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf. References to those Conventions are no longer appropriate. In 1982 a new United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was adopted and signed by Australia. Australia has not yet ratified the Convention. That Convention, however, now has 56 ratifications and is likely to enter into force in the near future (it needs 60 ratifications to do so). It is, apart from the provisions relating to mining of the deep seabed, generally accepted as reflective of international law. The Government considers that in relation to maritime zones the Convention should govern Australian practice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present, consultations are taking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties that have arisen under the Convention in relation to the provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. If these consultations are successful Australia and other developed States will be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the Convention and hence ensuring that it is universally accepted as the law on the subject. It is therefore appropriate, at this time, for Australia to amend its domestic law to bring its practice in relation to maritime zones into conformity with that provided for in the 1982 Convention. As I indicated earlier Australia considers the maritime zone aspects of the Convention to be reflective of customary international law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia has, over the years, gradually asserted its various maritime entitlements under international law. Thus, in 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed and in 1990 a 12 nautical mile territorial sea was established in place of the previous 3 nautical mile territorial sea. As long ago as 1979 Australia established a 200 nm fishing zone. The current Bill will complete the process of bringing Australia's maritime zones up-to-date. It replaces operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to the 1958 Conventions with references to the 1982 Convention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill makes clear that Australia asserts the full rights to which it is entitled under international law in a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. As stated in the preamble to the Bill, the rights that Australia has in such a zone include not just sovereign rights over both living and non-living resources but also jurisdiction as provided for in international law in relation to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The sovereign rights and the jurisdiction which a coastal State possesses in its exclusive economic zone in regard to these matters are set out in detail in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, the relevant parts of which form a schedule to the Bill. It will be for future legislation to deal expressly with matters such as pollution control in the exclusive economic zone.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also adopts the definition of the continental shelf in the 1982 Convention. The 1958 Convention defines the outer limit of the continental shelf in terms of a depth of 200 metres or beyond that to a depth capable of exploitation. This open ended definition has proved unsatisfactory and customary international law has recognised that the limit of the continental shelf is the edge of the continental margin, and that it does not include the deep seabed. The 1982 Convention contains in Article 76 a precise definition of the continental shelf. This is a minimum 200 nautical miles regardless of the physical configuration of the shelf. Beyond that distance, where the configuration of the continental shelf allows, however, the limit may extend to a distance not exceeding 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath. This limit is calculated either by reference to the depth of sediments or the distance from the foot of the continental slope, defined by gradient. Adoption of the 1982 definition will enable Australia to claim a larger total area of continental shelf than under the 1958 Convention. The gains made by adopting the new definition outweigh any potential minor losses and will bring Australian legislation into conformity with internationally accepted principles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also for the first time in Commonwealth legislation deals expressly with a contiguous zone. This zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea to a distance no greater than 24 nm from the territorial sea baselines. It is a zone in which a coastal State can exercise rights of control to prevent infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and to punish infringement of the above laws committed within its territory or territorial sea. It is envisaged that specific legislation such as the customs or quarantine legislation will in due course be amended to assert more fully the rights to which Australia is entitled in such a zone.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill amends in a consequential way a number of Acts as set out in Schedule 1. These amendments mostly relate to the definition of `continental shelf' in those pieces of legislation so as to remove references to the 1958 Convention. One amendment of particular note is the alteration of the adjacent area boundary under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in relation to Tasmania and Western Australia. This will ensure that the operation of that Act extends to all the areas of continental shelf which Australia is entitled to claim under the 1982 definition. The existing adjacent area `picture frames' which are used in certain offshore area legislation do not extend far enough in those two areas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The relevant parts of the 1982 Convention are set out in schedule 2 to the Bill and will form part of the revised Seas and Submerged Lands Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the passage of this legislation reflects the need for Australia with its significant interests as both a coastal and maritime State to position itself to take advantage of developments in the law of the sea. Australia's action in this regard will promote further consolidation of coastal and maritime State rights and obligations as set out in the 1982 Convention.

         —Today we are discussing the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993, which contains proposals by the government to change the oath of allegiance given by Australians who take out citizenship in this country. To say that this is premature is an understatement indeed. It is well ahead of its time. If Australia were ever to become a republic, one might then change the oath of allegiance. Until that time occurs, there is no requirement, no need and no reason to change the oath of allegiance.

         The only reason the government is bringing this up now through this bill is to allocate to itself nearly a quarter of a million dollars to use towards its pro-republican campaign. That is what would flow from the passing of this bill. A sum of about a quarter of a million dollars would go to the government towards the support of its republican campaign so that it could continue to undermine the stability of this country in the way that it has been attempting to do in recent times. The government is using the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 as a vehicle to allocate that money to itself.

         One of the most significant things that a person could ever do in his or her life would be to take out citizenship of another country. It is not something that I have had to do; it is not something that I would ever expect to do. But I have been to a number of citizenship ceremonies. One cannot attend a good citizenship ceremony without being impressed by the significance of the occasion and by what it must mean to a person to do that.

         There are people who take out citizenship in this country because they have had to flee the country they were born in. They have had to find somewhere else to live. They would virtually have had to be without a home and without a country to belong to before they found somewhere else. This has gone on since the Second World War. A number of people came here, particularly from Europe, because they were displaced persons.

         Some people live here for many years before they finally take out citizenship. Having lived in this country for perhaps a long time while retaining citizenship of another country, people find it a very emotional experience when they finally make the commitment that Australia is where they belong. Some people have come here as young people to make a life for themselves; others have come here with young children to make a life for their family in this country because of the stability and opportunities that it offers.

         A citizenship ceremony, which has all of these emotions present in the air, is a very solemn, happy and moving occasion. All of that suddenly seems to be going out of the window, particular this year. I refer to the way in which the citizenship ceremonies are being run, at least in Canberra. I can only conclude that it is at the direction of the minister that the occasion should be downgraded and that the circumstances in which the ceremony takes place should no longer be presented as significant, but as a mere routine bureaucratic arrangement.

         Since I have been in the Senate, the ceremonies in Canberra were held in the theatrette at the National Library. They were very simple, but moving occasions and very worth while indeed. One of the members of federal parliament from this electorate always took part and was invited to speak. For many years Australian native plants have been handed out to those who have received their citizenship as a mark of the occasion. I think that still occurs. It was an occasion where people really felt that something important had occurred.

         More recently, the citizenship ceremonies have been held at the Community Centre in Dickson. That also is a very suitable place and a nice occasion. I have been to a number of excellent ceremonies there that I and those who have taken out citizenship have enjoyed. Those involved have felt that they were doing something and that their commitment to this country was being recognised.

         I took part in an excellent citizenship ceremony in the open at Commonwealth Park in Canberra on Australia Day this year. It was a great occasion. There was a citizenship ceremony at a Lions Club dinner, and I also attended one to mark Refugee Week at which the ACT Chief Minister officiated. All those who took out citizenship on that occasion were refugees.

         Twelve other ceremonies have taken place at the offices of the department in Canberra and in the room about which Senator Bishop spoke earlier today. In fact, today 10 groups totalling 200 people are going through that room because the space is not big enough to hold a ceremony for all 200 people at once as there is in the Dickson Community Centre, in the theatrette of the National Library or in this building, as has already been pointed out.

         There are plenty of places in Canberra where one could hold a citizenship ceremony for 200 people with a little style, unlike the way it was done this morning in Canberra. Ten separate groups came in and out every few minutes, people were given a plant and they were sent on their way. No other people were invited to take part in the ceremony or to speak or to be in any way welcoming to the participants. I can only conclude that it is a deliberate policy of the Government to downgrade the nature of the ceremony. It has culminated today in this bill, which deals with changing the oath of allegiance.

         I also wonder why this bill is being brought in today. It is not urgent. One would have to say that it is to fill in time in the Senate—presumably while the government attempts to get its budget program in order. Why else would we be having this rushed through today when there are, according to the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, so many other things that ought to be dealt with? Every night when he has been on the news in recent times—petulant little man that he is—he has preached about the Senate holding up the budget and business generally and the Senate not doing this and that.

         The Treasurer keeps abusing us for not dealing with important legislation. Yet today this bill to change the oath of allegiance is the No. 1 priority of the Government. Let the people of Australia note that. The republican push and changing the oath of allegiance are much more important to this government than any of the other things that it keeps talking about. Let us not forget that.

         There is no necessity to change the oath of allegiance at present. Nothing before us deals with changing the oath that we as members of parliament take when we are sworn in after each election. The reason is that in order for us to do so the constitution would have to be changed. Nothing before us changes the oath that a member of the armed services takes when entering the forces. I can only conclude that taking out citizenship of this country is less important to the government than any of these other things. I do not accept that as reasonable or correct.

         This oath should not be changed unless there is a change to the structure of this country. I can see that one would have to change it in that event. In other words, if we became a republic, the oath as it presently stands would need to be amended. But that is not the case. For some reason, we have this matter before us today when the Treasurer keeps abusing the Senate for not dealing with the important business of the Government. He should be told what we are actually doing today.

         Someone should tell the Treasurer that this morning we passed nine bills. It was a pretty good morning in the Senate. I am not suggesting that they should not have been dealt with.

But we are now considering the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 as the next most important thing to be dealt with.

         The bill does not deal with things such as dual nationality, which is important and has some substance; it just deals with changing the oath of allegiance to fit in with some other agenda. I refer to the oath and the pledge, as it is called, for the future. The present oath of allegiance is as follows:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.
       </para>
       <para>
        That recognises the constitutional structure of this country and its institutions. Within it the person taking out citizenship makes his or her own personal declaration: `I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen'. That is what one would expect it to say.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The pledge that we are now given contains no commitment—nothing! It states:

        There is absolutely no substance to it, and anybody reading it would know that. One can only wonder why the government would come forward with a pledge in that form.

         It is worth having a little look at the words that we are discussing. The oath of allegiance, which is a solemn appeal to God and a solemn commitment to some person to some thing, is being abandoned. It is an attestation of the truth of what one is saying and of the binding character of the promise to testify on oath. An oath of allegiance has some significance and depth to it.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I agree that the word `pledge' is a solemn promise. But the word `pledge' has other meanings—such as a pledge of aid; a pledge or a security for the payment of debt. Although it has a meaning of promise, it is not a word used in that fashion and it is not a word that has any real depth or meaning to it. We are not talking about such a concept when talking about taking out citizenship of this country. One can have a `promise'—I accept that word—which is a declaration with respect to the future that one will do or not do, or give or not give something. In my opinion, a promise has much more meaning to it.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The term `to swear an oath', as it is worded at the present time, means to make a solemn declaration with an oath of allegiance to Almighty God. It does not have the same meaning when used by many people who make the affirmation, which states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I solemnly and sincerely declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.

        The commitment to this country should recognise the constitutional status of the country. It should show some understanding of what a person is doing in taking out the oath of allegiance and making one's commitment to this country.

        I heard another form of words recently that I think is worth bringing into the debate. It was given by emeritus Professor Ralph Elliott in a radio program in Canberra when he was asked what he thought about the change in the words. Acknowledging the Labor Party's attitude to this—which I think is probably not his own—by leaving out reference to the head of state, his suggested words were:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I hereby solemnly promise (before God) to be a loyal citizen of Australia, to obey its laws, to cherish and safeguard its democratic institutions, and to foster mutual respect between the country, all its people and myself.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a much more personal way of wording the commitment. It puts much more of oneself into it than the words that have been given to the Senate to consider today. I am not suggesting that Professor Elliott would change the present oath—I certainly would not—but at least that type of wording is a far more personal commitment than the words given to us today, which I regard as totally inadequate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I have indicated, there are two aspects to this matter; the words themselves and the complete lack of depth and meaning to the pledge that is presented, and the government's attitude towards the ceremonies which are conducted to enable people to take out citizenship. I hope the Senate will throw out this bill. The matter could be looked at at an appropriate time when, if ever, there was to be a change in the constitutional status of this country. This has not yet occurred and will not occur.

         The bill before us at this time has no place in the Senate. There is no requirement and no need to change the oath of allegiance for Australian citizenship. I ask the government to withdraw the bill and to not bring it forward either in this fashion or at all until such time as it would naturally fit into a constitutional change in the country. I think the mere fact that the other oaths I have mentioned are not being amended and are not being capable of being amended indicates that there is no real substance to this, other than to try to boost the government's republicanism push and to enable it, quite wrongly and quite falsely, to get hold of taxpayers' funds to help them push this along.

         —Unlike some of the previous speakers, I consider the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill to be an extremely important piece of legislation because it is dragging this nation state of Australia into the 21st century. It was only 45 years ago that this country established its own right of citizenship. I was a mere child at the time this happened. It took a further 25 years, and it was under the Whitlam government, before the oath was changed to reflect the monarch as the monarch of Australia.

         Here we are 20 years later—one can hardly say we are galloping along to reform—actually making changes that are relevant to Australia in 1993. They probably were relevant to Australia in 1973, but because of the way the parliament was structured at the time it could not happen. It can hardly be said that what has been proposed in the chamber this afternoon is revolutionary.

I am one of the few elected representatives of the parliament of Australia who has gone through a citizenship ceremony. I have not been as lucky as those who were born in this wonderful land. I came here by choice. But I am perhaps luckier than most because of where my mother was as at the time of my birth. That is a different story and we will not canvass an argument about the two.

         I had to think long and seriously in my adopted homeland before I took the oath of allegiance—before I became a citizen of this country. I had made the decision long before I took out citizenship to remain permanently in this land. The hardest decision I had to make was whether to pledge allegiance to the Queen. The oath says the Queen of Australia. They were the words of the oath that I used. We should recognise that people around the world recognise Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Great Britain, or even more specifically, as the Queen of England. The oath says `Queen of Australia'. We do have a Queen of Australia because it is in our law, but we do not have an Australian queen.

         This is an extremely important piece of legislation for multicultural Australia in 1993. It has taken a long time to get here. I am aware that there were two previous attempts to bring about this change under the administration of Bob Hawke. Both those attempts failed. I certainly hope that on this occasion the Senate will make the decision to endorse this bill and send it off to the House of Representatives. Sixty days after receiving royal assent it will become law and new citizens who take the oath next year, when it effectively becomes law, will be espousing words that truly and honestly reflect modern day Australia and not the anachronism of colonial Australia from where this developed. Australian citizenship has been in existence for only 45 years.

Certainly, there is no difference in law. I do not know why people are getting a head of steam up about whether we call it a pledge or an oath.

         In my opening comments I made reference to my birthplace. It is not only people from my birthplace who have problems with pledging allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. My wife also had the same problems. Finally she took the decision and became an Australian citizen, pledging her commitment under the oath as it was written at that time. But even she, born in London within sight of Buckingham Palace, the Queen's residence, had problems in pledging allegiance to the Queen when becoming a citizen of her adopted homeland. This is despite the fact that she was brought up to recognise the sovereignty of the Queen. Of course, everybody knows that London is the capital of England and as a child she recognised clearly and plainly that the Queen is first and foremost the Queen of England.

         The fact that the Queen is the Queen of Australia is only a secondary consideration; it is only really words on paper.

One has to ask: why would a government wish to do this? Is this change in the interests of the Australian people or perhaps is it really in the interests of people from other countries? What is the real reason for this legislation?

If a person is born in another country, such as Senator McKiernan, he can receive Australian citizenship and not have to renounce the citizenship of his country of birth. But if an Australian goes to another country and applies for citizenship in that country—he would not even have to receive it—he would automatically forfeit his Australian citizenship.

Mr Keating and some of the people on the other side seem to think that we have to change our constitution and our oath of allegiance so that we can become a republic in the mistaken belief that we will become more like Japan, which is a constitutional monarchy.

         I am steadfastly opposed to this bill. I am steadfastly opposed to weakening the requirements that we have of people who seek from us the benefits and advantages of citizenship of this country. I say: Australia for Australians. I welcome to these shores with open arms people who want to become Australians first and foremost. People who want to weaken the test and requirements of Australian nationality are unpatriotic. This bill is unpatriotic. Most importantly, this government is unpatriotic, not only in what it does but also in what it fails to do—to address the real issues of this nation. That is why it ought to be thrown out.

         People on the opposition benches are steadfastly opposed, to use Senator O'Chee's words, to the proposition that Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia. They are opposed to the proposition that Australian citizenship is a common bond involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians while respecting their diversity. They are opposed to the proposition that persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and accept these obligations. They are opposed to people who are going to become Australian citizens pledging loyalty to Australia and its people. They are going to oppose that proposition when they oppose the bill.

Senator McKiernan has made a great contribution while he has been here. He has an Irish background. He would not be alone in Australia, I hope, in having some connection with that great and magnificent country. The suggestion that he in some way swore allegiance as a means of obtaining something that he would not otherwise have obtained casts an aspersion on his character which is completely undeserved. He is as loyal and as great an Australian as any other person in this chamber, and I think that ought to be stated.

It has nothing to do with in any way insulting the Queen, a monarch for whom we all have great love and respect. That is irrelevant to the present debate. It is not irrelevant to the present debate that people who vote against this will be voting against the propositions that are set out in clause 3 and the schedule in clause 8. The schedule contains that pledge—that beautiful form of prayer almost—that people who want to become Australian citizens are asked to take and which manifests very clearly what is expected of them and which is very understandable.

         The pledge must be very plain as to what people are doing, very understandable in the context of where it is sworn and very clear as to what it means. People do not swear allegiance to any particular person who may or may not be in a country. Rather, they swear that they will be loyal to Australia and its people; that they will be loyal to Australia's democratic beliefs, which they share; that they will be loyal to the proposition that rights and liberties should be respected; and that they will be loyal to the proposition that laws that Australia or the states of Australia proclaim will be upheld and obeyed. It is a very simple, very effective, wonderful pledge and one that is historic.

Lately he is being considerably overworked because the government is finding itself in many positions in which it has to call on Senator Cooney's very great debating skills. Nevertheless, I do not think Senator Cooney was terribly convincing in his defence today. This is the third time in the 10 or 12 years since 1973 that the government has tried to change the Australian Citizenship Act and denigrate the pledge that people have to make to become citizens of Australia.

This was the oath that people were given in feudal times and it is ridiculous to suggest that there is anything similar to it now.

         The role of the oath has changed since then, but the oath that was taken in 1824 by Timothy Pitman, the first person naturalised in Australia, is a recognisable predecessor of the oath or affirmation that new citizens take today. That is another tradition that we have and the Labor Party is so keen to change. The long history of our oath of allegiance gives it weight, depth and feeling. Many residents who choose to become citizens find it deeply moving that they are reciting an oath that links them to our great traditions and to the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who took the oath before them.

         —That was the argument put by the other side. The question emerged as a political concern in the early 1980s when the Fraser government decided to institute national consultations on citizenships. The consultations produced evidence that suggested that a large number of permanent residents were not taking out citizenship because the government's 1983 bill was directed toward encouraging residents to take out citizenship by reducing the language requirement from adequate to basic and by reducing the residency requirement from three to two years. But what was discovered in that exercise was that people were concerned that if they took out citizenship in Australia, they would have to renounce their original citizenship and that that would not allow them to go back. That was one of the main reasons for that inquiry concluding that people were not taking Australian citizenship. So it had nothing to do with the Queen or an Australian oath of allegiance.

         It was also my first real introduction to the trade union movement, something that was to have a profound effect on me in time to come. In the late 1970s I returned to live in Tasmania, with my interest in politics growing by the day. I joined the Labor Party in 1982 and became heavily involved in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP from that time on. In 1989 I became state secretary of the Australian Timber Workers Union, which is now a division of the CFMEU, the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, a position I held until elected to the Senate.

         This provided me with the opportunity to represent workers in an industry where employers had neglected to address matters such as training and education, that had pay rates that were not commensurate with the tasks performed, and where there was no recognition of skills and no career advancement opportunities. During my four years as secretary I saw many changes that were brought about by the efforts of the union—changes that not only improved conditions for workers but also improved the whole work process and led to greater productivity and efficiency within the industry. I believe I can say quite categorically that none of those changes would have occurred without the efforts of the union. I would like to congratulate the leadership of the union at both the national and state level on the great contribution they made and to thank them for the support they gave me.

         Of course, not all employers would accept such processes. One example of this is the APPM dispute that occurred at Burnie. For the first time in a long time in Australia's industrial history, workers were confronted with the type of bastardry that the opposition would have us believe does not exist in this country—where an employer sought to deny workers the fundamental right to be collectively represented and organised. To their great credit, the overwhelming majority of those workers took the issue on and fought for what was right. They should be commended for their effort, their unity and their commitment to protect that fundamental Australian democratic right.

This action, plus the industrial relations policy it went to the election with, simply does not gel with the calls it now makes for fairer treatment of the working class Australians. It is policies such as those and the actions of many of Australia's employers that maintain my commitment to the trade union movement. I will do whatever I can to ensure its survival and the continuation of its role of representing workers of this country. In saying that, I do not imply a disinterest in or lack of understanding of the concerns and aspirations of Australian business, nor a disbelief in profit making or business success.

         Of course, the opposition still clings to the belief that we have to get rid of unions to free up the labour market and allow bosses to sit down with their workers individually and supposedly work out a fair deal for all. However, one of the major problems with that approach is the management in many of Australia's companies and businesses. Because of their lack of foresight, initiative and general incompetence, to them a free labour market means reducing wages and conditions of workers and not working smarter or developing new products or, indeed, seeking new markets or improving the quality of products they produce. Of course, this leads to claims about the current industrial relations system—the system that is supposed to give unions all power.

         I would like to give an example of how it does not and how employers are exploiting workers even under this presumably restrictive system. This example involved four unemployed sawmill workers who, in seeking work, had a proposition put to them that they could set up their own business and operate their own sawmill. The proposer of this deal would sell them the logs necessary to cut the timber and then would on-sell the finished product for them. Of course, they had no money to start with, so the proposer would lend them the first month's rent for the sawmill as well as some other money for outgoings.

People would be less able to save, with less to spend, and the result would be additional job losses to those already occurring through productivity and efficiency gains.

We had a Third World pattern of exports and a government—the Fraser government—that chose to ignore the potential trade opportunities within the Asian region. A decade later the Australian economy has been transformed. Certainly we still have high unemployment, but the rest of the picture is dramatically changed. Our economic fundamentals have been dramatically improved through building a much more competitive economy, along with a cooperative approach to industrial relations; greatly enhanced levels of education and training, research and development and export assistance; a much more competitive business tax system; and a government that is promoting and pursuing trade opportunities in Asia as well as the rest of the world.

In short, we have a much more innovative, productive and competitive economy than 10 years ago and, as a result, Australia is better placed to advance the welfare and living standards of its people.

         The government, during its 10 years in office, has been about vision and a clear sense of direction. We set out to transform the Australian economy, and we have. Australia is on a fundamentally different path now to that which it had followed for most of this century, and Australians have accepted this change in direction. Even the opposition, which governed Australia for most of this century and made it what it was up to 1983, has fully accepted this change, and its criticisms are not about the directions we have taken, but rather that we are not demolishing quickly enough the structure it put in place.

         But where do we go from here? The government's objectives are straightforward enough. They are: to increase the rate of economic and employment growth, thus increasing real incomes and reducing unemployment; to enhance the level of our domestic savings, which is an essential element of addressing our balance of payments problem; to continue the process of making Australia a creative, innovative manufacturing nation; to improve the international environment for our export industries by new and improved international trade arrangements; to establish a new vocational education and training system which will better meet the needs and priorities of industry; and to continue to enhance social justice in our society. Therefore, there should be no doubt about where the government is taking the nation. The record shows that we are headed in the right direction.

         These measures have been continued in the latest budget which, despite all the claims, maintains a fairer society and yet continues the program of returning this country's economy to a stable and vibrant position for the future. Of course, we have not solved all of our problems, and one of the fundamental issues that we must continue to address is that of unemployment. Although we have put in place substantial labour market programs for the next 12 months, including the continuation of programs such as newstart, jobclubs, LEAP, NIES and so on—which have been very successful in getting people into full-time work—we cannot rest there.

         Personally, I believe there are some areas that must be given special consideration. In particular, we should look at imports which come into this country. I do not believe we can continue to allow imports to come into this country without a greater requirement for identification of the country of origin. The buy Australian program must be revitalised and the loopholes that allow the current system to be rorted must be removed. We must be able to guarantee Australians that when they seek to buy Australian they really can buy Australian. This is a matter I intend to pursue with some vigour, particularly in the area of forest products, which represent around 10 per cent of this country's imports.

         Obviously, part of the process of addressing import replacement will be business investment and development. However, a lot of Australian companies seem to be sitting on their hands in this respect. But there are now good reasons why investment should commence: profit shares are at quite high levels and rising; and the gross operating surpluses of trading enterprises are at high levels compared to this stage of recovery from the previous downturns in the mid-1970s and 1980s. It is also 22 per cent higher than it was in March 1983 when Labor came to office. Real unit labour costs have been virtually stable. All this, coupled with low inflation and interest rates and further business tax concessions in the budget, has provided a better business investment outlook for the future.

         The budget measures are, of course, important. Together with business tax concessions announced in the One Nation package, they form a comprehensive array of incentives. They also provide a very competitive tax regime compared to those of our trading partners, even our Asian trading partners. The new company tax rates are 33 per cent, down from 39 per cent—something the opposition was going to increase to 42 per cent had it won the election. I must say that there have been some interesting comments from business about that.

         The strategy on which this year's budget has been based is to enhance growth in the short term through further expenditure for job creation and tax cuts, which will lead us into a longer term recovery that will come as the world economy picks up. What I now find difficult to understand—in fact, almost inconceivable—is the current position being adopted by the opposition in respect of this budget. On the one hand it claims to want fiscal responsibility, yet on the other it is opposing the government's revenue raising measures. I can understand its disappointment at losing the supposedly unlosable election, but Australians should now judge it for the reckless disregard it is showing for the welfare of this nation.

         Another area of concern to me is our economic relationship with New Zealand. While I believe it is necessary and important, I find it difficult to accept the imbalance that lies in the employment related area. I know that the Senate has conducted inquiries into some aspects of this, but the problem still seems to exist. Regardless of the explanation, I do not see why the people of New Zealand should be treated differently from people from other countries when it comes to working in Australia, or vice versa for that matter. It should be noted that, on current figures that can be identified, the New Zealand work force in Australia represents about two per cent of our current unemployed people, and I believe this is unacceptable.

         I would now like to turn to two other key issues facing Australia today. The first relates to land rights and native title, which have been highlighted by the recent Mabo decision. In essence, this decision provided us with the opportunity to appropriately address something that has been wrong for so long. The unfortunate thing about the debate is that some interest groups have tried to politicise it. All sorts of instant experts have come out of the woodwork, none more notable that Hugh Morgan of Western Mining. He made all sorts of statements about land claims but there was one claim he was not telling us about—that was the greatest claim jumping exercise in Australia's mining history, and he lost. However, regardless of all the politicising and disruptive tactics of some, the government will introduce legislation that will do something genuine about this longstanding and unacceptable situation. I hope that all honourable senators will support such steps.

         Finally, I would like to speak about Australia becoming a republic. This is something I have supported for a long time, not because of any disrespect for our historic links with Britain or the monarchy; rather, I support it for the reasons that it should occur. This country has developed socially to the point where it is necessary for us to become a republic if we are to gain a sense of completeness. For me, it is the only way that a full sense of pride can exist for all of Australia's people. It will be like the completion of a long journey or making the final payment on something one has never owned. Regardless of people's views, I do not think anyone could reject the notion of having an Australian as head of this country.

         Surely the most recent event of Sydney winning the 2000 Olympic Games brings home the importance of having a head of country and, indeed, a flag that would truly be our own. I am sure it would seem odd to other countries that, following our competing against Manchester, England, for the Olympics, we then turn around and have the Queen of England open our Olympics. There are no valid reasons why we should not become a republic. We should get on with the job and instil even greater pride in this great country.

         Before Senator Murphy's initial contribution we were debating the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993. I was saying that there are about one million people in Australia who have immigrated to Australia and who have not become Australian citizens. Sixty-one per cent of those people have Irish, British or New Zealand origins. As I said before, those people felt that they were part of the society and part of Australia, but had not become Australian citizens. A further study showed that 40 to 60 per cent of residents from non-English speaking Mediterranean countries, north-western Europe and Third World countries became citizens almost immediately. Overall, 80 per cent of those people from those countries became Australian citizens.

         The study showed that the most important reason why people did not become citizens was that many countries did not allow dual citizenship. I suppose people needed to feel that if they were not satisfied here, they could go back to their original country. The study also showed that the oath or affirmation were not significant reasons why migrants did not become Australians. The myth that has been perpetrated from the government side of the house that they did not become citizens because they had some fear of, or opposition to, taking the oath of allegiance is simply not correct. The government believes that it has a monopoly on history.

The Australian people are quite happy to participate in either side of the debate. They can deal with it. If Australian people had listened to the opposition's view back in the 1890s, we would never have got Federation. In the early 1890s we had the worst economic crises in this country's history and, at the same time, we developed the Federation. We were able to have referendums to establish the Federation of Australia, despite Australia going through the worst economic crisis since white settlement began.

         This simple bill contains what we now call the pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia, as well as the preamble, as amended by the Australian Democrats, which reads, `recognising that Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; and Australian citizenship as a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, and by sharing their democratic beliefs, and by respecting their rights and liberties, and by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia'.

There have been reports in the press that, in the last few months since this legislation was introduced into the parliament, people turning up at citizenship ceremonies to become citizens of Australia have been upset that they cannot use the new oath of commitment. This is an indication that people want to be loyal to Australia and want to be able to take that pledge.

         The opposition is not interested in those people. It wants to use an oath of allegiance that is clearly written for the 19th century. This is indicative of where the politics of the opposition are. Its politics are the politics of the 19th century. It cannot cope with progressive, evolutionary change in respect of the identity of Australia, the feeling of pride that Australia can stand alone and the belief that Australians want to identify with their own symbols and not the symbols of another country.

         As I have said in previous debates, these are the politics of the permanent opposition. I have said before that this is the first time since federation that members of the non-Labor side in the Senate have not had ministerial experience. That is the truth. Nobody opposite has had to accept ministerial responsibility and the responsibility of being in government. Opposition members have ended up like the Labor Party unfortunately was in the 1950s and 1960s: satisfied with being in permanent opposition, collecting the money for being here, but not really wanting to be in government. That is where opposition members are at.

Once the Senate passes this bill and its provisions are publicised and made available, I anticipate that many more people will come forward to take out citizenship in Australia. They will see that this oath of commitment is, for them, a commitment to Australia and the society they want to be a part of rather than, in the case of the present oath of allegiance, a swearing of allegiance to a head of state on the other side of the world.

         There was a debate between Arthur Calwell and Mr Menzies during a debate on a bill relating to the flag in 1952. One member referred to the blue in the flag as the blue which reminded him of the clear Australian sky. Arthur Calwell said the blue in the flag reminded him of the Eureka flag. Arthur Calwell was a very strong supporter of the Australian flag as was Dr Evatt, Ben Chifley and Curtin. The history of the Labor Party, right up until the time of Paul Keating, regarding national symbols was at one with the Australian nation.

When we are debating the independence of Australia, I invite Australians to look at that report because in that report Senator Schacht, the mover of the republican motion, also advocated a recommendation that Australians have access for domestic disputes to UN committees. For the first time since the passing of the Australia Act of 1986, when the Australian legal system became self-contained, Senator Schacht decided that the government should open up appeals by Australians in domestic disputes to foreign judges. Senator Evans has called this the new internationalist agenda.

When a representative of the Australian Republican Movement came before the committee I put to him, to make it clear, that this oath should be assertively more Australian. He said that he did not feel that was needed; in fact, he felt that could be regarded as a divisive element. If we are really wanting to beat the nationalist drum, surely those words, which have been part of the oath for a large number of years, should be included?

        That is an assertively American republican oath. Of course, in Australia, under the somewhat equivocal nationalism of the Labor Party, such a sentiment is not acceptable. We see in the current oath that there is no element of any loyalty to any particular institution, constitution or head of state. That is another weakness of the oath of allegiance.

         It is interesting, because of the nationalism that Senator Schacht tried to manifest in here, that there was a debate in the cabinet about whether the word `nation' should be included in the oath. Those great nationalists in the Labor Party—Mr Keating and his ministers—reflected on whether it was really politically correct to include the word `nation' in the oath. Former Senator Tate was kind enough to inform the committee investigating this bill that the Labor Party felt that the word `nation' did not have the right resonance for the current period. Again, it shows just how equivocal the Labor Party is on these particular issues.

         Senator Cooney said that he felt this debate we are having today should not be confused with the republican debate. I think Senator Cooney was wrong. This is entirely part of the republican debate. Anyone who, like myself, has a great respect for Senator Cooney and the contributions he makes to debates would listen to his comments and think about them. But Senator Schacht made the point that the oath is indeed part and parcel of the Labor Party's republican push. It is part of that wider debate. We do not know what sort of republican constitution the Labor Party wishes to put forward to the Australian people. I believe, with good reason, that the Australian people are becoming increasingly nervous about the sort of republic that Mr Keating would have in mind.

         The oath of allegiance is part of a wider debate on the republican issue. It is a desperate attempt to remove what the Labor Party sees as an offensive symbol in the oath of allegiance. I have to say that no people are faster to swear allegiance to Her Majesty than members of the Labor Party when they win office. When Mr Keating stabbed Mr Hawke in the back he was quickly up to Yarralumla to swear the oath of allegiance as Prime Minister. There was no concern or hesitation in the Labor Party at that time about any oath which contained a reference to Her Majesty.

         This was adverted to in the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp and Senator O'Chee. They quoted Sir Ninian Stephen as saying that the act is an `abysmal document', that not only is it an extraordinary example of legal and bureaucratic language but that it is extraordinarily inappropriate for its title. The dissenting senators went on to say, `We believe it is inappropriate to make piecemeal amendments prior to such a full-scale review'. I am inclined to the view that the amendment being put is not piecemeal.

It says to people of different religions and different ethnic backgrounds, `We respect your right to celebrate your religions and your diversity, and we will ensure that there are mechanisms in place to ensure that you can enjoy those rights, privileges and religions in a way that is tolerated, supported and recognised by the rest of society'.

         The approach we are taking is inclusive and to that extent we can be compared with many other parts of the world which take an approach to migrants coming to live in those countries which excludes them from full participation in the society in which they live.

         It has been barricaded into the past. It lost the last election because it has not responded to that social change and it is in danger of doing the same again—not because next time it will not have a social policy but because next time it will have an anachronistic social policy, one that does not take into account what sort of society Australia is and what the needs of that society are.

         Those opposite have come in here this afternoon lost in those arguments and in the rhetoric, talking about antiquated values, but for most of the time, what have they done? They have abused the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). They have set out to abuse the Prime Minister personally and denigrate him, saying that he is lower than life and whatever. This is the same person about whom they were saying these same things this time last year and it is the same person who gave them a hiding at the election earlier this year. He gave them a bath because he tapped into what Australians are thinking and what direction Australia is now taking.

         I have no doubt—and I did not support the Prime Minister when he was making a run for the leadership—that he will be remembered as a pioneering Prime Minister, one of vision, one of guts and one who was prepared to make the changes to fit Australia in a way that would make it adequate and appropriate and fit to fight the battles of the end of this century and into the next century. He recognises both the economic imperatives and the social imperatives, and no degree of abuse from the other side will undermine that reputation which he will have into the future. No degree of abuse from the other side will detract from the fact that there is an irreversible tide in the electorate moving in the same way as the government is moving, in the same way as the Democrats are moving and in the same way as other forces in this place are moving, but which is not being responded to by the opposition.

         As I say, we need to have an oath of allegiance which reflects the core values of Australia and which is a bonding instrument, and we can do so without any disrespect to our sovereign—absolutely none at all. No-one from this side and no-one from the Democrats who has participated in the debate in this place or outside of it has said anything negative about our sovereign. She is the Queen of Australia and whilst she is that we will go through the processes and we will pay allegiance, as the Prime Minister did when he went to Yarralumla to be sworn in, as we all did, in conformity with the law in the country. Our obligation is to the law as it stands. But the reality is that there is an anachronistic situation in that we in Australia swear an allegiance to the head of state of another country.

         I was at a dinner last night in Parliament House where the first toast was to the President of Lebanon, who was there as the official guest. The next toast was to the Queen of Australia. I hoped that the person next to me, the President of the National Assembly of Lebanon, really appreciated how the Queen of England found her way into the proceedings of the night. It is an uncomfortable situation, but it is part of the law and as part of the law we obviously observe it.

         Senator Short has mentioned the need for a revision of the Australian Citizenship Act. I want to place on record the government's appreciation, and my appreciation, for the work that former Senator Tate did in crafting this amendment, with the assistance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and cabinet. Senator Tate took a very deep interest in this proposal. We should recognise the work that he has done, and I gladly do so. I see the amendment that Senator Tate initiated on this oath as being very fundamental and one that has been able to be proceeded with without the need to address other aspects of the act. It is one that the government has been keen to ensure would proceed without being hindered by other considerations in respect of the Australian Citizenship Act, so we are proceeding with it.

         Very early in my time in this portfolio I said that I have been considering the rest of the act and how that also needs to be reassessed by government. I agree to a certain extent with the words of Sir Ninian Stephen that the act needs a fair degree of updating. Some of the basic principles of the act are fundamentally right and they do allow us to manage the process of citizenship in a positive way. I am looking at ways that the act can be reviewed and I expect that before Christmas I will be able to make some announcement as to how we can proceed on that broader issue. I have made those comments before today, both domestically and overseas, and there is nothing new in them.

         I see this amendment as fundamental and one which can and should proceed. This amendment recognises and reflects a changed Australia. It reflects the sort of Australia we now have. It also acts as a very fundamental instrument which reflects a need for common values, common institutions and common principles. As a consequence, the government and I personally are very pleased to be initiating this sort of change to our legislation.

        The amendment seeks to strengthen the preamble of the bill.

He has agreed to ensure that regulations are passed to include the words `having undertaken to fulfil the responsibilities of a citizen'. As well, the minister has undertaken—and I acknowledge it gratefully—that the preamble will be read out at every citizenship ceremony.

         Senator O'Chee asked whether the Queen is an institution within the Australian constitution. I think everyone acknowledges that the Queen has a very important part in the constitution. What we are talking about though is swearing allegiances to the democratic beliefs, rights, liberties and laws of the country. In terms of an oath of allegiance for citizenship one does not have to take the next step and swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. We obviously recognise that the Queen is part of our constitutional make-up, but what we are saying is that when one swears an oath of allegiance to obtain citizenship, one does not have to go through a specific act of swearing allegiance to the sovereign.

         —Having heard Senator McKiernan's persuasive words, I am starting to think that this pledge is more and more defective every moment. Not only has the pledge left out the Queen, who is part of our constitution, part of a tripartite system of government, but Senator McKiernan tells us that this pledge has left out other key institutions of this country.

         The point is this: the minister gave us an explanation that we had to have a pledge that recognised the key institutions of this country, yet the minister's explanation for leaving out the Queen is that there is a reference to the laws of this land. The laws of this land are very important, but there is a hierarchy of norms in this country. The laws are part of a set of institutions, but we have to recognise that there is an institutional process for creating those laws. If we merely say that we are going to abide by the law, that is a fairly meaningless statement. If you do not abide by the law, you get put in gaol. It is so fundamental that I just cannot understand why the minister still chooses to leave out any reference to the constitutional monarchy.

         The minister has told us that this has absolutely nothing to do with the republic. Why then does he oppose the reference to the Queen in this pledge if it has nothing to do with advancing the republican cause? I can see my friend Senator McKiernan over there straining like a greyhound in the slits looking forward to the passage of this bill. I know what Senator McKiernan's views are and I respect that they are different from mine. But the minister cannot escape the fact that this bill has an ulterior motive—and that is to advance the cause of the republican movement by weakening the adherence of Australian citizens and new Australian citizens to the institutions of this country.

         At a time when we should be seeking more national unity to overcome the adversities which face our nation, it is particularly disappointing that this government seeks to bring into this parliament massive changes to citizenship in this nation through the change of the oath of allegiance. Yet this government will rely on a majority of but a handful to implement these changes. There is no way that an emotive change, a divisive change like this, can be passed with just a handful of votes. Technically and legally it can be passed; but for the good of this nation should it be passed on a handful of votes?

He is drawing an enormously wide bow in seeking to bring in the history of white migration in this country on this particular point. This is the committee stage of this bill, and one does not want to open up a discussion about discriminatory policies or otherwise and going to the 1960s and to the changes that the Whitlam government introduced to bring in a non-discriminatory policy after 23 years or so of discriminatory Liberal Party policy and so on.

I really feel that for this bill to stand as amended is as ludicrous as the spurious arguments we have heard that the Labor Party changed the White Australia policy. We know that is a nonsense, in the same way that the suggestion that this bill stand as amended is a nonsense. This bill is technically defective in failing to address the fact that we have a core institution in the constitutional monarchy which is not recognised. I know that brings a great deal of disappointment to the minister, but it is a fact. It is a fact that the wording of this bill has overlooked the wishes of a large number of Australians.

I was hoping that we may have had some amendments that might have improved the bill and really taken into consideration what the minister said about recognising core values in this country, but we did not have those amendments. So I have a right and an obligation to stand before the committee of the whole and say that the bill should not be accepted; that the committee of the whole should not accept this bill because, in its current form, it still overlooks all those issues that I have raised during the course of my speech.

Are we talking about the Australian government or some other institution, or are we talking about some laws that the people themselves may have thought up? If so, what are those and so on.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Macquarie Dictionary

         , the term `allegiance' means the obligation of a subject or citizen to the sovereign or government; duty owed to the sovereign or state; observance of obligation; or faithfulness to any person or thing. The new form talks about loyalty to Australia and its people. One of the problems with the word `loyalty' is that it generally attaches to a person. That person is to be the person who symbolises and epitomises, in a constitutional sense, the country's core values.

What does the word `Australia' mean in the new pledge? That is what I would like to know. I am seeking this information generally. The minister might also advise the chamber as to whether, in the event that there is a republic and a president of the republic, it is the intention of the government to change this pledge to return it to `allegiance to' in reference to the president of the country.

        . . . `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people'. This is the affirmative, positive act indicating a solemn commitment, an allegiance to Australia and its people. `Australia' is used there in a very simple expression but it has various levels of meaning. Obviously, there is the political entity, the Commonwealth of Australia. Loyalty is being expressed to that political entity, the name by which we are known amongst all the nations. But there is also a geographical and physical sense, which should not be totally discounted—the place. There is a commitment to Australia as the place where we are fortunate to be, the sunburnt country . . .

In other words, we could have used the term `Commonwealth of Australia', but that would have been too restricting. `Australia' is just used in its simplicity with these various levels of meaning. So the loyalty commitment is meant to evoke obligations to Australian society, the political entity and the land itself, the place where we are.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that covers Senator Harradine's point. I think Senator Tate's comments also cover the point about precedents. It is a loyalty to the political entity, the land itself and the place where we are, and that encompasses the institutions of Australia in those senses. There is no intention to go on and do the things that Senator Harradine is worried about.

         —I have a technical question for the minister. The wording of the pledge as it stands refers to Australia and its laws. As Senator Harradine has pointed out, that replaces an allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors. As Senator Harradine again quite rightly points out, allegiance in that sense requires obedience to the laws duly passed. The Queen is head of state not just of Australia but also of each of the individual states. So allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors requires obedience to the laws of the Commonwealth and each of the states. The wording which has been substituted in its place relates to the laws of Australia.

         My concern—and I hope the minister can address it—is that this seems to leave out an obligation to obey the laws of each of the states, which are not mentioned in this provision. It would appear that the substituted wording does not catch the full meaning of the allegiance or obedience which is required in the existing oath of allegiance. I ask the minister whether this matter has been examined and on what basis is there an argument for saying that this proposed wording may include an obedience to the laws of each of the states, which are not expressly mentioned here and which are separate governmental systems?

        That reference to the laws of Australia obviously embraces the laws of the national government, the state governments and the institutions under the constitution. The words that are now being proposed are `loyalty to Australia whose laws I will uphold and obey'. Once again we have the political entity and land entity that Senator Tate talked about. The reference in the new pledge, as opposed to the previous provisions, is very similar. It refers to an obligation to faithfully observe the laws and uphold and obey the laws of Australia. There is no difference between now and previously. It is very clear that any legal reading of the current pledge or the previous provisions indicates a need to uphold and obey the laws of Australia on a national, state and territory basis.

         I wish to pick up a couple of things that have been said since the second reading debate. In particular, I refer to a remark made by Senator Spindler in his contribution on the second reading of the bill. In support of the bill and the removal of the reference to the Queen in the oath or affirmation, he said—if I got him right—that we should be rejecting this symbolic relic of the past.

         Senator Panizza, who followed Senator Spindler, found that remark very highly offensive. I also find that remark very highly offensive. Like Senator Kemp, who also spoke in the second reading debate, I am insulted and very angry at the recent attempts by the government and some of its supporters or fellow travellers to rewrite the history of this country. That is what has been going on here for a lengthy period. This government has become a past master at attempting to rewrite history. It is attempting to rewrite immigration policy, our multicultural policy and a whole host of other policies that really go to the core of our history and the values that have built this nation.

         The remark made by Senator Spindler, perhaps unconsciously, adds to that. But even worse, Senator Spindler is simply wrong. The symbols that we are referring to are not relics of the past. Even Senator Bolkus accepted in his remarks just a while ago that the Queen still is central to our constitutional system, which is the whole framework on which our society, government and parliament are based.

Those symbols, those essential parts of our basic framework as a nation, do nothing at all to detract either from the multicultural nature of our society or the perception of our nation. On the contrary, what they do is enhance and enrich those great values, attitudes and attributes of our nation.

In my discussions with those people, I have never had any view at all expressed to me on any concerted basis on the question of the reference in the existing oath and affirmation to allegiance to our head of state, to our Crown, to the centrepiece of our constitution.

        The "correct" figure depends on the definition of "cancer" used. There are at least 100 different forms of cancer in chickens. The most common form, seen in birds of less than 22 weeks of age, is Marek's disease. The more common cancer in older birds is called leucosis. There is an effective vaccine for Marek's disease and commercial layer flocks are vaccinated, and in addition are from leucosis free stock. The frequency of leucosis in layers is less than 1%. Backyard and free range chickens also suffer from these cancers, usually at a much higher rate than commercial layers.

        The risk to consumers from eating chicken meat from battery hens is extremely low because, in addition to the species barrier, the meat is cooked before eating. Most bacteria and viruses are destroyed within a few minutes at 70(o)C. In addition the concentrated acid in the stomach and intestinal enzymes of the consumer will further degrade and inactivate viruses.
