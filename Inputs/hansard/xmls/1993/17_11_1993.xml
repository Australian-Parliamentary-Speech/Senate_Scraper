         —by leave—The committee has noted that four of the instruments appear to be technically void or invalid, another may breach personal rights by discriminating against persons in a de facto marriage relationship, while four provide for important discretions which may not be subject to review of their merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. One of these discretions expressly provides for a statutory authority to make a decision in its absolute discretion and without giving reasons. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in

        The definition of New Exports Allocation in paragraph 1.1 appears as drafted to subdelegate to the AMLC itself the power to vary the legislated quota without making a fresh instrument under the Act every time it does so. This would appear to be invalid. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that any variation of the quota from time to time will be made under s.16H of the parent Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Paragraph 3.3 provides a discretion with the AMLC to vary a quota, expressed as `in its absolute discretion and without giving reasons'. The Committee notes that it is unusual to provide for a discretion worded in such a way, particularly as there are no criteria to guide and limit its exercise. In addition, the express provision that reasons for decisions need not be given would appear to breach the rights of those affected. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that this wide power is either subject to AAT review or comes within Administrative Review Council guidelines for exclusion from such review.

         In the 1990-91 budget the Hawke government announced that from January 1993 funding of workers compensation costs in nursing homes would be based on a state average. Previously, nursing homes had been fully cost reimbursed for workers compensation costs. State averages are calculated by adding all the workers compensation costs of nursing homes in a state and dividing this figure by the payroll. This figure is expressed as a percentage and each nursing home in the state receives workers compensation funding equal to that percentage of its payroll.

          If actual workers compensation costs exceed the funded amount, the nursing home must make up the shortfall. Alternatively, if the funded amount exceeds the actual cost, the nursing home keeps the difference. In response to concerns from the industry about administrative problems entailed in not commencing the change at the start of a financial year, their onset was postponed until 1 July 1993. The change was included in a special

          Any explanation of why the coalition is seeking to disallow the amendments in this instrument must commence by stating that the post-election decision not to send this matter to the Gregory review is yet another of Labor's broken election promises. The government tried to quieten down the nursing homes by saying that something would be done about it after the election. The nursing homes were duped.

          In an obvious attempt to take this contentious issue off the agenda during the campaign, Mr Staples advised the private and voluntary sectors in late February. A number of them told me that they had been told through telephone conversations that the changes to the workers compensation funding arrangements would be incorporated into the review of the structured nursing home funding arrangements, or the review that we more commonly know as the Gregory review.

          After the 1993 election, as I have said, the new minister, Mr Howe, reneged on his predecessor's promise—workers compensation would not be part of Professor Gregory's review and the changes would start up as originally planned on 1 July 1993. Mr Staples's promise was made in the middle of the election campaign. It was a Labor election promise to the nursing home industry, which was unanimously opposed to this change. It was made for purely political reasons, to keep the industry quiet during the election campaign. Mr Howe's post-election reneging on this undertaking is, as I said, just another Labor broken election promise.

          A large number of objections to the changes have been put forward by nursing homes and their industry representatives. Many of these claims relate to the nature of the nursing home working environment. It is a difficult environment, as we all know. Those of us who visit nursing homes know some of the situations in which those dedicated staff work. It is difficult to protect against serious accidents due to catastrophic events.

          Sometimes through no fault of their own, residents of nursing homes do not always act in a way that is reasonable and safe. In addition, the main compensatory injury in nursing homes—that is, back injury as a result of heavy lifting—involves high claims. It is very prone to rorting, often recurs and it is very difficult to protect against these sorts of injuries, even with the very best work practices.

          It is also argued that the proposed system will not necessarily reward or punish those homes that deserve to be rewarded or punished. A nursing home with a large number of small claims as a result of poor work practices may not incur as large a funding shortfall as a home that is unlucky enough to have a single major claim that has nothing to do with its work practices.

          The proposed average is a mean average. It is not a case of 50 per cent of nursing homes gaining and 50 per cent of nursing homes losing from the new system. I meant `mean' as in average—not `mean' in the other sense of the word. Analysis of a frequency distribution, which I have obtained through questions on notice, shows that 60 to 70 per cent of homes will get a bonus, while 30 to 40 per cent of homes will have a shortfall. The size of the shortfall that results from the use of this average is of concern, particularly in states where premiums vary significantly.

          In Victoria, some 40 homes have premiums four per cent or more above the designated state average. With a payroll of $2 million, a 50-bed nursing home in this category is looking at a shortfall of $80,000 a year. Aged Care Australia has given examples of two Tasmanian nursing homes with premiums of $170,000 a year each being underfunded by $85,000 a year. Shortfalls of this size mean that other homes will receive quite significant bonuses. Aged Care Australia has given another example of a Tasmanian home with a premium of $13,000 a year that will get $53,000 in funding.

          The state averaging system is, by necessity, retrospective. The original averages are based on care aggregated module, or CAM, payroll figures in the NH20 returns for the 1991-92 financial year. The actual average will be calculated from the 1993-94 NH20s, and the difference between it and the amount paid to the nursing home will be recovered or paid via a loading.

          The work cover scheme is fully funded each financial year and interim premiums are adjusted accordingly. This means that, while the Commonwealth is recovering excess workers compensation funding, the Victorian government will be adjusting its interim premium upwards to take account of the claims experienced during the previous year. This means that, as the premium costs go up, the Commonwealth's funding goes down. The PGHAV claims that this will be very detrimental if a nursing home has a serious accident amongst its staff, especially highly paid staff in a small home, regardless of how well the home runs in all other aspects.

There are wide disparities in the premiums paid by nursing homes in South Australia, which also has the highest state average. This means that shortfalls and bonuses may be very large. The Commonwealth has already adjusted the Tasmanian average upwards as a result of concerns expressed by the industry. An actuary in Western Australia has argued that that state's average is one percentage point too low.

          The minister claims that the industry has been given sufficient lead time since the change was originally announced in 1990 to improve its workers compensation claiming record. However, there is little evidence that the Commonwealth has acted positively to support such improvements. In answer to a question on notice, the government claims that it has funded a number of nursing home occupational health and safety related projects. However, closer scrutiny reveals that only three small projects have been funded, the earliest being approved in October 1992, two years after the original announcement in the 1990 budget.

          In virtually all workers compensation systems, employers' premiums are directly related to their previous claims record. When a nursing home changes hands, the new proprietor inherits the old proprietor's good or bad claims record. More often than not, it is a bad claims record, particularly if the previous owner has had financial difficulties.

          For example, a nursing home which I visited in Tasmania very recently claims that it is facing a $60,000 annual deficit as a result of this change because its current high premiums reflect the poor practices of the previous proprietor. That just seems very difficult to comprehend. In this example, the new proprietor is also paying negative loadings incurred by the previous proprietor as well as undertaking expensive structural upgrading and replacement work on a property that was approved by the department as being okay for a nursing home. Apparently, it has quite significant structural problems. This change will be an additional significant burden.

The three criteria I gave the industry in July were that the alternatives must, firstly, entail an incentive to improve occupational health and safety practices; secondly, be revenue neutral; and, thirdly, be administratively simple.

          My main concern is that I really cannot see that these regulations will necessarily do anything to improve occupational health and safety in nursing homes, which is what we are supposed to be looking at. Although I fully appreciate that full cost reimbursement provides no incentive whatsoever for nursing homes to improve their work practices and their workers' compensation claiming records, I am not convinced that the measures in these regulations will actually act as an incentive. I think the government is proposing to use a very blunt instrument which ultimately may not prove to be anything like the right instrument for the job—in other words, a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Basically people seem to be too lazy to actually get out there in the field, look at what is happening, look at things more closely and work out constructively what needs to be done. Although I do not agree with everything that the aged care industry is necessarily saying about these regulations, I really do think that they have raised sufficient cause for concern to say that the government has to examine again its approach.

Until these changes, nursing homes were fully cost reimbursed for workers' compensation costs, regardless of the claiming and safety record of the home. This removed the incentives that the workers' compensation insurance authorities create by increasing premiums for employers who neglect their occupational health and safety obligations. The result of the old system is that nursing homes have a very poor safety record, evidenced by the fact that the base workers' compensation premium for nursing homes in Victoria is almost twice that for private hospitals, their nearest equivalent.

          To overcome this situation and to improve conditions for staff and residents of nursing homes, the government decided in 1990 that, from 1993, workers' compensation costs would be funded in nursing homes on the basis of state average costs. Under the new funding arrangements, homes which have lower than average premiums are able to keep the difference between their funding and their actual costs. This provides a positive incentive for all nursing homes to improve their safety practices. Over 60 per cent of homes have lower than average costs and are gaining from the change.

          A number of misunderstandings have clouded discussion of this change at various times. The costs funded will be the average cost in the nursing home industry, so the poorer than average starting point in the nursing home sector will not disadvantage the industry. The costs funded in each nursing home will also be calculated on costs in that state so that homes in states with higher premiums will not be disadvantaged. The average used will be a proportion of the payroll in each home so that the actual amount will vary with the size of the payroll of the home. Larger homes will not be disadvantaged.

          The homes have had three years warning in recognition that premiums are calculated on an employer's claiming record ranging from one to three years previously. This should have provided sufficient time for homes to take steps to improve their claiming record. Early in the three-year lead time, a number of steps were taken to inform nursing homes of this change.

          Costs of occupational health and safety training have been made an acceptable expense under nursing and personal care funding. I think that certainly counters the implication, at least, of some of Senator Patterson's comments. A number of projects to develop and implement such training have been funded under the aged care program. I appreciate that there is apprehension in some parts of the nursing home industry that there will still be accidents in nursing homes which will cause an unexpected jump in premiums above the average for their state. When instances have been examined by the department, however, these have not proven to be as drastic as feared by the nursing home.

          In the state with the highest losses on the part of homes with poorer than average records the average loss is estimated to be around $28,000. By contrast, in the state with the lowest average loss for homes with poor records the average loss is under $5,000. This is offset, of course, by gains which would be made with homes with good records.

          A couple of homes have suggested that they will sustain a large loss and will be unable to continue to operate under the new system. For this to happen the home would have to be a long way above the average cost as a result of a very large history of claims. There is no way of protecting employers from the consequences of such a history of poor management practice that does not involve penalising homes with good safety records.

          The new funding arrangements correct a longstanding anomaly and provide an incentive structure which will improve safety for both the employees and the residents of nursing homes. So I again say that the government will not reverse its decision.

          I note that both Senator Lees and Senator Patterson referred to Professor Gregory. Professor Gregory dealt with this issue in his published report which stated:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Workers' Compensation costs were originally categorised in the same manner but in 1990 the Government decided that proprietors must be encouraged to try to provide a safe working environment for staff. Funding was therefore amended to pay nursing homes the average workers' compensation cost percentage of payroll for a State. This provides a significant incentive for proprietors because, if they can reduce their percentage of premium to payroll to less than the State average percentage for nursing homes, then they can retain the margin between their premium and the amount funded as profit. If they exceed the State average, they will be responsible for meeting the additional cost from what would otherwise have been their return on investment from within SAM.

         In other words, we have what Professor Gregory might want to say. I understand that both Senator Lees and Senator Patterson were suggesting that this issue could have gone to Professor Gregory for review; well, we have Professor Gregory's view on this matter already on record. As I said, the government will not reverse the implementation of this decision so I am not persuaded by the arguments put here today.

          —in reply—I want to put on the record that I was not suggesting we go back to the old system. That is absolutely ridiculous. If the regulation is disallowed, the government can go back to the drawing board and actually consult with the industry. I will say this again very slowly so that the minister can understand what I said. Because there was widespread concern in the industry, I wrote to the industry in July to put up some alternatives. I said that the alternatives must entail—listen carefully—an incentive to improve occupational health and safety practices, be revenue neutral and be administratively simple. I am not saying, nor is the industry saying, that we should go back.

          All three bodies—I will say it again slowly so that the minister understands—stated that they were in favour of a system that would reward nursing homes with good occupational health and safety practices and penalise those homes with bad practices. Never did I say that we should go back to the old system. We are saying that we need a system that addresses the concerns that the whole industry has. If the government and the minister bothered to consult with the industry—and this would happen on many occasions—they would find that they could reach some compromises. The industry has come up with some suggestions.

          I did not suggest, nor did the Democrats, that we go back to the old system. I have clearly restated what I suggested. The minister said we were suggesting that we go back to the old system. I just want it clearly on the public record that that is not right. I do not think that anything the minister said convinced me that we should change our minds.

         That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion no. 396 standing in the name of Senator Coulter, relating to world population growth.

        This matter is one of the most important matters ever to come before this parliament, that is, whether the idiosyncratic views of one senator alone should dictate the foreign policy of Australians specifically with respect to that part of our foreign aid program which is given to family planning and population limitation. If a deal was done between Senator Harradine and the government, it was particularly shabby, but I must say that I accept Senator Harradine's explanation that this was not a deal. In any case, there is the far more important issue, the substantive issue regarding the partial suspension of our aid for family planning and limitation of the frightening rate of population growth globally, and specifically in Third World countries.

         I hope that all senators who are here will support this motion for the suspension of standing orders and agree that there should be an immediate conscience vote on the substantive motion so that senators will have the opportunity to vote on this issue. In that way there would be a minimum loss of time.

         The population issue is one half of the total environmental debate. The other half is the per capita impact. One can put together every aspect of environmental damage—whether it is local, continental or global, concerning the impact of greenhouse gases or the impact we are having on ozone depletion—and population is one half of that equation. To fail to recognise that is to fail to recognise that population is the most important issue which now faces humankind. We cannot afford to ignore the question of population, and specifically the rapid rate of population growth.

         World population is now increasing faster than at any time in human history. Every 11 years another one billion people are added to the world population. They demand more food, more shelter and more energy for their existence—indeed, a share of the ability to pollute and damage the environment, the atmosphere and the waters of the environment and to impact on the limited resources of planet earth. Limiting the rate of population growth reduces the rate at which the pressure of people on the planet increases; it provides a breathing space for attention to the per capita impacts of people on the environment.

         Two of the most important principles which underlie sustainable development are the precautionary principle and the principle of intergenerational equity. If we are in doubt about the ability of the earth to sustain seven billion, eight billion, 10 billion, 11 billion or 20 billion people, the precautionary principle says that we should slow down the rate of population growth until we are sure. We should not simply go on hell-bent on increasing the population. Intergenerational equity means that we would give to future generations the same access to resources that we have today.

         The other main issue is the right of women to determine their own fertility practices. There are 125 million people in the world today who wish to use the services of family planning, who wish to space their families, who wish to limit the size of their families, and who are being denied that right by Senator Harradine and people like him who will not allow those people to make a choice. It is their right to make a choice determined by their moral codes and not to be dictated to by somebody in Australia. There is a clear link between mortality in children and mothers and family size. This is another issue of great importance.

         —Senator Coulter probably has not given a great deal of consideration to the matters before the chamber at the moment, and the significant amount of government business and legislation that we have to deal with. Clearly,  at this stage, although there is no doubting the significance to all senators of the issues raised in Senator Coulter's notice of motion, it would be inappropriate, given that we have a number of opportunities in this chamber for these issues to be raised, for us to have a very extensive debate at this time on this particular motion. I do not know how much thought Senator Coulter has given to the difficulties that we have, but there are opportunities for honourable senators, apart from taking up time like this, to debate issues of substance.

         In relation to the substantive points that Senator Coulter has made, it has come to light recently that the original reports which related to the suspension of population activities were largely misleading. In fact, expenditure on population activities has not been halted, nor, for that matter, I think it is fair to say, has it been slowed down.

         The substantial increase in population related activities to a total of $30 million in 1993-94 and $130 million over the four years to 1996-97 was announced in the budget. The 1993-94 commitment of $30 million is a three-fold increase over the $10 million that was spent last year and nearly five times that which was spent in 1991-92. There is no doubt that the lack of family planning services in developing countries is an important, crucial and pressing human rights, development and environment issue; it is certainly also one that the Australian government is determined to address.

         At the time of the announcement of the review that has been referred to, the $30 million set aside for expenditure in 1993-94 had been almost totally committed—all but $3.25 million—to specific projects and programs to assist population and family planning programs in developing countries. That expenditure of $26.75 million is now going ahead. Similarly, of the $130 million programmed to be spent over the next four years, $96 million has already been committed and will be unaffected by the suspension of the remaining part of the program. I think that represents a genuine honouring of commitments that were made.

         Nevertheless, it is the case that the expenditure of $3.25 million this financial year and a further $30.75 million over the following three financial years has been put on hold pending a fully independent review conducted by experts and development economists. I believe that that is a reasonably rational way for us to go. It will mean that these matters will be looked at on a sound intellectual basis and the inquiry will be completed by March,

         —I rise at short notice to support Senator Harradine on this matter. Senator Coulter accused Senator Harradine of being the only senator in this place to hold the views on birth control that he does; I can assure Senator Coulter that Senator Harradine is not the only senator in this place to hold those views. I support Senator Harradine in what he has done on this matter. I do not hold similar religious views to those of Senator Harradine, my religion not being the same as his, so I do not support him for that reason and cannot be accused of that sort of push. But I am concerned that the government was going to increase funding rapidly—and this morning Senator Faulkner outlined the amounts over the next few years—at the expense of what I would call practical aid to developing countries which would be of far more benefit to those particular countries.

         I do not know why Senator Coulter has to bring this matter before this parliament with such haste with only a few weeks left before Christmas in which to discuss a big agenda of very demanding matters. I know this question is a very serious one. It one that I, and I know a lot of my colleagues, would like a lot more time to prepare for, for there to be a proper and full debate. I object to this being brought forward this morning in this way, as I am sure most of my colleagues would too.

         I have heard these sorts of comments about the population increasing before. I remember in my farming days being told that, if I hung around farming long enough, the year 1984 would bring the biggest world shortage of food that had ever been seen, and that every farmer would be very prosperous because we would be working flat out producing food for the starving millions of the world. It is now 1993 and I am in this place, not on the farm, and that boom in the production of food never arrived.

In fact, we find now that India is a net exporter of wheat, and it is not that long ago that we were providing massive aid.

         Practical aid to all these disadvantaged and so-called overpopulated countries is the way to go. In my opinion, to try at short notice to take freedom of choice from parents in these countries is not the way to go. People should still have the God-given right to have children that they can look after; not to spend money on the sorts of things that have been happening, which Senator Harradine has brought out in estimates over the years, such as the abuse of females with all these untried and unknown drugs. Even now, we find questions being raised about ultrasound equipment which has been used in our own country. Women themselves are starting to realise that a lot of these so-called birth control measures that we are funding are very deleterious to their health.

         Senator Coulter's efforts to pull this stunt this morning—bringing on a notice of motion and then trying to get it debated, without giving anybody any prior advice—is not the way to go. I repeat that Senator Harradine's views on birth control are not just his; I know they are the views of many others in this place. In fact, in this place we have a parliamentary pro life group, of which Senator Harradine is the chairman, that does not share the views of Senator Coulter. That is our right and privilege in representing the people of our states. I know that thousands and thousands of my constituents share the views of Senator Harradine and me on this matter. Therefore, I certainly will be voting against any move by Senator Coulter to discuss this matter this morning.

In those circumstances, we have to educate our consciences properly on this issue by listening to what is said.

The debate should be based on evidence. There should be a true discussion about the proper principles that ought to arise from these issues.

         The problem that exists at present is that that debate is being stifled. The population controllers assert falsely that there are too many people in the world, particularly too many people in the Third World—black, yellow and brown people. In fact, they blame the fertility of poor women in poor countries for a whole range of problems—famine, war and economic stagnation which, eventually, boil down to man's inhumanity to man.

         Of course, this suggestion is promoted by the United Nations Population Fund and the IPPF. The United Nations Population Fund praised China for its program of force, coercion and abortions.

Even though the minister has assured us that the inquiry can, we hope, expand our understanding of the population and development issues, and in fact lead to a more effective program, I think it sends the wrong signals around the world.

         —The committee has before it the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993. This is an important part of the higher prudential standards to be applied to superannuation in this country. It is important because many of the traditional ways of handling disputes such as through the court system are expensive and lengthy. Most members do not have either the resources or the confidence in their ability to tackle trustees in circumstances where they believe they have been unfairly treated.

         Currently, there is before the committee, on behalf of the Liberal-National coalition, an amendment in respect of the complaints tribunal. The tribunal cannot deal with a complaint about a trustee's decision if it is about a benefit that was paid before the commencement of the act and—it is this `and' that is so important and which I think a lot of people have lost sight of—if the benefit was paid in whole or in part to a person other than the complainant.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The amendment is in two parts and is very restrictive, far more restrictive than the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. For example, it does not stop the lodgment of all complaints before the commencement date of 1 July 1994, only those where it was paid in whole or in part to a person other than the complainant. Therefore, I would submit that well over 90 per cent—perhaps 95 per cent—of the expected cases which are likely to come before the tribunal would be affected by the decision.

         The government's intention to reject this amendment would cause suffering in an area where, most probably, those people have greatest need for the cash resources and the cash payment that would flow from the trustee's decision. The issue is the consequence that will flow if the government and any other parties reject this amendment. The consequences of rejection of our amendment would be that the trustees would automatically delay payment in necessitous circumstances where there is the probability or the possibility of dispute because it would give rise to a double jeopardy position. The delay could well be for between six and nine months because we know that there will be a string of cases before the tribunal after 1 July because cases before 1 July 1994 in respect of problems can be heard by the tribunal after 1 July. Given the resources of the tribunal, one could well find that people would be denied an otherwise legitimate payment for up to 12 months in most necessitous circumstances. I think this is quite unfair.

         For example, a trustee could not run the risk in circumstances where money was paid out in good faith to a named beneficiary such as a widow. The money is paid out to the widow and subsequently, six or eight months down the track, along comes the de facto and says, `Well, this was unfair. I have been living with this chap for 24 years. I am the true beneficiary'. The tribunal would then make up its mind and say, `In the interests of natural justice—the other lady has moved off, is unknown, is perhaps living in another state—we will declare that the moneys should be paid to the de facto lady because she had been living with the deceased for a good number of years'.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In such circumstances, what hope would the trustees have of getting that money back, paid in good faith to the widow? It would create a double jeopardy position for the trustees. Particularly in small funds, it could severely embarrass the cash position of the fund and place in jeopardy the interests of the remaining members of the fund. I am sure that that is not what would be required. Therefore, I ask the government to reconsider its position. It is a small amendment. It will not affect a lot of people. The point is the consequences that will flow from the refusal of the trustees to pay out if there is any doubt at all about their decision being upset subsequently by the tribunal. They are not given the time delay because of cases being stacked up.

         Because we are looking into the future, I would ask the government and any other honourable senator who has any doubt about supporting my amendment to reconsider their position. It is in line with recommendation No. 16.1 of the Senate select committee, which had cross-party support from the Democrats and the Labor Party, but I remind honourable senators that this is more restrictive than that particular recommendation, and there is all the more reason for the Senate to support it.

         I also remind the Senate that complainants still have the right of access to the court system, as they do now, where they have this sort of difficulty. Obviously the tribunal process, which we recommend, is a very inexpensive method and it is a good invention. But I think we have to be very careful that we do not disadvantage people in circumstances where they could be denied a legitimate payment, simply because trustees will be warned, wherever there is a doubt, not to pay because such payment could be overridden subsequently by the tribunal. That is the greater problem. Then there is the associated problem that these people, who will be in necessitous circumstances, will be denied access to this money. I ask the government, through Senator Sherry, a very capable former chairman of that committee, to reconsider its position.

         The central thrust of Senator Watson's argument is that some people—I accept this—may experience a time delay of nine to 12 months in receiving their payment. But the cure which he is proposing is wrong in principle. The opposition is saying that, in order to minimise that problem, we should deny people altogether the right to appear before the tribunal.

         There is a clash of two principles here. The opposition happens to believe that the consequence of the outcome that it has outlined is worse than the principle that the government strongly supports, which is that people should have the right to appear before the tribunal and to argue their case. In some cases, there may be some delay of payment, but at least they will have the right to argue before the tribunal.

         Senator Watson said that the issue involves only a few people. It is not a few people. Death disputes occur every day. Hundreds of people would have their right to appear before the tribunal cut off. We just cannot agree to that in principle.

         Senator Watson then said that there is an alternative for these people in that they can go to the courts. But how many people have been doing that, and is it a practical option? For example, very few people have gone to the courts with cases dealing with death benefits. In fact, the figures I have seen suggest that it is fewer than 100. People simply cannot succeed there; it is too expensive and it takes too long. So the alternative that Senator Watson is suggesting is also inappropriate.

         Two principles are at stake. I accept that Senator Watson is very concerned that there would be a delay in payment—not the abrogation of a payment. I accept that that is probable for some people. But our principal concern, which we argue outweighs Senator Watson's principle, is that we will be cutting off altogether the access of hundreds of people to the tribunal. We argue that, on balance, and having regard to our principle and the numbers of people that would be affected, our argument is stronger. Therefore, we see the amendment that Senator Watson is suggesting as the wrong solution to the problem.

         Frankly, I think this problem is probably insoluble because of the phase-in time needed for the operation of the tribunal. There will always be people affected by a cut-off date. But Senator Watson's proposed solution is, in its outcomes, much worse. Frankly, what would the Senate committee say to people who have complained to it over the last year or two about being disadvantaged and who come back to it and ask, `Why did you cut off our right to appear before the tribunal'?  Whilst the principle that Senator Watson has enunciated has validity, it is outweighed by the approach and the principle that we are adopting in opposing this amendment.

         —I will respond to Senator Harradine's question. The volume of complaints involving death benefits and superannuation is small compared to the total volume of complaints. Evidence given before the committee certainly suggests that it is small. I cannot give Senator Harradine figures on it, but we do know that it tends to be a fairly small area, albeit an important one because people are waiting for money from the resolution of their death benefit case. At present, trustees have an absolute power to determine these issues. There is the common law, but, as I mentioned, it is frankly inaccessible for the member of a fund.

         From past experience, we believe that the proportion of this type of complaint compared to the total volume of complaints to the tribunal is quite small. Therefore, we believe that the likely time of resolution for a death benefit dispute will be six to nine months. That is a delay, but it is not an unreasonable period in which to consider the outcome and adjudicate on a death benefit dispute. So there would be some delay, but it is not significant in terms of time and the volume of the tribunal's work. The tribunal could well decide to give those issues priority because of the urgent nature of a death benefit case and the need to pay the beneficiary. Those problems can be overcome.

We say to them, `You have got a common law remedy'. But, in practice, they will not take that remedy. They have not done so in the past. One of the reasons for introducing a tribunal is the less time it will take to resolve disputes vis-a-vis common law and the normal courts of law. I do not think anyone is seriously going to argue that a common law approach will be quicker or less costly. It will be much more costly and it will take more time.

         —It is possible, sure. I think we have to ask ourselves honestly: how many people, given past experience, are going to access common law? The interesting thing about disputes of this nature involving death benefits—certainly from sitting as a trustee on funds making decisions like this—is that some of the payments are not substantial. Some payments might be less than $10,000; in many cases they involve quite small sums of money. Frankly, is it worth people going through the courts of law arguing common law—and in many cases, I suspect, trying to break new ground—when the legal fee that they will have to pay to recover what could be a significant sum of money to them will take a significant bite out of the moneys that they may receive from the trustees on a death benefit?

To collect this money could create undue hardship to the beneficiary who has probably spent the money—paid off a house or helped educate children. What is the legal position in the case of, say, a genuine person who received money in good faith—it was bona fide paid out—but the situation was subsequently upset by the tribunal?

         What does the government think the existing members of the fund are going to say about the double jeopardy position—essentially having to make a payout twice in respect of a beneficiary who was a former member of the fund? It creates a double jeopardy position. It could cause a financial problem for small funds.

         I acknowledge the important point raised by the parliamentary secretary. But at the end of the day the government has to weigh up the consequences of its decision. I think it is going to have a lot of very unhappy people. We are not taking away rights that they do not already have. True, the government is creating new rights for them, but we are saying that there are some circumstances in which we believe that the harm caused to individuals would be far greater than any benefits that the government proposes.

After all, my amendment seeks to prevent double jeopardy and protect payments that are made in good faith on presentation of proper documentation. I cannot imagine that there will be hundreds of these situations, but there will be some. The consequences in a lot of other situations will be that, if there is a doubt, trustees will delay and deny payments because of the waiting time between now and, not only 1 July, but whenever they have time to consider a whole long list of complainants after 1 July.

         If Senator Sherry can give that assurance with any authority, referring to the act, I will withdraw my amendment.

We do not want the trustees to be the nasty men denying payment; we want to facilitate the role of trustees and to give them appropriate status. We do not want a situation where they can be sued by other members for not taking due diligence and care.

         As a former trustee, Senator Sherry would not like to be put in that position by his existing members for not taking that degree of care and making a payment perhaps earlier than he should have. There would be a lot of his colleagues in a similar position who are good members, good trustees of superannuation funds, who themselves could be personally liable if the tribunal, effectively, made a double payment which, under the terms of the legislation as it now stands, they could be obliged to pay.

         I turn to the way in which the tribunal addresses this issue and refer to the argument that I advanced earlier. Clause 36 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill under `meeting procedure' states that the tribunal is required to take into account not just the interests of the person who is making a claim before the tribunal, but also the interests of all the members of the fund. I would argue that that gives the tribunal sufficient power not to award double payments in these circumstances, because it is required to take into account the interests of members of the fund. In doing so, it can avoid the situation advanced by Senator Watson.

         —I return to the original example that I provided to the Senate. A named widow is a beneficiary on the documents. It subsequently turns out that the deceased was living in a de facto relationship for, say, 20 years. In terms of natural justice, I think that one would find that the tribunal, on the balance of probability, would pay something to that lady, particularly when the whereabouts of the widow was not known or evident until the tribunal hearings. In those sorts of circumstances there are going to be problems. I do not want to create difficulties where genuine people have been paid out and double jeopardy could result so far as funds are concerned—particularly small funds—because it could prejudice the interests of existing members. At the same time, I want to protect the trustees so that they are not liable in the event of a double jeopardy situation arising.

        I draw the attention of the committee to the revised copy which has been circulated. This amendment requires the tribunal to advise claimants of their rights to access specialist superannuation legal centres. It establishes a requirement for the minister to establish such centres by regulation or to provide reasons to each house as to why they are not to be set up.

         I have basically summarised the effect of the clause. It is important that we have independent legal services for superannuation consumers. We know it is the burgeoning industry in the financial sector. It is important that the minister is required to proclaim regulations or to tell us why he or she would not.

         What I have added to the amendment since yesterday's version is a sunset clause of three years. Senator Watson was keen to consider this inclusion and it does accommodate the Senate committee's recommendation which will allow government and industry to work together to discuss and finalise funding arrangements, but in the meantime it gets the principle established and it gets the centres working. Overall the clause seeks to encapsulate the recommendations from the Senate select committee but without the Senate imposing on the House an appropriation requirement.

The funds are well represented by ASFA and the government is well represented by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is not true that consumers are adequately and proportionately well funded as well. I do not think it is fair to leave it to fall on individuals or overworked trade unions through the industry funds. I think it is important that the advice be independent and that it be consumer orientated. Honourable senators would not be surprised to know that the proposal is strongly supported by AFCO and the Australian Consumers Association.

         The consumer movement estimates that the cost of setting up two specialist legal centres is about $400,000. The cost of linking these centres through liaison officers in the four other states, in already established legal services, would add another $260,000, making a total of $660,000. I think that is a reasonably small investment in the short term, because the sunset clause is in there, to ensure that the rights the parliament is setting up with the SIS bills today are truly enforced.

         I presume Senator Kernot is talking about amendment 3, clause 16. We do not intend to support amendments 1 or 2. Amendment 3 will have the support of the Liberal-National party coalition because the requirements that Senator Kernot is seeking are not dissimilar to those in clauses 24 and 25 of the complaints bill as it stands. Clause 24 deals with the lodging of the requisite material documents with the tribunal while clause 25 deals with the power to obtain information and documentation. We interpret Senator Kernot's amendment 3 as requiring the provision of similar documentation, on request, by the particular legal services.

         We can foresee certain situations where certain trustees may say that there is no legislative authority for this information to be passed to such a tribunal, even though the request has been documented by the potential complainant. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to have such access as a service assisting the complainant to prepare the case before the tribunal. It is important that the lawyers at these legal centres do not appear as a witness or as an advocate before the tribunal. They assist the complainant to prepare the case. We are attempting to provide a low cost service to the consumers. I believe that through this amendment Senator Kernot, on behalf of the Democrats, has provided the means of facilitating that flow of information. It is nothing more and nothing less.

If paragraph (c) is not supported, we could have a farcical situation because there has to be some inducement for the government to take the amendment seriously. This bill is not appropriating money for setting up the legal service centres. I believe that these centres can be a very cost-effective way of assisting people. At the end of the day they may be less expensive than adding additional resources to the secretariat of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Therefore, all the government has to do is examine the issue. If it will not proceed to fund in the next budget, it should come back to the parliament and explain why.

The Senate is not appropriating money; we are just asking the government, if it has problems with the funding of it, to come back and explain the problem to the parliament in an open way and say why it feels there is a difficulty in complying, or complying adequately.

Following negotiations with Senator Kernot, she was prepared to put a three-year ceiling on that. We thank her for that. Without that, we would not be able to provide our support because it would have been open-ended. I think there are adequate safeguards on all sides.

In listening to the argument about the creation of independent legal centres, it strikes me as something of an irony that both the opposition and the Democrats are proposing to channel complaints through lawyers when we are seeking a low cost outcome. The thrust of the tribunal approach is to avoid a legalistic approach and to consider issues in a manner somewhat like an industrial tribunal would. In many jurisdictions lawyers are forbidden and therefore they are generally not used and we have the development of a range of advocates and advice deliverers who generally provide their services—from all the evidence—at a lower cost than lawyers.

The committee recommended that the government consider supporting the establishment of an independent superannuation consumer advisory service by way of grants from consolidated revenue over three years. The government has given that undertaking in response to the committee's recommendations. It will consider that.

         The tribunal will provide an alternative to the secretariat which operates through the ISC, and that will assist consumers. But there will be a number of people in society who will be rather reticent about going to the regulator because of a perceived difficulty as to whether they will get the same degree of justice, information and support as they would going to an independent party. I would say to Senator Sherry that the government could well find itself saving a considerable amount of money because the resources required within the ISC secretariat to assist consumers will be so much less if consumers have an alternative, cheaply funded body to go to other than the ISC.

        The effect of these two amendments will be to slightly expand the right of representation before the tribunal in two situations, firstly, where the complainant has a limited ability to speak, read or write English and, secondly, where the tribunal regards it as `desirable in all the circumstances in the interests of fairness'. The reason for these amendments is that we are concerned that trustees of funds, particularly larger funds, will be in a fundamentally stronger position vis-a-vis complainants in the tribunal. They will be trained in the procedures of the act. In many cases they will be full-time trustees, whereas the complainants will be ordinary Australians doing what they ordinarily do.

         While we recognise and support the need to keep the tribunal processes simple, we still believe that the tribunal must take a broad approach to the issue of representation. Where the complainant clearly does not understand the legal situation or is largely innumerate, for example, the tribunal should insist in the interests of fairness that they get representation. Again, consumer groups regard this amendment as the absolute minimum requirement to improve what I think the government has acknowledged in its legislation, but which just does not go far enough.

         —The Liberal-National Party opposition will not be supporting these amendments. We believe that the legislation contains adequate support for the issues that Senator Kernot raised in terms of providing an interpreter service and other necessary support services. In view of the fact that there are adequate provisions already in the legislation, we believe that the two Democrat amendments, although fair, are unnecessary in terms of the adequacy of the coverage of the current provisions.

         —The government's position is that we will also be opposing both of the Democrats' amendments. In terms of the first amendment, we, like Senator Watson, believe that the current definition in the bill is sufficiently broad to ensure that persons with a disability can be represented. In respect of the second amendment, clause 23(2) presently states:

        If we amend the clause in the way the Democrats are suggesting, we are advised that that will, in fact, allow lawyers to appear before the tribunal in almost all cases—if not all cases. We believe that is undesirable. For those reasons, we will be opposing both amendments.

        I point out that where trustees are other than members of a fund—they could be representatives of the ACTU—this amendment is no reflection on their capabilities. Some of the best performing funds in Australia are those that are run on the basis of trade union-type representatives representing employees. There is no doubt about that, and that is widely recognised. However, as these bills are all about prudential standards, we believe that there is no better auditor of a superannuation fund than a person who is a member of that fund. We are suggesting that at least one member who represents the employees' interests shall be a member of that superannuation fund.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think that honourable members will find that in most circumstances that is the case. It makes good sense that there is at least one trustee who is a member, and maybe more. This does not preclude an employee who is a member of the fund from being a trade unionist. These bills are all about safeguards and prudential controls. It should not be forgotten that there are very high standards required of trustees. They can be sued by other members of the fund who believe the trustees have not acted in their best interests. There could be circumstances where the trustees make a decision that does not suit the performance of the fund and that could cause difficulties.

         These amendments provide that at least one of the trustees representing the employees' interests shall be a member of the fund, rather than an outside person. I think this will enhance the prudential standards and controls that operate. The amendment is moved with the highest motive in terms of trying to add another notch or ratchet to the prudential standards or controls that apply to superannuation.

In most cases—and perhaps the answer could come from senators opposite who have a lot more experience of being employee representatives of funds. I think Senator Kernot will find that, as a matter of good administrative practice, some of the trustees would be drawn from members of the fund. So the members of the fund prima facie will look after their own interests and those of their colleagues. That is all we are suggesting.

The government opposes these amendments, one reason being the query that Senator Kernot made of Senator Watson. It would require the resignation of a number of trustees from a number of funds. We do not know the number, but I certainly know there are some funds that do not have a person who is a member of the fund as a trustee.

         We see some other practical problems as well. Generally, the sort of industry funds we are talking about cross a number of industries; there are a number of industries within the industry funds. I take the example of the hospitality industry, with which I am familiar. I was a trustee of that national fund but I was not a member of the fund. It may well be difficult to get a member who is an employee in the industry to sit as a trustee. Therefore, it is easier in many circumstances to find a person—usually a union official, although not always—who is not a member of the fund to sit on a fund in those circumstances.

Is the minister aware that such a bridge will substantially increase the impact on the very important wetland areas of the lower Murray, Coorong and Lakes Alexandrina and Albert and that these important areas are protected under the international agreements Ramsar, JAMBA and CAMBA? Is the minister also aware that the South Australian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, Resources and Development, which contains three government members, recommended that the bridge not be built? Will the minister act, as she has already done in the case of the Creery Wetland in the Mandurah Estuary in Western Australia, to protect these South Australian wetlands of international significance and use her powers to put an immediate stop to the construction of the bridge to Hindmarsh Island?

The water surrounding Hindmarsh Island, which is located at the mouth of the Murray River, was listed by Australia as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar convention of 1985.

         Subsequent to the proponents' environmental impact statement in 1990, public concerns were raised about, amongst other things, the lack of infrastructure for managing increased visitation to the island's valuable wetlands. In October 1993, the environment, resource and development committee of the parliament of South Australia released its inquiry into the Hindmarsh Island bridge project. Amongst its recommendations were that the South Australian government should reassess the need for a bridge and that more emphasis should be placed on the environmental aspects of the proposal. Senator Coulter has already alluded to that report.

         The Commonwealth, in effect, delegates responsibility to the states or territories with respect to the management of sites recognised under the Ramsar Convention. However, Mrs Kelly advises that the federal government will consult with the South Australian government to consider the implications for changed management of the island, particularly taking into account the potential for increased visitation to the island. Subject to any decision by the South Australian government, the federal and state governments will cooperate in this approach. I spoke to Mrs Kelly just before question time, because Senator Coulter had given notice of this question, and she again emphasised that she will be having consultations with the South Australian government about this matter.

It is grossly untrue to suggest that the children have been denied education. It is also grossly untrue to suggest that detainees' access to religious services is limited. Religious workers from the major Christian denominations attend the centre on a daily basis and Buddhist monks usually attend the centre on culturally significant days.

         Probably the most outrageous part of Mr Photios's statement yesterday was that counselling for victims of torture and rape is virtually non-existent. This is not only grossly wrong but also it illustrates Mr Photios's preparedness to exploit the most vulnerable of these people for his own political ends. A full range of torture and trauma counselling and treatment is available to the detainees. That range includes the admirable work of a group of psychiatrists led by Dr Maria Bashir and the service for the treatment and rehabilitation of torture and trauma survivors.

         Mr Photios did not stop at just spreading inaccuracies. In his typically opportunistic fashion, he accused the Labor Party of being anti-migrant. This comes from a member of a party which says that probably all immigrant applicants, including boat people, should be removed from the jurisdiction of the ADJR. As a consequence, the access to the courts—which the constitution guarantees them—would be denied to them. Mr Photios's confusion went even further in a pretty broad statement that he made in the parliament.

         I congratulate those Australian private firms which were at the fair and committed resources in conjunction with Austrade. One of the most disappointing things was to see the impact that present European Community policy on meat quotas has on Australian industry. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation had a separate stand with several private exhibiters. In one morning every one of those exhibiters said that they had to turn down orders from Europe for their products because they could not get access to the European market because of the quota system. All the European buyers said the quality and presentation of our meat was absolutely first rate and that they would be only too delighted to buy it but, unfortunately, as we know, the European Community has quota limits and we cannot get into those markets because of those quotas.

         I will certainly be taking up with my colleagues Senator Cook and Minister Griffiths the need for Australia to put more resources into the presentation at ANUGA and encourage more Australian industries to be represented. This is the major world trade fair in food and beverages. It obviously writes a lot of business for countries and companies around the world. I think we ought to lift our game and put the resources in to benefit Australian industry. It certainly would be in tune with the government's policy for the Agrifood Council to develop high value food exports from Australia.

         In this transfer process, the Commonwealth—I must say, to the great benefit of many local communities around Australia—has provided more than $64 million in grants and social benefit subsidies to enable the completion of this program. The complete withdrawal of the whole 234 aerodromes has now been completed and the aerodromes have been transferred to local ownership. It has been a major achievement of the Aviation Division of the Department of Transport and Communications to complete such an extensive program of transfers in such a time frame and completely within the budget.

The department of transport, in conjunction with ATSIC, is providing training for reporting officers from a number of far north Queensland aerodromes to assist with the future maintenance and day-to-day operations of those aerodromes. For example, Aurukun, Hopevale, Mornington Island and Palm Island are just some of a number of the communities that have officers under training at the moment.

I refer the minister to the recent Federal Court decision involving the National Australia Bank whereby employer-funded taxi travel after hours has been regarded as a fringe benefit and subject to the fringe benefits tax. I remind the minister that this may mean that some employer-funded taxi travel, when employees have to commute to and from work outside normal hours, could cause some problems. I ask: will not the decision add to the level of costs of employing people, especially women? Is the minister not concerned that this lack of tax recognition of employer-funded taxi travel will place many females who need to travel home late at risk if they are forced to use public transport? Will the government as a matter of social conscience introduce legislation to remove any doubt that employer-funded taxi travel should not incur fringe benefits?

         —The government is aware of the concerns regarding this matter. We are examining the implications of the recent court decision concerning the application of FBT in this area. So it is under examination. There are some points that I think we should make in case this generates unnecessary fear and concern amongst people and perhaps leads to unnecessary changes in practices. It is important to note that there is already an exemption from FBT where an employer pays taxi fares for an employee on an infrequent and irregular basis; that is, where the employee is unexpectedly required to work late. So circumstances in which it would not have been possible for people to make other arrangements because they did not have advance notice are already exempt from FBT. My advice is that that is not changed by the National Australia Bank decision.

         It is very important that we do not send the wrong message to employers. I am advised that where they are acting in accordance with that exemption, which is where the problem to which Senator Watson refers could most often arise, there is already and continues to be an exemption. Of course, FBT does not apply in the case of FBT-exempt employers. Many areas of large volume female employment in the shift area would come into that category. There are a number of circumstances in which, even if the most extreme interpretation of the National Australia Bank decision were to be taken, exemption would apply. Nevertheless, there are some concerns being expressed with regard to the possible implications of the Federal Court decision. The government has that under examination.

         There are also spin-offs into other areas that have proved profitable for the company.

ADI is achieving what the government hoped it would achieve. It has turned a non-profitable business with inflexible, old-fashioned practices into a profit-making enterprise. The board, management and staff at ADI are to be congratulated on their progress and success in recent years. The company is aware that the government will consider the future of ADI in the new year and whether it will be retained as a government-owned enterprise. I think the fact that ADI has shown that it is a viable defence company in Australia is encouraging.

         Specifically, the tariff reduction covers carded wool, wool tops and other combed wool. This breakthrough is the outcome of the Prime Minister's wool initiative taken during his visit to China in June and raised in bilateral discussions that Senator Cook and my colleague Mr Crean held with the Chinese Minister for Trade and Economic Cooperation, Madam Wu Yi, in October. China's decision reduces an impediment to further processing of wool within Australia and provides a basis for continued expansion of the Australian wool tops processing industry.

         I consider this reduction in import duties to be an important first step in our overall strategy to increase access for Australian wool to China. The government will continue to seek from Chinese authorities reductions in other import barriers that apply to wool, including import licensing quotas and domestic taxes. Further discussions to improve the market access for Australian wool to China are likely in Geneva in December, in line with Australia's request of China, already made in the processes of China's accession to GATT.

         —The specific figures, before ADI was formed in 1989, no doubt can be drawn from the record. I know why Senator Crichton-Browne is so sensitive on this particular issue. He should remind himself of what the Labor government in 1983 inherited from the coalition government, which was all in favour of free enterprise, competition, and all the wonderful Liberal values. For 7 1/2 years it nurtured government factories in the defence area that were inefficient and incompetent and did absolutely nothing whatsoever about it. It had something like 20,000 employees working in what amounted to the most inefficient industries in this country.

         What galls Senator Crichton-Browne is that this government has taken on these issues and turned these industries into a profitable area and an efficient organisation. I know that he is embarrassed by the fact that he went up to Bendigo in 1982 with Senator Martyr and tried to sell his sleazy propositions about closing down the Bendigo ordnance factory.

         I can see why Senator Crichton-Browne would want to raise the question today. There is a degree of jealousy in what has been achieved in this and other areas. I am sure that with diligent application and a fair amount of research, Senator Crichton-Browne would eventually in his heart of hearts agree that ADI has done a great job at Bendigo ordnance factory and at similar institutions that ADI controls around the country. As I stressed in my previous answer, these are not easy areas. These are not the quick profit areas; these are not areas in which it is easy to make a profit. ADI has done a great job. It is not without problems; it will face problems in the future, but I am sure that all honourable senators opposite would wish ADI well in the future.

        That is absolutely correct. The sequence of events is as follows: on Monday morning—that is, 27 October—I had a meeting with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and I was advised, apart from a whole range of other issues in terms of assertions and unsubstantiated rumours that it was pursuing, that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation had just received a report—Senator Macdonald should listen to this—that a CAA officer may have been aware of the `implications of removing the autopilot', not removing it, which is a substantially different thing.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I will tell Senator Macdonald why that is important—and I may need the additional two minutes to do this because it is vitally important. Only about 20 per cent of the autopilots that are fitted to this kind of aircraft disable other instruments when they are removed. About 80 per cent of the aircraft of this type that fly in Australia can have the autopilots removed without affecting any other instrument in the aircraft; in other words, a more expensive form of autopilot. That is, in general terms, the situation.

         So it was a question of whether the CAA knew what the implications would be of removing that autopilot, not whether it was actually removed.

The facts are that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation did not tell me that the CAA was aware that this autopilot had been removed, as I accurately told the Senate committee.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), to a question without notice asked by Senator West this day, relating to refugees and access to the legal system.

       <para>
        I refer to the quite scurrilous attack that was made on the New South Wales Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Michael Photios, in Senator Bolkus's answer. Mr Photios will, no doubt, answer the quite scurrilous diatribe, point by point, as soon as he has the opportunity to read what the minister said.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I want to say three things. Firstly, I know from a very close personal observation of Michael Photios since his appointment as New South Wales minister for ethnic affairs earlier this year that he is widely respected by ethnic communities throughout New South Wales and, I must say, also in states beyond his own state of New South Wales. In my view, in the short time that he has been there he has been quite an outstanding minister—and recognised as such.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, to assert that Mr Photios—who I understand is of Greek background—is in some way anti-migration, or anti-immigration, as Senator Bolkus said, is as absurd and ridiculous as it is scurrilous and wrong. Thirdly, to assert, as Senator Bolkus did, that there should be reduced access to Australian courts beyond that which is currently available for appeals against adverse decisions on applications for entry through Australia's existing carefully constituted and independent system of administrative review is also both nonsensical and scurrilous. The minister must know that under the constitution all persons are guaranteed access to our legal system through, at the very least, the High Court. There is no question about that and there never has been.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fact is that one of the very important elements of Australia's migration program is currently under threat because of the heavy demands on the Federal Court flowing from appeals against migration determinations. Last year, no less than 61 per cent of all ADJR cases before the Federal Court were migration cases. That puts great pressure on the court and it also endangers the integrity of our migration program. If Senator Bolkus was implying, as he appeared to, that, contrary to what I and others have said, there should be no examination of this situation and that to have any examination of this is somehow anti-immigration, that is indeed to fly in the face of reality and quite contrary to the true interests of our migration program.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe, without having a firm and final view on the matter, that an examination of this matter is necessary for the fundamental reason of wishing to maintain and strengthen our migration program and its integrity. If Senator Bolkus is suggesting that to have an examination of this matter is in any way a problem for the migration program and an undermining of it, then I believe he stands condemned out of his own mouth for dereliction of his ministerial duties.

         Finally, I say to Senator Bolkus—I am glad he has remained in the chamber—that he has made pleas over time, and I well understand them, for as bipartisan an approach as possible between the parties in this parliament, and I presume in the Australian community, to the question of our migration program. If Senator Bolkus thinks that by the scurrilous type of attack he made today on Michael Photios he is in any way enhancing the cause of a bipartisan approach, then I am afraid he is very sadly misguided.

If he is still thinking through that position, then that is good and he should keep thinking through it. It is a position that we on this side have also looked at, both in the context of drafting legislation and also in the context of the current inquiry.

Senator Short is right; there is the original jurisdiction of the High Court which, on the best advice I have available to me, would ensure that people in this category coming into Australia would be able to access, indirectly through the High Court, Federal Court consideration of their cases.

         I am sure all Australians would like to see an outcome to this. Our special assistance category program is geared not only to those in detention but also to other Cambodians with families in Cambodia, families in compassionate circumstances. It is a valuable program. People should not go out, on the basis of misinformation, criticising a program which has benefits not just for boat people but also for others. That is why bipartisanship is something I would like in this portfolio. But it has to be based on accuracy and honesty between the players.

         This report shows how much has been achieved by the Resource Assessment Commission. The Resource Assessment Commission has existed for 4 1/2 years and during that time has completed major investigations into the Kakadu Conservation Zone, our forests and timber resources. The current inquiry into the management and use of resources in Australia's coastal zone is due to be completed by the end of this month.

          The government announced in the context of the last budget that the Resource Assessment Commission would cease operations from the end of this year. This is very disappointing given the work that the Resource Assessment Commission has done, and it is incredibly short-sighted. The Resource Assessment Commission brought a refreshingly independent approach to major resource issues. Its research has been scientific, without ignoring the social aspects and values of our community. It has been given issues that the federal government has not wanted to deal with, which meant that it was never going to have an easy time. Considering this, it has done remarkably well.

          The consultation that the Resource Assessment Commission undertook for the coastal zone inquiry was impressive and hopefully will have effects that last beyond the actual report that is produced. The Greens (WA) regard implementation of this report as an indication of the government's commitment to protecting our precious and fragile coastal system. The Resource Assessment Commission undertook some pathbreaking research—for example, the contingent valuation survey of the Kakadu Conservation Zone, the analysis of the pricing of Australian woodchip exports and investigations into the use of mediation in the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry process.

          The idea of using mediation is particularly important and should be encouraged to a much greater extent. In the United States, mediation has been very successful in helping to resolve major environmental disputes. Mediation can work better than unilateral government action because it brings opposing sides together to discuss their different values, problems and proposed solutions. The results can last longer because a framework for constructive consultation is established.

          I dispute the contention by the government that it has integrated consideration of economic and environmental priorities and so removed the need for a body like the Resource Assessment Commission. The example of what is happening in the old growth forests of New South Wales illustrates how the chop-it-down mentality, with the Commonwealth not doing anything, remains. The government has suggested that CEPA, the Industry Commission or ASTEC could undertake such inquiries. However, they are not regarded as independent and do not have the specific research expertise required to cover both environmental and developmental aspects.

         This is a group of reports from the Australian Research Council evaluation program. One of the surprising things about these four reports is that they are dated 1990 or 1991 as the period of review. It surprises me that a department like DEET that has 17,000 staff cannot really get its act together a little faster to make sure that we have these reports on time.

          Probably one of the most surprising things in these reports that I have ever read in any report is a disclaimer contained in their background sections. The reports were compiled by very distinguished groups of professors reviewing fields such as economics, organic chemistry, material and chemical engineering and fluid mechanics. The bottom of the first page on the report on economics states:

          by Professor Roger Holmes, who is the deputy vice-chancellor of research at Griffith University. Professor Holmes's article, which is headed `Beazley must rethink funding formula', highlights one of the very unfortunate consequences of the 1993 budget and its effect on research infrastructure funding. He describes the budget as a wolf in sheep's clothing which will result in the further concentration of research dollars in this country in a smaller group of universities.

          I am sure the Senate has heard of the plan of seven universities in this country to have the research dollars concentrated in their hands. What people have to realise is that two-thirds of the research money is already concentrated in these universities and what is now being proposed by these universities, aided and abetted by this government, is the further concentration of this funding.

          It is seven years since the Dawkinisation of the universities in this country, when the whole system was turned upside down. Institutions that had very little in common were forced to move into mergers to meet some magic number; they could not be universities unless they had a certain number. Whole careers were thrown into states of confusion. People resigned and morale collapsed. What we now have from this government is a de facto admission that this whole policy has failed, despite the best efforts of the staff of universities to make it work in the face of very inappropriate government policy.

          Having forced these institutions together, having moved staff and told them, `If you want a promotion in a university you have to have a research record'—so they turned their careers upside down and got into higher degrees and further research—the government, in effect, is now saying, `Hey, wait a minute. We are not going to do that now; we're going to go back to what we had in the binary system'.

          This came out when I questioned one of the senior public servants, Mr Michael Gallagher, in the Senate estimates. He more or less admitted that if a university wanted to be a teaching university and do no research, it could do that. But he did not admit that the funding formula that the government is now applying will force many universities into that position and recreate the binary system we had before. Given how far we have come in recent years, this is a very backward step. This government stands condemned for this policy. It will be to the detriment of the reputation that Australia has built up in its universities.

         The report of the Resource Assessment Commission highlights just how unlikely it is that export woodchipping will cease in the foreseeable future. Page 26 of the report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . there is no reason to discontinue woodchip exports. To do so would seriously disrupt industry and impose severe economic losses on forest-based industries and local communities.

        <para>
         This report is timely, given that just a little while ago the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) circulated a draft cabinet submission which seeks to tempt the environmental movement with the possible closure of the woodchip mill at Twofold Bay. The minister's long-awaited submission puts forward two options for the proposed East Coast Armaments Complex—Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay. The fact is that ECAC could only be built at Twofold Bay if the woodchip mill were closed and relocated in its entirety or, at the very least, regularly shut down while the armament wharf was in operation.

          An environmental consultant to the recent interdepartmental committee on ECAC highlighted the fact that the woodchip mill might have to be closed. Our information is that compensation would run into hundreds of millions of dollars, much higher than the cost of ECAC itself. No wonder the consultant concluded that the woodchip mill problem could be sufficient to prevent the development of ECAC at Twofold Bay. It raises the question: why did the minister choose Twofold Bay as the only alternative to his preferred site at Jervis Bay? The answer is clear at least to me. He is making cabinet choose between the impossible and the unpalatable, knowing that the impossible would be defeated and the unpalatable—Jervis Bay—would get up.

          Twofold Bay is nothing more than a straw site, a transparent ploy. The minister wants ECAC to go to Jervis Bay and he is trying to engineer a situation where it is the only real choice. I contend that this report which is before us now proves my point. The minister has dangled a carrot in front of the environmental movement. He is saying, `Support Twofold Bay as the alternative to Jervis Bay and you might just get the woodchip mill closed and replaced with ECAC'. The report we are now debating makes it clear that this is a false hope, a red herring. Cabinet would not in its right mind spend huge quantities of public money when much cheaper sites are available.

          If the minister succeeds in narrowing the choice down to these two sites, he will have eliminated any real opposition to Jervis Bay. It seems to me that that is his aim. Port Curtis near Gladstone, which has the most potential as an ECAC site, will have been struck off the list. I recently visited Port Curtis and, in discussions with local officials and environmentalists, it became clear that a mainland site for ECAC which would be much cheaper and more efficient than Facing Island—the only site Defence has looked at in that area—is in fact a real option.

          Even Point Wilson in Victoria, which has a major question mark hanging over it because of Victoria's plan to move the Coode Island chemical facility to the same area, is a more realistic proposition than Twofold Bay. This report gives the lie to the bogus draft cabinet submission circulated by the minister. I hope that his cabinet colleagues will see through it and reject it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

When ADI took over as a GBE, the first thing it did was close down this factory that never made a shell nor a bullet.

The way the housing for the defence forces has been transformed by the creation of the Defence Housing Authority is one of the very few successes in the 10 years of this government. That, in no small part, is due to the calibre of the personnel who have been running the authority since it was set up. Some very successful commercial people have been involved in that.

         Anyone who has been visiting defence houses over the last 10 or 15 years would realise the enormous change that has taken place. Many of the defence forces' houses were in housing commission areas. They were in poor socioeconomic areas and the condition of the houses had been allowed to run down to a really terrible degree. The Defence Housing Authority has turned that around and has put it on a good commercial basis. Like Senator Calvert, I pay full credit to the authority for its achievements.

         That is of particular interest to the government because it means that less money had to be allocated from the defence budget for defence housing. This is probably a high peak in profit because quite a volume of Commonwealth-state housing agreement stock was sold off and the benefit of that will be felt for another two years but after that I would imagine that the profit level will fall back.

         One of the things that concerns me as shadow minister for veterans' affairs is the way the government has been slow to revise salary and allowance payments to defence forces. Essentially, what happened before was that the defence forces had poor quality housing and they did not pay terribly much in rent. That rent was subsidised to some degree by the defence forces as part of the conditions of service, in recognition of the fact that defence families get moved at the whim of the government of the day, or more precisely the Department of Defence.

         What has happened is that with the upgrade in quality of Defence Housing Authority housing and the provision of houses to service personnel there has been a move towards setting market rents as the rental allowance paid by service personnel.

         While the quality of housing has gone up, the ability for defence families to pay for that housing has been reduced. What the government has set out to do is correct the situation. But it has failed to recognise the fact that the capacity to pay is terribly important. It has not revised the pay scales particularly for the lower ranks so that they can pay for the better housing.

         —I want to make a couple of comments. The Defence Housing Authority annual report is very timely because of the reference in another debate to the assessment of housing as a fringe benefit for the purpose of assessing eligibility for family payment. I think this report helps to fill out that debate a little more and give us a better picture. The other issue which is continuing in another debate relates to Woomera and the way defence housing was allocated. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         The first report which I have tabled deals with the redevelopment of the CSIRO Ian Clunies Ross laboratory complex at Prospect, New South Wales. It is proposed to relocate staff of the Division of Animal Health from the McMaster laboratory, Glebe and staff of the Division of Animal Production at the Poultry Research Unit at North Ryde to Prospect. It is also proposed to provide upgraded research facilities for existing staff of the Division of Animal Production at the Prospect site.

          The McMaster laboratory at the University of Sydney, Glebe is occupied under permissive occupancy and needs to be vacated as soon as possible after June 1994. CSIRO considered several options before coming to the conclusion that the McMaster laboratory should relocate to the site at Prospect. At the public hearing the committee was advised that the relocation of the McMaster activities to Prospect is in the national interest in terms of the research synergy between McMaster and Prospect programs and Prospect is in a metropolitan location appropriate to research outputs for the manufacturing sector.

          Relocation of the poultry facilities from North Ryde to Prospect was examined by the committee in 1991 and endorsed in its report to parliament in March 1992. The committee was advised that coordination of the move within this project will minimise costs and overcome potential cost penalties of a separate development. The Prospect site contains 41 major and minor buildings, many of which have reached the end of their useful life. Working conditions are cramped and the dated design of some buildings has made animal handling labour intensive.

It is a pity that the minister in the chamber at the moment, the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), has not briefed this chamber on the research work being carried out there. Such information would be of great benefit and would give a lift to the woolgrowers who are suffering so much pain at the moment.

         This report concludes a two-year investigation by the committee into the administration of one of this country's largest and most significant institutions. For probably the first time in Australia a parliamentary committee has extensively investigated the manner in which income tax is collected. The inquiry was undertaken in recognition of the enormous changes in all aspects of the Australian Taxation Office and tax administration commenced at the beginning of the 1980s under the banner of modernisation.

          This inquiry was commenced during the previous parliament under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Barton, Mr Punch. The committee accepted 128 public submissions, accounting for over 5,000 pages of evidence from ordinary taxpayers, academics, taxpayer agents, industry representatives, accounting and legal professionals, officers of the Taxation Office, senior tax office management and many others. In addition, it received more that 40 exhibits and considered a number of confidential documents.

          The committee's report is a comprehensive assessment of the administration of the Taxation Office. While it is critical where necessary, it also recognises and commends the office for its many innovative and positive achievements, particularly in the areas of modernisation, self-assessment, personnel management and revenue collection. It also makes 148 recommendations, some of which I will now address.

          In regard to legislative framework, in evaluating the tax office's performance, the committee has considered the efficiency of administering the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The committee has recognised that which must be painfully obvious to all in this parliament and, I would have to say, probably to all taxpayers in Australia—that the act is long overdue for redrafting.

The committee has recognised that to redraft the act and simplify its administration will not be an easy process, nor will it be quick or inexpensive. Nevertheless, in the committee's view a redraft must be commenced urgently. The committee therefore recommends that sufficient resources be devoted to this exercise as a matter of the highest priority.

          I now turn to administrative structures. After 80 years the committee considers the time is now ripe for the establishment of a new administrative framework for the tax office. The committee considered a number of options, including the establishment of a board of management. I might say that Senator Bishop, in a minority report, expressed a preference for a board. However, the committee determined that the Taxation Office should be constituted under its own act as the Australian taxation commission. Through such a commission it was felt that the advantages of a board could be embraced. In addition, a commission would facilitate the use of experts in executive roles on either a full-time or part-time basis. It was also felt that a commission would allow for a more flexible system for the employment of taxation professionals and provide the capacity to respond to changing international and domestic priorities.

          The committee has carefully and comprehensively considered the system of private and public rulings issued by the commissioner. The committee has recognised the importance and significance of rulings for taxpayers. As an administrator, the Commissioner of Taxation has no authority to create law. Nevertheless, as a result of both legislative changes and the financial barriers in assessing judicial review, the committee acknowledges that the word of the commissioner has come to be seen by many as de facto or quasi law.

          The committee gave extensive consideration to proposals to make the commissioner's rulings subordinate law through the procedures of tabling and disallowance. While this mechanism would provide parliamentary scrutiny and an effective discipline in the exercise of the commissioner's powers and discretions, the committee considered that there were significant practical difficulties in such a system. In particular, the possibilities of delay and increased uncertainty, the need to establish a capacity within the parliament capable of analysing and evaluating technical and complex administrative guidelines, and the capacity of the commissioner to avoid the parliament through an issue of other administrative guidelines were considered to be so significant as to militate against the introduction of such a system.

          Nevertheless, the committee has concluded that parliamentary review is both necessary and desirable. The committee has recommended that all public rulings be tabled in the parliament and be available for review by the parliament's committees.

          The committee was of the opinion that, to a large extent, public rulings could be construed as delegated legislation—hence, the consideration given to whether they should be just tabled or whether they should be subject to disallowance. In the end, it was decided to recommend that the rulings be tabled in the parliament. I understand that there were 45 rulings last year. The reason the request was made for tabling is that, in the main, neither parliamentarians nor the general public at large have any idea of what rulings are made—they have no idea whatsoever. The committee had the opportunity to recommend that the rulings be made public and, hence, making the taxation commissioner more subject to scrutiny and more accountable to the parliament and thus the people.

          Since the introduction of the self-assessment system, the importance of taxation auditing to the detection of taxpayers who fail to comply with the law has been paramount. The powers of taxation auditors to access information are both extensive and exceptional. The committee carefully reviewed the auditing function. Its recommendations for change seek to establish a professional independent audit operation which is balanced and efficient. Through the separation of the information gathering and analysis functions from the decision making process, the committee considers that the powers of the auditors can be better harnessed and the independence of final decisions enhanced.

          I turn to the small claims tribunal. There can be little doubt that access to our judicial system has become the privilege of the privileged. It has become so expensive. In the field of taxation this is even more the case as there is no legal aid available to those citizens who wish to challenge the tax office. The committee has recognised this dilemma and urges the establishment of a low cost facility for the resolution of taxation claims below $5,000. While such a facility would not be judicial, it would allow issues of principle and importance to individuals to be argued and settled in a manner which is both practical and equitable. Under the committee's proposal, issues of significance could still be resolved by judicial interpretation where it was considered necessary. However, if the Taxation Office elected to go that route, such determinations would be paid for by the taxpayers and not by the single individual taxpayer.

          My concern about the unequal struggle between the bureaucracy and individual Australians became of vital importance to me during the long inquiry into the MidfordParamount affair, in respect of which we have seen in this last week that the taxpayers have to find $25 million to be paid by way of compensation to the people whose lives, businesses and reputations were ruined by the bureaucracy. It has been a long haul because the government originally opposed my wanting to make that reference to find justice for those people. My motion in this place to have that matter referred to the public accounts committee was vociferously opposed by Senator Button. But at the end of the day this matter was referred to the committee and, with Mr Punch, we worked to find justice for the people who had been destroyed by the actions of the bureaucracy.

To me, the Australian Taxation Office must be directly accountable to this parliament. Its officers must appear before estimates committees. There must be a thorough and ongoing accountability to the parliament for the way in which the commissioner exercises the vast amount of discretionary powers that he has under various pieces of legislation.

          In the area of rulings there was a further disagreement. I believe that this matter is of paramount importance. Those who read my minority report—and I strongly suggest that people do—will find that one of my major concerns about the manner in which public rulings are made is that they do in fact have the force of law. The commissioner declares that he is actually not making law but, to all intents and purposes, he is. I deal at some length with the constitutional questions that are raised in this respect.

          For that reason, I have said and insisted—not only at the end of the inquiry but also during the inquiry—that tabling and disallowance should be applicable to rulings; that, indeed, they should be made in accordance with the ordinary regulation making powers contained within the ordinary taxation legislation. Senator Parer in his tabling address said that the committee was concerned that those rulings should be tabled, but that is merely a method of publishing them. My concern is that the law is made by the parliament. Under our constitution it is the parliament that is required to impose laws.

          There was also a grave concern that with regard to private rulings some may get them and others may not.

And of course there is the extraordinary power conferred on the commissioner that he can revoke a private ruling on the basis that he has identified some other group of people that may be affected by the private ruling in a way which he considers to be adverse—a very curious conferring of power.

          I then go on to deal with the highly important question of tax reform and tax law simplification. Two things have occurred. Firstly, the law has become more and more complex because of the way in which legislation is drafted. The technique used is to try to imagine any particular loophole or exception or occurrence that may occur in the future. The result is that we have hugely complicated legislation, the meaning of which is not readily available to or understandable by ordinary Australians—and if the law is not comprehensible, then it is not good law.

          So when we talk about the purpose of that legislation, which has been to do away with evasion and avoidance, we also look at the question of simplification. But let me deal first with the question of evasion and avoidance. In the 10 years that Mr Keating has been either Treasurer or Prime Minister, all tax changes or so-called reforms have been brought in to, so-called, get rid of evasion and avoidance. Yet the Auditor-General now qualifies the financial statements of the Australian Taxation Office on the basis that the commissioner has not worked out a means of estimating how much revenue is still being evaded or avoided. The last time he was able to do that was for the 1985 tax summit. After that we have had to rely upon academics and others who are doing their own research and publishing, so that the most recent figure we have is one from an academic, which shows that perhaps the forgone revenue by way of evasion and avoidance is some $6 billion.

          To counter this, as I said, the tax gap which has been identified by the Auditor-General and which has resulted in the financial statements of the Australian Taxation Office being qualified for the last several years means that we have no measure, no ready reckoner, of whether or not the laws that are being introduced and administered by the tax act have been effective. So I have made a very strong recommendation that there be an outside review of how we can find a proper way of measuring that tax gap so that we can know whether there is efficiency in the administration of that office.

          One will also find in my minority report a detailed analysis of the manner in which Mr Boucher handled the modernisation agreements, both with the finance department and with the Public Sector Union. Those two agreements are in competition with each other. The promises made to the Department of Finance could not be met because of the effect of the Public Sector Union. One will find from the evidence that the Taxation Office was going to be $114 million short over a period of some two to three years; that if it did not get an injection of additional money, that is, $114 million, it was going to be unable to pay the salary bills.

I think honourable senators will find it interesting to note that the fringe benefits tax, which both the majority report and I recommend should be looked at in terms of being simplified and made more certain, has been one of the few growth areas of taxation revenue. But whether or not that is because more revenue is being collected under existing legislation or whether it is because new fringe benefits were added to the fringe benefits tax is not disclosed in any of the material provided by the Australian Taxation Office.

          Also dealt with in my minority report is the infamous black hole in the last budget of Mr Dawkins. After the budget was brought down it was discovered by the opposition that, indeed, there was a hole in the figures provided and that, when supporting documentation was read, one saw that new taxes, withholding taxes, were being foreshadowed for subsequent taxation years. There was also a minute tabled by Mr Boucher showing that he thoroughly supported withholding tax as the strategy to be pursued for the collection of tax to meet revenue targets, and yet he finally backed away from his own recommendations. When questions were asked about that black hole, the provision of the additional $114 million, the fact that that $114 million was needed for salaries to be paid and that, in the space of less than three weeks, $1.7 million was able to be found by way of additional compliance, we found that there were no answers forthcoming, and the reason for that change of mind remains a mystery.

          Honourable senators will find that I deal with a number of items relating to the politicisation of the Taxation Office—everything from the special treatment given by the deputy commissioner to Mr Keating over the failure to lodge tax returns, when ordinary Australians were prosecuted for that, to the way the commissioner dealt differently with information sought by the Fitzgerald inquiry and information sought by the WA Inc Royal Commission. Those questions remain unresolved, but the evidence remains on the record.

          My main concern in bringing down this report is that we see fairness and equity in the tax system. For that reason, I have also dealt with the question of capital gains tax. It is a discriminatory tax which is now being expanded by the way in which, by public rulings, law is effectively being made. I deal in the minority report with Hepple's case; the comments of the High Court, which said this was a matter for the parliament to fix, not the court; and with the subsequent amendment to the act and the way in which that has failed to fix the problem.

          The capital gains tax in terms of revenue that it was originally stated it would meet has not met those targets. But it has been a distorting tax in that, because the family home is exempted, savings have certainly been distorted. One did not have to be very smart to work out that that was going to occur. For that reason, and because it is a de facto wealth tax and a de facto death duties tax in many circumstances, I believe that justice and equity in the tax system would be better served not by taxing the family home—which is anathema to me—but by replacing the capital gains tax with a speculative gains tax.

Most ordinary Australians are hard working people who try very hard to comply with all laws. The law is complex as it is, and I am reminded of the fact that when the tax pack was first published, it was intended to mean that more Australians would be able to furnish their own returns but, in fact, what occurred was that the number of Australians who used accountants to furnish their returns went up; one look at that tax pack and it frightened them to death, me included.

          In fact, during the 1960s and 1970s, it is now recognised that there was widespread tax avoidance. In more recent years, the pendulum has swung very much, in fact too much, the other way.

I think it is appropriate that we should place on the record our wish of a speedy and complete recovery from his hospitalisation. I think it reflects the fact that we work hard in this place, that we put in long hours and that from time to time one of the consequences is ill health.

          While there have been many calls for the rewriting of the tax act, I issue a warning that it is not necessarily the Income Tax Assessment Act but perhaps the Fringe Benefits Tax Act that contains the greatest pitfalls nowadays or the greatest problems for taxpayers. I note my colleague Senator Bishop's comments in this regard. But in all these calls for the rewriting of the tax act, we have to acknowledge that, if the underlying premise is fundamentally wrong, plain English will not solve taxpayers' problems. It will be a complex task, and I urge the involvement of practitioners and academics outside the Taxation Office in that rewriting exercise.

          I think that one of the difficulties that taxpayers face nowadays is the failure, perhaps of the Taxation Office, to always acknowledge the important rule of law concept of precedent because without the acceptance of precedent there can be no certainty before the law. I think there are enough cases to indicate, perhaps, a need for a direction to the tax office in upholding this very important concept of precedents.

          There is also the other question of the emphasis of audit on grey areas. Certainty before the law is an utmost requirement in any taxation which relies on self-assessment. Therefore, in closing, I commend honourable senators to read the majority report and also the minority report, written by my colleague Senator Bishop. I think both these documents, and the attachments, will reflect significantly the further developments and modernisation of the tax office. I wish tax offices and others who will be involved in this process well.

         —Before lunch I was finalising some comments in response to Senator Watson and Senator Kernot. I do not want to talk for very long on the matter. I think I was developing the point that it is difficult to in all circumstances have a member representative as a trustee of a fund because some funds have a very high turnover of membership due to the type of industry that they are representing. I gave an illustration of the hospitality industry, where there can be an average turnover of staff of 100 per cent per quarter. It might sound a staggering figure, but it is not unusual.

         A trustee can be appointed and then leave that industry to seek or take up employment elsewhere, therefore having to leave the fund as a trustee. Someone else is then appointed. I think that would be an undesirable situation. There are many member trustees of funds anyway, so they certainly are not excluded in any manner or means. The other problem, which Senator Kernot touched on, is that this would mean that in some funds the trustee would have to resign.

         Senator Watson himself has acknowledged the very high standards of management of these industry funds. There does not appear to be an argument that the management in any way would be improved by these amendments. The majority of industry funds are quite large. They are not small funds with under 100 or 200 members. Many funds—probably the majority—would have tens of thousands of members. So we are dealing with funds that are very large and in which, in a sense, a professional full-time approach of time, demand and training is required. It is not always easy to find that in a member trustee who is a direct employee in the industry. For those reasons, we do not support the amendments.

         The Commonwealth had to rely on the trading or financial corporations power and the old age pension power contained in section 51 (xx) and (xxiii) of the Commonwealth constitution in order to enact this legislation.

         Unfortunately, there is also a cost to members of the superannuation funds, and to the employers sponsoring the funds, to amend the trust deeds and to incorporate companies on an ongoing basis in terms of administering the companies and filing returns. I remind the Senate of our recommendation that there essentially should be one return filed with the ISC and that when the ISC updates its computerised facilities then it will be in a position to accept that recommendation and to lodge any necessary fee or subsequent return with the ASC. Therefore, it will be necessary for the Australian Securities Commission to come up with a form of company structure which will simplify annual returns and this new compliance requirement.

Can we have certain assurances from the government and the advisers that the provisions of this bill will not be unconstitutional and that, therefore, the ISC will be in a position to be able to enforce the provisions against individuals and partnerships if they are not in a corporate state?

         —The Senate is addressing the Copyright Amendment (Re-enactment) Bill 1993. The bill, as the name implies, is a re-enactment of the 1989 amendment act, which has become invalid due to a decision by the High Court in May 1993. The provision which was fatal to the whole legislation related to the royalty payable on blank audio tapes. The High Court found the royalty to be a tax and that it therefore violated section 55 of the constitution which provides:

       </talk.start>

        Laws imposing taxation shall only deal with the imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions of the 1993 bill do not effect any policy change or new initiative. They are directed solely to re-enacting the amendments to the principal act made by the amending act of 1989, with the exception of those imposing, and related to the imposition of, the blank tape royalty. Thus, the amendments propose to do the following: protect performers from unauthorised recording or broadcasting of their live performances; enable educational institutions and institutions assisting the handicapped to copy television programs off air in return for payment to copyright owners; streamline the existing licences to educational institutions for photocopying by abandoning requirements for record keeping and payments for actual copying, and substituting an estimate payment scheme with charges made per student; remove copyright protection for industrially applied artistic works and so remove the duplication of protection under the Designs Act 1906; streamline the existing statutory licence for record manufacture; and make various other miscellaneous amendments primarily of a technical nature, given that the validation will be retrospective and, therefore, the stages of commencement of various parts of the amending act and the actual dates of the deemed commencement of particular sections are already known. The Democrats will be supporting the bill.

         —As Senator Spindler has outlined, the Copyright Amendment (Re-enactment) Bill 1993 simply seeks to validate all those portions of the Copyright Amendment Act that was passed in 1989, except those dealing with the blank tape royalty, which, as Senator Spindler and others pointed out earlier, was held by the High Court to be a tax. As a consequence, the whole bill, in effect, was held to be invalid because taxing bills can deal with only one subject of taxation and they must deal only with the imposition of tax. The blank tape royalty, which was held to be a tax, was so inextricably entwined with the other bits that the whole lot fell. Consequently, for the same reasons as outlined by the Australian Democrats, the coalition supports this bill.

         The purpose of the Copyright Amendment (Re-enactment) Bill 1993 is to repeal and re-enact, with retrospective effect, all the provisions of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 that made amendments to the principal act except those related to the blank tape royalty. The bill is necessary because of the opinion of the Chief General Counsel that the whole of the 1989 act is invalid as a result of the court decision concerning the constitutional invalidity of the blank tape royalty, which was referred to by Senator Spindler and Senator Vanstone.

         Clause 11 of the bill is a provision to ensure that regulations made under any invalid provisions are clearly validated. It does so by deeming them to have been made under the authority of the 1993 act but commencing on the dates that the regulations purported to commence. Such regulations include those made in respect of performer protection, provisions for which were included in the 1989 act.

         While this had been thought sufficient to protect the validity of the subordinate legislation, it had been overlooked that under sections 135P and 135ZZB, included in new parts VA and VB, provision was made for the declaration of certain collecting societies to be made by the Attorney-General. The respective declarations of the Audio-visual Copyright Society Ltd and the Copyright Agency Limited were published in the government notices section of the

         Because the bill has not included specific provisions covering these declarations, there may be doubt as to whether they are saved simply by the retrospective enactment of the primary provisions. This proposed amendment remedies this omission and resolves any doubt. It will add a new clause—clause 10A—which states specifically that the declarations made under the retrospective provisions set out in the clause are taken to have been made in the 1993 act but operate from the making of the declarations.

         The proposed amendment is thus in the same form as clause 11 of the bill. It refers specifically to the two clauses—135P and 135ZZB—so as to clearly identify the declarations that are the subject of this special provision. There are no other declarations or notices by the Attorney-General requiring this treatment, and there is no financial impact on the Commonwealth. That having been said, I thank the opposition and the Australian Democrats for their support of the bill.

Of course, on a few occasions the Senate has come to a different view—so has the High Court—from that of the chief parliamentary counsel. Nonetheless, there were so many people saying, `There is a risk in this'. This presents an example of where the government's own counsel was saying that there was a risk. The government proceeded anyway; it lost by only one; nonetheless it lost.

I suspect that we might need to find a way—perhaps even by way of a particular category of advice that comes from the chief parliamentary counsel—to let parliament now know, not about the options the government has discarded, but about the option we are being asked to follow.

         What the Commonwealth has done over recent years—this year is no exception—is squeeze very hard on payments to the states; at the same time, it has gone on its merry way, spending without constraint for its own purposes. Although of a minor magnitude, a classic example of the philosophy and the arrogance that underline that is the recent revelations of the Prime Minister's penchant for Thai teak tables at the Lodge and for Gould bird prints in the cabinet room, at an extra cost of $100,000 to Australian taxpayers. There are already 3,000 works of art in the parliament, all of which would very appropriately be able to adorn the cabinet room. It is all part of the approach of this government.

         When the proposed taxation and other revenue measures are taken into account—and they are the bills that have all been dealt with in recent weeks—this budget has been an unmitigated disaster for the government, both politically and in simple economic terms. Although Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is the main budget bill, it seeks to appropriate only a relatively small proportion of the government's total expenditure requirements this financial year, namely, $29 billion. That is because most of the expenditure by government is appropriated through other bills, for example, the social security bill and the like. Nevertheless, this bill is an extremely important bill.

It has increased taxes—and I will come back to this in a moment—except for the small cut in personal income tax that has taken effect this week. It is nonsense to suggest, as the government does, that by increasing the overall level of taxation it will stimulate the economy. Economic growth and the related desperately sought employment growth are not advanced by tax rises, yet this budget has attempted to do just that.

         Those income tax reductions will provide Australians with an extra $1.7 billion in their pockets in 1993-94. That will escalate over the next four years by an additional $12 billion or so. That does not sound too bad, does it? But on the other hand, those tax cuts are dwarfed absolutely by the $31.6 billion in additional tax revenue that the government plans to reap from Australians over the next four years. Despite the income tax cuts, over the next four years every Australian will pay an extra $1,800 in tax. Every household will have to pay an additional $5,650 in tax on top of the taxes that they are currently paying.

         The government is rife with splits. We have had a major split between the two main economic ministers, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in the last couple of weeks over the question of taxes. The Treasurer adamantly said that taxes will not go up and the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, very clearly raised the possibility of future tax increases. It is less than 10 days ago that he said that the government's deficit strategy may involve some revenue increases, though the government will be very cautious about introducing any substantial additional tax increases. By saying that, Finance Minister Willis is quite clearly indicating that the government is certainly contemplating the need for tax increases in the period ahead.

         Will spending be cut to make way for the additional spending promises made for the Olympics, labour programs, Mabo and so on? If the government is to stick with its target of reducing the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97—that one per cent is creeping out, it is already up to 1.2 per cent—how will that target be met unless either expenditure in other areas is cut or taxes increased. It appears highly likely, given the statements of the ministers, that both will occur. So there have been major splits between the fundamental economic ministers. There has been a split over the reform agenda of the government.

The industrial relations package, which is being debated at this very moment in the other House, sets the process of reform backwards. It does not take it forward. The package represents the worst of trade union privilege and puts trade unions further above the law.

Whilst that might help people who are lucky enough to maintain their job, it does precious little for those who are unable to find a job or who are squeezed out of the work force as a result of all of those situations.

That indefensible budget, to quote the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, had to go through four rewrites before it was eventually passed. That was a classic example of an inept, out of touch party which even turned on itself. We have seen splits in the government over the fundamental issue of health. We have growing questions over the Prime Minister's leadership capacity and judgment. The teak table exercise, the cabinet room prints and the like are testimony to that.

         —In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter that has been worrying me for some time. In fact, this matter has come to my attention as chairman of the opposition's waste watch committee. From what I have seen, there is something very wrong with Australia's major communication carrier, Telstra, formerly known as Telecom. Over the last six months I have been involved in investigating a number of allegations of malpractice by Telstra which have been made by both former and present employees. In that time I have met personally with a number of individuals who have made these allegations and I am convinced that it is time for a drastic overhaul of the means by which the management of Telstra operates.

         I have discovered that overtime abuse within Telstra is not uncommon and that such abuse has existed for many years, apparently with the quiet blessing of management. It is abuse which is costing Australian taxpayers millions of dollars. I have also discovered evidence of overtime rorts within Telstra and of Telstra conducting activities which are not only illegal but also are outside the gambit of the Telecommunications Act.

         Finally, I have been able to obtain from the chief executive officer of Telstra, Mr Frank Blount, an indication that there are currently 800 employees under scrutiny for travel allowance fraud. However, of those 800 people, Telstra has managed to bring only a mere handful to court. Most of the individuals it has taken to court to date are in fact former employees who have turned whistleblowers in an attempt to highlight the abuse. They are individuals of lesser rank within the organisation, whilst those guilty at a higher level appear to have escaped unscathed.

         The pursuit by Telstra of former employees involved in travel allowance fraud is without any particular formula or management protocol. I am aware that a particular employee was let off a fraud of over $100,000, yet others have lost their jobs over fraud involving much lesser figures. Telstra has launched Operation Echo in an attempt to resolve some of these travel allowance fraud issues. According to the response which I received in estimates, Operation Echo has cost over $250,000 since May last year, yet the amount returned to Telstra is pitiful. Much of the problem with travel allowance fraud within Telstra stems from the fact that management has failed to resolve the contentious issue with the union. In effect, Telstra management has not had the courage to confront the union and that failure to reach agreement has cost Australian phone users millions of dollars.

         Telstra has admitted, in response to my questions, that under the existing guidelines it is possible for employees to be paid travel allowance even though they may only be 1 1/2 hours away from their home.

When we add to that rostered days off and long weekends, we can double the amount.

         Telstra has gone so far as to admit that in its current guidelines for travel allowance purposes, there is no minimum prescribed distance. I am sure that within Telstra a culture has developed amongst employees in which travel allowance is seen as a legitimate means of increasing income. I would steadfastly argue that no employee should be out of pocket whilst undertaking duties on behalf of their employer away from home, but what we have at Telstra is a system which is open to abuse, which has been abused, which continues to be abused and which has drawn little, if any, action from the Telstra management to resolve the matter.

         In mentioning these further abuses, I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the case of a Mr Geoff Marr. Mr Marr is a former employee of Telstra who has been dismissed over a purported Cabcharge abuse of around $200. There are two points which need to be made at this stage. The first is that Telstra by its own admission has spent over $145,000 pursuing Mr Marr over this Cabcharge abuse of $200. The second is that these allegations of Cabcharge abuse by Telstra management against Mr Marr only came to light after Mr Marr had taken the step of informing management of his concerns regarding overtime abuse within his department. I believe that Telstra has in reality spent around $400,000 pursuing Mr Marr. I believe it has done so in an effort to silence him and to discredit him, because of his claims of management malpractices. As an example of that, under freedom of information he has obtained over 50,000 pages of documented reports that have been put together about his activities.

         We must remember that Mr Marr is unique in that he is the only employee that Telstra has chosen to pursue, Australia-wide, for Cabcharge abuse. Yet Telstra records confirm that other employees have used Cabcharge in similar ways to Mr Marr. Those same records show that a Telstra employee, Mr Gary Ryan, and an associate caught a taxi from Melbourne to Sydney at Telstra expense in September-October 1989 because a flight was missed, in preference to attending a social function, and no action was taken. There are two standards which have been adopted by Telstra management, one which applies to employees who toe the line and another which applies to employees who are not prepared to condone abuses of the system.

         —I rise to speak on the appropriation bills before the Senate today. I would like to direct my opening remarks towards Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94, and the Department of Transport and Communications, particularly with regard to road transport. This appropriation bill deals with road funding, shipping, waterfront, rail and transport. In the continuation of this government's ever decreasing allocation of money to roads, the government has really gone overboard this time. When the Fraser government went out of power, some 7c per litre of the road fuel levy received was going back into roads. Approximately $1.3 billion was allocated to roads by the federal government in one financial year.

         A little bit at a time this government allowed it to go to about $1.6 billion, but that was only last year with the black spot program. An extra amount was added on for that program, which I will come back to later. But generally this government did not increase road funding in real terms from the day it came to government. It was locked in for the first year of government by the budget at the time and agreements that existed with the states, but within 18 months it had gone back to cutting road funding right around Australia.

         So the $1.3 billion continued on for some time. All this time the state of the roads was deteriorating. The black spot program was introduced by the Hawke government, I believe as a political exercise at the time. I criticised it at the time. I always maintained that the black spots on the roads were not necessarily where the high unemployment was. Mr Hawke tried to relieve high unemployment with the black spot program. Fortunately, the minister for land transport at the time, Mr Brown, turned it into a worthwhile exercise and directed funding to the black spot program where it was really needed. I commend him for his work during the time he had control of the black spot program.

         In this budget, road funding has been reduced from $1.628 billion right down to $1,019.6 million in 12 months. For a  government that prides itself on increasing exports to get greater export income, this is a total disgrace. It is worse when one reads in the forward estimates that in the next budget it is going to decline further to $813 million, which means that in the space of two years road funding by the federal government will have been cut exactly in half.

Getting back to the subject, the more remote areas of Australia is where the main exports come from. One would know from the Mabo debate that Western Australia produces 25 per cent of export income. That export income comes from the remote areas. You cannot mine in Kings Park. Even if you wanted to you would not be allowed, not that I recommend it. You cannot mine a river. You cannot grow wheat in St George's Terrace. It has to be grown in those remote areas, that I inhabit so very often. Unfortunately, with the hours and weeks we sit in this place the time I spend there is getting less and less. Anyhow, I volunteered for that when I went for preselection in 1986. The state of our roads is deteriorating. Bitumen generally—and I have a bit of experience in road making from my local government days—lasts for 40 years.

         —Yes, it depends on the specifications. I am talking about bitumen on highways and main roads, which generally lasts about 40 years. Generally, it needs no maintenance for about 15 years. Someone will shoot me down for that statement. Of course, it depends on the amount of traffic on it and the weather. The weather has a lot to do with it, in particular rainfall. The optimum rainfall for road making, if I can remember my textbooks, is about 18 inches a year in the old terms. So, if there is a lot more or a lot less, that can affect it.

         We are looking at a period of 40 years. For 15 years nothing needs to be done. After 15 years, it is necessary to start spending money. When a road is 15 to 25 years old, a reasonable amount of money needs to be spent on it, and after that it goes up. This is especially so on the narrower roads because there is shoulder maintenance. If the roads are wide enough, if they are the normal highway specifications, vehicles do not go off the edges and the roads do not break down. That is basically where spending starts.

         Unfortunately, a lot of the bitumen roads in Australia today are in that 25 to 40 years phase. In fact, the bulk of them would be in the 35 to 40 year stage. A lot of money will need to be spent to maintain those roads. Of course, a lot are getting to the stage where they need to have the rippers put through them and started again. For a new road, it is not only a matter of putting a new black top on it; foundations have to be laid again. According to the fourth rule in the textbooks, without new foundations corrugations will go down to the base of the road and it will have to be built again. That is where the real cost comes from. I cannot understand why this government did not increase road funding from $1.3 billion. It funded a one-off black spot program, which I understand saved a lot of lives in certain areas. Then it cut back funding by $600 million this year, with a further cutback of $200 million next year. I just cannot see how the government hopes to maintain those roads.

         I know there is thinking, not so much from the government, but from the minor parties in this place, that more goods should go back on to rail. I myself am a great believer that more goods should go back to rail, but one has to be practical and sensible about this. I have said before in this place and I will say again that 70 per cent of all Australian goods have to go by road. There is not much choice about that. Seventy per cent of those goods then going by road travel less than 70 kilometres and are handled a minimum of twice. They are loaded on and loaded off. So we cannot get away from that road concept.

         There was an increase in the fuel levy in the last budget. We debated that at the time. For a while there were a couple of amendments supported by the Greens, but then, when the crunch came, they folded. I would have forgiven the government for that sort of increase, even though it will increase the cost of exports to Australia, if an extra allocation had gone to helping to maintain roads, to keep those exports moving. But, no, the government failed completely to do that.

         If we look at the humanitarian side of things, it is no secret that the worse the roads are, the more deaths there are on the roads. It is a simple fact. There has been great progress made on extending the Hume Highway all the way from Melbourne to Sydney. It can be seen that, per kilometre travelled per vehicle, road deaths are being cut down, and it is the same in Western Australia. There is a dual carriageway out of Perth to as far as Sawyers Valley. For years and years I went up and down that road. I used to see a lot of accidents. That road is only about 45 kilometres long or thereabouts. There were a lot of fatal accidents, let alone injury causing accidents. Now, because of the dual highway, those accidents do not occur as often. If there is an accident, it is usually a one-vehicle accident.

         In Northam in Western Australia, they have been trying to build a bypass probably for the last 10 or 12 years, but funding is never forthcoming. When I was still in local government, the first time that a bypass was looked at for that place, if I can remember rightly, the cost was $6 million or $7 million. The latest quote—and there are no funds available, so it is hardly worth while considering the quote—was $30 million. That is more than half, roughly half, if I have it right, of what Western Australia has been allocated for total road funding for the year. So we have the situation that the longer those roads are left, the more dangerous they become.

         Then there is another point. When the roads get into a bad condition, as I said, the numbers of road accidents build up and there are more deaths. One certain way to circumvent that is to drive a heavier or safer vehicle. I made a conscious decision last week about the four-wheel drive vehicle that I drive. I considered that I had seen too many of them in accidents, especially on rough roads. I thought it was time to get into something heavier. If I did that, there must be a lot of others, hundreds and thousands doing that. For that reason alone, the cost of safe transport in these remote areas is going up.

I refer, for example, to the sales tax on wine. I said at the time that I am not very interested in wine because I do not drink it, but I am certainly interested in the vine growers of Western Australia, and indeed all of Australia, who have been so badly affected.

         Then there was the extra sales tax on cars and heavy vehicles.

I think that the wine levy accounted for something like $85 million. The rest came from increased sales tax on cars and every other thing, including heavy vehicles. I said at the time that the cost of a prime mover would go up by $2,000 in the first instance and another $2,000 next year, making all transport dearer, of course, which will lead to higher costs in the inland areas.

Anyone as old as I am can remember when decimal currency and metric weights came in. We were given a hand to change over accounting machines and things like that; we had a subsidy. If something like that were done, it would take those cars off the road a lot quicker, but the government cut that one off. Anyhow, I could go on and on about that.

         Only five days after the federal election Treasurer Dawkins announced that the government had no intention of keeping its promise to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995. This was the first post-election act of betrayal. Despite having reiterated the `no tax by 1995' promise in black and white in its own election policy document, the Treasurer had the gall to inform Australia's 1.5 million pensioners five days after the election that the government had sold them a lemon.

         These tax hikes are not the only nasties for older people in the budget. During the election campaign the government was very keen to point out the extent of the real increase in home and community care funding since the program's inception in 1985. However, for the second year running, the government has reduced the real rate of growth in HACC funding. It is now down to an all-time low of six per cent. While much less than 50 per cent of the HACC target population is able to access the services, these reductions must be questioned. They also run counter to the government's stated objective of encouraging greater independence for the frail aged. Such a funding cut really makes one wonder whether this objective is dollar driven rather than care driven.

         I would like to finish talking about the impact of the budget on older people by referring to two budget decisions that highlight the deception and hypocrisy of this government. I turn firstly to the hypocrisy. Last year the previous Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, came out and attacked the coalition over and over again—he lambasted us—for suggesting that the age at which women receive the age pension should be increased to 65. He went right out of the tree. But in another post-election backflip, the government announced that the budget for 1995 would increase the age pension age for women to 65. He attacked us before the election, when we told the truth, and then changed it around after it.

         I now turn to the government's deception. In the budget the government announced that the target ratio of community aged care packages, or CACPs, per thousand aged 70 and over would be increased from five to 7.5. This is what it says in the budget—but when is it going to happen? By the year 2000. And the number of funded hostel places would be reduced accordingly.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The department has admitted that the 7.5 is only a mid-term target that will be achieved around the turn of the century. The current number of CACPs is a mere fraction of 7.5—in fact, probably less than one per cent. However, in every piece of government literature that I have seen since the election, the false impression is given that the 7.5 places per thousand have already been achieved or will be achieved very soon. But let the public know that it is around the year 2000—another beyond 2000 promise.

         There is no indication that this is only a target, and very rarely is it ever mentioned that it will be offset by a corresponding decrease in hostel places. So those opposite herald the increase to 7.5 when, really, that target will not be reached until the year 2000, and they do not tell people that that is being balanced by decreases in hostel places. It is sort of like a magician's sleight of hand, but we do not see the rabbit out of the hat until the year 2000. It is just another example of how the Labor government is willing to deceive and mislead the Australian public to meet its own political ends.

         Many of the issues that I have addressed tonight pertain to women as well. Senator Panizza talked about the government's not addressing road funding in this budget. The issue that women in rural areas repeatedly discuss with me is road funding. The Country Women's Association some years ago did a survey and asked women in rural areas which Commonwealth funding issue most concerned them. The answer was road funding. One might have thought education, health or many other issues, but road funding was the issue those women were concerned about. They were concerned about how the products would get from the farm gate to the distributors; they were concerned about how their kids were going to get home when they drove their cars; and they were concerned about their spouses driving into town to pick up supplies for their farms. Road funding is an issue for women.

         For many women who are using the second car at home, which is most probably a car that requires leaded petrol, the increase in the petrol excise will have an effect. The increase in wholesale sales tax on many of the items they purchase—household goods—will affect them. The budget does nothing to address the unemployment problem for women. It also affects the pharmaceutical benefits scheme delay and the delay in the dental health program. All of those delays affect women.

         It is also of concern to the coalition that one of the Labor government's major election promises to women, namely the introduction of a home child-care allowance, would be provided 18 months after the election—again, off into the never-never. What the election was about was lies and what this budget is about is promises that go off into the future. It is typical of members of this Labor government who lied their way into government and who, in fact, have done very little in this budget to address the issues of unemployment which concern women.

         I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that there are at least four reasons why Senator Evans should see Mrs Gillespie. Firstly, she is an Australian with a right to speak to her foreign minister about a matter which comes within his ambit and to explore with him any possible future options. Secondly, I believe that such a meeting would give a very strong signal to the Malaysian government and to the wider Australian community that Senator Evans takes this case particularly seriously. I think it is a great pity for that reason that no such meeting has taken place. Thirdly, a little girl who has her Australian passport has been kidnapped from this country.

         Another matter which was extensively canvassed at the Estimates A hearings concerned the Mabo case. The committee spent some two hours on 8 November canvassing some of the problems and issues which have emerged. There were two particular issues that I sought to press Senator Evans and his advisers on which I felt were of great concern to the Australian people. The first one was what proportion of the land mass of this country, in the government's opinion, may possibly be validly claimed under native title. I think that is a very important question. Is it correct that some 40 per cent of Western Australia may be claimed? Senator Collins and Senator Tambling would certainly wish to know how much of the Northern Territory may be claimed under native title.

As the counter-memorial said, if Australia's hands are dirty in this case, the hands of Nauru are equally dirty. It does not come with cleans hands to this issue.

I am sure Senator Carr will agree that it is an extraordinary case. Again, I press Senator Evans to supply this legal advice so that we are better able to judge whether the taxpayers' money has been responsibly spent.

         Senator Carr was kind enough to raise implicitly, in a rather unpleasant manner and with overtones that I do not accept, the issue of another very dramatic step that Senator Evans, one of the leading republicans, has taken in allowing Australian human rights cases to be ultimately complained to a number of UN committees. As would you understand, Madam Acting Deputy President, this overturns the philosophy of the Australia Act, whereby the Australian government severed ties with the Privy Council.

         Madam Acting Deputy President, one of your former leaders, Mr Gough Whitlam, put it quite well when he said that it was not appropriate for Australians to litigate their differences before foreigners and that it was appropriate that the Australian legal system be self-contained. That is how Mr Whitlam justified the Australia Act. Frankly, I think that statement had a lot of merit.

         Five years later, the Labor government has opened up appeals to three UN committees. I do not plan to go through what I would regard as a fairly comprehensive adjournment speech given on this issue on 26 October 1993. However, the interesting thing is that, when I pressed Senator Evans as to whether he was aware of concerns which had been expressed about the functioning of these committees, I thought he seemed genuinely surprised. Indeed, I was a little surprised that some of the public servants advising him seemed to be genuinely surprised.

         I will run through some of the criticisms of the UN committees. Firstly, a number of the members of the committees are not seen to be independent of their government. Some of them are employed by the governments that nominate them to the committees. Allied to that point is the fact that, frankly, many of the governments represented on these committees are not democracies. In other words, they have not reached that appropriate structure in their community which allows freedom and liberty to flourish. So we have people who are not independent being nominated by governments that are either not free or are partly free.

         Secondly, the committees do not adopt what we regard as proper processes. In other words, people's standing before the committees is restricted. Their hearings are often held in camera and they are dependent on finance from the UN and sometimes governments. These committees are associated with a range of problems, all of which compromise their independence and mean that they do not meet proper standards of legal processes.

         Another issue of concern is that not only are these Australian cases able to be complained to these committees, but the Australian government reports to these committees. I have made the point before that Jim Scullin, Ben Chifley, John Curtin, Robert Menzies and Billy Hughes would never have reported, particularly before the war, to, for example, the British colonial office on any matter in the way that Senator Evans and Mr Keating report to the UN. The affection that any Australian pre-war monarchist may have felt for the British empire is literally nothing compared with the adoration that Senator Evans and Mr Keating feel for the United Nations.

         I had wished to raise a number of other matters, but time is certainly on the wing. One of those matters—on which I would have hoped to have got some support, even from Senator Carr—relates to the ABC and the need to decentralise the activities of the ABC away from Sydney. Senator Zakharov, as a Victorian, and Senator Carr, as a Victorian, could understand the great concern amongst ABC people in Melbourne—and in all other states—about the total expenditure of resources in Sydney and the control of virtually all activities of the ABC from one particular capital.

If we are to address unemployment in Australia, we must look at the investment figures that apply to wealth creation in this country. If we can have investment in wealth creation, we will have real employment, and real employment will address unemployment. It is no good pursuing these phoney schemes that employ people for a few months. It is no good educating young people if, at the end of the education, there is no job.

         Let us look at Singapore. It is a very interesting place. The average weekly earnings in Singapore are the same as Australia; that is, about $26,000 a year. The marginal rate of tax in Singapore is 14 per cent. Is it any wonder that countries like that have a high savings ratio. There is an incentive to save not an incentive to consume and spend. Under our system and with the high marginal rates of tax there is a disincentive to put money into a building society to earn interest because one pays 34 per cent or 47 per cent tax.

         It is quite obvious that the people on the Labor side of politics, who regrettably are in government, do not care about unemployment. Over the last 20 minutes, they have tried to stifle any positive proposals I have given to fix the unemployment problem. There are two very simple solutions. We could have a tax regime that is competitive with the countries with whom we compete. Secondly, we should get rid of the centralised wage fixing system with all the ridiculous restrictive work practices that go with it. I have never complained in this place about wage rates. There are no problems with the wage rates in Australia particularly with the devaluation of the dollar.

         —I realise that it is Wednesday night and I do not want to detain the Senate for very long. An extremely important issue which is of great concern to many people in Australia, particularly the environmental movement and many people in this place, is the protection of old growth forests, especially in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. Most honourable senators will be aware that there is in existence an intergovernmental agreement—an agreed forest strategy—which refers to the need to protect and review old growth forests and to protect areas of high conservation value so that they can be properly assessed and certainly not clear felled or interfered with in any way.

         My purpose in speaking this evening is to point out that I have received a document written by the forest ecologist in the Environmental Protection Unit in New South Wales. He points out that compartments 1375, 1380, 1381 and 1387 in the Cathcart State Forest had been set aside as compartments with special prescription qualities. They are recognised as areas of high conservation significance and they are also areas which provide a habitat link between the proposed Coolangubra and Tantawangalow national parks. Despite this recognition and despite the recommendation from the National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales that this area not be touched, it certainly appears from this document that this recommendation was overridden at the ministerial level and permission for the New South Wales Forestry Commission to log these areas has been granted. I therefore seek leave to table this document.

The significance of the document in relation to this chamber and this parliament lies in the fact that there is this intergovernmental agreement in which the states and the Commonwealth, with the exception of Tasmania, have undertaken to defend and protect these areas, pending their complete assessment. Clearly, this document shows that in this case New South Wales has gone against its own recommended protection and the minister has actually overridden the recommendation. Consequently,  I  believe that  this  puts  the

         The point of detaining the Senate this evening for an extra three or four minutes was to make that point and make yet another appeal to Minister Kelly to ensure that these very important areas are protected because once we chop down a 300- or 400-year-old tree there is no way we can put that back in less than 300 or 400 years. This is a very asymmetric decision that has been made in relation to forests. We can decide not to chop down the trees; if we want to change our minds next week or next month we can do it. Once the trees are gone, there is no way in which that sort of decision can be changed.
