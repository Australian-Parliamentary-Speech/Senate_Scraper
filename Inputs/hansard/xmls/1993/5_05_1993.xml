I hope this chamber will see these reforms as part of a package that the Government is bringing on for debate today to improve the processes and procedures of this chamber.

I doubt that there will be a huge amount of controversy about the first matter dealing with titles of office holders in this chamber, which I know has the strong support of the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Colston. The Government is absolutely determined to remove the hyphen between the word `Deputy' and the word `President' to improve our Standing Orders.

        —The debate that took place when I started as Parliamentary Secretary and, subsequently, the second time around, which led to the final form of words contained in this motion, as I recall it, may well have taken place before I became Manager of Government Business in the Senate. There was a significant period during which I was a Parliamentary Secretary and not Manager of Government Business. It came from discussions that we had which did not relate to my capacity, in particular, as Parliamentary Secretary, but which related to dealing with certain Bills.

        With regard to the first Bill I dealt with as Parliamentary Secretary, I operated on a fairly constrained interpretation of my rights in that matter. The Opposition raised some concern and said, `This is limiting the debate because you are not participating fully in a way that a Minister would'. I think either Senator Watson or Senator Baume raised some concerns which I thought were right. We undertook some further discussions and then had a subsequent debate in the Parliament.

        Certainly, the exercise of these rights as set out in notice of motion No. 7 was indispensable to my conduct of the role of Manager of Government Business, but it was also fundamental to the basic discharge of debate in the Parliament on all those tax Bills and on the other matters of legislation with which I dealt both here and before the various committees of the Parliament, representing Ministers or in my own capacity as a Parliamentary Secretary. For example, the capacity of Senator Sherry to represent the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy before the estimates committee derives from this proposed resolution because the standing orders of the committees operate on the same basis as these Standing Orders.

        When the sessional order was more constrained than this, it caused problems not so much for us—although also for us—but for the Opposition. This motion is fundamentally consistent—although I cannot say identical because I have not checked the final form—with the procedure in the House of Representatives. As I understand it, it is also consistent with the operation of Parliamentary Secretaries in most parliaments around the world. Furthermore, it is not so much in the interests of the Government but in the interests of the Parliament.

        The point we are discussing here is that, come 1 July, the Government will have only 30 senators in this chamber. Therefore, Ministers will have to carry an extra load because the Government could not attract enough votes to get more senators. There is no reason why we should not examine the proposal to have Ministers from the lower House who are responsible for expenditure attend at estimates committees in the carriage of the debate concerning the proper expenditure of taxpayers' money. That is a much better proposal than having someone, who is merely categorised as a Parliamentary Secretary in order to be given lurks and perks, carrying on as if he or she were truly a Minister.

        For heaven's sake, there is nothing to prevent the Government having all the Government senators declared Parliamentary Secretaries with the status of Ministers. It makes a mockery and laughing stock of the Government's position of having a so-called small number of people who constitute the Ministry. As there are 40 in the Ministry now, will it be 50 next time and maybe 60 the time after that, with de facto pay increases?

        This motion is being brought on in this chamber for the simple reason that there will be only 30 senators on that side. If the Democrats vote with the Government on any particular issue, it will no longer be enough to give it the numbers. The Government will either have to get the concurrence of the Greens or Senator Harradine in order to get legislation passed. We have to acknowledge exactly what this is:  it is a grab at a de facto increase in the number of Ministers.

The number of Ministers in the Senate has been increased from six to 10. I am not opposed to that, but I am opposed to our having to change the Sessional Orders for the purpose of accommodating paybacks to the mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Since the number of Ministers that we have in the Senate has gone up from six to 10, I would have thought that we could expect to have at least one Minister attend each of the estimates committees.

We are fortunate that the electors of Australia recognised that talent and the lack of talent in the Opposition.

Except for the Select Committee on Superannuation, which I would hope to conclude as chair—that continues for only another month—it is not anticipated that I would be able to chair any other committees in future in my current position. That means that potentially I am in for a pay decrease, not a pay increase.

Senator Cook has to be the nominated one who can handle those matters. I ask the Democrats, if they hear this or happen to read about it in the future, to think about that before they run willy-nilly and lie down to the Government again in the first controversial decision in this new Parliament.

        What the people have to understand is that in this chamber, where the Hare-Clarke system of voting is undertaken, which is the true reflection of what the Australian public wants, the number of Government senators is now down to 30. Thirty members of the Labor Party got Senate seats. On this side of the chamber we got 36 seats. That is the true reflection of the voting of the people when it is not done on just those few dicey seats.

         —Indeed, as Senator Coates would readily acknowledge, the aim is to abolish the Senate. It is the unmitigated truth that the Labor Party wants to abolish the Senate. Senator Gareth Evans has been quoted as saying that he would come into the Senate and white-ant it from within. Senator Evans has said at Labor meetings, `Yes, we will have to take that off our party agenda, but there is no need for us not to work at it underneath'. Obviously his main purpose in coming into the Senate was to white-ant it from within.

As Senator Kemp has said, we now have additional Ministers and 10 Parliamentary Secretaries who will be pseudo-Ministers. Estimates in this place has been downgraded to such an extent that we have a Parliamentary Secretary, with no knowledge at all, taking the place of a Minister who is meant to be representing the Minister in the other place.

        One politician whose example has been especially important to me is my predecessor, John Button. His commitment to Australian industry and sustainable industry development has helped to put this country in a stronger position to meet the challenges ahead than it might otherwise have been. He believed that Australia's future depended on its ability to maintain a strong, innovative and diverse industrial base. This is a belief I share.

        John Button's commitment to Australian industry marked him as an authentic Australian nationalist—unlike the sham loyalists who bristle whenever anyone suggests that we should have our own flag, but who could not care less where the flag is manufactured or who owns the ground it is planted in. John Button's reputation for honesty and integrity has enhanced the standing of politicians generally, as well as the cause of Labor in Victoria and beyond. His record of achievement will be difficult to match.

        The election was resolved in favour of Labor's vision. The people of this country once again rejected the attitudes and the policies of the New Right which have held the Liberal Party of Australia captive for the past 10 years. The result on 13 March demonstrated the level of public commitment to social democratic values in this country. It indicated the direction that the majority of Australians wanted their society to move in. It demonstrated once again the confidence that the Australian people have in the Keating Government and the Australian Labor Party, and the ideals they represent.

        As a Victorian, the long-term economic decline of my home State is a matter of special concern. The 1980s brought to light deep structural problems within our economy and saw a major shift in resources from the south-east of the continent to the north and the west. Throughout that decade, economic growth in Victoria was often below the national average as measured by national account estimates.

        During the recent recession, 60 per cent of Australian job losses occurred in Victoria. The reasons for Victoria's decline are complex. One will search in vain for a truthful explanation of the State's predicament in the self-serving propaganda of the Kennett Government. Victoria's current problems cannot be adequately explained purely in terms of debt, which is lower under Labor than it was under Henry Bolte; in terms of wage costs, which are lower under Labor than they were under Rupert Hamer; or just in terms of financial mismanagement, which is worse under Jeff Kennett than it has ever been before.

        The depth of the recession in Victoria can be attributed to the interaction of structural factors like the State's reliance on protected industries; cyclical factors like the inevitable collapse of the speculative construction boom; and human factors like the failure of poorly managed enterprises such as the Farrow Group.

The last accord, known as mark 7, places responsibility for industrial organisation on workers and their unions, operating within a framework of minimum standards awarded by industrial tribunals.

Many of these are completely outdated and in need of major revision. Many offer wages and conditions grossly inferior to enterprise agreements currently being won by workers and their unions. In Victoria, hundreds of thousands of workers are fleeing to the federal industrial jurisdiction to escape the savage attacks launched on them by the Kennett Government.

The number of Australian children staying on to year 12 has increased from four in 10 to eight in 10 over the space of 10 years. However, much more can be done to provide not just equality of opportunity but greater equality of educational outcomes. The unequal educational outcomes we see today are primarily the result of differences in social background, economic circumstances and what educationalists have come to call cultural capital.

        A republican Australia would at last be free of the confusion about our national identity which has baffled many people overseas and even some within our own shores. Australia's national identity is lived out each day by its people, and it lives on in the National Estate. During the past 20 years, Labor governments have established a proud tradition of protecting and enlarging our natural and cultural heritage. Labor has introduced legislation to preserve world heritage areas, the built environment and our Aboriginal heritage. At the Federal level, there has been enormous investment in national institutions such as the Australian National Gallery, the National Library of Australia, the National Maritime Museum and the National Museum of Australia. These museums and repositories contain the collective memory and the collective conscience of the nation. It will be essential in a new Australian republic that all Australians have access to this wealth of material, and I welcome the Government's commitment to the establishment of a foundation of Australian cultural development.

        Finally, the Labor Party is committed to constitutional reform. We have a lot of unfinished business left over from the 19th century, when working people and their representatives were largely excluded from the constitution-making process. In my view, the republican debate has so far been too narrow in its focus. If we are to achieve meaningful constitutional change we should be thinking and talking about  broader  issues  than  who  should be the president of Australia. For instance, there can be no new republic without a reconciliation with  the  Aboriginal  people  of  this  country.

        The present ground swell for constitutional reform gives us a once-in-a-century chance to declare our independence, and that is not insignificant. It also gives us the chance to give constitutional expression to Australia's social and democratic values. I welcome the Government's commitment, as outlined in the Governor-General's speech yesterday, to ongoing constitutional reform, considered separately and on its own merits. It is important to remember that a constitution is not just a set of procedural rules or a description of political machinery; it is also a statement of beliefs and aspirations. The founders of the Commonwealth understood that political structures can embody certain principles, and they set out to write a constitution that reflected their belief that the interests of property could predominate over the interests of the majority. This is why Australia is a federation and this is why federalism has become essentially a device to fragment and frustrate the democratic will. That is why we have the section 92 free trade guarantee and other provisions designed to prevent people from exercising control over capital.

        The recent election result is a reminder that Australians no longer subscribe to the principle that property should come first, the people second—that is, if they ever really did. That result demonstrates once again that a majority of Australians are unshakably committed to the principles of social democracy, equal rights and opportunities for all. It shows that the people of this country recognise and cherish the fact that we should be one nation. We should be using the republican debate to review the fundamental shape of our federation, the division of powers between the various levels of government and the way they are funded. The debate gives us an opportunity to re-evaluate the prickly question of fiscal equalisation, which is currently working very much against the majority of people in this country who happen to live in the south-east of the continent. It is essential that funding is directed to regions of real need, in line with national priorities. We should be examining how best we can organise the public sector to serve our future needs. In particular, we should be exploring the possibility of an enhanced role for local government.

It appears that, once again, there is an attempt to allow the Minister responsible for primary industries in this place to abrogate his responsibilities regarding estimates hearings. I object very strongly to that proposal.

        I think it is totally wrong and unacceptable to allow this motion to be passed. I appeal to the Democrats in general and in particular to Senator Bell, who is not in the chamber at this time. Senator Bell has served on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs along with a number of other senators, and has shown a rational understanding of the situation that exists in rural Australia. I add that Senator Sherry has also served on that committee.

        That is not the point at issue here. The point is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) appointed Senator Cook to carry out that particular function before estimates committees, and it should be Senator Cook who carries out that function, not somebody who is ranked third in order of responsibility for the position. This is a particularly important issue at a time when there is a very serious crisis in the wool industry.

        I make particular reference to an interjection made earlier by Senator Burns. Senator Burns is chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee. When the crisis in the wool industry was mentioned, Senator Burns interjected, `Whose fault was that?'. I say categorically that much of the fault lies clearly with the Labor Government. I make the point that when the reserve price scheme was in place it was approved at every step by the Labor Government. The Government also had its own representatives on the board of the Australian Wool Corporation.

        When the reserve price was in place—initially, I believe, at 870c; it was then lowered to 700c—the Minister at the time, Mr Kerin, made statements that the situation would not change, that it was set in concrete, that it was rock solid. He made those statements in wool-buying countries such as Italy and France, in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. In changing that policy position, which was said to be absolutely set in concrete, he totally undermined the confidence of the trade in purchasing Australian wool. Combined with that, we saw what occurred yesterday with the current account figures that came through: there was another loss to this nation of $2.1 billion. There has been a subsequent fall in the Australian dollar today. Once again, these economic policies are undermining the confidence of overseas buyers purchasing our product.

        These things I mention are not the only ones. The Government cannot abrogate its responsibility and the position it adopted, undermining an industry which last year, despite its problems, put $3.8 billion into the economy and which has one of the highest, if not the highest, employment multiplier effects of any industry in this nation. Much of Australia's infrastructure depends on a viable and healthy wool industry.

        My opposing this motion and not accepting the reasons that are given by the Government is not a reflection on Senator Sherry but a reflection on the fact that the Minister named by the Prime Minister should accept his responsibilities and appear before estimates committees to answer the questions and to give the rationale behind the Government's policy position. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I once again appeal to the Democrats, and particularly Senator Bell, to accept the responsibility of making sure that those who are chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out certain functions in this Parliament do so. In this case it happens to be Senator Cook who is named on the ministerial representation sheet as the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and also as Minister representing the Minister for Resources. There is another very good reason why Senator Cook should appear. It fits very neatly into his responsibilities as Minister for Trade, and this matter should be addressed in terms of the operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. If this motion is carried, it will allow a Minister of the Crown to abrogate his responsibilities as the Minister representing primary industry in this place.

        —I wish to speak on this matter and to oppose what the Government is proposing to do, for the simple reason that this is yet another onslaught against the Senate. There is a well established tradition that Ministers should attend upon estimates committees because the estimates committee process is the mechanism by which the Senate makes the Executive accountable to Parliament. It is as simple as that. Even honourable senators opposite should be able to understand that it is an important mechanism for parliamentary and Executive accountability that Ministers should attend upon estimates committees. Yet here we have a proposal, on just the second day of sitting, that would let Parliamentary Secretaries do the job of Ministers so that Ministers do not have to turn up. That is what it is about: it is about letting Ministers get away with not doing their job.

        I have a few suggestions as to why Senator Cook may not wish to attend a hearing of an estimates committee examining the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I expect the real reason why the Government wishes to shield Senator Cook from the estimates committees in relation to this portfolio flows from the very tough time he had in the last estimates committee. One has in mind all the difficulties that we had with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy—as Senator Calvert and Senator Archer well know—and the implausible stories that the Minister tried to fob onto the committee about all sorts of issues concerning the importation of genetic material from Denmark.

        Senator Cook did not like it because he got a tough time. That is what it is all about. So what does he want to do? He wants to send Senator Sherry in his place to do his job for him. Goodness gracious, Senator Cook did not do so good a job himself, and now the Government wants to send a Parliamentary Secretary instead of the Minister. We believe that the Senate should not and should never be party to an instrument by which the powers, privileges and responsibilities of this Senate are weakened in favour of the executive government. We do not believe that the Senate should have a hand in weakening the practices that we have fought so hard to achieve.

        One of the greatest achievements of the Senate is being able to carefully and adequately scrutinise the operations of the Government and the departments through the estimates committee process. But here we will have a situation in which an errand boy is sent on behalf of the Minister, with no capacity to give undertakings to the estimates committee in the course of the hearings. If a Minister appears before a committee, at least he or she has the capacity to give undertakings that certain things will be done. But here we will receive a Parliamentary Secretary with no capacity to give those undertakings. Certainly the undertakings may be given, but the question is whether they will be adhered to.

        We can have no certainty—and this is no aspersion on Senator Sherry—that an undertaking given by a Parliamentary Secretary will be acted on in the same way that an undertaking given by a Minister will be acted upon. That is also one of the reasons why we have to wonder why the Government wants to replace the Minister with a Parliamentary Secretary. We have to sit here and say, `These Ministers are paid an enormous amount of money to do a job. They actually have a particular responsibility to represent a Minister in another place in the same way that Ministers in the lower house represent Ministers who sit in the Senate. So why should we create a situation in which a Minister who is supposed to represent the Minister for primary industries does not have to do his job?'. The Government has given this Senate not one single answer as to why the Minister should be allowed not to do his job.

Indeed, I congratulate him on his appointment as a Parliamentary Secretary.

In a way, I think that highlights the problem of this proposal; that is, there is an enormous arrogance about the Prime Minister, having won this election—an election the Prime Minister did not expect to win.

Of course, the election on 13 March has conferred much more personal power on him. I believe that this demands that those of us who were also elected on 13 March, as well as senators who were elected in 1990, acknowledge that an extra responsibility has been placed upon us in this Parliament; that is, that we should be extra careful and extra diligent in our scrutiny of the Executive Government.

        I support the argument put by my friend and colleague from Western Australia Senator Crane, who spoke about the wool crisis and the importance of the problems of the primary industries. There are many people, many specialist woolgrowers in particular—pastoralists, people who rely almost entirely on the wool industry for their livelihoods—who are going through enormous trauma at the moment. Their livelihoods, welfare and wellbeing are being affected; they are living under enormous stress. That stress is spreading not only through the rural communities, the small country towns that have been the backbone of Australia as a nation for so many years, but also into the city, as many people who are being forced out of the country move into our urbanised regions. This is increasing unemployment, crime and the general demise of the balance between country and city that Australia has grown up with in the past century.

        A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of specialist woolgrowers in a town called Boyup Brook, south of Perth. They put to me the concept that even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was not respected enough, or did not have enough seniority in the Government, to make statements in relation to the solution of the wool crisis and the problems of primary industry. They thought that the only way certainty could be returned to rural industries, and the wool industry in particular, and indeed to international faith in the wool market, was for the Prime Minister to make a statement in relation to the package for the wool industry. They suggested to me that we should demand a meeting with and a statement by the Prime Minister on this matter.

        Senator Crane quite properly pointed out, if I remember correctly, the problems caused by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, when he made a number of statements at international forums giving reassurances to international wool buyers and the market about the price of Australian wool and the reserve price scheme which were quickly overturned. The point I am seeking to make in perhaps a roundabout way is that we have an industry that is seeking the highest level of reassurance and commitment from this Government—indeed, from the Prime Minister, not even from the Minister. Yet the Senate, which is the only body in this nation that is responsible for scrutinising the activities of the department, the Government and expenditure through the very important estimates process, is being asked to have those questions and that scrutiny dealt with by, with no disrespect, a very junior Parliamentary Secretary.

        I think the Senate, and particularly the Australian Democrats, should give very strong consideration to whether they support this move. It is very clearly a backward step for the Senate in the very important estimates committee process to have to deal with a Parliamentary Secretary. The people of Australia passed their judgment on 13 March 1993. They also returned, in States such as Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, very high Senate votes for coalition senators. I would like to think that that is a reflection of the need people see to ensure that there is a check on the Executive Government and that the Senate has a very strong role to play.

The Government obviously warmly welcomes the decision of the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, to sign on to all parts of the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina on 2 May in Athens. This is a positive first step in achieving a durable solution to the problems in the former Yugoslavia, although I note, of course, that that decision is yet to be ratified by the self-styled assembly of the Bosnian Serbs.

         It is also obviously the case that, in addition to that agreement on paper, we still have to see concrete evidence on the ground in Bosnia that the Bosnian Serbs have abandoned the use of force to achieve their objectives and that they will participate in good faith in the peace process. Certainly, continued attacks by Bosnian Serb forces on towns in eastern Bosnia in the last couple of days show that that evidence is still very sadly lacking. It must also be said that the Serbs are not the only ones intent on using force, as is evidenced by the really quite atrocious and bloody fighting between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims over recent weeks in central Bosnia.

It is unclear, however, that the benefits of such further resolute action, which might include the arming of the Muslims and air strikes, outweigh the costs of that.

         It is the case that more civilians would be put under threat and potentially subject to suffering if the flow of humanitarian assistance were cut off. As such, it is a very real dilemma for the international community as to whether, I repeat, the benefits will outweigh the costs of that further action. It is an issue on which judgments, including our own, are very carefully poised and balanced.

         My final point is simply this: a durable peace is manifestly going to be achieved at the end of the day only through a political and diplomatic solution. We can only all hope that that political and diplomatic solution can be rapidly reached without the kind of further bloodshed that would be necessarily involved were more resolute military action to be taken by the United Nations and the European powers or, of course, if such bloodshed were to be perpetrated by the parties on the ground. There are no easy answers to this question. Any suggestion from Senator Hill or anyone else that there is an easy answer is as misconceived and as ignorant as I am afraid we have been led to expect from that source in the past.

The estimate I have is a wide-ranging one, somewhere between $5 million and $10 million; it is hard to pin it down. That is $5 million or $10 million that would be better off in the pockets of Australian industry and in the pockets of Australian performers so that the Johnny Farnhams, the Jim Barneses, the Dame Joans, the INXSs and the others who are constantly subjected to piracy can get the payments that they ought to get if people purchase their products in the proper way.

         The United States and the European Community have been very strong in applying pressure, and rightly, on the Thai Government and on other governments to prevent video piracy and the hijacking of intellectual property. We were concerned that, in forcing the commitments that Thailand had given to those countries, there would be some greater leniency with respect to, or less enforcement on, Australia and on Australian copyright. I have obtained an undertaking from the Thai Government that that will not be the case, that enforcement will be uniform and across-the-board. That undertaking was given by the Thai Minister himself, who asked me on behalf of any Australians who have their incomes or their rights affected by this sort of piracy to draw to his attention particular examples of that so that enforcement can indeed be as complete as possible.

         Not only with respect to this matter but with respect to a whole range of other matters the Government has been working, in previous terms and now in this term, on dealing with bilateral issues between countries. When I was in Thailand I took up the issue of industrial property. We were close at that time to concluding an agreement to protect patents, trademarks and industrial design. It is my understanding now that in general terms an agreement between Australia and Thailand has been concluded and needs final clearance and that we can shortly expect to have an agreement between Thailand and Australia which resembles that between Australia and Indonesia to protect trademarks, patents and industrial design. This, of course, complements the actions we are taking multilaterally in the Uruguay Round to try to protect all intellectual property.

         I simply repeat what is, in fact, standard procedure which, to the best of my knowledge, has been applied for the whole three years I have been Minister of the portfolio and that is that when a matter of process, particularly, rather than policy, is varied by the department there is an obligation on the department to draw it to the attention of the Minister.

         I want to talk about this this afternoon. I have spent a lot of time carefully considering the central policy question of whether this should be a price-based system or a merit-based system—a beauty contest. There are some very interesting examples of failures in both systems which I hope to expand on later. I spent a lot of time considering that question but, yes, the standard procedure is that where there is any variation—and, in my personal experience, very minor ones—there is a sensible obligation on all departments to draw it to the attention of the Minister and seek his approval for that variation. I have discovered that that has to be flagged specifically because of the realities of the pressure of a Minister's office and the paper flow. That procedure was not followed in this case.

         It remains the case that there still is an expectation by Australian businessmen in some quarters that, when they travel to the ASEAN region, they can arrive one night and depart on the outgoing plane with a pocketful of orders.

         There is also a need for Australians to promote themselves, as we are emerging much more as an exporter of manufactured goods and the providers of sophisticated services, so that we are not seen in the old stereotype of simply being an exporter of mineral commodities and agricultural products. There is a growing recognition that we are seen as a much more sophisticated nation and a clever country. But we do need always to underline that when we travel abroad, particularly in this region of the world.

         Thank God I am not a lawyer and I do not presume to be, but that advice just makes sense to me. Senator Bishop is a lawyer and so is Senator Alston. I am told that the Sydney silk who cross-examined me in the Federal Court is one of the best. I was certainly told he was one of the highest priced and, if price based tendering processes mean anything, that must mean he is one of the best. He cast some aspersions on the deficiencies of Parliament. Maybe it is because we have so many lawyers in our ranks that we are so deficient. I think Senator Bishop, as a lawyer, should have known this, and so should Senator Alston. In the weekend press, Senator Alston—despite his previous position, expounded at length in the pay TV committee, that this should be a pure price based process—said that all these conditions should be put on. But the Attorney-General's Department said, `No, they can't be put on', and I think that advice is right.

         Why was this a matter of concern to the department? I will tell the Senate why, and Senator Alston knows this: this industry litigates like no other, not just in Australia but around the world. The broadcasting industry and the allocation of licences is buried in litigation. In conclusion, I will give one example. The last merit based process—and with the greatest respect, this is one of the big deficiencies of merit based processes of which I am personally aware—was the allocation of the third commercial free to air television licence in Perth. That was a merit based system, a beauty contest. Of necessity, it took over two years to conduct because under natural justice we have to give every applicant the same opportunity to be tested. That process cost the public a fortune.

         Senator Alston may be able to correct me on this because he would be as familiar with this case as I am. To the best of my recollection it provoked at least 15 legal actions and it ended up with a tender being allocated. Who picked up the value of it? The Government?  No, the tenderer. The tenderer got the licence after two years, 15 legal actions and a fortune of public money spent on assessing these things. Senator Alston knows conditions cannot be applied to just one company; they have to be applied to all applicants in advance before we know what their prices are. I do not know how many multimillions Kerry Stokes got for that, but he sold the licence and, of course, the benefit was picked up. That is the problem with merit based processes because they often do not set the correct market price.

         The principal issue on which it was referred to that Senate committee, which I opposed at the time but in hindsight I actually support, was to provide a unique feature of Australian television, which I hope is eventually provided, to make it distinct from all other pay TV services in the world, and that is the involvement of our national broadcaster in providing two channels of predominantly Australian content and, to use that pejorative term, quality television. That was the issue that sent it off to that committee. Despite all the conspiracy theories, all of which were tested during three hours of cross-examination in the Federal Court, the principal reason why I took the decision I did on MDS in January was to preserve the national role of the ABC in a pay television service.

This proposal is one of a series of proposals from companies wishing to conduct a space launch facility in a near-equatorial location. They seek to capitalise on the cost advantages which those locations provide for the launch of geostationary communication satellites.

         This drought assistance has been integrated with the exceptional circumstances support to wool producers which means that $5 million of the $44.6 million of the wool support has been allocated to help drought affected wool producers.

         Including this latest allocation, the Commonwealth has now provided special drought assistance of $27.5 million since September 1992. Drought affected producers may be eligible for interest subsidies of up to 100 per cent on existing and new loans for carry-on, debt restructuring and productivity improvement purposes. For 100 per cent subsidies to be provided, Queensland and New South Wales will be required to match subsidies above 50 per cent on a dollar for dollar basis, which means they will need to contribute $2.6 million. The cap of $30,000 per applicant which applied to the special drought assistance from 1992-93 has been increased—that is, the cap has gone up—to $50,000 for 1993-94 assistance. To be eligible for an interest rate subsidy under the exceptional circumstances provisions, Queensland producers should apply to the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, which administers the RAS scheme in Queensland on behalf of the Commonwealth. Each application is assessed on a case by case basis, taking into account a full assessment of the producer's current and projected financial situation. I think that covers some of Senator Boswell's questions.

        Senator Coulter asked the Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, what he was doing regarding the removal of Barry Carbon from the position of head of the EPA in Western Australia. In the short time I have I wish to put the record straight. The Government of Western Australia is not in any way ridding the EPA of Barry Carbon. His contract expires on 30 June this year and that is when he will be able to apply for a job, if he so wishes, in a new sphere. The WA Government is splitting his job into two. He holds the job of CEO and chairman of the authority. On 1 July the Government of WA is splitting that job into two, which is a very common practice in the authority.

         What the WA Government did cancel, after receiving a legal opinion, was a contract entered into by the previous Minister seven days before an election and six months prior to the date that Barry Carbon's contract was to expire. So it is simply a situation of the new Government of WA splitting the job into two. It is not unloading Barry Carbon. He is free to apply for any of the two jobs if he so wishes. This matter should be left to the State of WA.

         In the lead-up to the election, the very conservative red-necked Western Australian government-in-waiting was using the advice of Dr Tim Meagher, a man well known for very considerable environmental damage in Western Australia. The new Western Australian Government now wants to get rid of Barry Carbon, somebody in whom the conservation movement in Western Australia was not particularly confident when first appointed, but over the years he has proved to be a man of considerable integrity and independence. While one would not agree with every decision which the EPA has made—the Democrats are on record as opposing the decision of the EPA to support the petrochemical plant, for example—nonetheless, in the main Barry Carbon has shown considerable independence and is an excellent person to fulfil that role.

That is the proper function of a comprehensive Federal Government. The question specifically mentioned things such as air quality and water quality standards.

         It was made quite clear prior to the last election that, as far as the running of the EPA in Western Australia was concerned, the position of chief executive officer and chairman would be split. There is no doubt about that. As I understand it, that proposal was also considered by the previous Labor Government. This situation is the result of the enormous amount of conflict in Western Australia between the EPA, conservation and land management, industry and a number of other organisations, including conservation groups in Western Australia. That is well and truly on the public record. So when Senator Coulter comes in here and makes these claims about Western Australia, I have to say that he is way off the beam.

         I want to make another point about this matter. Senator Coulter referred to environmental destruction. Firstly, the record of the EPA in some areas of Western Australia is very good. In other areas it is not so good. CALM is in the same category. However, it became patently obvious to anybody who was sitting back looking at what has been happening, particularly in the last 12 or 18 months, that it was necessary to reassess both the position that the EPA was adopting and EPA's administration.

There was a clear policy position prior to the election as far as the incumbent government of Western Australia was concerned. We should now allow the restructured Environment Protection Authority in Western Australia to get on with the job of achieving a balance between environmental requirements and sustainable development in Western Australia in order to help overcome some of the serious problems that exist as a result of unemployment, not only in Western Australia but in Australia as a whole.

In other words, `Don't dare ask me to intervene in any shape or form, because if I did that I would be accused of favouring my mates, and that is the last thing I want to do'. One does not have to be a complete idiot to understand that the terms and conditions of the administrative arrangements can be defined without in any shape or form favouring any of the participants. If the Jack Waterford principle has any relevance, it is simply that Ministers should not intervene in tenders and do so at their peril if they want to advantage one or more of the parties.

He used to be a jockey; I suppose there were weighty reasons why he gave that game away. I assure him that he is a real lightweight when it comes to media law. He clearly does not understand the difference between being involved in every little detail and accepting responsibility for what others do in his department.

         What that section states is a very hallowed principle. `The Minister is to determine' means that the Minister is fixed with ultimate responsibility. It does not go on and spell out, chapter and verse, how to do these things; it simply leaves it to the discretion of the Minister, taking advice from the department and any outside experts that he chooses to rely on. But if he adopts the approach of closing his eyes and saying, `Today is the 19th of January and I've got much better things to do in the Northern Territory. I'm the State President of the ALP; I've got a lot of mobile polling booths to run around. All I'll do is sign a document put in front of me. I'll do it on a wing and a prayer, hoping that if there is anything of any significance the department will bring it to my attention'. That is not the basis on which the Minister is paid a very good salary. He is paid to exercise some individual judgment.

It follows from that that we expect them to exercise judgment and discretion.

One normally reads them to see what is going on. If the Minister chooses not to want to know what is going on, it is perfectly consistent with the approach he took in signing the determination—and sign it he did because he was required by law to sign it. In signing that document, he was spelling out the parameters of the administrative arrangements to be put in place.

         As Senator Bishop pointed out to me a moment ago, Minister Collins signed under section 93. Section 92 of the Act actually applied to MDS licences and it has no more or less ambit than section 93—it says `may' instead of `must'. Section 92A(1) states, `The Minister may determine . . . a price-based allocation system'. That means that it is up to the Minister to work out how to do it, and that is what he did. He took advice—if one could call it advice—and he asked his department to provide him with a form of determination, to which he put his name. One should not have a glass of beer in one hand and a blindfold in the other and say, `Where do I sign?'. One should actually read the document.

         Senator Collins is not the new boy; he has been around for a while. He ought to remember the FM radio licence fiasco when Bond Media bid $23 million, fell over, forfeited about $100 and the next in line had to pay only $10 million to get the licence. That was an absolute farce. In the 1980s we were a laughing-stock because of that sort of behaviour. We chose, quite rightly, not to go for beauty contests, for all the reasons Senator Collins mentioned. We went for price-based allocation systems, but we did it on particular terms. As the Minister well knows, and as he should have known because he was the presiding Minister, we did it in relation to the third mobile telephone licence and also we did it in MDS. If there is one thing Senator Collins should have learnt in his term as Minister for Communications, it is that a price-based allocation system on previous occasions has involved the payment of a substantial up-front deposit. So there can be no argument that it is within the power of the Minister, the department, or both, to prescribe just that.

         Do not let us have any nonsense that somehow, because this is a price-based system, the Minister is not entitled to attach any terms and conditions. There are eight pages here, all spelling out the way in which it is to be done. One of the obvious terms and conditions was precisely that it not favour any of the parties. Indeed, why does the Minister at this stage, half way through the game, want to change the rules  and to introduce an amendment which would now require the successive bidders, if the first lot fall over, to come up with 5 per cent? He is doing that because he concedes that it is perfectly proper to do it. In other words, it should have been done in the first instance. Why was it not done in the first instance? It was not done because someone else is to blame.

In other words, he is asking them to sign their own death warrant. That again, I would have thought, is so manifestly unfair that it is unconscionable. Again, the Minister is trying to deflect attention from his statutory obligations. He is the one required to spell out the ambit and the parameters. He is the one who manifestly has failed to do so.

The obvious precondition was to pay the 5 per cent. He could also have required the companies to be incorporated for at least three months, which would have taken one of these players out of the game immediately. He could have required that people did not have criminal convictions. He could have required that the people involved in those companies had at least filed an annual return.

We have eight pages telling us how it ought to be done; one of those points is that one has to put $500 on the table. If one could put $500 on the table then one could put $5 million or even five per cent, as the Government's amendment clearly concedes could have happened.

Senator Alston has invited me to give the Senate my view on the subject and I will. I have moved a few censure motions in my time, and I have called for enough resignations during my 10 years in opposition to find this a very familiar debate. The problem is that Senator Alston's speech does not address the political context on which this entire process was based. I have not forgotten it.

         I have a very great regard for this Parliament, for any Parliament, and for ministerial responsibility. The Senate cannot possibly make a harder judgment on me than I continually make on myself in that regard. In my view it involves three elements: first, a Minister behaving with propriety and, second, a Minister behaving responsibly in every sense of that word. Those two issues cover matters such as deliberately misleading a House. In my view, when a Minister fails in those two elements it is a hanging offence.

          The charge that has been laid against me today is based on competence. I have been accused by Senator Alston—he has laid it out today by going round and round on the same subject 50 times—that I was not exercising due diligence by sitting down like a corporate lawyer and second-guessing the department. Of course, I could not have done it unless I had had the intention of making some changes. I will put the question of propriety and responsibility on the charge because, while Senator Alston has only accused me of negligence, other people have accused me of plenty more, to the extent of formally doing so in the Federal Court. That charge is still sitting there awaiting a determination.

         There were three avenues to that court case. The first two related to the narrow legal question of whether the determination that I issued in January was lawful. It will be an interesting test. I received advice from the department that it was lawful. Subsequently that advice was confirmed by the Attorney-General's Department, with the concurrence of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Mr Rose, that it was lawful. But, as Senator Alston knows better than I do, the Federal Court will finally determine that matter.

         Senator Alston should have a look at the third avenue which is in the applicant's submissions. I might add that the matter was a very public process in that the courtroom was full of press, and the transcripts of proceedings are publicly available. This third avenue went to the most serious charge that can be laid against a Minister in relation to any matter, and that is abuse of public office—misfeasance. All the horrendous allegations—that the Prime Minister did this and he ordered me to do that—were baseless. Senator Alston knows that this was the political context in which this process was going ahead. Those allegations are all garbage.

         Despite making all those allegations in writing to the Federal Court, I was not called to give evidence. I did not have to give evidence. Counsel acting for me said, `Look, if there is no requirement for you to appear in the court, it is a matter for you entirely. We're perfectly happy to go to the court, but on the written evidence there are no grounds for making these charges. It is a matter for your decision as to whether you go'. I have a very simple view of the Australian judicial system, and I still hope that I will die holding the view. My view is that if one knows that the charge is false and one goes to court and tells the truth, one will have nothing to fear from an Australian court.

         On the question of negligence, Senator Alston asks, `Why did I not just shove $5 million onto it; that would not have made any difference?'. That is not how it would have been judged in here or anywhere else. I immediately would have been asked, `Why, of your own volition, did you want to second-guess this department, which during your time as Minister has had an impeccable record'—and it has—`of letting major broadcasting tenders for radio, television and telecommunications?'. We have just banked the $70 million from the third mobile licence. Senator Alston is enough of a politician to know that that is true. I had absolutely no reason to believe in a real sense that the department would not carry out the mechanics of this process in the same competent way that it has carried out the mechanics of major tenders since I have been a Minister.

The honourable senator knows that it is not a procedure that operates just in my office; it operates in any Minister's office, and I have checked it. As one Minister said to me, unless it is specifically flagged that the department is going to vary previous procedure in terms of process, of course a Minister does not assume that it is. The procedure is quite simple and I am very familiar with it.

Although it was two months before the election, I actually was not running around mobile polls, Senator Alston. Almost all of my ministerial staff were on leave because—and I think most other Ministers would probably have this arrangement—January is the only time of the year that they can get a break. I am glad that Senator Alston at least agrees with that. Last year was a pretty hard year—not that that is an element of this at all. I am simply describing exactly what happened. I knew what had previously happened. I knew that the department's communication selection team had been working on this. I knew that internal advice had been flowing backwards and forwards between the Attorney-General's Department, checking out the validity of the process.

Of course, that is absolute nonsense. I saw the $500, as Senator Alston knows perfectly well, because I briefed him on it. I assumed it was nothing else—and it is—but a lodgment fee. Can I just say this now: there was no deposit. That was the decision that was taken. There was no deposit asked for. And it is breathtaking. It was simply a paper shuffling charge.

As I said earlier today in Question Time, this is not a very pleasant process for anybody, but I would rather be in here copping flack for not intervening in the department's processes—as far as I am concerned, I can do that with conviction—than trying to defend what I would have thought in terms of real ministerial responsibility was indefensible. Had I taken the decision to interfere in the administration, the mechanics, of a tender process, where I had not done so in respect of any other tender lodged in the department, do not tell me what would have been said in the press. I know perfectly well.

Where there is substantial change—and how substantial could one get than this—is the department required to specifically seek approval for that variation in process? I have since discovered—and I did not know it until this happened—that there is a requirement in fact to do that within the department and to flag such advice to the secretary. I do not know whether that happened and, of course, the investigation will find that out.

Tony Staley received written advice from the Attorney-General's Department that the ABT was acting unlawfully. He ignored that advice. The matter went all the way to the High Court, which ruled in favour of the applicants, ruling that it was acting illegally. Tony Staley was censured in the Parliament for ignoring specific advice telling him it was wrong and he was called on to resign. Did he resign? No, he did not resign.

        That is the way it still looks. The tender disaster is just the last in a very long line of disasters that we call pay TV in Australia. As far as we can see, there are three basic reasons for this. The first is that the Minister has taken far too much advice from an immensely deregulatory and `dry' department, his own Department of Transport and Communications. Secondly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as I said, has intervened in the most Machiavellian manner with what seems to be almost no background knowledge. I hope somebody can correct me on that, but I think I am right. The third—and the most important—reason for this is that pay TV in Australia is based on section 8 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, legislation which is appallingly flawed and which passed this Parliament only because it was voted for by the Government and the Opposition.

         Let us get back to basics on pay TV. What are the most basic and glaring flaws in the legislation, things that still have to be fixed up right now? Firstly, the role of the ABC has to be looked at. The ABC is mandated under satellite; it is not mandated anywhere else. If we want Australian content in news, current affairs, children's entertainment and light entertainment, we want the ABC in there right from the beginning, no matter what pay TV system starts up.

         Secondly, cross-media ownership needs to be looked at. We still believe—I know I have said it about a thousand times in here; I will continue to say it—there is far too much power in the hands of far too few people in Australia in terms of the Australian media. We do not want to see too much foreign ownership. At the moment, foreign ownership is not spelt out in the legislation. What is spelt out in the legislation is that the cross-media rules will apply only to the satellite. Even in the satellite legislation, the cross-media rules are appallingly inadequate. As far as all other terms of delivery of pay TV are concerned, there is nothing in the legislation and there should be. We would like to see foreign ownership rules in the legislation, with the level of foreign ownership being under 35 per cent.

         Local content may be the most important part of the legislation. The legislation imposes a 10 per cent Australian program content level despite what all of the witnesses said to the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. Every one of the witnesses, including potential bidders, said that they thought 15 per cent or more was appropriate. The Minister stated in his second reading speech that setting the level higher than 10 per cent would be an unnecessary financial burden on those people. We still do not believe that.

         I moved an amendment to the Bill to put the level of local content up to 20 per cent initially. I received no support. The level is still at 10 per cent and only for drama. I wanted it to go across the board—not just for drama but for news, current affairs, light entertainment and children's programs. We did not get support on that either. Another of the amendments which I moved would have allowed the ABA, after five years, to look at what whether the local program content should be increased by five per cent or more. Of course, I got no support on that either. All witnesses before the Senate inquiry suggested higher levels of independent Australian production were not only attainable but highly desirable. Not one of the potential bidders expressed the view that higher levels would amount to an unnecessary financial impost.

It should be in there.

I can warn the department now that there are terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry into this matter, and if it does not have an adequate investigation something will go ahead and it will have to answer to somebody.

Had our position been adopted, our national interests would have been better served, and the bad eggs would have been tossed out of the tender basket from the beginning. The Democrats believe that there are much bigger issues to contend with than this one. We still want a merit-based tender system which places some premium on Australian drama and industry content. We still want non-satellite pay TV systems to be subject to the same ground rules as is the satellite system. Most of all, we want a competitive system which protects and advances our cultural and economic interests.

The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in his response to Senator Alston, seemed to have a twofold defence. The first was that he was frightened to death, therefore did not want to know anything about it, and that if he did not think about it he felt it might all go away. Secondly, he had in his head some quaint notion of the ramifications of what is meant by a price-based allocation system.

         Let us get it right. Section 93(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act required that the Minister `shall' determine in writing a price-based allocation system. In the judgment of the case of Kerry Stokes concerning the MDS licences there is a section dealing with the history of this case which says that a determination was also required to be made by the Minister under section 92A of the Act, which Senator Alston referred to earlier. It also shows that prior to the power being confirmed on 5 October 1992, the Minister had in another document on 1 October 1992 determined that a tender-based allocation system would be applied for the granting of licences. Subsequently that was revoked and the system to be used for allocating those licences was to involve, in the words of the Government

         The point that I am making is very straightforward and simple. The provisions of section 92A and section 93(1) are very similar and differ only in the use of the words `may' and `shall'. For the information of Senator Collins, I inform him that when an Act says `the Minister shall', that is precisely what it means—the Minister has no option. If it says `the Minister may', it means he has a discretion.

        Just so that we get that straight, in exercising the discretion given to him under section 92A, the Minister chose to have a provision that the tender shall be accompanied by a deposit of five per cent of the amount of the bid. In the tender document, which is pursuant to section 93(1)—which is not a discretion, and where it says the Minister `shall' make a determination—the requirement in the document is that there shall be a non-refundable application fee of $500.

         The questions that come readily to mind and which the Minister needs to answer are as follows. On what date did the Minister first discuss the determination that he was to make pursuant to section 93(1) with his department? When did he establish what the precedents for licence tenders were? When did he ascertain what the fundamentals of the invitation to tender were? When did he become aware of the fact that the tender was to differ from precedent? Did he seek advice from his department as to why he was not following precedent—and if not, why not? If he did not acquaint himself with any of those facts, why not?

         In his defence today, the Minister said that one reason he wished to have a hands-off approach to this whole question was very simply that he knew how controversial the matter was—that he was aware of all the material that was being written and he was aware that it was a matter that would attract a lot of comment both in the press and in the chamber. He said that had it been shown by freedom of information action that he had made a telephone call or queries about the manner in which this tender was to be conducted, he would have been castigated in this chamber.

         The truth of the matter is that being frightened of being asked questions in this chamber is no reason to abrogate his responsibility. If the Minister is required by law to make a determination, he must do it in an informed way. The Minister's further defence that he has so many pieces of paper coming across his desk that he does not know what he is signing does not stand up, even if that is a defence in ordinary practice, because he has already said that he was aware of the fact that this was a highly contentious matter. Therefore, anything to do with this matter must have been something that he would have looked at with care and responsibility. If Senator Collins did not do that, I am afraid that he is culpable, and the penalty for that has to be paid.

         The history of the whole business of pay TV has been the subject of political whim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Minister made comments—which Senator Bourne put on the record—which indicated that he was quite aware it was subject to the political whim of the Prime Minister; that he was required to act in this area in ways in which he would not otherwise have acted. But when it finally came to this matter of being required by law, by the Act, to make a determination, the only response he has given here is, firstly, that he was frightened of criticism and, secondly, that he either did not properly ask the advice of his department or he sought advice and did not pay regard to it.

There is an Australian expression which perhaps best puts these matters in context: the more things change, the more they stay the same.

         I thought one of the lessons of 13 March would have meant that we would see a change in strategy and tactics when the coalition resumed its appropriate place in opposition in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. But again we see a proposition that lacks an objective, specifics, detail, clarity or any sense of purpose and which can be read only as ambiguous. I believe that the former national secretary of the ALP, Bob Hogg, was right the other week when he said that there is no natural party of government in Australia. But what has become very clear is that there are natural parties of opposition, and they sit on the other side of the chamber.

         Look at the politics of Australia over the last few years in respect of broadcasting and the media. The Opposition has continually been convinced that conspiracies exist between the Government, the Labor Party, the bureaucracy, the media and some sections of business. We have seen trotted out time and time again in the Parliament and in some sympathetic publications the line that a vast conspiracy exists, particularly in respect of television but to a lesser extent in respect of other forms of broadcast media and print; and that decisions are made at the whim of a select few—a handful of media barons.

She made one point in particular with respect to the legislation which governs broadcast media in this area. Senator Bourne argued that the legislation is flawed. There is no doubt about that in my mind. There is no doubt about that in the minds of a number of people in the Government. But anyone who was present on the evening that this legislation was being debated, when these matters were canvassed by the Senate, could tell people with absolute authority why the legislation is so flawed in certain respects.

There is no question in my mind that we can improve upon that. It is an absolute disgrace that the Opposition could not even put forward a coherent and consistent policy.

Time and again that occurred. During the Fraser years, there were changes that were deliberately and blatantly designed to favour one group of people over another group.

This, at base, is what the Opposition is arguing. But on the last occasion when a degree of ministerial discretion was exercised—not intervention in my view but ministerial discretion—on the issue of microwave multipoint delivery systems, MDS, when the Government took decisions, in my view, in the public interest, what was the response of the Opposition?

It would no longer have been a price based system. If we look at the five hurdles that were proposed in terms of ownership, capability, Australian content and industry development, and if we look at other conditions that may have been applied as well, we see the price based system would have been changed beyond recognition. It could not have been termed that in any way, shape or form.

The normal situation was changed by this Minister who, Senator Loosley says, did not read the document that changed it.

         For Senator Loosley to pretend that somehow the price based tender system would have been changed beyond recognition by adopting the normal procedures that had been adopted in all previous price based tender systems requiring a substantial and reasonable deposit—to pretend that changing the normal situation was the only way to have a genuine price based tender—is absolute and arrant nonsense. I am surprised that Senator Loosley would get up and damage his own status as a man of reasoned argument in putting such absolute nonsense to this chamber.

         What we have to do is look at the facts, which I notice Senator Loosley very carefully avoided or, when he did come near a fact, treated extremely loosely.

         What were the facts of the mess, and what were the motives behind those people who participated in the mess?  Was it a conspiracy? Senator Loosley seems to suggest that we were regarding it as some kind of continuation of conspiracy theory. Or was it simply a muck-up? A conspiracy or a muck-up? I must concede that seeing the way this Government has administered this nation for the last 10 years, it is more likely to have been a muck-up, because that is the traditional way so much legislation has been dealt with in this place; it has ended up as muck-ups.

This tender system was mucked up because this Minister changed by an act of commission the normal processes.

         I am appalled to note that the Minister is not in the chamber to listen to this debate on his maladministration. What I want to know is whether the Minister was aware of the fact that his department was advised long before tenders closed that the tender system that the Minister had approved was going to attract a series of collapsing bids from phoney, shonky applicants. In other words, the department knew the chaotic result we have now got before tenders closed. I know that because I know who told it, and I know it was well before the closing of tenders.

If they did tell the Minister and if the Minister failed to act, he is culpable.

It is only after the tenders close that one ends up with real problems. I ask the Minister, in his absence from this debate about himself: did the department tell him of this advice, warning that the process was certain to turn into the farce that has now damaged Australia's status internationally and made us a laughing stock in this area?

         What also intrigues me is to see the way Senator Collins's initial response was like Senator Loosley's—to try to blame the Senate for this procedure.

Why did the department proceed to an inevitable disaster, knowing one was on the way from the sort of collapsing bids from the shonky group which has won this tender, for example? If the Minister did know that this inevitable disaster would take place, one has to wonder what were the objectives. Why was it allowed to continue? Was it a deliberate attempt to destroy the price tender system, in favour of mates, to avoid the sort of protest that would have emerged had the thing gone forward immediately, to the benefit of particular mates? There would obviously have been an immense outcry and, no doubt, political flack.

I think it takes 30 days for them to provide the money and up to 45 days for their bona fides, in terms of multiple interests and so on, to be examined by the Trade Practices Commission.

         What I certainly want to know is: did Senator Collins query the $500 fee introduced by his department in that process in January? Did he ask whether there were any changes from the normal procedures? Surely that is the duty of a Minister, and it is not just the duty of the department to tell him whether there are any changes. Surely any Minister with any recognition of his obligations would ask: are there any changes from normal procedure involved in this vitally important multimillion dollar matter? Apparently the Minister made no such query or request. We did not hear of one today. Why not? Surely not asking is a sin of omission, whereas the sin of commission involves changing the system.

No wonder his terrorised Minister, having already been made a fool of by Mr Keating in this matter, was not prepared to stick his neck out again. Naturally he did not want to change a comma or a full stop, but that had nothing to do with the reason he presented today; it had an awful lot to do with the intervention of his Prime Minister in this area, terrorising this Minister who had been made to look foolish in that way.

         There may be many other reasons why this extraordinary situation took place. It may be that the department decided not to tell the Minister of its knowledge that the tender system was going to be a mess because maybe it wanted to destroy the satellite system concept. There are all sorts of allegations that the department has a level of hostility towards some of the major media players. There is no doubt that as a result of this delay a lot of the major players are looking at other systems of delivery because the satellite system, which requires digital technology, does present particular difficulties—there simply are not enough receivers for digital technology—whereas MDS can proceed straight away.

        If there is a fiasco—if there is some sort of sham, some sort of spurious theatre—it has been demonstrated this afternoon in even bringing this debate to this chamber in the timing which we have seen demonstrated today.

Basically, if this Minister is to be held responsible, it means that he has to answer to this Senate chamber.

         When was his first opportunity to demonstrate his responsibility to the chamber? Of course, it was after the convening of this Parliament, the drawing together of honourable senators after the general election. The first real opportunity was during Question Time this afternoon. But the Opposition lodged this matter of public importance, crying for the Minister to act responsibly—which can only mean to this Parliament—with your office, Mr President, at 8.30 this morning, 5 1/2 hours before Question Time.

That was where the ministerial responsibility of Senator Collins was well and amply demonstrated at the first real opportunity. But the Opposition had predetermined and decided—probably last night, but by lodging with your office at 8.30 this morning, Mr President—that it would claim that the Minister had not exercised or demonstrated ministerial responsibility, and it brought forward this matter of public importance.

         What is all this hullabaloo about? Two unknown groups have been given an opportunity to take on the vested media interests in this country, provide pay satellite television and to provide that sort of service to Australians if they wish to take up the possibility of enjoying television. They have only been given an opportunity. This has to be emphasised. No licences have been given to these two groups—`shonky groups' as they were called by Senator Michael Baume, who immediately preceded me in this debate. Senator Baume has already made a judgment about the two groups when they have jumped only one hurdle.

In the meantime, it is true that these two newcomers have been given their opportunity, but they are still just candidates for a licence. They have got their opportunity possibly because they have been able to make an application by lodging with it a small deposit, $500, rather than, say, 5 per cent of the tender amount—or $5 million, as Senator Alston suggested was appropriate.

In fact, I believe it can be shown that at neither departmental nor ministerial level has there been a skerrick of evidence of any corruption in the way that this has been set up.

         Having been given every assurance when he was dealing with this matter from Darwin that the Attorney-General's Department was of the view that this particular tender process and this documentation faxed to him was in accordance with the law, the Minister decided that in good conscience he could sign that determination about the way in which the tender process would go ahead. I believe he was doing so in a way which acknowledged not merely that this document was legally correct, but the matter was much broader than that. It was being said to him that this particular process and the documentation were in accordance with the policy set down by the Parliament. It is lawful because it is within the parameters set down by the Parliament. It is not merely legally technically correct, it is lawful because the Minister was being asked to sign a matter that was in total conformity with what the Parliament intended when it passed the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992.

         This is only my personal opinion, but I would go even further and say that I regard the requirement of a $5 million deposit as taking the tendering process beyond what Parliament intended. Parliament intended that players in the market could put in an application and we would then see what value the market attached to these licences. To narrow the field and say that the only players in the marketplace who could put in a tender were those who could afford $5 million non-refundable deposit would, I think, go against the policy intention of the Parliament, which was to allow as many applicants as possible the opportunity to put in a tender. Then processes relating to the Trade Practices Commission and Australian Broadcasting Authority matters, along with the actual finding of the money, would follow. But I believe that to have a non-refundable deposit as a precondition would raise very serious questions as to whether that document would be in accordance with the will of the Parliament, which clearly was looking for price-based applications at this first hurdle stage.

         —Our concern with this matter really relates to a discussion held earlier today. As I understand it, we limited the number of estimates committees in the Senate to six principally because that approximately reflected the number of Ministers that the Government had in this place; it was therefore sensible that that be the number of committees that would consider the estimates.

         However, now we have the situation where the Government has increased its number of Ministers to 10; on the other hand, it has set only a very short period—in fact one day, as I understand it—for the estimates committees to meet to consider what is obviously going to be quite a considerable volume of work. It therefore seems to us to be sensible, in view of the fact that the Government now has many more Ministers, to further divide the departments so that they can be better dealt with in the very limited time that the Government is providing to us for that task.

         The issue that I therefore raise and the question I guess I am really putting to the Minister who is now the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner) is: why is the Government simply limiting itself to six estimate committees when, if its Ministers were going to do their jobs in relation to the estimates, there is no reason why we cannot have eight or even 10 committees meeting and, therefore, more thoroughly do the job that we are to do if we are to responsibly carry out our function in this place? It is really as simple as that.

         We want to thoroughly meet our responsibility—that is, to review the appropriations through this estimates procedure; we want the system to work as effectively as is possible; and it seems now that, as the Government has provided 10 Ministers in the Senate, it could be done more appropriately by an increased number of committees. We are therefore puzzled as to why the Government is simply seeking to limit the number of committees to six again. If the reason the Government gives is that that was the practice in the past, what I have attempted to demonstrate is that it was based on a premise that no longer applies because there are now more Ministers.

         I invite somebody to respond. I do not want Senator Faulkner to close the debate. He might respond by leave as to why the Government is unwilling to provide more than six committees. If this is something that the Government has not thought about, could it now do so and perhaps recognise that such a reform would be beneficial to the effective functioning of this place. My colleague Senator Crichton-Browne might have some ideas as to how the departments could be further divided so that the estimates procedure in this place could function better. An expression of the Government's attitude to such a reform at this time might facilitate the debate.

        I thank Senator Hill for granting me leave to move the amendment. I hope that this will facilitate the passage of the motion. Senator Hill raised the general issue of the process of the estimates committees. Obviously this is an important matter. Tomorrow morning we will be talking about further reforms to estimates committee procedures in terms of the Committee of the Whole and streamlining estimates committee procedures. I do not want to canvass that issue now.

         I would point out that the Government is proposing a package of reforms in this area which I believe will improve the processes of this chamber and make for a more reasonable period of sitting time. The routine of business will not be under such a strain; honourable senators will not be under such a strain; and there will be a far more reasonable and sensible modus operandi for the Senate chamber.

         Senator Hill needs to accept that there has been a very great imbalance in the sitting times of estimates committees. This is shown in the public hearings and also, to some extent—although I do not consider this a major issue—in the private meetings associated with those hearings. I have taken out some figures for the 1992 Budget sittings which—and the Opposition should seriously consider them—strongly support the case for reform. The figures for the estimates committee hearings and meetings are as follows: Estimates Committee A sat for 20 hours 39 minutes. Estimates Committee B sat for 65 hours. This might have been due not so much to the allocation of departments as to the membership of the committee. The other figures are: Estimates Committee C sat for 29 hours 40 minutes; Estimates Committee D for 14 hours 49 minutes—

         I believe that any fair-minded person looking at those figures would have to say that there is a clear imbalance in the time taken by estimates committees to examine departments. There is clearly a need for the Government and this chamber to address that imbalance. What the Government has proposed in the motion is an attempt to see that the workload of the estimates committees is evened out so that there is a fair workload across six committees.

         That is not easy to do, given the nature of ministerial responsibilities. Obviously, if at all possible we do not want to split ministerial responsibilities across estimates committees. With one exception, that has been achieved in this proposal.

         I suppose in any motion like this there is always a little bit of crystal ball gazing. We cannot be absolutely certain, nor would anyone expect, that we will get a precise amount of equivalent time between the committees. I do not think that will happen. But I am absolutely certain that if we adopt the proposal that has been outlined today we will see a much fairer allocation of time. The situation could not be much worse than having Estimates Committee B meet for 65 hours and Estimates Committee D meet for 14 hours 49 minutes. It would not be difficult to find a better and fairer allocation of time.

This is all very interesting but, as I understand it, Senator Faulkner is speaking by leave specifically to answer some questions that Senator Hill raised with him. As I recall, they specifically concern the question of why there are not 10 estimates committees instead of the six that are being proposed. Senator Hill and the rest of us would be interested to hear the answer to that.

As mentioned in the proposed program of hearings of estimates committees, there is an opportunity for every single senator in this chamber—as we have always had—to follow through his or her interests.

The answer to the Senate's difficulties is not to increase the number of Senate estimates committees that we have. The answer to the problems that we face in this chamber is to see the Senate committee system and the Senate estimates committees work far more effectively than they are at the moment.

         It is no great secret that because of the Government's diminishing numbers—and three-quarters of Senator Faulkner's colleagues have been given some higher promotion—it does not have the numbers to service the committees. That is why those opposite wanted to reduce the number of members serving on standing committees from eight to six. The only thing that  stopped that was that the Democrats also wanted a spot on the committees and, when it became obvious to the Government that they could have that only at the expense of the Government, the number then went back to eight.

         This has nothing to do with scrutiny of government, scrutiny of the Parliament, or scrutiny of government expenditure. It is all about the Labor Party's fun sport and that is numbers. The Labor Party is not concerned about proper scrutiny of the Parliament, of expenditure or of legislation.

         —One has to come into the chamber and see who sits on the front bench to find out. If we look at Estimates Committee A, it seems that both Senator Evans and Senator Cook have responsibilities. If we look at Estimates Committee B, it appears that Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner both have responsibilities. If we look at Estimates Committee C, it seems that Senator Richardson and Senator  Crowley both have responsibilities. Estimates Committee D, E and F are covered by Senator McMullan, Senator Collins and Senator Schacht, and Senator Bolkus has Estimates Committee F. In other words, we have two Ministers for three of the estimates committees. We were told this morning that we were going to have a Secretary, a new little boy is going to come along representing a Minister at one of the estimates committees and that the Minister will not be available at all.

         There is no reason why we cannot extend the number of estimates committees to eight. I say to Senator Faulkner that I do not know whether the reallocation of portfolios under the various committees makes a lot of sense. Frankly, that is the least of my concerns. My concern is to make sure we have a Minister before each committee and that we have before us the bureaucrats. We need the correct number of estimates committees so there can be proper, responsible and diligent scrutiny of the conduct of the Government and expenditure of taxpayers' funds.

         I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to Senator Faulkner's motion which will increase the number of estimates committees from six to eight. I have not argued for 10, although there is a very persuasive argument for that. The Democrats have always quite properly argued that the Senate is a proper forum for proper scrutiny. I commend the Democrats for the number of occasions on which they have called for pieces of legislation and matters of importance to be referred to select committees. I implore the Democrats to embrace the proposal I am putting forward by way of my amendment. I understand the estimates committees are sitting for only one day.

I am not going to go as far as to suggest that members of the Opposition are being deliberately obtuse about this matter; I suspect that their memory has lapsed. Let me remind everyone that one of the reasons why there have been six estimates committees for 20 years is that there was a general agreement a long time ago—and that agreement has continued—that the appropriate number of committees to be meeting at any one time was three. One of the reasons for that was that that was the appropriate number that

         </emphasis>

We had Senator Bishop going right off her tree about how disgraceful it was that one of the estimates committees was not being televised. If there were to be eight estimates committees, presumably we would be talking about having four meeting at any one time. That, therefore, would put extra pressure on

         As far as the servicing of committees by senators from either side is concerned, the Opposition has quite successfully managed to have different people attending one estimates committee at different times depending on the portfolio being considered. The allocation of portfolios to estimates committees is, as Senator Faulkner has said, purely a matter of balancing the amount of time that ought to be needed for them all to be through at about the same time.

         The Opposition's need to have different shadow spokespersons attending and different interests reflected because of the mixture of portfolios that are looked after by different Ministers has been perfectly adequately catered for by the way in which it has had different membership for different portfolios within the same committee.

         The main point about the six committees is that only three can sit at any one time for those servicing reasons that I have mentioned, and also for the interests of senators who want to participate in them, especially Opposition senators. People have complained that it is difficult enough for people who want to deal with one particular matter at one committee and also attend another one when there are three sitting at the one time. If four were sitting at the one time those complaints about the difficulty of programming to satisfy a variety of interests would be even greater.

         One can go to the other extreme and say, `Let's have 19 estimates committees and call them A to P', or whatever it turns out to be, `and have one per portfolio'. That would be perfectly okay as long as we ended up with an agreement that there would be some limited amount of time for each one. It is purely a mechanical means of ensuring that everyone knows when a particular committee is meeting and that excessive duplication of facilities is not required. Six has always been, and I am sure will continue to be, the appropriate number, because three is the appropriate number for committees to be meeting at once.

The debate touches on a wider issue which is particularly important to the Parliament, to this Senate and to the public at large. A range of proposals have been put forward by the coalition to make some substantial reforms in the procedures of this Parliament. Essentially, each of the reforms which we put forward, including the reforms that Senator Crichton-Browne has put forward, encourage more scrutiny of government actions and legislation. Each of those measures—there are probably four or five measures relating to Question Time, Chairs of committees, estimates committees and so forth—have as their essence the need to improve the performance of this Parliament and, among other things, to subject government actions to greater scrutiny.

         I agree with the Opposition to the extent that we certainly underline the very great importance of scrutiny of government. We believe, perhaps even more vehemently than the Opposition, that too much power has come to reside with executive government and that decisions are made extremely narrowly. In the recent election, we saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) exclusively make decisions which even his own party did not know about until they were announced to the public. We have seen the Prime Minister make decisions on the run by way of press release. Again, members of his own Government—his own Ministers—did not know exactly what that decision was until they read about it in the paper or heard about it on the radio. That way of running the country is extremely objectionable.

         Having said all that, we observe that no section of the portfolios will be excluded. Irrespective of whether we have six or eight committees, all the portfolios will come up for scrutiny. Presumably the Opposition, in considering how it will deal with questions to Ministers and senior public servants in these estimates committees, will have the opportunity to examine each of these people and each of the issues. The number, variety and nature of the questions and so on that they will ask will not be in any way limited by the existence of six or eight committees.

         In times of significant economic stringency and when both the Government and the Opposition are talking about decreasing staff and making everybody's work more efficient and more effective, it seems passing strange that in this particular case the Opposition wants to increase the number of committees from six to eight. I do not think the question of proper scrutiny was raised, because all these matters, all these portfolios, all these Ministers and all these staff and so on will be brought before the committee and it is well within the capability of any senator to ask questions within the existing six estimates committees. For those reasons, the Democrats will be opposing the amendment and supporting the motion.

         That is not going to prevent me from trying once more to convince the chamber of the correctness of Senator Crichton-Browne's amendment to the motion. The Opposition gave Senator Faulkner leave to explain to us why there should not be 10 or eight estimates committees. We got a very long discourse on the fact that, because some people are longwinded, Senator Faulkner thought that by having six estimates committees this problem would be stopped. I cannot understand how having six estimates committees, as we had last time, is going to stop people being longwinded. I could not follow any of Senator Faulkner's arguments and nor could anyone else on this side of the chamber.

         The Australian Democrats is the party that used to be—and I emphasise used to be—in Don Chipp's day the party that was very big on scrutiny and on keeping the government honest. The Democrats have completely fallen away from this objective of their party and that is why they got such a poor vote in the last election. The people of Australia understand that they are now no more than toadies to the Labor Party. They are people who are more left wing than the Labor Party. Whenever I say they should go and join the Labor Party, the Labor Party members say, `Even our left faction is not as bad as the Democrats'.

I suppose from the Democrats' point of view—and it is important that their few remaining voters understand this—it does not matter to them whether there are six or eight estimates committees that they do not attend. They are not terribly big on scrutiny when it comes to estimates committees.

         The reason for these sensible reforms is that there is limited time.

In Estimates Committee A the Government could give Senator Evans responsibility for Prime Minister and Cabinet and Foreign Affairs and Trade and leave Primary Industries and Energy to be considered by a separate estimates committee. Primary Industries and Energy is a very important department to be considered by the estimates committees but one which in recent times has not been scrutinised properly because we have simply run out of time and we have not been able to properly question the Government on those sorts of things.

         I am not saying definitively that that is how they should be split but there is good scope to divide the work of those committees, as Senator Crichton-Browne has suggested, and have eight committees. This would allow Ministers to deal with their portfolios and get on with their business, and it would allow committee members time to scrutinise the departments properly and then get on with their work. That would spread the workload and the scrutiny.

         Senator Crichton-Browne argues for eight Senate estimates committees. I understood that his leader, Senator Hill, was trying to develop a case, just a few minutes earlier, for 10 Senate estimates committees. Why does the Opposition not go for 30?

If we had eight Senate estimates committees, it is true that we do not have 24 backbenchers to cover them. So Senator Crichton-Browne is right. There is a problem because the Government has to provide 10 Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary. I am not going to be dishonest enough to stand up here and say that there is not a problem in terms of the resources that we provide, the personnel on our back bench, to staff the estimates committees.

         We have the responsibilities that come with forming government—ministerial responsibilities and the responsibilities of Parliamentary Secretary. I do not know whether it is true on the other side of the chamber, but on this side of the chamber we have also had a tradition that the Whips not serve on estimates committees if it is at all possible. That is a tradition that, because of our limited resources due to the increase in the number of frontbenchers, might be stretched. But not only is it an absolute impossibility for us to cover that number of committees; also I would ask: what would the cost be of establishing these two or four extra committees that are being proposed by the Opposition?

         There is a responsibility on all senators to look at the way these estimates committees operate. They have become a laughing stock, and everybody knows it. I repeat what I said in my introductory remarks: there are very few senators in this chamber—there are perhaps only two or three exceptions—who really believe that the estimates committee system is working the way it should. And there are very few senators in this chamber who would defend the behaviour of those senators who have been responsible for this occurring. We all know it.

It would have had an argument about whether I should have had Defence under A, B or C.

          —The situation at the moment is that the Manager of Government Business moved what were notices of motion Nos 10 and 11 together. What I intend to do, with the concurrence of the Senate, is to split the question so that we deal first with notice of motion No. 10 and then with No. 11. So the procedure will be to put the amendment to notice of motion No. 10, and then follow on from there with notice of motion No. 10, as amended, or notice of motion No. 10 as it is, put the amendment to notice of motion No. 11, and do the same thing. Does that have the concurrence of the Senate? It is so ordered. The first question, therefore, is that the amendment moved by Senator Crichton-Browne be agreed to.

         I represent Christmas Island in the Senate and have had the opportunity in the last year to visit Christmas Island on two occasions. The community on Christmas Island is undergoing a number of very important changes that have arisen from various initiatives taken by the Government and from legislation that has been passed through this Parliament.

          I am sure a number of honourable senators will recall that the Territories Law Reform Act was enacted in 1992 and consequent to that the administration of both the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island has undergone major and important changes. Many of those have been difficult changes for the residents of the two separate communities. Christmas Island, which this particular report addresses, has seen a number of changes to its municipal administration. The new shire council was, in effect, constituted by the territories law reform legislation. It is now operating and assumes responsibility for the Christmas Island Services Corporation which provides many of those municipal functions.

          It is important to recognise that two significant events are taking place on Christmas Island. The first is the development by Indonesian investors of a casino on the island. A casino with a capital investment of approximately $60 million is currently under construction. In the latter part of this year I will be watching very carefully the Government's estimates of the income that it will derive from the various royalties and agreements resulting from the operation of that new casino.

          I am certainly aware that the shire council believes the funding arrangements made for municipal services on that island should be reviewed. In fact, it is asking for a percentage of the earnings that will be derived from the casino operations to fund many of its operations. That figure is of course very different from the figures set forth in this particular report of the Christmas Island Services Corporation for the year ended 30 June 1992.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second issue that is impacting on the island community is the major rebuilding program of the Commonwealth Government. From memory, the figure committed by the Government in the first five-year phase of that rebuilding program is well in excess of $40 million. Naturally, the construction and commercial activity that is taking place is very important.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The community of Christmas Island is, of course, very small. There are approximately 1,300 residents on the island, many of whom take up their residency as former citizens of Malaysia, principally, who were attracted to the island by employment with the phosphate mine on the island itself. Of course, there are now many other employers on the island—principally in the government arena of the National Parks and Wildlife Service which very properly carries out a national park function on the island. There is a very viable small business and commercial sector that is operating and has been stimulated by the development activities of both the casino and the Government's rebuilding program. Of course, a number of other people have also been attracted to the island.

          This is an important report because it, in effect, flags out the old government era of administration in which the principal economic activity of the island was provided by government in one form or another and essentially underpinned the phosphate mining. So it is important that we note this report as the final one of the old regime and look carefully at subsequent developments on Christmas Island.

          I am very pleased to hear that the Christmas Island Shire Council has become a member of the Western Australian Municipal Association, which is the local government association in Western Australia, and is also part of the WAMA purchasing group organised by the Western Australian Municipal Association. The Western Australia Municipal Association has helped as much as it has been able, which I understand is quite considerably, with the new shire council organisation. WAMA has sent some of its officers to Christmas Island and is doing its bit to ensure that the Christmas Island Shire Council becomes part of the mainstream of local government in Western Australia.

I have taken over responsibility for the shadow territories portfolio which includes Christmas Island, Norfolk Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

          The island has a population of around 1,200 to 1,300 Malays and is dependent on the phosphate mine which, I suppose, has provided almost all the employment on the island. Now, on 8 August, a casino will be opened which will create a great many jobs. I believe that almost full employment will be realised, taking into account the people who are employed on the mine and those who will be employed in the casino and its associated service industries. But I well remember about three years ago when that casino might never have reached the drawing board stage; when there was a very close debate in this chamber within the parties as to whether the casino should go ahead. I believe that now the casino has almost reached the point where it will be opened on 8 August—a lucky day for the Chinese, I understand, which is why that day has been selected for its opening—and I look forward to being there.

          The Government is also spending a huge amount of money on revitalising, renewing and upgrading the houses that have been left vacant, as a number of people have removed themselves from the island and set up their homes in Western Australia. The report says that the island will be governed by a local government council. The laws of the island will be the same laws which are current in Western Australia and the islanders will have to adapt to those Western Australia laws.

         This report into the Aboriginals benefit trust account, which affects the mining royalty equivalents paid in the Northern Territory, is a very important report because it provides the basis not only for the administration of the four land councils operating in the Northern Territory but also for a series of benefits paid to Aborigines, again in the Northern Territory, under various provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. Of course, it allocates a considerable amount of money. In this particular case I note that in 1991-92, the year under review, the royalty equivalents in revenue were in excess of $34 million and interest earned on investments was in excess of $3 million, giving a revenue of $37 million.

          The distribution of the funds is very important. As I mentioned, a significant proportion of that money is made available to the administration of the respective land councils. It is interesting to note the provision for additional payments. If the land councils find that the funds that they receive as a right under the legislation are insufficient to meet their operating costs, they make application to the Minister for top-up funds under the provision of the Aboriginals benefit trust account.

          I am always critical of the fact that these funds are approved by the Minister and provided for the additional administrative costs of the land councils in addition to those automatically made available by the legislation. When I say I am critical, I mean that I am critical because that takes away from the funds that are then available for the community benefit of Aborigines in a more direct manner and, in effect, they are being applied for administrative purposes. So I always find it interesting to note where those particular changes are made.

          I have not yet had the opportunity to assess and look in detail at all of this report which was tabled here only this morning. I was concerned in looking at the report of the previous year to note that very significant funds had been pre-committed for the purchase of Aboriginal owned pastoral properties which, in effect, compromised future benefits that could be paid and made available. So I will be very interested to do a detailed appraisal of this particular year's report to ascertain the extent to which funds have been able to be made available for the various applications that I know are always presented annually to the Aboriginals benefit trust account—which are always, of course, far in excess of those which can actually be recommended for approval by each of the regions.

          Again I would emphasise that this is an important report. The income that flows through the trust account is, of course, that which is derived principally from mining activity in the Northern Territory and, as such, provides a very important stimulus to economic activity not only in the Aboriginal community but also in the Northern Territory community generally. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

          It is very interesting to note that, in very many important aspects, what the Labor Party Government has done is simply learnt yet again from the policy which the Liberal and National parties put out at the last election. What is said in this report and in the action that the Government has announced in recent times is simply an endorsement of what our then shadow Minister, Mr Michael Wooldridge, put up to the people of Australia at the last election as our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy. Specifically, the Government—and this report makes mention of it—has adopted our proposal to have an office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs to give independent policy advice to the Minister.

          There is, of course, a difference between the way in which the Labor Party has introduced this proposal and the way in which we did it. We did it after nine months of consultation, after a discussion paper had been put out and after Dr Wooldridge had had very lengthy discussions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. The Labor Party has simply made the announcement and lumped it upon these Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.

          The second proposal stolen by the Government from our election policy—already on the second day of the Parliament the Government is taking over the proposals that we put at the last election—is the reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. This is referred to on page 25, item 5 of the report. Another proposal that we put up and the Government has now adopted is to have commissioners working full-time and for a salary. We also proposed that regional chairmen should act full-time and on a salary; again, a proposal that has been adopted by the Government. In our policy we have also proposed that decisions should be made at regional council level rather than in the central government in Canberra. That has also been taken over by the Government.

          The Government still has a couple of other things to do to legislate correctly in so far as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is concerned in accordance with our policies. Still left to be adopted is our proposal for enhanced accountability. I would certainly urge the Government to look at our proposals in that regard and adopt them in future.

          The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has bipartisan support; certainly it has the support of the Liberal and National parties. However, I should sound a note of warning. It will only get that bipartisan support for so long as it acts responsibly. I was distressed to learn during the campaign that one of its commissioners was promoting some grossly inaccurate statements about our policies, suggesting that petrol and medicines would go up under our GST, when everybody knew that petrol would fall by 26c a litre in cost and that there was to be no GST on medicines. We were rather concerned to see a responsible commissioner going around promoting this sort of Labor Party propaganda.

          Although commissioners should have a view on matters of current debate, we hope that they will at least express their view in accordance with the facts and not in line with political propaganda that has been distributed around at the time. Having said that, we continue to offer our bipartisan support to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. We think that the amendments proposed and referred to this in report go a long way towards making the commission even more effective. We wish it continuing success.

         In looking at the 1991-92 annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, I would commend the board of directors for the very prudent administration that it has undertaken of this corporation for the financial year under review. I am familiar with a number of the members of that board. I note that the chairperson is Mr Gatjil Djerrkura of Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory and the Deputy Chairperson is Ms Lois O'Donoghue who, of course, is the chairperson of ATSIC itself.

          In reviewing this particular report from the Northern Territory's perspective, I can comment with some familiarity and knowledge on the project investments that have been undertaken, such as a tourist resort at Kings Canyon in the MacDonnell Ranges, the purchasing of Toyota and Mitsubishi motor vehicle franchise interests in Central Australia, and the Barra Base tourist-fishing lodge as a joint venture with the Tiwi Land Council on Bathurst Island. These are important initiatives for Aboriginal people, not only for their participation in the employment aspects and projects associated with such large capital investments, but also in providing Aboriginal ownership in the Northern Territory for Aboriginal people in the commercial objectives of the community.

          I appreciate that the administration of a commercial development corporation is in itself a very hard task. In particular, I would draw the Senate's attention to the very difficult decisions that the board of directors has obviously had to take with regard to Bonner House here in the ACT. This particular project, which the Corporation inherited, has been taken over and has been fraught with some financing difficulty over a long period. What is most concerning in these accounts that needs to be addressed was the revaluation that was so necessary of Bonner House itself.

          One sees in the report that the Corporation has found it necessary to review the inherited valuation that it took over of $12.4 million at 5 March 1990 as to its correctness and the necessity to revise  that valuation to an amount of $8.55 million—that is, $3.85 million less than the valuation at which the property was taken up in the books of account of the corporation.

          Many issues arise from the Labor Party's induced recession, and property values throughout Australia have taken a very major impact. I could imagine much of the debate that must have taken place in the board of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation in having to cope with this very hard and difficult situation. I note the Board's comments on page 33 of the report drawing attention to the fact that the financial statements:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

          This is very important because Bonner House, as many honourable senators will be well aware, is part of the Woden commercial district of the ACT. It has no direct provision of services to Aborigines other than the small community of Aboriginal people in the ACT. I cannot see it providing any immediate employment benefit for Aboriginal people. In changing the commercial nature of this particular project, it is important that any investments of this magnitude—that is, an investment of $12 million having to be written down to $8 million—involving benefits that were to be provided for Aboriginal people are not repeated. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         The 1991-92 annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is another significant portfolio report. It highlights the commission's third year of activity. The board, the commissioners, the various regional and zone councils and the staff of ATSIC are to be commended for the professional manner in which they have approached the difficult task that has been given to ATSIC in providing many programs—whether they be in the area of land development, social advancement or corporate services—for the provision of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.

However, I highlight in the time available to me that, in the report's outlook for the future, the commission acknowledges that the Mabo judgment is something which will now be very significant. Page 16 of the report states:

        —Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch at 12.45 p.m. on this day, which seems a long time ago, I was developing a very important point in this debate, that is, although the Keating Government has been re-elected for a second term, a number of other senators and members of the Opposition were elected to this Parliament who have a very important job to do, even though we are not sitting, as we would like to be, on the other side of the chamber. That job is to scrutinise the performance of this Government and the expenditure of taxpayers' money, to ensure that taxpayers' money is being expended in a proper way and that the objectives of the Government, the objectives of the Parliament, are being met by the bureaucracy.

        I made the point earlier in the day that it has been widely reported, particularly by the press gallery, that the power of Mr Keating, in his position as Leader of the Government and Prime Minister of Australia, has been enhanced by the result of the election. It is, of course, more important for the Parliament to thoroughly use its powers of scrutiny, and the estimates committee process is crucial to this.

        We are debating whether or not it is appropriate for the Senate to agree that a Parliamentary Secretary should perform the duties of a Minister before an estimates committee. The particular estimates committee that we are talking about deals with the primary industries portfolio. There are people across Australia who are involved in the wool industry, in particular, and a number of other rural industries in Queensland who will be very seriously affected by the decisions and the expenditure of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.

I guess the way in which money is allocated through the rural assistance scheme and the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation will also be considered by that estimates committee. I think it is entirely appropriate and quite proper for our constituents to have their concerns raised by their senators from either side of this chamber, and answers given by a Minister and not merely by a Parliamentary Secretary.

        In his contribution to the debate earlier this day, Senator Coulter said that he supported many of the arguments of the Opposition, particularly those put by Senator Bishop. He put a number of other arguments to the Senate which were in favour of the Opposition's view on this motion moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). Even Senator Coulter made the point that we would not want to see this becoming a precedent.

        What the Australian Democrats would be doing by supporting this motion is reinforcing the precedent that was created in the last session when the Senate agreed to Senator McMullan taking on responsibilities before an estimates committee. As the Democrats are supporting this motion tonight, they will be adding to that precedent. I am slightly perplexed by Senator Coulter's logic in saying that he does not want to create a precedent but that he is going to go along with it because it is only a sessional order and it applies only to one Parliamentary Secretary. The motion states that any senator appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act may exercise these powers. If the Prime Minister decides from time to time to appoint more Parliamentary Secretaries, Senator Coulter's line of argument is further diminished.

        The Opposition needs to be even more diligent than it has been in the past in scrutinising the Government, particularly through the estimates committee process. In the intervening hours between my earlier contribution to the debate and now, we have had a detailed and often heated debate about the role of estimates committees and the number of hours that some estimates committees take to scrutinise government expenditure and the Forward Estimates.

       I think many people who have spent many hours on estimates committees would very much agree with that quote by those two eminent American legislators and academics. It is very important that senators spend a lot of time and are very diligent in going about their work on estimates committees. I do not think one can judge the effectiveness of that time by the number of hours that an estimates committee sits. However, if the Minister and the bureaucrats who are advising the Minister do not perform their functions properly, that scrutiny cannot take place effectively either.

        As Senator Campbell and speakers before me have pointed out, the estimates committees play a very important part in the role of this Senate. Perhaps the Opposition takes this matter a lot more seriously because it is, by nature, the role of the Opposition to question and query not only the Ministers but also staff and departments. This year, for the first time in the six years I have been here, we on this side of the chamber had to have a ballot to decide which of us could be members on some of the estimates committees.

        Senators on this side of the chamber are keen to be in a position where they can look at the expenditure and see where money is being wasted, to keep the Ministers on their toes but, more importantly, to keep the bureaucrats on their toes. Let us face it, it is an important part of the functions of this chamber to do just that. That being the case—the importance that is placed upon Estimates—it is also very important that the person responsible for a particular department be the person who appears before an estimates committee to be queried.

        Other honourable senators on this side of the chamber have made the point very strongly today that Ministers should be available to appear at estimates committee hearings, and there is no reason why they should not be. The Government now has 10 Ministers in the Senate. Surely some of those Ministers could make themselves available to give the estimates committees the appropriate status. With all due respect to my colleague Senator Sherry, the fact that he is a Parliamentary Secretary would make it seem that he would not have the clout, the experience or the rapport with heads of departments and agencies that a Minister would have. I also find it rather peculiar that the Parliamentary Secretaries have had bestowed upon them the title of `the Honourable'. I would have thought that, given the attitude of the Labor Party members towards this chamber and some of its traditions, they would not see fit to bestow upon themselves the title of `the Honourable'.

        I also noted this morning the point made by Senator Bishop that Parliamentary Secretaries receive the lurks and perks of the office, which would include more staff and, therefore, more government expenditure. Senator O'Chee made a  point about Senator Cook being very uncomfortable last year when questioned about genetic material and related matters to do with his portfolio. It is the responsibility of the Minister in this chamber representing a department or representing a Minister in the other house to be present at the estimates committee hearings.

Wendy Fatin, MP, appointed the second Working Party on 1 July 1991. At that time, the Working Party's terms of reference were broadened to encompass the media more generally. The NWP is scheduled to complete its term in June 1993.
