        The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showed that:

      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Since May 1992, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) started a new campaign trying to stamp out the voice of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation (UVBC), which is led by the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, an Amnesty International's prisoner of conscience since his third arrest by the GOSRV in 1982.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The GOSRV has ignored the UVBC's moderate demands: the restoration of its structure and activities in the country, as clearly stated in the letter signed by Thich Huyen Quang on 25/6/1992 to the Hanoi authorities.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Instead of listening and considering the UVBC's genuine and sound desires, the GOSRV is continuing on their criminal path of repression and persecution: torturing till death Venerable Thich Thien An in late September 1992 in Chi Hoa prison, arresting Venerables Thich Khong Tanh and Thich Tri Luc in 2/10/92, and carrying out other oppressive measures, such as threats, distortion, slander, preventing communication, searching of religious places and private homes, etc of Buddhist monks, nuns and lay people who support the UVBC.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In 1981, the GORSV intervened by creating the Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), a puppet body, with the intent of dispossessing the Buddhist clergy and lay communities. Many clergy have been forced to join VBC, and threatened due to their support to the UVBC.

The order concerning the membership of the loan council committee was structured in such a way that three senators came from the Government, three from the Opposition and one from the Australian Democrats. That is in a form that meets our requirements; therefore, I do not think the amendment that we were proposing earlier is necessary.

        This Bill introduces changes to Part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to modify some aspects of the procedures for allocating Satellite Subscription Television Broadcasting Licences A and B.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me make clear at the outset that this amendment does not apply to those tenderers who were announced as the highest bidders on 30 April 1993. Those companies' applications are now at the second stage of the established process which will continue to finality. This legislation does not reflect a judgement that either of the current highest bidders is unable to meet its bid, and to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place should such a contingency arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The process to allocate these licences, which was determined under Section 93 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, has 3 stages.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first stage that has just been completed, involves an impartial assessment of complying tenders to identify which delivered the highest bid price.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second stage involves assessment of the tenderers so identified by the Australian Broadcasting Authority who will need to form a view about the suitability of the applicants under Section 98 of the Act. The ABA will also seek the opinion of the Trade Practices Commission in relation to Part IV of the Trade Practices Act as required under section 93 of the Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The third stage involves actual issuance of the licence but only after the ABA and TPC processes have been satisfied, and the full bid price paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the legislation, Trade Practices Commission consideration could take up to 45 days. Following that, licensees have 30 days within which to pay the bid price.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The interest of the public is that the issuance of pay television licences and the effective commencement of broadcasting services should occur as soon as possible. This has always been the Government's intention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Until licences A and B are issued, it is not possible for the standard for a digital transmission system to be declared, nor for a third licence to be issued to the ABC.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation before the Senate therefore provides that, in the event that either of the present highest tenderers were not successful, any alternative tenderer who thereby had the opportunity to be assessed as a potential licensee would be required to provide a 5% deposit within 3 days of being given that opportunity.
       </para>

        This amendment will put an additional step in the process after the initial identification of highest bidders—its purpose is to provide an additional indication that those tenderers have the financial capacity to pay the price bid hence justifying continuation of the process through its detailed assessment stages.

        ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) BILL 1993
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1993 is to give effect to the National Road Transport Commission's (NRTC) first determination regarding annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and permit charges for vehicles operating above 125 tonnes. The Bill is vital to the Government's national micro-economic reform agenda for land transport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For too long the efficiency of Australia's interstate road transport operations has been impeded by a lack of uniformity in regulations and charging. Currently heavy vehicle operating conditions and registration charges vary considerably between nine different jurisdictions and bear little relation to the costs imposed on the road system by various types of vehicles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The NRTC, which is an independent statutory authority, was established as a result of the Heads of Government Agreement of July 1991 and set up under Commonwealth legislation passed in December 1991. Its purpose is to investigate and make recommendations regarding the establishment of a national registration scheme and uniform road use charges for heavy vehicles, and nationally consistent operating regulations for all vehicles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Intergovernmental Agreement, which forms a schedule to The National Road Transport Commission Act 1991, requires the NRTC to recommend charges for heavy vehicles which: achieve full cost recovery; achieve a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity; improve the link between pricing and investment decisions; and minimise the incentive for road transport operators to shop around for lower charges.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Ministerial Council approved the NRTC charging determination on behalf of State and Territory Governments. It is envisaged that each of the States and the Northern Territory will pass legislation in their respective Parliaments which will adopt the legislation passed in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and any Regulations made under it. This will ensure that there is uniform charging for heavy vehicles throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement, this Bill will require the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, from 1 July 1995 onwards, to fix annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and to fix charges for the granting of permits to operate vehicles with a gross mass exceeding 125 tonnes. Those charges will be fixed in accordance with the schedule to the Bill. The Bill will not affect the existing registration scheme in the Australian Capital Territory other than to fix the charges to be collected when a heavy vehicle is registered. Responsibility for determining registration exemptions or concessional charges will continue to be a matter for the Australian Capital Territory. Revenue from the registration charges will be retained by the Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The charges provided for in the schedule to the Bill may be increased or decreased by regulations under the proposed Act. The amount of increase or decrease is limited to a maximum of 5% per annum. Heads of Government have agreed that the matter of concessional registration charges for particular groups is for each State and Territory to address according to their own priorities, with the cost to revenue being met from their own budgets. In accordance with this decision, the NRTC charging determination does not make recommendations on the level and structure of concessions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During the process of implementing national charges, the States and Territories will be reviewing the structure of registration concessions in their individual jurisdictions, including those which apply to the rural sector. The charges provided for in this Bill do not include, and the schedule does not preclude, the fixing of fees for administration and other services provided by the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this context, it would be contrary to the spirit of the Intergovernmental Agreement for Governments to impose administration or inspection fees that varied greatly across jurisdictions, as road transport operators would see these as part of the total cost of registering a vehicle. This would encourage operators to shop around between the States and Territories. A working group of officials is currently examining the issue of acceptable and uniform levels of administrative charges and inspection fees and is expected to complete its report in the next couple of months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As in the Australian Capital Territory, revenues from national registration charges received by the States and Northern Territory will be retained by them and will be available for use on roads. The use of those funds, including distribution to local councils, and the determination of road funding needs, will be decided by each jurisdiction.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The passage of this Bill is testimony to the continuing commitment of the Federal Government to implementing the reforms in the road transport industry which have been needed for so long, and which were agreed to by Heads of Government. I expect that Heads of Government will honour their commitment made in the Intergovernmental Agreement and all administrations will implement the reforms by July 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Road transport is an essential part of our land transport system, and approximately 70 per cent of freight which is moved in Australia travels by road at some stage. Australia cannot afford to squander opportunities to bring about workable and acceptable reforms in the road transport industry, and assist in enhancing Australia's international competitiveness. There will be no significant costs, revenues or savings to the Commonwealth arising from the Bill.

        AUSTRALIAN WOOL REALISATION COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1993
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 will provide for a one year extension to the repayment period for the wool industry debt. That debt currently stands at $2.26 billion and is backed by a Government guarantee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's recently announced package of measures, of which this amendment forms part, is in response to the deteriorating conditions in the wool industry. We have experienced reduced demand for our wool due to the continuing global recession affecting our key markets in Western Europe and Japan and the virtual withdrawal of Russia from the market. In combination with this we are faced with continuing over-production, a 3.9 million bale stockpile and wool prices which are at their lowest level in real terms in over 40 years. The key elements of the recent package provide immediate relief from the short term circumstances facing the industry and set in train a process to address the more fundamental issues in the longer term.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, as you will be aware, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission is charged with the responsibility of managing the stockpile and discharging the industry's debt which was accumulated under the former wool Reserve Price Scheme. It is to undertake this in a manner that is in the best interests of the nation and woolgrowers in particular. The legislation currently requires the Commission to acquit the debt within 7 years or less. The Commission ceases to exist upon the sale or transfer of all assets and repayment of the debt.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This amendment will now give the Commission 8 years, from 1 July 1991, in which to repay the debt and the Government guarantee will also be extended by one year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In current circumstances it was apparent that the Commission could not retire the debt within the requirements of its current schedule, without an adverse impact on an already deteriorating wool market. The Commission was not in a position to sell significant quantities of its stocks without further depressing the market. At the same time the Government agreed that woolgrowers could not afford increased tax payments to maintain the debt repayment schedule.

        —This motion by Senator Faulkner seeks to restrict the speaking time of senators on a second reading debate from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. Some people on the other side of the chamber may find that a good idea. That may be a reflection on how much respect they have for the Senate chamber, but this is an important place and the matters discussed here are important. Senator Patterson moved the amendment to the motion to ensure that if Bills are taken cognately, the 20-minute speaking limit should not apply.

        That is an eminently sensible proposal. Even the people on the other side would have to recognise that when Bills are taken cognately there are many matters that have to be dealt with by members of the Opposition front bench, who of course have to speak in some cases on behalf of a shadow Minister in the other place and sometimes in their own capacity. It is entirely appropriate that in those circumstances honourable senators be given a full and adequate opportunity to address those issues.

        A perfect example of the necessity of having a 30-minute speaking time, at least in so far as a cognate debate is concerned, occurred immediately after this motion was last dealt with by the Senate. We moved to the adjournment debate and Senator Bell raised two matters, both in relation to the State of Tasmania. It took Senator Bell—and I know he was trying to get through it as quickly as possible—almost 30 minutes to deal with the two matters. That is not a criticism of Senator Bell; it merely points out the absurdity of saying that we can deal in the space of 20 minutes with two or more Bills which are being taken together. We cannot do it.

        We only have to look at the appalling nature of the Government's taxation legislation in the last parliament to recognise that it does not have a clue about how to run the tax system. I am not talking about issues of policy; I am talking about important issues of detail. Of course, the Government has not thought through the consequences of its legislation. When we have a government that does not think through the consequences of legislation, who is it whose task it is to protect the taxpayer? Who is it whose task it is to protect the community at large? It is the task of the Opposition. To complete that task, to do its duty, the Opposition needs adequate time to consider these Bills properly. We are not a rubber stamp of the Government.

         It is no laughing matter that the House of Representatives is unfortunately unable to do these things. Frequently, we in this chamber jest to some degree about our colleagues in the other place. We do so because we know and they know that the House of Representatives is not capable of giving these matters adequate consideration. In part, one of the reasons why the House of Representatives is incapable of giving these matters adequate representation is that the members in that place have a speaking time of 20 minutes. So do we become like the House of Representatives or do we, as honourable senators, do our duty and work through these Bills properly until our consideration is completed?

        Senator Faulkner has said in defence of this proposition—and I say `in defence of this proposition', not `advancing this proposition'—that if one cannot say it in 20 minutes, it is not worth saying. It took him, I hasten to add, between 15 and 18 minutes to advance that very simple proposition. Senator Faulkner got up on his hind legs, thinking he was the new Cicero of the Senate chamber, and gave us a lesson entitled `Do as I say and not as I do'. It was one of the most abjectly boring speeches the Senate has heard in a long time.

He could not come before the Senate and say that by cutting back the speaking time from 30 minutes to 20 we are going to give more enlightened discussion. Of course he could not do that; it would be a nonsense. Senator Faulkner well knows what cutting back the speaking time from 30 minutes to 20 will achieve: it will give less enlightened discussion to these matters. Of course, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner has a vested interest in having less enlightened discussion on these matters.

        Of course Senator Faulkner would say, `But most of the second reading speeches that have been given in this chamber over the last three years—some 67 per cent of second reading speeches—have been dealt with in 20 minutes or less'. That is absolutely correct, because honourable senators do not enjoy having to get up and speak for 30 minutes. Speaking for 30 minutes is a hard task, particularly when one has complex matters to deal with. But it is that 24, 25, or 26 per cent of speeches that go over the 20 minutes that are the exception for which we should make provision.

        For example, when the 20-minute rule applied at the end of the last session in the lead-up to Christmas, I well recollect how my National Party Senate Leader, Senator Boswell, in speaking on the rural crisis, required an extension of time—which, I am pleased to say, was given to him by the Senate—so that he could outline the concerns of the people of Queensland in relation to the rural crisis, the drought and the effects it had not just on farmers but on people who live in rural communities. Of course, it should not be the case that a leader of a party speaking on an issue which goes right to the core of what that party stands for should be obliged to go on bended knee to the other side of the chamber to beg for another three or four minutes to complete a speech which he had already gutted to try to fit into the 20 minutes.

        I point out to my colleagues in the Democrats who sit to my left that we in small parties, more so than those in large, need the full 30 minutes to lay down our point of view. In the Democrats there is an arrangement whereby individual senators deal with particular areas of interest. In the National Party we have an informal arrangement where some of us take particular interest in certain matters. For example, Senator Bjelke-Petersen has during her time in the Senate taken a particular interest in family issues and issues affecting women who live outside the capital cities. Therefore, we do not have an array of speakers to deal with particular matters. We cannot throw four or five adequately briefed senators into the debate. In many cases we have but one senator to lay down our point of view. That one senator should be allowed the opportunity to lay down that point of view fully, adequately and thoroughly so that everybody—not just in this Senate chamber but also throughout the community—knows the view of that particular party.

        Many times in this chamber I have disagreed with views that honourable senators have put, but I have never disagreed with the right of that senator to put that view. I take as an example the former Senator Vallentine from Western Australia. There perhaps would have been one occasion on which I have agreed with Senator Vallentine on an in principle issue. I remember that on numerous occasions Senator Vallentine would come into the chamber on the adjournment debate, not having been in the chamber all day, and then proceed to give an adjournment speech of 30 minutes which would cover some 20 pages of finely printed text. I know on a couple of occasions that people from either side protested—and in a couple of cases the Senate proceeded to call the quorum on Senator Vallentine on the adjournment.

We should not further restrict Senate speaking time when adequate speaking time is the hallmark of the enlightened and reasoned debate for which this Senate chamber is justifiably proud and famous, not just in this country but throughout the region. In many countries with which we deal, people say that the Australian Senate is one of the finest chambers of review that one will find anywhere.

In the autumn session of 1990, 63 per cent of speakers took 20 minutes or less. In the Budget session of 1990, 76 per cent of speakers took 20 minutes or less. The figure was 68 per cent for the autumn session of 1991; 78 per cent for the Budget session of 1991; 76 per cent for the autumn session of 1992; and 59 per cent for the Budget session of 1992.

        What time saving is the Government really going to achieve? As Senator O'Chee has said, those who took more than 20 minutes to deliver their speech obviously decided they had something to say which would take more time. People normally do not get up and speak for the sake of speaking, and one reason for that is that hardly anybody is listening. It is unfortunate that in the other chamber very few members come into the chamber to listen to what people have to say in their speeches during second reading debates about the principles of the Bills that are before them.

As we saw at the end of last session and, sadly, at the end of the session before that—and I think in the session before that—the guillotine came down in this chamber as well.

       This is part of a pattern of measures which have come through at the start of this new Parliament which will have the effect of further curtailing the rights of senators to debate Bills and to make governments more accountable. That is a matter of great concern. There is probably no year on record in which the Government has attempted to get more Bills through the Parliament than it did last year. Certainly, a record number of Bills were passed by this chamber. If we are going to fulfil our duties as legislators, it is vitally important that we have every opportunity to make the points that we believe our constituents would wish us to make and to raise questions with the Government.

       I have said this before and I will say it again: I think there is a desire in the community for parliaments to function better. There is a need to make executives more accountable to parliaments. Two royal commissions, one in Queensland and one in Western Australia, have made that very point—that it could be argued that the problems which emerged in those States showed that the parliaments were not acting effectively.

Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, recently pointed out that no legislation of any substance has been debated in this chamber, despite the fact that we have now been back almost two weeks. In fact, the time of the chamber has been taken up with a whole host of procedural motions that Senator Faulkner seems determined to ram through this chamber without any sensible attempt to get a proper consensus and without any recognition of the need to make some changes. Instead, he has done a deal with the Democrats in an attempt to impose the Government's will on this chamber. It is a great pity that Senator Coulter and his colleagues have cooperated with him.

For example, senators will have further time to contribute on second reading amendments. So there are ways around this motion, although they are somewhat untidy, but if this motion is forced through, they will undoubtedly be used.

That cannot be an unlimited right but, as other speakers have said, it was not so many years ago that we had an hour to speak on a Bill. For years after I was elected there was the entitlement to speak for an hour on any Bill. What we are faced with now is not, as my colleague Senator Kemp says, a minimalist reduction from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. We are now in a situation where we have one-third of the entitlement we had when I first came into the chamber—20 minutes as against 60. That is a massive reduction.

        The point of all of this is that the business of the chamber, in the eyes of the Labor Party, has to be reduced to the level of impotence that the House of Representatives now enjoys. The Labor Party has never matured in its thinking. It does not understand the exercise of power. It does not understand that power is not unqualified, that the right to exercise power carries with it certain responsibilities, and the most important of those responsibilities is the responsibility of accounting for the exercise of that power.

        The accounting of the exercise of power cannot be done on television interviews; it cannot be done in the press. It can only be in the Parliament that the executive government is brought to account. Because of the limitations constitutionally on the House of Representatives, this chamber is the crucial chamber where governments are brought to account. So any move that denies the right of a senator to speak or the access of a senator to speak to some degree circumscribes the matter of accountability of the Government.

        Mention has been made of the guillotine. When we were allowed to speak for an hour, the guillotine was rarely used, except by the Labor Party. If one goes through the

The Labor Party loves the guillotine. I remember the time when Senator Murphy was Leader of the Senate. I think he guillotined 68 Bills through in 20 minutes. I was not here but the notoriety that that earned the Labor Party spread right throughout Australia. We have had the incredible situation where right at the start of this session the Labor Party has already introduced the guillotine in the House of Representatives, where it has absolute power.

        Another manifestation of this same avoidance of accountability has been the marked deterioration of the committee system in the Senate. The committees are very dear to the proper functioning of the Senate. We have seen a marked reluctance on the part of the Labor Party to allow those committees to operate properly. Nothing demonstrates that better than the estimates committees, which are sitting at present. Mr Deputy President, how many times do you walk into an estimates committee and see only Liberal or National Party senators around the table forming the quorum?

They prefer the secret backroom deal of the Caucus committees. This is ultimately what is behind the whole of the republican movement for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is a naked grab for power of a Prime Minister who wants to take unto himself a new Constitution which puts greater powers in the hands of the party of the day governing the country. This is promoted by a Prime Minister who knows that at present he has absolute and total control over Caucus, so he is answerable to no-one.

        The other very upsetting manifestation of committees at present is not only the lack of cooperation of the Labor Party but also the arrogance of the chairmen of the committees and of the Ministers at the table to control and restrict the flow of questions to those committees. Unless we can have an honest answer or frank explanation from a public servant as to where money is proposed to be spent, we simply cannot have an examination at the level we need to assure the Senate that the Government is spending its funds properly. The incident last night where Senator Collins once more reverted to his characteristics, which I compared once to a dying wounded buffalo in the Northern Territory, and steadfastly refused to answer questions or allow questions to be answered is really a very serious assault on the committee system.

        This matter of accountability cannot be overemphasised. We live in a society where compliance with the law is essential. If we do not comply with the law, society ends up in a state of anarchy. But compliance with that law is a voluntary matter. In general, people comply with the laws because they accept they are for the common good. One of the laws involves paying money. A lot of us in this country pay taxes. We pay those voluntarily—certainly, we can be pursued by the tax commissioner, but 99 per cent of the community pay their taxes voluntarily and on time. The reciprocal obligation on the Government of those taxing powers is to account for the expenditure of money. One of the principal ways of bringing the Government to account for that is in this chamber. I am implacably opposed to anything that restricts or diminishes the powers of the Senate to inquire into the proper workings of the Government. I therefore oppose this motion.

I oppose the Government's motion that there be a restriction of 20 minutes placed on speeches by honourable senators in second reading debates. The principal argument that I put to the chamber is that the Senate is a precious, essential element of the Australian democracy and to restrict its powers is to undermine the ability of the Senate to fulfil its objective to represent the Australian people in ensuring—by scrutiny; by questioning; and by putting forward views, particularly contrary views—that there is a proper examination of all matters that come before this Parliament.

I believe it is tragic that the legislative scrutiny of this Parliament has now been virtually vacated by the House of Representatives. In saying that, I do not wish to show any disrespect for the other place—of course, it is against our Standing Orders to show any such disrespect—but I speak plainly when I say that the Senate is the only chamber where there is careful scrutiny of government legislation and, indeed, even of a large number of other areas such as government reports and inquiries by Senate committees.

        It is a scandal that yesterday, the fourth day of sitting, a guillotine was introduced into the House of Representatives for 30 Bills to be handled with often only 20 minutes allocated to each Bill. That is the kind of intention that the Government can impose upon the House of Representatives because it has a majority there. Against whatever protests are put forward by Liberal and National party members of the House of Representatives, or by the two independent members, the Government has its way. Its way is achieved by its iron majority in the House of Representatives. So, because of what happened yesterday, 30 Bills are to be adopted, regardless of contrary view and regardless of debate. These Bills are all to be determined according to the Government's wish; that is, the Bills are not to be amended or varied in any way.

        I want to make one thing very clear: I believe that on most occasions a 20-minute speech is better than a 30-minute speech. I believe that restricting a speech to 20 minutes is best achieved by self-restraint and self-discipline, not by such a restriction being placed in the Standing Orders of the Senate. I think there are times when honourable senators need 30 minutes to express properly their views on a particular Bill or even a series of Bills.

        I put to the Senate that if this motion is carried with Democrat support for the Government's proposition, it will be able to be evaded. There is no such time restriction on speeches at the first reading or third reading stages and, as we know, 15 minutes is allowed to speakers on any matter at the committee stage. Under our current procedure there are occasions—for instance, the consideration of finance Bills—that allow for a speech on any topic. This opportunity has not been taken up in recent years as much as it was 12 or 15 years ago, when I was first here. If restrictions are imposed in this way, the Senate has its own way of getting around them. Any view a senator needs to express could be expressed through such alternative means—even including during the adjournment debate. I happen to think that a five-minute speech on the adjournment is an admirable self-restraint, but I have, along with others, spoken for 30 minutes on the adjournment on a few occasions. I believe, in retrospect, that the length of time I took on those occasions was justified because there was a need to speak comprehensively.

I give only one other example—the two-day special sitting in late January 1991 to debate the Gulf war. I regard it as one of the high points of the Senate in terms of the contributions of the approximately 50 senators to the debate on one motion. That one matter was before us for the two days and we spoke, as many will recall, until 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning to give everyone an appropriate turn. Many senators rightly spoke for 30 minutes. It is appropriate, when there is need for a full expression of view on a matter of major import to this country, that the Senate should allow that.

I was rather intrigued by Senator Kemp's mention of the Marshall Islands.

The Senate may well be aware that there is a parliamentary delegation going to a number of South Sea Island countries. I am hoping to be a member of that delegation, which I believe might be leaving in June. I might, for the edification of senators, be approaching Senator Richardson for a reference to give to a few people over there or perhaps an introduction to people to see whether I could set up a suitable immigration scam!

        To pick up the assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and assert the opposite, I remind everybody that, under the unrepresentative system of election of the House of Representatives, it is possible for a party with just over 12 per cent of the vote to gain government. It is in the Senate, with its proportional representation system, that we have a properly representative chamber. I see Senator Watson looking puzzled. I would invite him to do the numbers on just three parties seeking election and to recognise that the party that wins government has to win only 25 per cent of the votes plus one vote in 50 per cent of the seats plus one seat.

We had a responsibility to carry that view into this chamber and if the numbers had prevailed then, in relation to the point Senator Baden Teague made about government scrutiny, the boot would have been on the other foot.

The Opposition supported that legislation introduced by the Government. It has now changed its position.

        Senator Teague also made the very significant point that in the committee stage of the debate senators can speak for up to 15 minutes as many times as they like. It is at the committee stage of the debate—and I stress that word `debate'—that true debates occur. That is where we get into the nitty-gritty of legislation; that is where we change the legislation; that is where we move amendments to legislation. As I say, if one feels strongly about a particular amendment, provided there is objection to it—and presumably there is objection if one has to debate it—one can get up and continue to make points with respect to that amendment, and there is no limitation on that debate.

        It is at the second reading stage, which is improperly called a debate, that each party states its general philosophical position with respect to that legislation.

The detailed points that need to be raised, particularly if they lead to an amendment and a change to the legislation, can be dealt with in the committee stage.

        I pick up a point here that Senator O'Chee made. On several occasions it has been quite clear that senators in this place have spoken for 20 minutes, half-an-hour or whatever the limit at that time happened to be; they clearly have been in need of additional time, have sought leave and, to my knowledge, that leave has not been refused. I would disagree with Senator O'Chee when he rather pejoratively suggested that Senator Boswell had to get on bended knee and go to the Government to get that leave. I would suggest that most of us in this chamber would recognise that if a speaker was making valid points, clearly in continuation of some argument, and then sought leave, that leave would be granted. That mechanism would not be needed very often. The Opposition has many members in this chamber and it can put two or three speakers on. It can easily cover the philosophical aspects of a piece of legislation over the course of an hour by putting on three speakers. So there is not, in that sense, a limitation.

        Somebody remarked along the way that the Governor-General's speech should have been edited. I could not agree more with that statement. I think it is clear that various government departments simply threw together their particular pieces in the speech. The speech was often repetitive. It looked almost as though it dealt with points in alphabetical order because women came well down on the list. I hope that does not indicate the low—

        It is for those reasons that we are supporting the Government on this motion. I simply stress that the so-called second reading debates are not debates; they are statements of position for which, in our view, 20 minutes is quite adequate. We would certainly resist—and strongly resist—any limitation on the committee stage of the debate. We certainly would not object if leave were sought for an extension of time if a speaker clearly needed an extra few minutes to complete a speech; I would hope that the Government would also extend that courtesy to any speaker.

Immediately they make their ballot they have to show it to one of their factional members. Good democracy!

Last night we had a most shameful situation in the estimates committees, another attempt to undermine the powers of the Senate estimates committees. I do not understand the Democrats, frankly.

He got up and could not use 20 minutes; he took just on 30 minutes. The hypocrisy of that is unbelievable. If Senator Bell, who is a Democrat and who believes that he should have been able to fit his speech into 20 minutes, found that he could not and took just on 30 minutes, then surely to heavens the vote in that situation would be nothing but hypocrisy.

        I was absolutely staggered to hear Senator Coulter say that debate is not important in this chamber. Let me quote his exact words. He said, `All it is in this chamber is how the numbers fall'. Debate does not matter. We have had the Democrats saying to the public at large, `Our policy is that anyone who comes into the Parliament in our party has the right to vote as they think. They will not be caucused. We will listen to the debate and we will vote the way we believe we should'. That is what the Democrats told the Australian people; that is what they tell their constituents; and that is what they tell their party members. But today we have heard Senator Coulter say that debate is not important; it is how the numbers fall. That, I think, is a travesty of their whole credibility and we will see what happens as a result of it.

        The proposal to limit speeches in second reading debates to 20 minutes is more than just a matter of limiting speaking time; it is a matter of putting a further check or limitation on this accountability, important though that be. This 20-minute limit on speaking time is restricted further by the Government's practice of grouping Bills together and debating them cognately. Last year in the tax area we had something like three to four minutes per Bill to thrash out the important issues.

        Within the next fortnight this chamber will be debating three tax Bills: two taxation laws amendment Bills and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. If this motion is passed, contributions to the debate on those Bills will be limited to 20 minutes. Therefore, we will have less than seven minutes to debate each of those important Bills.

        The second reading stage of a Bill is very important because it sends messages to the Australian people telling them what issues they should be contacting us on. But if senators do not have the opportunity of sending out those signals and messages through this Parliament, then we are taking away from the Parliament the very responsibilities that we were elected here to carry out—to debate, to challenge and to put alternative positions. If those responsibilities are taken away from us we will have to rely on networks other than this Parliament to send our messages to the Australian public. I think that is unfortunate.

        Let us see how that is reflected in regard to administration. The taxation office—an area for which I have particular responsibility—is becoming subject to less and less parliamentary scrutiny. The office seems to be more concerned about dealing with its own groups that it has set up outside the control of this Parliament and as a result is devoting less time to the Parliament. It is making determinations and rulings which cannot possibly come through the Senate. For those people who do not have the opportunity or money to challenge those rulings—and challenges to a ruling must go before a court and the court system is so expensive that they cannot afford it—where is the justice? Taxation justice in this country depends on how much money one has and, as some witnesses suggested, on how much influence one personally has with the taxation office.

In the last election the vote for the Democrats fell from about 12 per cent to 5.3 per cent. That shows what the people of Australia think about the way the Democrats have simply rolled over for the Labor Party every time some proposal is put up to curtail speech in this Senate, to interfere with the Senate's scrutiny and to oppose reform.

At least in the last Parliament the Prime Minister knew that his numbers were very, very tight. He occasionally paid lip-service to Caucus decisions. Of course, now—and it has been demonstrated in many ways, particularly with the appointment of the frontbench—the Prime Minister is not even going to take any notice of the Labor Party Caucus anymore, let alone the Australian public. He has no concern for those sorts of things. Where we might have hoped that, at some stage, the excesses of the Government could be curtailed, we have a group—a very small group and getting smaller, I might say—in the Australian parliamentary system, the Australian Democrats, who seem determined to do everything possible to allow this Government to ride roughshod over the wishes of the Australian public.

There is no doubt in my mind that this whole change to the Standing Orders and this attempt to reduce time limits is a further erosion of senators' rights and an attempt by the Government to escape further scrutiny by this Senate. I do not need to remind the chamber that it is this Senate that has been responsible for the dismissal of at least two Ministers. You never know, there might be another one coming up shortly. Anything that will reduce our powers and scrutinising abilities should be opposed. I am very disappointed to see that the Democrats have once more thrown away their principles in order to support the Government in this matter.

        —I want to raise a couple of issues in connection with this motion to limit speeches during second reading debates to 20 minutes. I am very serious about the nature of debate which takes place in the chamber. When I first came into this chamber, I could not make a speech for more than eight minutes. For about the first 10 speeches I made, at the end of eight minutes, I could not think of another word to say. But as one gets more knowledgeable—not more voluble—about what is happening in government, one needs to be able to develop a speech.

        Apparently, the other night Senator Bell felt he needed 29 1/2 minutes to develop an argument. As Senator Chamarette said, former Senator Vallentine used to come in here and talk for 30 minutes—not to fill up 30 minutes but because she felt she needed 30 minutes to develop an argument. I am all in favour of senators being able to develop an argument. Believe me, if Reg Wright or John Wheeldon were still in this Parliament, I would have give them an hour to develop an argument because both those speakers were so good that people who heard them on the radio would come in to listen to the points that they were making.

        I make the following proposition very seriously to the committee that deals with the Standing Orders: we ought to stand by standing order 187, that senators shall not read speeches. We ought to stick to that firmly. In the case of a Minister or a shadow Minister, we would allow them to incorporate in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard

        a document which, in effect, contains an essay on the subject or, if you like, what could be called a speech—although I think it is wrong to call it a speech when it is being incorporated in

        There would need to be some caution. The shadow Minister or the Minister would need to be able to let both sides read the document first so that we could make sure there was nothing improper in the speech. That is what is wrong with incorporated speeches; someone could incorporate in a speech something which is highly improper and to which objection would be taken in the Senate. If that problem could be overcome by allowing people to see the speeches, we would enable the Minister and the shadow Minister simply to incorporate their speeches.

Another senator on his side is Senator Schacht, who frequently comes into this place and makes excellent speeches. I certainly do not like some of the things that he says, but they are excellent speeches. He directs his mind articulately to the subject and people enjoy listening to him, although we might not enjoy some of the things he says, especially when he makes outrageous, unfair and unreasonable attacks on me and my colleagues on this side of the chamber.

        If senators did not read speeches, they would really start to debate issues properly. We might then get debates which only take three or four minutes. When senators started to read speeches, someone would be able to object and the whole Senate would uphold the objection that they are not allowed to read them; not even Ministers would be allowed to read them. Once we did that, we would not have to worry about whether there were 20-minute speeches or 30-minute speeches. The whole thing would flow and the Senate would be a much more exciting chamber in which to be present.

        This proposal really reduces the debate in this chamber to an absolute farce. It takes us to the situation that applies in the House of Representatives where the members do not make a significant contribution in the chamber; they are simply but numbers for the Government. The members get to speak but rarely and when they do speak they are entitled to do so for 10 minutes. From time to time when I have flipped through the

In 10-minute speeches there is no intellectual debate developed; they invariably consist of simple cliches that in no way persuade, educate or inform people of the legislation before them.

        The fundamental premise upon which a parliament functions in a democratic system is that there shall be two fundamental rights. The first is the right to freedom of speech and the right to speak. The second premise upon which a parliamentary system is based in a democracy is the freedom to vote. The Government proposes to abolish the former. In my view, any limitations on people's right to speak in this chamber is an infringement on that right, and to reduce the speaking time adds to that infringement.

        The truth of the matter is that this debate is all about the Government's incapacity to manage the business of the Parliament. Senator Faulkner's solution to that, to the bottleneck at the end of the year, is to no doubt continue to use the guillotine, but in the meantime to limit the period of debate. It logically follows that, if we are going to limit the time of debate, we might as well simply give Independents, the minor parties and the coalition a global amount of time—in other words, formalise the system of a guillotine and say, `The Opposition has got three hours for this debate. We do not much care whether Opposition senators take an hour each to speak and there are three of them'—

         —It can count too. Professor Pearce has to do a great deal of work in a very short time. I understand that that is well under way. He has already spoken to quite a number of departmental officers. The draft terms of reference were given to him on Saturday morning with a large number of documents, I am told—several large boxes—relating to this issue. The reason for that was so that over the weekend Professor Pearce could read the paper, get across the paperwork, and determine whether in his view the terms of reference were appropriate to the inquiry—a perfectly reasonable thing to do, I would have thought. On Monday morning the secretary to the department contacted him and asked him for his view. Professor Pearce said that in his view the terms of reference were appropriate to the inquiry and he did not wish to make any amendments to them.

         I was given those draft terms of reference as well. I was told by Mr Evans that Professor Pearce did find them appropriate and did not want to make changes to them. I said that that was my view also and that they did not require amendment. I found it interesting to get the questions in the Senate estimates committee last night because I was referring to the terms of reference as the questions were being asked. I was not asked a single question on this central issue last night that was not covered by one of those terms of reference.

It claims that nearly all women have a horror story to tell about poor or patronising treatment they have received from banks or financial institutions, in particular from bank managers—most of whom are men. Over one-half of the 1,000 women from Australia and New Zealand who were surveyed believe that banks and financial institutions do not take them seriously. As Senator Giles said in her question, 82 per cent said that the attitudes to women in the financial area need to be improved. Worse than that, 46 per cent said that they had actually moved their financial business to another institution because of the bad service.

The report showed something that most women know: in most households women do the banking, pay the bills, buy the insurance and make very many of the household financial decisions. They also have a very strong influence on the financial decisions that their husbands or partners make.

         The report makes very good reading. It also contains some very simple and explicit instructions to people in the financial area—in particular, not to treat women as mental defectives; and that it is not a good idea, if you are talking to a woman about financial matters, to ask to speak to her husband. I sincerely hope that people in financial institutions will read the report and take it seriously because there is financial business out there to be done, provided the institutions are sensitive to the needs of women. Also, if they are serious about good business and they recognise that 46 per cent of women will move their business because of poor service, they might take heed.

         This is just another example of the important role played by CSIRO in helping develop innovative technology for our food exports. It shows that we do have the research and development capacity to enhance our export drive. We are hopeful that with this breakthrough and this development we can find other ways to use this technology to further enhance other food exports. Honourable senators opposite, who claim to represent rural constituents, will see the benefit for their constituents of enhancing exports. This is a very significant development and one that CSIRO should be proud of.

         The bureau report referred to by Senator Burns provides further confirmation that there have been major improvements in operating efficiency at our container ports. It concludes that, in some cases, Australian performance levels are approaching observed best practice in similar sized overseas ports. In grain and coal handling, it concludes that the operating efficiency in Australia of relevant ports now approaches or is at world best practice. It will be recalled that stevedoring reforms in grain handling were an important element in the Government's waterfront reforms.

         However, this level of improvement has not been uniform across all waterfront sectors. The bureau found that government and port authority charges in Australia were substantially higher than those observed for similar cargoes and ships overseas. This clearly emphasises, as I have been saying now for some three years, that there is scope for further efficiencies to be achieved in the port sector. Indeed, one of the major reasons why the changes were made in this portfolio, after discussions that I had with the Prime Minister last year, to incorporate all of the transport responsibilities under the control of one Minister, was to address this question of developing a cohesive and mutually supportive transport system for Australia where resources were not duplicated or wasted on alternative transport.

         It is interesting to see that the shadow Minister for transport is criticising the Government for not pursuing port reform with the States. He makes the extremely novel suggestion that the Government should progress these issues with the States in the ministerial forum of the Australian Transport Advisory Council.

         Already, reforms of port authorities have seen their work forces reduced by 35 per cent since 1989. However, again, these reforms have not been uniform across all ports, as indicated in the report. The Government's reforms have successfully created a more competitive and efficient stevedoring industry, with ongoing performance improvement and record low levels of industrial disputation. The focus is now moving more fully to the port authority sector and to improving the efficiency of the sea-land interface.

         The Minister for Justice has sought advice from the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in respect of this issue. As a consequence of that advice, I am advised that the AFP has in fact been monitoring Japanese organised crime trends and activities for a number of years. I am also advised that the AFP has an excellent working relationship with the Japanese national police. There is high level liaison between the two agencies and, in fact, the AFP's assistant commissioner for investigations recently visited Tokyo for further discussions with relevant Japanese authorities. This sort of liaison has enhanced the AFP's understanding of the level of the threat to Australia of Japanese organised crime.

         There has been some success achieved by agencies, particularly the AFP, in the monitoring of this issue.

         From the immigration perspective, AFP's close liaison with authorities has enhanced our immigration controls in this area.

The last time he entered Australia was January 1992, on the advice I have.

It comes before the Commonwealth Government, although it is in the custody of a New South Wales Government establishment, the Australian Museum, because of the Protection of Moveable Cultural Heritage Act.

Although no application has been received, because of the obvious and well-known significance of this particular fossil and the publicity surrounding it, which has drawn it to public attention, the department is already seeking advice from expert examiners appointed under the Act to ascertain whether they would be likely to recommend or refuse a permit, so that if any decision is made—because tenders for this sale close on Friday—we will be in a position to make a prompt decision in response to any application that might be made about the export of Eric.

         In the past couple of weeks I have had a case advanced to me that we are not spending enough on cardiovascular research and that it ought to be given a higher priority over other areas. When one talks to the experts in the field they mount convincing cases, as they do with breast cancer. The truth is that medical research in Australia needs to be upgraded overall. We simply do not spend enough on it. One of the promises that the Prime Minister made in the election campaign, which is of vital and fundamental importance, is the promise to increase the percentage of spending on research.

         The Government is very committed to providing emergency relief assistance as cash to these major non-government welfare organisations, precisely because that arrangement of government assistance and non-government agencies provides the very best care for people in financial or emergency need. I think it is a matter of celebration that the Government sees fit to support people in need through this emergency relief funding.

         The funding arrangements under those agreements will mean pretty significant benefits for patients and for public hospitals. The way in which the agreements work means that those States which reduce public access do suffer penalties under the agreement and those States that can do even better do gain access to bonuses. I am sure that some States will be trying very hard to do that. My meetings with the Tasmanian Government so far have been fairly positive in that respect.

Increased passenger movements in March 1993 compared with March 1992 were achieved at the following Queensland destinations: Cairns, an increase of 44 per cent; Proserpine, up 38 per cent; Townsville, up 33 per cent; Maroochydore, up 30 per cent; Mackay, up 17 per cent; Rockhampton, up 11 per cent; and Brisbane, up 11 per cent.

         Mr President, if I might be parochial for a minute, I note that the March 1993 results compared with the March 1992 results also indicated very encouraging growth at Yulara, with an increase in traffic of 37 per cent, and at Alice Springs, with an increase of 13 per cent. These results are a clear demonstration that the Government's decision to deregulate domestic aviation has been a major contributor to the development of the many holiday destinations in Australia and the economic benefits which continue to flow from the tourism industry. I might add, with some satisfaction, that it is a policy which has no added GST.

         That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to questions without notice asked by Senators Alston, O'Chee and Tambling this day, relating to the tendering process for subscription television licences.

         The answers given by Senator Collins today were a classic trifecta because he simply refused to answer each question he was asked. That goes a long way to explaining why every journalist who has examined this issue over the last two or three weeks has come to the unanimous conclusion that Senator Collins ought to go. They have reached that conclusion for the reason that he manifestly cannot handle the issues; he ducks and weaves; and, on almost every occasion, he says whatever suits him if he thinks it will get him off the hook. Today there were two instances in which Senator Collins made statements which were demonstrably untrue. In neither instance was he prepared to concede or to back down; he simply chose to tough it out. That is, I would have thought, a contempt of the Senate.

         It is worth examining the answers given by Senator Collins because there is probably some greater significance to the reason for his behaviour than simply sheer pig-headedness or stupidity. The first question that Senator Collins was asked today related to the statement contained in his letter to the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications dated 11 May. That is four days after he received the letter from the secretary dated 7 May. So the Minister's reply was not dashed off on the spur of the moment. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thank you for your letter of 7 May in which you provided draft terms of reference for the inquiry into the Pay Television tender process following your discussions with Professor Pearce.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the discussions with Professor Pearce must have occurred prior to 7 May. Yet today the Minister told the Senate that Professor Pearce was first briefed on this matter on the morning of 8 May. In other words, Professor Pearce played no part in the drafting of the terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That fact is also dealt with very specifically by the answer Senator Collins gave to a question asked by Senator McKiernan in Question Time the other day about how the terms of reference came to be determined. Senator Collins talked about the terms of reference being settled between the secretary to the department and Professor Pearce. `Settled', of course, is not the appropriate term. They were simply presented to Professor Pearce as a fait accompli. More importantly, if that is true, Senator Collins clearly got it wrong when he said, `I did not draw up these terms of reference, Professor Pearce did'.

         Senator Collins ought to acknowledge that that is clearly incorrect and at least have the grace to back down and apologise to the Senate for that statement. If he wants to say, for example, `Well, I said it in the heat of the moment. It was simply because of Senator Hill interjecting and I got it wrong. I did not really mean that. What I meant to say was that he was consulted or that he settled', that would be one thing. He was given the opportunity to say that today and he did not take it. Therefore, we are entitled to ask why it is that we have this obvious obtuseness on the part of the Minister to the point where he is deliberately trying to run an agenda.

         I think the answer is that he is trying to invest Professor Pearce with some high degree of involvement in the drafting of the terms of reference to create the impression that this is somehow objective, somehow above a grubby little exercise of trying to divert attention from his own manifest lack of responsibility. He is trying to suggest that somehow Professor Pearce is the one who ought to be given the credit for these terms of reference. That is outrageous. The Minister ought to apologise to Professor Pearce for using or misusing him twice in the way that he has, and he ought to apologise to the Senate and explain that the statements that he made and that are on the record simply cannot stand up.

         </emphasis>
         —and again Senator Collins did not take any opportunity to dispute it and merely confirmed it—that Professor Pearce was first approached on 8 May to head the pay TV inquiry. So how can it possibly be that the terms of reference drafted by the secretary on the seventh were, in any shape or form, discussed with Professor Pearce prior to their being provided to the Minister? One can look not only at that answer, but also at the Minister's clear determination to hide behind the coat-tails of the Federal Court and basically plead the last refuge of a failed law student, that is, that this matter is sub judice. Senator O'Chee made it clear that the evidence was proving beyond doubt that the only written advice provided and made available to Senator Collins was very much against the direction that he was moving in and the banning of the ABA from involvement in the process. He simply said to the court, `I did have other advice'. That other advice would seem to have been oral advice.

It is obvious to all concerned that the only advice he had in writing told him not to do what he was determined to do. The reality is that he was not particularly keen on doing it, anyway. It was only as a result of a severe bout of arm twisting from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that both he and his department were dragged screaming to his agenda. We can understand his reluctance, but to somehow suggest, as I presume he must, that he talked Mr Doherty out of his written opinion so that he got him to the point where he had positive oral advice in favour of the Minister's actions is a manifest absurdity. Therefore, we have those two examples of Senator Collins simply refusing to provide any coherent explanation.

         Senator Tambling can deal more precisely with the answer that he was given. The end result is that, after about two weeks, we still do not have a Minister prepared to accept responsibility, or to face up to the basic proposition, which is: why did the Minister not read that document before he signed it? Why is he engaged in this elaborate smokescreen of setting up a bureaucratic witch-hunt to divert attention from his own shortcomings? Why did he appear before the estimates committee until 3 a.m.—

         —Indeed; because he refused to answer any question on the basis that, somehow, his hand-picked inquiry into the activities of poor, hapless bureaucrats has precedence over the Senate. The fact is that the Senate estimates committee has absolute jurisdiction in the matter, as the Minister well knows. He conceded last night that there was nothing in law or convention that entitled him to do what he did. It was simply his preferred course of action. In other words, he was in political damage control mode. He was frantically determined to avoid responsibility to this Senate. He is wanting to put the matter off as long as possible, to hand it over to Professor Pearce as an objective outsider. From the very outset, the Minister has been trying to pretend that these terms of reference are Professor Pearce's, not his. It is about time he faced up to where true responsibility in the matter lies.

It is disgraceful that Senator Alston is getting down to this level. Professor Pearce is an acknowledged Australian expert on administrative law. He is dean of the law school at the ANU and a former Commonwealth ombudsman. Senator Alston has put forward this extraordinary proposition that because I wrote a letter—I will go through it again; honourable senators should listen to this—saying, `Thank you for your letter of the seventh', it was impossible for Professor Pearce to have seen it.

It is that issue to which I would like to refer. Yesterday when Senator Ferguson asked the question about what Senator Collins had read before he signed the documentation, Senator Collins made the statement that he always received a brief.

         coverage of this TV fiasco—TV row issue—that was given good electorate coverage by a journalist in an opinion piece, obviously very sympathetic to Senator Collins. It is obvious from the article, because of the direct quotes of Senator Collins, that he had a hand in preparing that article by Mr John Loizou. The first quote was:

        He did not tell us anything like that here in the last few days. But he has given it to a journalist to put into a Northern Territory newspaper. In the article Mr Loizou says:

        This is a matter of real, extreme and major concern to this chamber. Senator Collins is prepared to say one thing to his journalist mate in the Northern Territory and withhold the same information from this chamber. He ought to have been just as open and honest with us in here. Obviously, not only is he prepared to say those sorts of things differently and exercise his ministerial responsibility differently, but also, again, he tends to camouflage and hide behind his staff. In the quote that I just read, he referred to the checking by his communications adviser. Further on in the article Senator Collins is directly quoted as saying:

        Again, he does not have the fortitude, the intelligence or the strength to stand by his own decisions. He has put the onus back to his principal private secretary—to ensure that his staff has to hang around for this type of advice. This is very much a matter of the Minister passing the buck to others, as he continually seeks to do. Where is the doctrine of ministerial responsibility? He has obviously divorced himself from it. He continues to insult the intelligence of not only the Parliament and the media but also the electorate.

Clearly Professor Pearce needs to have his attention drawn to this material which so far has been available only to people in the Northern Territory. Therefore, I ask that Senator Tambling make every effort to see that Professor Pearce gets a copy of the material to which he has referred in his speech.

         —This debate is about decency. It is about the standards that are expected by the community of parliamentarians and the standards that parliamentarians expect of each other. Most importantly, the highest standards of all are the standards that the Parliament expects of the Ministry. That is what this debate is all about. It is about whether we have, in the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), a Minister who accepts that those standards must apply to him as they do to everybody else and whether he is willing to discharge his duty in relation to those standards.

         We have already seen that Senator Collins quite clearly does not believe that he has an obligation to answer to this chamber. He has set up an inquiry which has no standing under the rules of this Parliament or the conventions under which this Parliament runs. Yet every time he is asked a question here, in the chamber where he is expected to answer, his response is always, `Well, I've set up an inquiry so you shouldn't ask me about those things'. That is a grave slight on this Senate. It shows, first and foremost, that Senator Collins lacks the respect and the decency to recognise that it is here in this chamber, amongst his colleagues and the elected representatives of the people, that he must answer for his manifest failures. That is Senator Collins's first grave mistake.

         Secondly, we have a Minister who seems to have misled the Federal Court of Australia on two separate matters in sworn evidence. First, he told the Federal Court that he received legal advice from his department's senior legal adviser to the effect that he could rule out the MDS-pay TV option. Secondly, he told a judge of the Federal Court of Australia that he was doing it to preserve the intent of the legislation. When we read the legal advice that was provided to him by his department's senior legal adviser, what does it say?

If this chamber is to maintain any relevance or to uphold the principles on which good government in this country is based, Senator Collins must at least do the Senate the courtesy of maintaining in this place the same standards and code of behaviour that he seems to reserve for his electorate in the Northern Territory.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Panizza this day, relating to an Audit Office report on the use of Government credit cards by officers of the Australian Taxation Office.

        I briefly want to address the question that I asked Senator McMullan during Question Time, which involved the matter of the abuse of credit cards by officers of the Australian Taxation Office. I will read from Auditor-General's report No. 29 of 1992-93 entitled

         Aggregate and Departmental Financial Statements 1991-92

         Within the group of the one million unemployed around Australia there are very many unfortunate people who have had many social pressures on them after they or their spouses have lost their jobs. There have been various instances around Australia of social security fraud, entailing only amounts of a few hundred dollars or less in some cases, that have come to the notice of the social security department. People have certainly been fined, and in the bigger cases gaoled, for that offence, which is the very same offence that has been committed in this case.

         Do not tell me that there are no cultural and social pressures on people who cannot find a job or who have lost their jobs. Yet here we have well-paid officers of the Australian Taxation Office blaming social and cultural pressures. I can understand an officer paying $12-odd for a box of chocolates for someone, but I cannot see that riding lessons or dancing lessons are not a personal gain. If one gains knowledge, that is a personal gain. Whether or not one can ride a horse or dance has little to do with how to operate the tax office, so it must be a personal gain.

        These unfortunate people around Australia who have had to resort to a bit of petty thieving because of the position they are in and because of the impositions of the social security department have found no such sympathy.

        I wish Senator Walsh were in the chamber. Going back over the last 10 years, when he was Minister for Finance he pointed out the abuse of the free lunches, the free trips, the free accommodation that seemed to be available to the high-fliers of the business community in the roaring 198Os. As a Minister, through the Parliament and through his department, he put an end to those practices. But today the taxation office, which demands the highest standard of honesty of everyone in Australia, cannot apply that to itself.

         I could go on and deal with other things, such as the lack of substantiation. For instance, there was a certain amount of property bought for which there were no original invoices. What happens when we file a tax return? We have self-assessment these days, which means that substantiation must be available if one is audited, and there are a few audits around. The tax office does not listen to excuses, so why should this Minister listen to these sorts of excuses from the tax office? The report goes on:

        Is that opportunity offered to some poor housewife who has been picked up for the petty thieving of a $3.50 lipstick when she goes to court? Sometimes the magistrate takes social pressures into consideration and dismisses the charges against these people as first offenders. But here we have officers of the Australian Taxation Office, who expect the highest standard of honesty from taxpayers, who are not willing to apply that standard to themselves. That is a total disgrace. I believe that in this case the Minister for Finance has an obligation to come clean about what has been going on, to have a thorough investigation of what happened, and to report back to Parliament on actions he has taken in relation to wrongdoers in the ATO.

        </emphasis>
        of last weekend reported that one of the most powerful crime bosses in the world had purchased for $800,000 a unit on the Gold Coast. The person referred to was Mr Masaru Takumi, who is the second-in-charge of Japan's largest organised crime group, the Yamaguchi-Gumi. That Yakuza gang, the Yamaguchi-Gumi, is said to have 37,200 members. It rakes in more than $8 billion a year, mainly from extortion, prostitution, drugs, gambling, money laundering, protection rackets and fraud. Mr Takumi is not unknown in Australia. It is reported that he has visited Queensland five times—twice in 1987, twice in 1988 and once last year.

         This matter was brought to the Senate initially by my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff, Mrs Sullivan, whose electorate encompasses the Gold Coast, where the purchase took place. She asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a question about this on Monday of this week and made a very interesting and important speech on the matter in debate in the House of Representatives on Monday night. I refer the Senate to that important speech by Mrs Sullivan, which appears on page 477 of Monday's

         . I will not go into all the details and repeat the facts she outlined there, but she raised the question: how is it that a person such as Mr Takumi, one of the known crime bosses of the world, can apparently visit Australia at will and outlay hundreds of thousands of dollars on purchasing residential property in Australia? In the answer Senator Bolkus gave today to Senator Jones about this matter—and I thank the Minister for his answer—he raised more questions than he answered.

         Senator Bolkus talked about the fact that for years now the Australian Federal Police has been monitoring the entry into Australia of organised criminals and organised crime—including from Japan but from many other countries as well. He said that the AFP has a good link and liaison with the Japanese police and that, as a result of that, in 1991 some of the members of these crime gangs were identified and deported.

         In relation to the person at issue in my comments today, Mr Takumi—although my comments do have wider application—Senator Bolkus said that Mr Takumi was entering Australia on a multiple visa which had been issued before he had a criminal record. That is a very interesting point. One does not get to be No. 2 boss of pretty well the largest criminal organisation in the world overnight. Obviously that is a situation that has built up over a period of time.

         I am told that until recently people in Japan who had been convicted of criminal activities and had served their term had their conviction expunged from the public record. Once they had done their time, there was no further record of it. To talk about criminal records of Japanese individuals can therefore be misleading, as Mrs Sullivan pointed out earlier in the week, because there may be information beyond that which now appears on the public record.

         I hope that Minister Bolkus will give the Parliament more information about this matter because the present situation raises more questions than those he answered today. For example, what sort of multiple visa does Mr Takumi hold? Is it a tourist visa? Is it a visitors visa? Is it a business visa? If it is a business visa, given that his past activities are now known to the authorities in Australia, including the AFP, what sort of business is he carrying on? Above all else, why is it that that visa has not been cancelled, and was not cancelled when his activities and his criminal background were first discovered? That must be some time ago, given his very senior role in the crime organisation of which he is No. 2 at the moment.

         There are a lot of questions in this connection regarding immigration that need to be answered in this matter. I will not go into them in any further detail at this stage. I hope the Minister will respond at an appropriate—and very early—time because it is a matter of urgency. We know now about Mr Takumi, but how many other Mr Takumis are out there doing the same thing, entering Australia seemingly at will? What is the scope now for organised crime from other countries to enter Australia seemingly unhindered?

         The other issue that I find quite staggering is how a person with that record is allowed to purchase residential property in Australia when under our administration and policy all applications for the purchase of residential property are required to go to and be vetted by the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is the relationship between the AFP's knowledge of matters and criminals such as these and the Foreign Investment Review Board? What is the knowledge of the immigration department about these persons? Is there any arrangement whereby the Foreign Investment Review Board automatically checks out these people, at least in a standardised way, with our law enforcement and other agencies?

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Vanstone this day, relating to a High Court judgment and alleged bias against women by the judiciary.

        Senator Crowley was asked what view her Government had with respect to the outcome in Longman's case and whether her Government was happy or unhappy with the degree to which it was being followed or not followed. Ordinarily one would not expect any honourable senator in this chamber to be full bottle on every case in the community; it simply would not be possible. But that is not the situation Senator Crowley found herself in.

         As I recall, Senator Crowley first raised the matter of gender bias in the judiciary in October of last year in this place. She did so by quite specifically raising some remarks made by a South Australian Supreme Court judge, Justice Bollen. Clearly she was unhappy with those remarks, she believed that they were inappropriate and that something should be done about it. Nothing was done about it for a while. As I understand it, it was in January sometime that the Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia referred certain matters within Justice Bollen's summing-up to the Full Court of the Supreme Court for a ruling. Justice Bollen, in effect, lost on each of those matters.

         Senator Crowley then made some remarks about gender bias in the law and she has made remarks since then in this place, and on radio here, there and everywhere, before, during and after the election. So on that subject we would expect her to know something, especially since she and her Government purport to have thought about this matter seriously enough to come up with what they say is the best way of alleviating this problem.

         The suggestion the Government has come up with is some funding to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for that institute to develop some gender bias curricula and to offer courses on a voluntary basis to the judiciary. So some attention has been given to this matter. One would expect, therefore, that not only the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, who has had so much to say about this matter, but the Government—the Public Service, for example—would be familiar with what the High Court says judges can and cannot say when summing up in sexual offence matters.

         This development in the law is not something new; it is not something that happened last year. Senator Crowley was not caught on the hop by something that happened in December or February and she did not know about it. This High Court case was decided in 1989. Anyone who was seriously interested in the substance of the matter—that is, gender bias reflected in judicial remarks—would have been looking at the extent to which that case was being followed or not followed.

         Quite clearly, when I asked Senator Crowley about Longman's case I might as well have asked her whether she knew how to walk to the moon in a day. She did not have a clue; she did not have even the vaguest idea about the subject matter. Worse still, when a supplementary question was asked to give her a hint about the subject matter, she still did not have any idea what the High Court might or might not have said about those things.

         We have a Minister coming into this place and making remarks about the adequacy or otherwise of what judges say and about what judges ought to learn and ought not learn. However, she clearly has not even bothered to make any assessment about what judges can and cannot say in these matters. She has not given the slightest bit of attention to the question of whether the High Court decision on this matter is being followed by the lower courts. My understanding is that an unfortunately large proportion of the judiciary takes no notice, or insufficient notice, of Longman's case, and that is the problem.

         As Senator Crowley is not here, for the benefit of other senators who may be interested in this matter let me take up a few more minutes to outline what the High Court has said about this matter, because it is a serious problem affecting a large number of people in the community. To the extent that there is a perception of gender bias in the judiciary, it is a problem for all of us. It is something we should all be interested in and watch as the problem slowly but surely is eradicated. The High Court has said that in a number of States it used to be, and it still is in some States—

In a number of States it used to be the case, and it still is in some States, that a judge in summing up a case involving a victim of a sexual offence was required to warn the jury of the dangers of relying on the alleged victim's uncorroborated evidence. For years and years, alleged victims of sexual offences thought the need to have their evidence corroborated more than that of anyone else was a bit rough. The picture generated by this rule basically was that one could not trust women who make allegations that a sexual offence has been perpetrated against them.

         Some States have had the foresight to change the situation and say that they no longer regard victims of sexual offences as being so unreliable that a warning must be given about them. Why is a warning not given in the case of the evidence of a victim of a bank robbery, if that witness happened to be the only person behind the counter? Why is a warning not given about such evidence? Why is not a warning given about everyone else who gives uncorroborated evidence? Why are victims of sexual offences treated differently from victims who give uncorroborated evidence in other cases involving only two people?

         South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have changed that requirement, and I am grateful that they have done so. They now say that if a judge thinks it is appropriate to warn about a particular witness and the particular circumstances of a particular case, the judge is obviously free to do so. But, in effect, they have taken away the requirement to warn. So in those States judges do not have to give a warning about the need for corroboration of the evidence of alleged victims of sexual offences—and that is a good thing—but they are free to do so if they believe that that is appropriate.

         In deference to my colleague Senator Crowley, something should be said about the remarks that have just been made. We are dealing here with a sensitive and important issue in terms of Australian justice and in terms of the perception of gender bias in Australian courts. In the most recent speech we have heard on this subject, an aura of principle was used to cloak a snide political point. Senator Crowley was asked a particular narrow, technical question to which she did not respond. From that point on the issue was raised in order to get a horse laugh from the Opposition, and perhaps the wider community, at Senator Crowley's expense.

         This is a serious issue and not one that we ought to be exploiting for the purposes of what gallery tittle-tattle we can generate. I remember just recently a Victorian judge said in a sexual offence trial that when women say no they often mean yes which, taken in the broader context, is approval to proceed in circumstances of sexual harassment. In a recent South Australian case, a judge opined that it was permissible to hand out a bit of rough treatment in the matrimonial arrangement between a husband and a wife. These are just a couple of notorious examples in the public debate of where the judiciary has expressed views well and truly out of step with what is reasonable, fair and objective—views that have a tone of misogynism about them and views which ought to be taken as entirely inappropriate for people on a bench making judicial judgments about human conduct on matters sexual.

The effort of the Opposition is to undermine the best intentions and good efforts of the Minster—who in this case is Senator Crowley, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women—to try to change a misogynist perception in some of the judiciary in Australia, so that women who are victims of sexual offences and have those sexual offences before the courts can be properly treated.

That has nothing at all to do with whether we all agree that something ought to be done. It was simply a test as to the Government's competence, which the Minister failed.

         —I wish to speak only for a brief moment on this motion to take note of an answer given by Senator Crowley. I do not want to undermine in any sense the gravity of the issue which has been raised by Senator Vanstone. Indeed, following Justice Bollen's remarks in the South Australian court, one of my South Australian colleagues, Ms Sandra Kanck, collected many thousands of signatures on a petition which, incidentally, I understand the Government of South Australia refused to accept on a very narrow technicality.

         I want to raise one slight technical point, because I am sure this debate will arise again, and that is the use of the word `sex' and the use of the word `gender'. I looked at these words in the dictionary and found that gender is appropriately applied to words. It is not well developed in English, but in German `der, die, das' is gender. I would be showing gender bias, for instance, if I described Senator Vanstone as `der frau' rather than `die frau'. Gender is not appropriately applied to Senator Vanstone as a woman; she is of the female sex, not of the female gender. I just wonder, if that dictionary definition is correct, whether we might use the words `sexual bias' rather than `gender bias'.

        In this report the Higher Education Council looks at the funding principles for the 1993-95 triennium and the funds allocated to higher education institutions. Before I comment on this document, I want to point out to the Senate the disgraceful situation we have today where, under government documents, we have 10 documents on education presented in one day. We have 30 minutes to discuss these documents. If I wanted to speak on each of those education documents, it would take me 50 minutes, and there are only 30. That would not provide any time for anyone to speak on this or any other matter.

We have already had today examples of the Government trying to restrict the powers of the Senate by a number of changes it is proposing to the Standing Orders and procedures of this Senate to allow less scrutiny. We had the case last night of Minister Collins making a joke of the procedures of estimates. He not only did not allow the questions through to the department; he also took the questions and then refused to answer them for three hours, claiming that there was another committee looking into it. That really took away our time and our role of scrutiny. It brings the work of this Parliament into disrepute if this sort of thing continues to happen. This again is another example—

The Higher Education Council has pointed out that the channels by which students may enter higher education are changing rapidly. In particular, credit transfer arrangements are being improved. However, it is pointless for institutions to develop extensive transfer arrangements only to find that there are not sufficient places because of overcrowding. The Prime Minister's engineered recession has forced the higher education sector to hide more than 30 per cent of the unemployed youth in our higher education institutions. This is making entry to universities through other methods, such as credit transfer, very difficult. The report points out that there has been a shift from undergraduate to postgraduate studies. This is causing concern because of the reduction in opportunities for school leavers and other commencing students.

         The Higher Education Council also looks in this report at the growth of open learning programs. The council notes that the Government has announced that fees for students enrolled in programs are broadly compatible with higher education contribution charges that would apply to the same studies on campus. At this point the council fails to point out that the federal funding for the open learning program ceases after three years and that the open learning program is supposed to be self-sufficient. The Government is, therefore, proposing that the open learning program can be provided at a cost per student equivalent to the HECS charges. This is clearly absurd, and it is an issue which the Government urgently needs to address. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        The report by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on the Australian Research Council's evaluation program in relation to grants for ecological research is an important one because increasingly people are recognising the importance of ecological research if we are really going to be effective in moving towards a pattern of ecologically sustainable development. The report notes that Australian ecologists are at the centre stage of world research and that in this country's universities we have many people of very high repute doing absolutely excellent work.

         However, the level of support which is given to those people and, indeed, to much scientific research in Australia is totally inadequate. The report notes that only 20 per cent of applicants for ARC grants were successful and some 80 per cent of grant applicants failed to get grants. While some of those grant applications may have been of poor quality, undoubtedly among that 80 per cent would have been many applicants of quite high quality who would have failed to get a grant because the amount of government support is totally inadequate. Indeed, under `Principal Findings', the committee also reports that its members were puzzled by apparently arbitrary and sizeable cuts in seemingly reasonable requests. It may well be that in many of those requests the arbitrary cuts meant that the work was inadequately performed.

         The report also says that, by comparison with equivalent Canadian, British and American funding bodies, the ARC funding for top ecological research would have to be regarded as niggardly. So while Australia, at least in terms of rhetoric, has taken some lead in relation to ecologically sustainable development, the research which is necessary to underpin that move and which will have to be extended over the next several decades is, according to this report, niggardly.

         The report also goes on to note that the great majority of successful applicants expressed dissatisfaction with the level of funding. So while the work which was being done within that 20 per cent was of high quality, nonetheless those people felt constrained by the shortage of funds. They also felt very constrained by the need to supplement their niggardly funds from government sources with additional funds from private sources. This bears on a matter which I raised with Senator Button some time ago by way of a question in relation to the requirement for CSIRO to obtain 30 per cent of its funds from private sources. Senators may recall that the substance of my question was how much time was spent by researchers applying for, and writing reports in relation to, grants.

         Senator Button pointed out that some 20 to 25 per cent of scientists' time was now being spent on applying for and reporting back to grantors on grants. In his answer to my question he said that he thought that was a good thing because it helped to set the direction of the research. While that may be true—it may be advantageous with respect to some research in the narrow industrial area—I believe that in the ecological area it is extremely dangerous because much of what ecologists will be researching is likely to be seen initially as inimical to the interests of industry. Under these circumstances they will find it even harder to get money from private sources. Indeed, that is referred to in this report. Given that circumstance, the type of research which they can take on board, the more fundamental type of research, the research which perhaps is going to be critical of some aspects of industry, is not likely to attract funding. The work of ecologists will be even further inhibited.

         That matter was raised yesterday by Professor Ian Lowe in a lecture at CSIRO. I believe there is a great deal of concern throughout the scientific community about the direction which this Government has taken with respect to that requirement for private funding for ecological research as well as research of a more general nature.

          On 19 January 1993, Mr Richard Lippiatt wrote to the Committee of Privileges enclosing a final submission under resolution 5 of the privilege resolutions of 25 February 1988 which refers to remarks made by Senator Bell in the Senate during the adjournment debates on 3 June and 13 October 1992. Mr Lippiatt had initially written to the committee concerning remarks made on 3 June and, with the concurrence of the President of the Senate, the committee decided to treat that correspondence as a submission under resolution 5, and agreed to consider it. Having had further correspondence and consultation with Mr Lippiatt, the committee recommends that a response agreed to by Mr Lippiatt and the committee be incorporated in

        In general, employees accrue leave entitlements based only on the period of employment with their current employer. However, in some industries, such as the waterfront industry, employees are likely to change employers so often that they could never take leave, but rather would be paid out the value of leave entitlements each time they transfer to a different employer.

        In those industries, leave entitlements under the terms of an industrial agreement or award may be based on total service with a number of employers.

        The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 proposes amendment to a provision of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 which is a small but significant feature of the compulsory income contribution regime provided for in the Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bankruptcy Act enables a trustee to make an assessment of the income a bankrupt is likely to derive during the period of bankruptcy and where the income is assessed as being above a specified threshold, the bankrupt is liable to make contributions from his or her income of 50 cents in each dollar above that threshold. Section 139ZG of the Act enables a trustee to file a certificate in a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of amounts of contribution which a bankrupt has refused or failed to pay. The Act provides that such a certificate operates and is enforceable as if it were a final judgment of the Court in which it is filed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are proceedings currently on foot in the High Court of Australia which challenge the validity of subsections 139ZG(3), (4) and (5) on the basis that because a bankruptcy trustee's certificate is given the status of a judgment of the court in which it is filed, the provisions enable a person who is not a judge or holder of other judicial office to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, contrary to Chapter III of the Constitution. The Government has been advised that there is a significant likelihood of the provisions being declared to be invalid. The case is scheduled for hearing before the Court on 7 June 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is concerned that there should be adequate means of enforcing the obligations of bankrupts to make contributions from income to their estates. This Bill proposes the substitution of the impugned procedure with new provisions which give the trustee a right to take action in the courts against a bankrupt who has refused or failed to pay income contributions to the estate. The trustee will be able to file a certificate in relation to any proceedings for the recovery of such debts stating the nature of the debt and the amount owed, and the certificate will be prima facie evidence of those matters. The Government has been advised that the revised provisions could not be considered to trespass upon the judicial power of the Commonwealth, since the trustee will be required to initiate court proceedings to recover amounts of unpaid income contribution from a bankrupt.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government moved decisively in 1991 to tighten up bankruptcy law in response to community concern that certain high flying bankrupts were avoiding their responsibilities to creditors. This was done by introducing a compulsory income contribution regime specifically designed to prevent persons from diverting income at source to associated entities and putting it beyond the reach of creditors. The present High Court challenge was initiated by one of the persons whose activities gave rise to the community concern to which I have referred. The Government is determined that the integrity of the important reforms it has made in the bankruptcy area be maintained, and it brings forward this Bill in order to achieve this.

I believe the industry has made some commendable improvements and I expect it will continue to adapt, compete successfully and bring much needed export earnings to Australia.

        To further encourage progress and development in the Australian industry the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy introduced a new dairy plan from 1 July 1992. The plan set the direction for the industry until the year 2000. A key element of this approach was the establishment of the Dairy Marketing Review Task Force. The Task Force has been charged with the responsibility of developing an industry-driven strategy aimed at redirecting the industry's effort to further enhance the export marketing and development of dairy products.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy received the Task Force's interim report at the end of last year and the final report should be submitted in the near future. The Task Force has consulted widely with dairy manufacturers and exporters to ensure that the Review recommendations will be realistic and achievable. I am confident that the Task Force will identify a forward looking and progressive marketing strategy, giving due consideration to the structure of the industry, which will lead the industry through the remainder of this decade and into the next century.

        When the Review is completed, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will evaluate its recommendations carefully. I can assure this House that the Government, in close consultation with industry, will make use of the Review's findings and continue to guide the dairy industry toward improved marketing capacity, profitability and long term growth.

        Mr President, as I have said, the primary purpose of these amendments is to improve the Corporation's financial operations in relation to banking and foreign exchange. The effect of these amendments is that the Corporation should not be inhibited from normal commercial dealings with the banks. Removing the impediments which have been identified will result in reduced costs for both the Corporation and the industry.

        The amendments specifically empower the Corporation to undertake futures dealings with banks. The Corporation's futures trading will be limited to hedging. These powers are similar to those previously given to other marketing authorities such as the Wool Realisation Commission.

        The amendments will remove uncertainty concerning the ability of the Corporation to secure exchange rates and cover the financial risks involved in international trade.

This trade is expected to amount to over $100 million this financial year.

        Another important amendment will improve existing banking arrangements. The Corporation can now consolidate funds and avoid banking charges and management expenses associated with separate accounts. The savings resulting from this change are estimated to total $40 000 in a year.

        —It has been an interesting debate on the question of how long speeches during second reading debates should take. I have listened to the entreaties of the members of the Opposition who, throughout this debate, have said that I, for one, speak at far too great a length in the Senate chamber. I have really taken that on board and I do not intend to prolong the agony on this issue this afternoon.

        I will make a couple of points relating to this matter. I believe that when this sessional order was introduced at the end of last session it worked well and most senators would agree that it worked well. I think it is true to say that the most effective speeches made in this chamber are ones like the one I am making at the moment—ones that are of 20 minutes duration or less. There is no doubt that if senators cannot say what they want to say in 20 minutes, it is probably not worth saying.

        I believe that the sessional order that was introduced at the end of the last session did save a significant amount of time. It is important to point out that there are ample opportunities for senators to make their points. Every senator has the opportunity of making a half-hour adjournment speech every sitting day. I think we are all fairly thankful that many senators do not avail themselves of that opportunity. But the key point is that the opportunity does exist. The opportunity for senators to make speeches of 15 minutes duration on the many Bills that create controversy is available on countless occasions in the committee stage. I think it is worth reinforcing that point with senators—perhaps with those Independent senators who may not have made up their minds on this issue.

        It is true that, historically, speeches have been longer in the Senate than in the House of Representatives, but that is now changing because the nature and role of the Senate is changing. The Senate is no longer the club for retired old gentlemen which meant that one could get away with making a speech for an hour or so. There are a great deal more pressures on individual senators, the Senate and the Government in terms of its legislative program.

The reality is that it is very sensible—and most organisations and houses of parliament do this—to put the procedural framework in place first. We have come back after an election, we are putting in place the procedural framework within which the Senate will work and after that we will be debating our legislative program within that framework. I believe that is an eminently logical way for us to deal with these issues and it is certainly in the proper order.

        It is not a question, as many Opposition senators have said, of the powers of the Senate. This motion relates to the length of speeches given in this chamber.

We had a long discourse from one senator about the role of the estimates committees, and so it goes on. This motion relates to the length of speeches and not to the powers of the Senate.

        I believe that a 20-minute time limit on speeches made at the second reading stage will force senators to concentrate their minds on the matters before the Senate and will inevitably result in a higher quality of debate in this chamber. The time limit will impose greater self-discipline on senators and I think that is worth while. It will discourage senators from rambling on about irrelevant issues which do not address the key issues of principle that are before the chamber in any piece of government legislation.

        What is the essential difference between speaking for 20 minutes and speaking for 30 minutes? What is so vital and so compelling to the Government that it wants to reduce the speaking time of senators by 10 minutes? We have been debating this matter since quite early this morning; it has been running for several hours, but the savings which are intended by reducing the speaking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes are but some minutes a session.

        I refer to the number of senators who have spoken for longer than 20 minutes over the last three years. For instance, in the fortnight between 1 May and 17 May, there were only three senators who spoke for longer than 20 minutes and only four senators who spoke for longer than 25 minutes. For that fortnight, the difference between being able to speak for 20 minutes and 30 minutes meant there was an additional 50 minutes of debate.

        When speeches have continued for more than 20 minutes, invariably they have related to appropriations, special issues, relevant issues of particular interest to individuals and to big issues. In the 1990 Budget session, in the fortnight from 1 September to 11 September, one speaker spoke for between 20 and 25 minutes and there were but five speakers who spoke for between 26 and 30 minutes. If speeches had been limited to 20 minutes duration, there would have been a saving of 35 minutes for the fortnight. In the following sitting fortnight from 2 November to 6 November, again, just a handful of speakers spoke for longer than 20 minutes. If this measure is introduced, the time savings in any one session of Parliament will be probably, at the very most, an hour. Yet that is a crucial hour for those who believe they have a vital contribution to make on a particular issue.

        There was talk this morning about the difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate. I make the point that the Senate is now the only chamber where the Parliament has a say. While the constitutional debates disclose that the founding fathers anticipated the formation of a two-party system, there is no evidence that they anticipated that we would have only two parties and that any one party would have a majority by itself in the House of Representatives. That now being the case, the House of Representatives is no more than the executive chamber of government. There is no legislation that can be impeded; there is no process that can impede the intentions of the government if the government so chooses. That has had the effect of abolishing the House of Representatives as a chamber of scrutiny of the government. It is simply a mechanical process used, and required to be used under the Constitution, in conformity with its own standing orders for the formal passing of legislation so as to end up ultimately with the enactment of laws. It was never intended that the Senate be in the same situation.

        The founding fathers had anticipated that the Senate would be the States house. We know that it is not such a house in the sense that it used to be. But in a referendum, notwithstanding that it was a referendum supported by both major parties, the public rejected the breaking of the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The purpose of equal representation was to ensure that each State had equal representation. It was designed and intended that the Senate not be a chamber of executive government. It was set up in such a way as to ensure proper and adequate scrutiny of the actions and activity of the executive government. There was, and there still remains, concern to ensure that the Senate is a house of check and balance on the government, a house of review, a house of second consideration, and a house of contemplation and further deliberation.

        The very Constitution and standing orders which led to the creation and ultimately to the running of the Senate are premised on the basis that the Senate would not be a house of executive government but a house of review. It is because of the very nature, character and style of the Senate Standing Orders that the late Lionel Murphy was able to stimulate and breathe life into the committee system, which provides a very proper scrutiny of government legislation. One does not need to reflect upon the contribution the committee system of the Senate has made in refining, improving or ultimately rejecting legislation. One does not have to reflect upon the role the Senate committees have made in terms of scrutiny of government legislation and government conduct, and ultimately government accountability.

        By controlling both chambers of the Parliament, the Government to all intents and purposes is able to bypass the parliamentary process in scrutinising legislation. When the coalition last controlled the Senate to the extent that it had more than half the required numbers to succeed in any one division, as I remember at that stage, the time allowed for Question Time was unlimited. I think it was Lionel Murphy who put a time limit on it. Initially, as I recall, we had unlimited time available for speeches and they were restricted to an hour. We had lengthy, robust, articulate and investigative Committee of the Whole debates.

        Therefore, I believe a heavy responsibility rests upon the Government to ensure that it preserves the character and the nature of the Senate to enable it to scrutinise carefully the activities and the conduct of government. To swipe at and wipe that away, in my view, is to abolish any form of accountability. No government ought to fear scrutiny by the Senate. It ought be encouraged. It ought not be seen as a threat to the program of government. This debate ought not to be a debate, on the one side, of scrutiny of government legislation and, on the other, the developing of a process to ensure that legislation goes through in spite of the fact that there is not proper scrutiny. It is vital that the integrity of the Senate is preserved in the same way as we preserve the judiciary in an independent form—and hopefully in the same way that we also have independent media and an impartial and competent Public Service.

It was a great disappointment to me last night as a member of an estimates committee to have Senator Collins tell us not once, not thrice, but numerous times that he did not see a need to be accountable to the estimates committee. In his view, the setting up, by his decree, of an investigation or an inquiry into the conduct of his department supplanted the functioning, the role and the responsibilities of the Senate. He was asked a question today by a member of the coalition and he declined to answer. He said, `You will find that out from my inquiry'.

        In the same way, we have seen the gutting of the Committee of the Whole to the point where, while the Estimates play a role, we no longer have the focus of examination of legislation in this chamber. Bills are now put off to the side where Ministers conduct themselves in a way quite different from the way they do in the chamber, and in a quite different atmosphere. Last night, hour after hour the Minister was able to refuse to answer any single question in a way which he would not be able to do if he were in this chamber because he knows he has the media present, he knows the proceedings are being broadcast and he knows that those people in Australia who care enough to worry about the conduct of the chamber are examining his response and his conduct. He knows that in the Committee of the Whole he would not be able to answer in the way he did last night. So the answer is to gut the Committee of the Whole.

        Perhaps that attitude is reflected in the level of attendance in this chamber by Labor senators. As we see almost every single day that the Parliament is sitting, members of the Government do not bother to come in. The same thing is true of the House of Representatives, but it is particularly sad to see it in the Senate. The reason they do not bother to come in is that the Government has made a judgment that they are not to speak on issues. So they are taken off the speakers list and there is no point in being here. Their contribution to the Parliament is simply to come in here at Question Time and cheer the front row along and to come here for divisions and quorums. Beyond that, the organ and the activity of the Government in terms of making a contribution to debate in the Parliament have now all but thoroughly disappeared.

        We all know that if the Government makes a judgment that the arguments being presented by a senator are irrelevant, the Standing Orders accommodate that situation. Further, if the Government believes that a senator presenting a debate ought to be prevented from continuing, there is a simple mechanism in the Standing Orders which requires no more than for the Government Minister on duty to stand and move that the senator no longer be heard. In effect, that mechanism is a standing guillotine. But the Government is reluctant, as were we when in government, to introduce the guillotines or the gags because it knows it is an undesirable course; it knows it is not well received by the public and that it will be under scrutiny if it conducts itself that way. So, by surreptitious means, it introduces a process whereby, in effect, it has a permanent guillotine in place.

That might have been boring, pedestrian and irrelevant to others, but as long as I feel that I have a point of view to put and an argument to present I ought not to be gagged by the Government because it believes it has a program it has to put through and the most expeditious way of doing that is to prevent senators from the other side—whether they be the Democrats, the Independents or the coalition—from representing their constituents, their party and their point of view.

        I wish to foreshadow a further amendment and to indicate that we propose to refer this matter back to the Procedure Committee so it can examine the questions I have raised. I say to those who bothered to listen to this debate with an open mind that, if they examine the time taken to debate matters during 1990, 1991 and 1992, they will find that the savings are minimal. On a sample annual basis, in 1990, 71 per cent of the speakers spoke for 20 minutes or less. That is 228 speakers. In 1991, 72 per cent of the speakers spoke for less than 20 minutes and in 1992, 81 per cent of the speakers spoke for less than 20 minutes. Perhaps we are becoming less verbose, less articulate or less intellectually rigorous. But 81 per cent of the senators who spoke in 1992 spoke for less than 20 minutes. Based on samples, the average percentage of speakers who spoke for less than 20 minutes in the 36th Parliament was 75 per cent. So I put it to the Senate that the savings are minimal.

        I conclude by saying that, if we calculated the time taken for this debate and aggregated it over the life of this Parliament, we would find that we consumed more time debating this matter today than we will for the life of this Parliament. Yet we are being gagged because of the Government's notion that it has to prevent the Opposition from presenting the arguments in the way it would wish to. I hope the Democrats, the Independents and the Greens cast this proposal aside.

        —by leave—I wish to foreshadow two further amendments. I do not want to take the time of the Senate to debate them at any length, other than to explain what they are in due course. Like Senator Crichton-Browne, I think I was engaged in other business when this debate was suddenly called on. The first amendment, in the event that the others are unsuccessful, would provide that this extra restraint on speaking times would not apply to debate on any annual appropriation or supply Bill because of the critical nature of funding Bills.

        The other amendment would provide that, in the light of the Government and the Democrats agreeing to further restrict debate in this chamber through the principal amendment, time taken to determine points of order would be taken out of the more limited 20 minutes for debate, as would time taken for a quorum. At the appropriate time, if necessary, I will move these amendments.

        —by leave—Yes, I propose—I am not foreshadowing an amendment—that we refer the matter back to the Procedure Committee, not for the purpose of frustrating the intention of the Government but simply to have it further examined to see whether this is the most effective and beneficial way of saving time. If we examine how much time will be saved, it really is a nonsense. Perhaps there are other more effective ways whereby we can all cooperate to ensure that legislation passes through in a way which is efficient.

        —When I spoke earlier today on the subject of time limits on speeches in second reading debates, I referred to the speeches Senator Reg Wright and Senator John Wheeldon used to make. They would fill the Senate chamber in the old Parliament House because their speeches were so good. I commented that people who heard them on radio would come in to listen to the points they were making. I see that Senator Crowley was clever enough to pick up that comment and say, `Oh, yes, they would come in from miles around'. Senator Crowley was not here then, but in those days we did not have television. We used to listen to parliamentary broadcasts in our rooms, where we could listen to either the House of Representatives or the Senate. That is what I meant.

        I did not mean the public radio broadcast of their speeches, so that people would come in from Queanbeyan, Yass or somewhere else to listen to their speeches. I meant that parliamentarians who were listening to the Senate being broadcast on the parliamentary broadcast system in our offices would hear the broadcast, and the speeches were so good that they would come into the chamber to listen to those senators and others, who were really first class in those days. What a pity it is that senators of today are not up to that sort of standard.

Senator MacGibbon interjected, `Yes, and those extra perks involved additional staff'. I would like to put on the record that, as a Democrat senator, I have three staff, the same as every other senator. I am not aware that I get any additional perks in that respect whatsoever. I would like Senator MacGibbon and Senator Macdonald to provide objective evidence that there is any distinction made between the Democrats and the Opposition with respect to that matter. Secondly, we voted the way we did on the last matter because we believed we were voting for the right cause, not because there were any perks involved in it whatsoever.

        The second matter on which I claim to have been seriously misrepresented is the claim by Senator Walters that I had said that the debate did not matter, it was only a matter of numbers. Senator Walters clearly did not understand the point I was making, which was also made by members of her own side during that debate. My point was that if the position in the Senate were such that any party had the ability to ram through decisions on numbers alone, we would not get into a debate.

        The threshold issue is that this Senate works as a debating chamber simply because the numbers are so distributed that debates are forced. If the Opposition does not understand that that is the threshold issue—that is why the Senate is a successful house of review—then heaven help us. Having established the question of numbers, then of course the question of the debates is vitally important. That was exactly the point I was making—that numbers determine whether the Senate is a debating chamber and does not behave in the same way as the House of Representatives.

        This proposal relates to reducing the number of standing committees from nine to seven. I am going to be absolutely honest—and I think many senators know that this is the situation—and lay the politics out before them. This proposal was not the Government's preferred option in relation to the standing committees. The Opposition and the Democrats know that at one stage we tried hard to see whether the existing Standing Orders, which have six senators serving on each legislative and general purpose standing committee, could operate for this Parliament.

         After considerable negotiation on this issue, it became clear that the Australian Democrats were keen to protect the position that had been enshrined over recent years in relation to their serving on these standing committees. After discussion, in order to achieve a similar result, the Government amended that original proposition and is now moving to reduce the number of committees.

         Also, as we will debate at a later stage, we are very serious about trying to ensure that the workload across the committees is even. I think that is very important. Many senators know that one or two of these standing committees have really borne the brunt of the committee stage work of the Senate and a number of others have not had anything like that overwhelming workload. It is worth while seeing whether we can balance the workload and have a more equitable spread of work across the committees.

         It is important to outline briefly the Government's view on the issue of Chairs of these committees because I understand that Senator Hill will be moving an amendment at a later stage to see the Chairs of the committees shared between the Government, the Opposition and the minor parties and Independent senators who are represented in the chamber.

         I believe it is worth recalling the way in which these committees have operated in the past. I think the nature of the committee system and the way it has evolved certainly does reinforce the need for the Government to have the capacity to nominate a Chair for these committees, given the important role the Chairs play. Certainly, having a government Chair on legislative and general purpose standing committees has been accepted as a longstanding convention. Even Odgers, on page 468 of the fifth edition, indicates without any equivocation at all that this is certainly the case. Odgers states:

        The Senate's committee system is possibly unique in that the party composition of standing and select committees does not necessarily reflect voting strength in the Senate. It is a long-standing convention that the Government provides the chairmen of committees and enjoys a majority of votes in committees, even if the Government may be in a minority on the floor of the Senate.
       </para>

        The convention probably grew out of the early concept that is still valid today—that committees are fact-finding and advisory and do not aspire to decision-making.

        I do not know whether the latter part of that quote from Odgers is true, but I thought that if I did not provide a fulsome quotation from Odgers I would hear any number of Opposition senators giving me one later in this debate. I think that is indicative of the principle that has been established for a long time—the convention that has worked in this chamber for a long time—and it is one that it is essential to retain. I personally believe that this suggestion from the Opposition is tantamount to its accepting that it is going to be a permanent opposition in this chamber. No fair dinkum alternative government would want to see the Government lose the chairmanship of committees.

         I have also been honest previously in saying quite clearly that the Government has difficulty in staffing the committees because of the number of frontbenchers that we have. We have 10 Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary in this chamber. We all know how the mathematics add up. Most of us who can do simple arithmetic—I would not put Senator Walters in that category—understand that. It may as well be on the table that it is a difficulty for Government backbench senators to cover the committee workload—and it is enormous. The Opposition has an advantage in that any number of frontbenchers and all the shadow Parliamentary Secretaries, which I think amount to five or six, can serve on these committees. That is not a luxury the Government has and it causes, obviously, very significant logistical difficulties for us as we look to staff these committees.

The first is that the Government is seeking—and apparently in so doing has the agreement of the Australian Democrats—to abolish two of the standing committees of the Australian Senate. Basically, the Government is seeking to abolish both the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure.

         It seems that the Government is seeking to abolish these committees simply because of its low numbers in this chamber after the last election. No case has been made out on the merits for abolition of the committees. It is simply a matter of fact that, now that the Government has fewer members and more Ministers in this chamber, it has decided that its backbench cannot adequately service the current committee structure of the Senate.

         The abolition of these committees is convenient for the Australian Democrats because they do not have enough senators to service all legislative and general purposes committees unless some of them service more than one. So when the Government went to the Australian Democrats and said, `We propose to cut back the existing Senate committees', that was received positively by the Australian Democrats because it suits their low numbers in this chamber.

         The sad aspect of this is that these committees are not committees of the Government; they are committees of the Senate, and their record has been good. I want to speak briefly on the one I know best, and that is the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Although I have never been a member of the Senate committee, I am well acquainted with its high public standing. I think some of my colleagues who have served on the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure will express their concerns about the abolition of that particular committee.

         The Senate foreign affairs committee in fact received its first reference in 1971, so it has existed for over 20 years. As I have said, it is held in high regard by practitioners in foreign affairs in this country and it is also well known internationally. In my observation, certainly some of the work it has done in recent years has been up with the best it has produced in that long period—work which, I am prepared to acknowledge, has been done largely under the chairmanship of Senator Maguire, whom I hope will later enter this debate and put his view about the abolition of a committee he has so well chaired in recent times.

         When I think of the work that committee did, for example, in its inquiry into Australian-Indian relations—which is the only contemporary work that has been done by this Parliament on what is now an important relationship but will be a much more important relationship in the future—my view is that if that work had not been done by the foreign affairs committee, it would not have been done at all. That inquiry explored the potential for the relationship, the economic potential, and how the Australian foreign aid component in south Asia and India in particular might develop. It also looked at the defence aspects of the relationship, which have been of some concern to many Australians, and to some extent it put to rest some of those concerns, which were not well-founded in fact.

         I think also of the inquiry the committee undertook into Australian-Latin American relations, which was the first inquiry of that type by the Australian Parliament. It explored the potential for growing relationships between Australia and the various Latin American states. When that report was brought down, all the heads of mission from Latin American states based in Canberra attended in this chamber. They gave high commendation to the work and the detail that had been put into the report by the Senate committee, particularly the work on the potential of the economic relationship, which has been largely unknown within Australia. Of course, that report was largely endorsed by the Australian Government in due course.

Just because the Australian Labor Party in the Senate has lost a couple of seats while at the same time increasing its frontbench representation, it now wishes to abolish that committee after more than 20 years of work. As no better reason has been given, I think that is a sad state of affairs.

         I am really astonished that the Australian Democrats are so ready to be a party to the abolition of a Senate standing committee that has so well served Australian interests for so long. I understand the problem that faces the Australian Democrats in servicing all these committees. I have even suggested to them that if, say, Senator Bourne, who has an interest in foreign affairs and who might participate in particular inquiries, such as the inquiry on Australia-China relations, were to find that because of the pressure of her other work she was unable to participate in other inquiries of less interest to her, it would not be unreasonable that we should find a way of accommodating that difficulty on the part of the Democrats. That would be a much better solution to the problem we have before us today than simply abolishing the committee, which is the solution the Government put to the Australian Democrats and which, as I have said and as I understand it, they have so readily accepted.

That committee is fully engaged with its own workload and, interestingly, there has not been duplication. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the joint committee has expanded its role in recent years; it now has a subcommittee dealing with human rights, for example. There is no way that it would be able to pick up the work that has been done in recent years by the Senate foreign affairs committee.

         The second issue that has been brought within this debate is our proposed reform that the chairmen of general purpose standing committees be shared around the chamber. It is true, as Senator Faulkner has said, that the practice in the past—and it is incorporated within the Standing Orders—has been that the government of the day chairs these committees. One suspects that it ended up in the Standing Orders in that form because it was assumed that the government of the day would have the majority in this place.

         But I repeat what I said a moment ago: these committees are not committees of the government; they are committees of the Senate, and there is no logical reason why the government should chair all of them. Work done by legislative committees is brought back into this chamber for debate in the Committee of the Whole. At one stage we followed the practice of the Opposition providing the Chairman of Committees, the Deputy President. Nobody said that that system would not work because it was an opposition chair heading up the debate. The same logic applies to the work being done by the committees when they are operating in their separate state.

         What we are proposing as a matter of reform is that the Standing Orders be changed so that senators other than government senators would have the opportunity to chair some of these committees and provide the benefit of their own unique backgrounds and experiences. In doing so, we are not in any way being pessimistic about our future opportunities in government. In fact, we see it as a reform of the Senate. We recognise that it would have to be a reform that was carried on if the numbers changed in the other place and we were in government. We believe that it is time that the Senate as a whole asserted itself properly in relation to the functioning of the committee process. We should not allow the government, in effect, to run the Senate's agenda in respect of this very important part of the Senate's work.

         To be reasonable, we have suggested—and we did so on the basis of there being nine committees; but as I said, if the Democrats stand by what they have earlier said, we will end up with only seven—that four committees be chaired by a government senator, four be chaired by an opposition senator, the Opposition representing the largest block in this chamber, and that the ninth be chaired by a representative of the minor parties or Independents. Because of the Australian Democrat numbers, I am anticipating that the ninth one, on the current structure, would be chaired by a senator from the Australian Democrats.

I will, therefore, seek to move an amendment to bring about that reform. I hope that the Australian Democrats, who I know have been thinking about this issue for the last week and a half, might be prepared to support us on this occasion.

But in this instance the Government is starting from the position of having preferred three government senators and three other senators on a committee. That has not proved possible.

I took the trouble today, because I have heard all these interjections, to see what aggregate votes the various parties received in 1990 and 1993. It is quite an interesting reflection. The Liberal-National Party-CLP—I have added them all together—received 8,751,671 votes at the two elections. The Australian Labor Party received 8,454,673. In other words, the Liberal-National Party combined vote over those two elections comes to 42.5 per cent. Their Senate representation after July will be 47.4 per cent. The Labor Party's vote totalled 41 per cent combined over the two elections and we receive 39.5 per cent. The Democrats received 8.8 per cent of the vote over the two elections and get 9.2 per cent of the representation in this chamber. The Greens' aggregate vote is 2.4 per cent and they get 1.3 per cent in the chamber. Those who argue that this chamber is totally representative of votes cast and reflects those power realities are wrong.

         I ask the Senate not to misunderstand me; I am not whingeing or complaining about this. The reasons are partly due to preferences, but not much. It is simply that in every Senate election there is a missing quota; that is, the total amount of votes are divided by seven and we have six successful candidates. The history of the 1990 election especially rather than this one is that the Labor Party had the missing quota. Therefore, we are substantially and proportionately under-represented in this chamber than the primary votes cast.

         That could just as easily happen to the Opposition in any particular period. If one goes back through the past, I am sure it has been equally disadvantaged at some time. I put that on the record because of this sort of trite interjection: `This chamber is purely representative. You didn't get enough votes. Therefore, we don't care less that you are going to have difficulty in staffing the committees with senators'. A lot of luck is involved in this. I do not whinge and say that the system is bad, corrupt or biased. I do not say that at all. We have had the wrong end of the stick luckwise—especially in 1990—in terms of having the missing quota, as is reflected in this chamber.

         Senator Hill went to the question of why the Senate foreign affairs and defence committee has gone. He should not have been surprised by that. I proposed that, but did not put it to the chamber, in 1987 and 1990. It is not as though it is a recent discovery. It was selected on the basis of looking down the list of committees to see which one has the least legislative role and which one can have its workload picked up by another committee.

         Clearly, we believe that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—comprising about 30 parliamentarians and with enormous resources in terms of staff, et cetera—can adequately cover these issues. Where it cannot cover these issues, then another committee to which we move these responsibilities can take up the slack. Hence, if the Opposition insists on doing an inquiry, such as it did on India and produced an excellent report, that committee can still do it. But it also has to be said that committee members will only be able to devote probably half the time to those sorts of issues as they have in the past.

         Let me move on to one of my long-term concerns. If in this chamber we continue to increase committees and their workload, we are going to move to the American system, which I abhor; that is, having 90 per cent of the work on committees done by staff and not by senators themselves. I have noticed a tendency over the last 11 years for that to increase. More and more reports are written by secretariats, rubber-stamped or altered slightly by chairmen, and then rubber-stamped by the committee members. Members do not have either the resources or the time, if their efforts are spread out over a number of committees, to go ahead and properly supervise the eventual report or adequately prepare questions to witnesses. I think this process of reducing committees by two will slightly help to stem that process.

         Senator Hill said that when these committees were set up it was always assumed that the Government would have a majority. No-one here, other than maybe Senator Durack, could even comment on that. They were set up in 1971 precisely because the Government did not have a majority. The DLP, for once in its life, voted to reform the system and voted with the Labor Party. The basic point made by Senator Hill as to whether it was always assumed that government should chair these committees was based on the fact that the Government did not have a majority in the chamber. That was one of the checks and balances put in at the time when the rest of the powers of the committee were put in.

         These committees have immense power and give the Opposition immense opportunities. The Senate in its wisdom in 1971 said, `How can we slightly counterbalance a disproportionate amount of influence and opportunity of the Opposition and not the Government?'. We agreed at the time that the Liberal coalition could provide the chairs of all these committees, the Estimates committees, et cetera. Now we hear some sweet and honeyed words about power sharing. Where was the power sharing in the day of the McMahon Government when the committees were set up?

         There are two senators in the chamber who were here prior to 1980, during the Fraser Government.

He should remember that very well. I admired him for it, frankly, even though I whinged at the time. We had a disagreement over a reference. Suddenly we fronted up at the committee; and bang, in came the numbers which made it three all, casting vote—`See you later Robert, you are wrong'. I just slotted that away in my memory and said, `We'll get our chance one day. We'll do almost the same thing', although it is not a preferable course on which to go.

There are greater cynics who say, `They are just trying to put their snouts in the trough to get the committee chairmanship'. I would be much more impressed if I heard from the opposition side now that this is really about power sharing and Senate symbolism and that they will not take any of the emoluments that go with chairs of committees.

But, of course, no. We are a bit cynical as to why suddenly the coalition would want to be into power sharing to disrupt what was an original agreement in 1971, when in fact they control four State parliaments around this country. How much power sharing is done there? How often in Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales do opposition members chair committees in the Parliament? The answer is, absolutely never.

         I will not waste too much time of the Senate. In summary, I make the point that the Government has come forward with this proposal to meet changed circumstances. The change is that, inevitably, most of these committees will now constitute eight senators rather than six. It means that if those opposite want a meaningful contribution from government senators and want to force them onto these committees—that is, to serve on two or three—they will not get the output from them.

         In relation to the chairmanship issue that Senator Hill raised, we remain a little cynical about this sudden surge of power sharing. We have heard nothing about it in the last 10 years. This sort of motion should always be debated three months before an election. When senators want to substantially change the Senate and the relativities between the Opposition and Government, three months before an election is the time to do it. Everyone has an eye on the weather then. We may think we are going to lose and think that power sharing is a good idea. Those on the other side can be held to it, because if they think they can win government they should not mind power sharing down. It is a rather cynical move to introduce this proposal when those opposite face three years, six years or whatever in the wilderness. I suggest that Senator Hill introduce that amendment in two years and eight months time. We can all have an objective look at it then, none of us knowing what the future holds.

If we find that the current load is unbalanced or that the Opposition absolutely insists that one area move to another, we would not be blind to those particular recommendations.

         —I thank the Senate. The incorporated material shows that, starting with the legal and constitutional affairs committee, which had a membership of eight senators, there were 16 inquiries on which reports have been presented, and there are five current inquiries on a wide range of subjects. When I turn to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I see also a long list of very substantial national inquiries that have been undertaken. I have with me a pile of reports from the last parliament, and I am proud to have been associated with the work of the Senate committee in the establishment of these reports.

         Let me note what is now an international authority on the visit to any nation by nuclear-powered or armed vessels and the safeguards required. At the time this was a hot political issue in this country and many in the public regarded it as a genuine danger to civilians in port cities, and, more widely than that, that there were visits to our ports by nuclear-powered or armed vessels. This measure has taken all of the fire out of those concerns. There were some 50 recommendations which made sure that all of the arrangements were in good order. There was a change whereby some ships would not come to the Victoria Docks adjacent to the city of Hobart. All of the politics has gone from that issue.

         Let me talk about the report Senator Hill has referred to, that is, the Senate committee's report on Australia-India relations. It addressed both strategic assessments of India in the subcontinent and trade prospects between Australia and India. When there was a major mistake made by the present Government in the sale of redundant aircraft to Pakistan—a mistake which is greatly regretted, I believe, even by the Ministers responsible—this report was at hand and was a fallback to repair and rebuild the damaged relations between Australia and India. The recommendation in this report that there should be an Australia-India council has been accepted. The essential text for the politics of the relationship between Australia and India—if one asks any of the academics and any of the business people involved in Australia-India matters—is this Senate report.

         None of these reports of the Senate committee has been duplicated by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Another area of very real concern both to our foreign affairs interests in this country and to defence has been our increased involvement in United Nations peacekeeping. It was very appropriate that there be a careful study by politicians of United Nations peacekeeping in Australia. The more than 20 deployments of Australian service personnel and police to peacekeeping needs around the world and a whole body of recommendations to improve our decisions with regard to such deployments are carefully catalogued in this evaluation.

         I turn to the major report brought down during the last Parliament, a report on Australia and Latin America, which I regard as one of the most significant, most constructive reports for Australia coming out of the 50 or so inquiries in which I have been involved in the past 15 years. I am very proud to have been associated with this report, as is Senator West who is in the chamber and, indeed, all eight of the senators who served in its determination. The President of the Senate has been glowing in his tribute to this report. He represented this Parliament last year on a visit to Colombia and found that everybody concerned with foreign affairs and trade matters he spoke to was aware of the Senate committee's report relating to all of the republics of Central and South America.

         Senator Hill has referred to the enormous interest shown in this issue by the eight ambassadors in this city who represent Latin American countries and who have appeared as witnesses before our inquiry. They have followed it most carefully. Last Wednesday night, they very admirably held a dinner in honour of the chairman of the committee, Senator Maguire, as he will be retiring from the Parliament next month. They said, through the spokesmen that evening—the Ambassador of Chile, the Ambassador Colombia and our good friends—that the dinner was held in honour of the whole committee, and Senator Maguire took it in that way.

More than that, the committee has initiated a proposal—and the Parliament has agreed—whereby the seminal elements of our report on Latin America and the Government's response be bound together and published in Spanish and circulated in the countries of Latin America.

         The proposal to have only seven Senate standing committees happens to match the number of Democrat senators. There are only seven Democrats in this chamber.

In the future, when others look at this debate, and at the downgrading of the Senate committee system, they will see it as meeting no argument on merit, only the convenience of some senators, and they will see this as a very sorry day in the Senate.

         I have been able to do the arithmetic—something to which Senator Ray referred. There will be only 30 Labor senators in the chamber. Ten are Ministers. I welcome the fact that one-third of the Ministry is drawn from this chamber. It should be so. One-third of the members of Parliament are in the Senate; one-third of the Ministers of the Government ought to be from the Senate. When we take those 10 into account, plus the President of the Senate—or if there should be other than a Government President, presumably a Government chairman of committees—this leaves only 19 senators to serve on the standing committees. If there are nine standing committees and three or four are required for each—even at the most, that is 36 places to be filled—each of those 19 senators would be required to serve on two standing committees. I understand that arithmetic but I do not believe that that is an argument that ought to sway this chamber to abandon standing committees of great worth.

There is a convenience, a concentration and a focus which senators bring to an all-senators committee which mean that it is a very achieving committee in the way that I have outlined in the reports that I have referred to.

         As Senator Ray said, this proposal was put up three years ago and six years ago. Senator Ray was the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and was aware of pressures, even in those years, on Labor senators to service committees. It was at least informally put about that there might be some reduction. One of the committees discussed was the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. However, rightly, six years ago and three years ago that discussion led to the confirmation and retention of this very achieving Senate standing committee. Even at this eleventh hour, I still hope there will be the same outcome this time.

         On 16 September last year the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for an inquiry and report on the matter of Japan's defence policy and current defence development and debates in Japan. A number of very valuable witnesses have appeared at our public hearings, including His Excellency the Ambassador of Japan. It would be of great discourtesy, not only to the senators who have three-quarters finished that task but also to our witnesses, including the Ambassador of Japan and through him the Government of Japan, if we were to not see the completion of that reference.

         We have completed our public hearings. We have already developed a draft and it would be the wish of the committee for that to be completed by the end of June this year. I put the plea that, if there is going to be a loss of a committee, there be a certainty of transition such that this current inquiry, the only major current inquiry to be completed, is completed and reported to the Senate. There are two or three ways to do this. One is through retaining the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade at least until the end of June with its current membership. Another is to have a select committee, again with the membership of the current standing committee, that would have the precise task of completing that report on the same terms of reference and building upon the transcript of evidence and material that has been available to the Committee. A third is to ensure that in any amalgamated committee it be a priority reference and that there be sufficient personnel from the former committee continuing into that amalgamated committee to ensure that it is completed by June this year.

I commend, as I did at the beginning of my speech, Senator Cooney's first-class record as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Senator Hill has served in this area in the past, as has Senator Tate, former Senator Puplick, former Senator Missen and so on. There has been an enormously high regard for that committee. Yet the proposal that is before us is to take these two most eminent standing committees and amalgamate them so that there would be half the resources and half the ability to complete the good work of both committees. Even in this transition, I would see that the concerns of such persons as my good friend across the chamber Senator Cooney in legal and constitutional matters would have difficulty competing with the completion of a report such as that which I referred to with regard to Japan.

I would also look for a signal with regard to Senator Panizza's amendment that would change the actual combination of responsibilities or portfolio areas with regard to the continuing Senate committees. I will defer to those alternative considerations if I can see that we will have the full number of Senate committees. The reason why I moved the amendment is for there to be only a reduction to eight committees, if that was the mind of Democrat and Independent senators—and, indeed, of Government senators. If we retained nine committees, I would happily withdraw my amendment for eight.

The underlying principle of the income test is to assess people's current need for income support based on the current financial resources available to them. The real truth is that capital gains on listed shares are readily available. Determining whether to access the capital gain or not is entirely up to the individual. Nevertheless, the gain is available, and that is the same across a whole range of investments. That is what underpins the whole income test, which the Opposition does not even seek to overturn.

A Democrat amendment proposed in December similar to this current proposal was not supported by Senator Patterson at that time either.

         I answered the ridiculous claim about investing overseas the other day. The idea that Australia's pensioner population is flocking to invest in the New York stock exchange is, to say the least, bizarre. Pensioners do not have the arrangements in place to gain the benefit of doing that, and it is just not likely to happen.

         The rules that will apply to shares have applied to managed investments for five years. Over that time, 128,000 pensioners have invested in managed investments. They do that because there is intrinsic merit in the investment. They will have to weigh up the intrinsic merit of the investment in shares as against managed investments and other forms of investment. As I said, even if some do sell their shares, they are pretty likely to reinvest in ways that are covered by the income and assets test anyway.

         As I mentioned, the number of people affected by the change is around 60,000, and around 24,000 DVA pensioners are also affected. So we are talking about less than three per cent of the social security pensioner population. Those affected are mainly those with large shareholdings, including some with as much as $100,000 in shares. For those who have a small number of shares, this measure has so little effect that it does not matter anyway.

         It is true that the new rules do not apply to non-listed shares, real estate, art works and antiques. There are pretty good reasons for that. Shares in non-listed companies are not part of the measure because they are not readily realisable in the way that shares in listed companies are. Therefore, capital growth cannot be readily utilised for income support purposes as it can be with shares in listed companies.

         Real estate, antiques and art works are not part of the measure because the whole investment must be sold in order to gain access to the capital gain, whereas listed shares can be sold in small lots to realise gains as people consider them necessary to be realised. A pensioner does not need to sell the whole portfolio to access profits. If I were an antique dealer, I would not really believe that 100,000 pensioners would be marching down the street beating a path to my door this afternoon to invest in antiques. It simply is not going to happen. The truth is that pensioners may seek investments other than shares as a result of this measure—although I still think many will stay with what they have—but they will not be racing off to invest in antiques.

         I think the other point we have to cover concerns comparisons between definitions in the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office. There is no sound reason why those two organisations should use the same method of assessing income. The social security income test serves a totally different purpose from the tax office assessment of income and it always has. Social security legislation provides a level of income support based on people's current needs and their current ability to meet the needs. The Australian Taxation Office assesses a person's income over the course of a full year to determine what he or she can contribute to the revenue of the community. So to suggest that social security income tests should mirror the tax definition of income ignores the intrinsic differences in the way the two organisations go about their tasks.

         The criticism that the changes do not allow losses to be fully offset against gains is flawed, because if one says that, one does not understand the current nature of a social security income assessment. It presumes that past dollar losses should be offset against past dollar gains, but the income test seeks to establish the current earning capacity of a particular investment and the corresponding financial resources available to individual pensioners. This method of assessing current earning power has been in operation for many years, and it has been endorsed by the High Court of Australia as an appropriate way to administer the income test.

         The assertion that identical managed and unmanaged investments will be assessed differently under the new rules is incorrect. Such anomalies are possible under the current rules. Currently, a pensioner who invests directly in the share market is assessed differently from a pensioner who invests indirectly in the share market through an equity trust. That is the kind of anomaly that the legislation seeks to correct. The change will remove the anomalies in assessment and ensure a fairer and more workable treatment of investments.

         The claim that the Department of Social Security will apply arbitrary assessment dates is patently untrue. All clients will have their share portfolios assessed on the same day, using the same source information, when the change is introduced in September. The department will obtain updated information on share market performance every fortnight. Clients can seek individual reassessments of their share portfolios based on this information if they feel the need. Consistency of assessment will be maintained by automatic quarterly reassessments which will occur, again, using identical share market information for all clients.

As I outlined a second ago, the problem is that if one invests in an equity trust which invests indirectly in shares, one is treated differently from someone who invests directly in shares. That is clearly an anomaly which we ought to fix. Otherwise, we go in the reverse direction. If Senator Watson is suggesting that we go in the reverse direction in order to eliminate the income test, he is swimming against the tide of his own party. Senator Watson has shown an occasional capacity to almost want to do that but he never quite maintains the courage to go the full step.

Since we announced this, the numbers of pensioners who hold them have gone up almost by half. So this assertion that there is a flood of pensioners trying to get out of shares is simply not true and will not be true for the future.

He said that the number of pensioners with investments had increased, but he did not give me any details as to the level of their investments in shares. He has not told me whether those people are full pensioners or not and whether they have investments at a rate which is low enough to entitle them to a full pension anyway. That figure really has not convinced me.

         As for the accuracy of the estimates of the savings, these have been questioned by the stock exchange. I also question the accuracy of the figure because when I asked in Estimates whether it took into account changes in pensioners' behaviour, the department said that it did not. I do not care what Senator Richardson says about the increasing number of people investing in shares, the fact is that financial advisers are telling pensioners to take their money out of shares. If Senator Richardson had read any of the material that goes out from investment advisers, he would see that that is what they are telling pensioners to do. That is what they are ringing my office and telling me that they are telling pensioners to do and that is what they will do.

         The very premise on which this move is based, as Senator Richardson has said to us several times, is the premise that we should be treating equally those who invest in management investment trusts and those who invest directly in the share market. If, in the way that the managed investment trusts are treated at the moment—and that is not to say that is correct—it is deemed that capital gains are income, that is a contradiction and an illogicality which should not be perpetuated over other investments. If it is, and if the Minister wants to extend that treatment in fairness to other areas, the gain in value that might accrue to antiques, as Senator Richardson mentioned—I did not hear the actual words he used but the implication was that one could not sell the corner leg off an antique table, that it was not as redeemable as a parcel of shares—or, as other people have suggested, to land, stamp collections, coins, art works or whatever, is a gain in capital value which is taxed as capital gains when the items are sold.

         A portfolio of antiques or a portfolio of philatelic value has some degree of flexibility.

Capital gains are not income, never will be, and should not be treated that way.

         I turn to the other aspect of what financial advisers are and are not doing. There was one aspect of the Minister's response which concerned me greatly. I agree—in fact, it is a platitude—that those who will be most affected are those who have the biggest shareholdings. Wow, that is really enlightening stuff. Of course that will be the case. But those who are in that situation do not need us to leap to their defence. Of course, it is worth while for financial planning advisers to take the trouble to rearrange their affairs.

         The people who will be most significantly affected are not those people at all. The significant effect will be felt by those people who have a part pension and who would have that pension compromised by the Government's deeming that their small capital gains are income and enough to take them off the pension entirely. Those people are not necessarily in the category of having large shareholdings; they are people who have a few shares, and they could well be people in what I think is the average range of seeing perhaps $700 to $1,000 accrue to their share portfolio over a year. It might be that $700 or $800 is taken off it by movements in the share market in a subsequent year. One year they are on the pension and the next year they are off the pension. One person who wrote to me said, `At my time of life, at 82 years of age, I do not need this hassle'.

         I ask Senator Collins what the next level will be. We have seen a progression. We have seen the introduction of a wealth tax on that section of the Australian community that can least bear this cost. With the increased value of their share or their investment bond, they lose a proportion of their investment because it comes off their pension. That is a wealth tax. The Government started off with friendly society bonds. Any increase in their value reduces the pension. Increases in management investment trusts reduce the pension. Now it is concentrating on increases in the value of shares. What is the next item the Government will be looking for? It will be the family home. Pensioners out there, beware, because this Government has a very bad track record. We have what is tantamount to a wealth tax. We are increasingly seeing evidence of this coming through.

Taxes should be fair; they should be equitably distributed; and they should be borne by those who are in the best position to afford them. The Government is trying it out with the pensioners, and it may be the beginning of a wealth tax for all Australians.

         During the debates on superannuation, the Government consistently implored Australians to save more. The whole thrust of the superannuation guarantee levy was that the increased amounts of money had to be put aside by employers on behalf of their employees to provide for their retirement; people had to be encouraged to save for their retirement. This very proposition discourages people from retiring, from investing and from hedging against inflation rather than putting their money under their beds.

         —I rise to oppose the motion moved by Senator Faulkner and to support the amendment which will be moved by Senator Panizza. The reason for the Government, and apparently the Democrats, wishing to cut the number of Senate committees is simply that as a result of the election on 13 March the Government has lost two senators and it simply does not have the people in this chamber to adequately service those committees. It is also relevant, I guess, that the Democrats are now down to seven on their way down to two, I suspect, after the next election.

         I briefly want to draw attention to the very fine speech made by Senator Baden Teague in his plea to retain the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It was a committee that for a year or so I was privileged to sit on. I pay particular tribute to the work of Senator Maguire, who chaired that committee very well and, of course, to my colleague Senator Teague who, as deputy chairman, really did a lot of very fine work. Senator Teague, as we all know in this chamber, has a very great and sincere interest in foreign affairs particularly, which is well evidenced by his very great knowledge and understanding of foreign affairs, and his very close contacts with—I suspect I would be right in saying—all of the representatives of foreign countries who are resident here in Canberra.

         However, I do want to draw attention to the inquiry by that committee—to which Senator Teague made rather lengthy reference—into Australia's relationships with Latin America. That was a first report; that was the first time any parliamentary group had made any in-depth study into our relationships with Latin America. As Senator Teague has rightly said, it has become almost the—I think `bible' might be taking it a bit far—principal reference book for anyone in Australia who might be interested in doing business with, or having cultural, sporting or other links with, the countries of Latin America.

Certainly it was, as Senator Teague said, a report that had the very enthusiastic support of the diplomatic representatives of Latin American countries in Australia.

         It is more than a shame, it is a tragedy, that the Government, because of its own inefficiencies, wants to get rid of that committee. Like so much that this Government does, there are other ways of correcting any perceived difficulties it has. One would be to manage the committees a bit better. Possibly the Government could make sure that the workload was not quite as heavy, but still retain those committees, particularly the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, which has really carved out for itself a major niche in the parliamentary system. The Government could well retain that committee but look at lessening in some way the workload on it and on other committees.

         I think Senator Bourne was a member of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee and contributed substantially at times. I appreciate that when she became the Whip her time became a little more precious; she was not able to attend as often as she had previously. Senator Bourne is well aware of the fine work that that particular committee did. I ask Senator Bourne—as one who understands and has been part of that committee—to reconsider the proposal and not just simply go along with the Government willy-nilly. I ask her to have a look at other arrangement which may be able to be made which would allow those committees to remain in place, but possibly with a lesser workload.

         The committee on transport, communication and infrastructure then conducted a major inquiry into satellite launching facilities in Australia. Senator Schacht participated in that occasionally and, when he did, he made sensible contributions. Senator Kernot also paid particular interest to that. Whilst she, like all of us, would have benefited from the extra knowledge she gained, I was always a bit sorry that she, continuing her anti-Queensland stance, was all for promoting Senator Schacht's State in trying to get satellite launching facilities down there and ignoring the much better proposals in the north.

However, the Government has made funds available to support the learning and teaching of languages other than English in schools and other sectors. For example, under the Priority Language Incentive Element (PLIE) of the School Language and Literacy Program, funds are provided to encourage students to continue studying any eight of the priority languages at Year 12 level including Japanese, nominated in the Australian Language and Literacy Policy (estimated expenditure under this program in 1993 is $7 million); a 30% increase in funding (to $9.7 million in 1993) for language teaching through ethnic schools, and a provision of up to $4 million per year for innovative projects which aim to improve the quality of LOTEs teaching in schools, TAFEs and universities nationally.

In comparison, in the banking industry, entry salaries are linked to qualifications and fairly constant across sectors, with a pass degree attracting about $26500 and no loading for a second language.

        (11) The casual nature of employment combined with remuneration in the industry may not be attractive to Australian tertiary graduates with Japanese language skills. In addition, the casual employment and small size of firms, common within the industry, tends to prevent any clearly defined career path. This may also act as a disincentive to Australians with Japanese language skills to apply for tourist guide positions.
