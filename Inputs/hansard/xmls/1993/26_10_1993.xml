         —My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the Australian Mining Industry Council's blunt refusal to take at face value Commonwealth assurances that its proposed Mabo legislation will validate all previous titles, will the minister now settle this matter once and for all and give the Senate an unequivocal assurance that all past titles for land will be fully secured and will not be affected by native title? Further, is it correct that, even where a possibly invalid mining lease is validated, native title rights will not be extinguished and will be restored at the end of the lease so that any proposed extension will need to be negotiated and paid for by mining companies?

         We have said all along that our legislation deals with the concerns of the states and industry that as a result of the Mabo decision there may be invalid grants. There is no point in legislating to validate grants that are already valid and there is no point, accordingly, in the legislation addressing that issue. AMIC's position does appear to be based on misconceptions about the government's proposals.

         The legislation protects the rights of all existing titleholders. It does allow, as I have said, validation of existing grants, including rights of renewal. Any grant of interest in land which is invalid because of the existence of native title will be validated or able to be validated by the states and territories as a result of this bill.

         The legislation does not give native titleholders any new veto, de facto or otherwise. They will have the right to negotiate on actions affecting their land, but in no way do the tight but very fair provisions for negotiation and arbitration, if necessary by a tribunal, constitute a veto. There will be stringent criteria for registration of claimants to avoid delays through vexatious claims. Nowhere have we ever proposed that consideration of native title will have to precede other approval processes, which seems to be another thing that is worrying the industry. That is a complete misconception of our proposals.

         Again, the revival of native title after mining leases expire is hardly a source of uncertainty because any native title will be subject to the grant during its life and the life of any legitimate renewals. Additional conditions or costs will not be imposed on existing exploration and mining titles. Generally, when you put all of that in a pot and look at the total picture, it is evident that we are providing a workable system that will be quite fair both to native titleholders and to the mining industry. Far from driving away investment, we are providing the certainty and the fairness that will encourage it.

         What seems to be totally lacking in the appreciation of many commentators, whether fair-minded or otherwise, is an acknowledgment that the Mabo decision itself by the High Court introduced a degree of uncertainty. What the legislation is about is avoiding a protracted process of litigation to test the parameters of that uncertainty. Rather, we will by this legislation resolve a great many of the issues that, in the absence of it, would be left unresolved. That is the reason this legislation does make total sense from the point of view of the mining industry, the pastoral industry, the state governments and anyone else that is seriously minded to deal with it.

Secondly, do I take it the minister concedes that, at the expiration of a mining lease, it will be necessary to renegotiate and take into account not just any valid claims which might be established in due course but, indeed, as the mining industry says, that applicants for future grants would have to deal not just with native titleholders with proven claims but also with those who merely claim native title?

The deficit reduction strategy which the Treasurer articulated on 17 August 1993 remains essentially intact. Of the extra revenue sought from the revenue measures passed by the Senate last week, the government will gather in 1996-97 some 97 per cent of the budget night estimate.

         The importance of this outcome cannot be overstated. We now have in place a medium-term deficit reduction strategy that will deliver progressive deficit reductions over four years: from $16 billion in 1993-94 to about $6 billion in 1996-97—that is, about one per cent of GDP in future.

         As I have pointed out on several occasions to those who have paid any attention—and who now happily constitute a majority in the Senate, even if not all—international financial opinion, including that of the IMF, has placed great emphasis on governments having established credible medium-term fiscal strategies. They recognise the need to have a short-term increase in deficit for stimulus purposes. But they do believe it is very important that we have a medium-term deficit reduction strategy to deal with questions about interest rates—because a failure to do so would put up the pressure for increased interest rates—and to reduce the scope for capital formation and job creation. A failure to do so would lower the growth of output and income.

         Australia is one of the few industrial nations that has put a credible medium-term fiscal situation in place. Other countries have tried to do so. For example, the very valiant efforts of the President of the United States have brought that country's deficit target for 1996-97 down to three per cent of GDP, whereas ours by 1996-97 will be approximately one per cent of GDP. Locking such a strategy firmly into place is very important. The business community recognises that it is important and welcomes it, because it knows that it provides certainty—certainty to plan, to invest and to expand. In achieving that outcome, the minor parties in the Senate have played a key role.

         Aboriginal claimants are not stupid and are not going to waste time, money and emotional energy pursuing claims that obviously have not got a hope in Hades of succeeding, but nonetheless it is conceivable that in some cases claims will be pursued in order perhaps to clarify the native title status of some common law reservation, statutory reservation or something of that kind. It is conceivable that a claim of that kind might be pursued in order to establish the extent to which the native title interest can live alongside the previous valid interest. In order to cover that situation, the legislation provides exactly as I have stated. There is no ground for uncertainty there either.

         The question is about especially France. Until now, the debate in France has been one-sided. There are signs that it is now turning. In recent days, former French Prime Minister, Raymond Barre, former French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and the current president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, have all said things in the French debate in France which are helpful to a conclusion of the round in a balanced way.

         Indeed, the wine and spirits exporters have also come out supporting the round and, coming from the agricultural stable, that is quite significant for France. Recently, the SOFRES poll in France indicated that 48 per cent of French voters thought that the round would end with France signing the agreement, even though it was unsatisfactory for French interests. It should be remembered that four per cent of the French economy is devoted to agriculture and six per cent of the work force derive employment from agriculture. A completion of the round for the French economy would be worth in US dollars $25 billion, in French francs $150 billion, in extra income, and it would create half a million jobs in France. These figures are now increasingly part of the public debate.

         Elsewhere in Europe there is a view that for the round to be successfully completed `something' has to be given for France. I do not know what all that means but I think it comes down to this: the signs are that there could be some sort of change. I do not know what that change will be; it will depend on something happening. Australia and the Cairns Group will be involved in any of those ongoing debates about that and we will play our role in order to protect the interests of the agriculture fraternity in Australia and the best interests of our trade account in this country.

Meanwhile, on the US side, the NAFTA bill goes to Congress shortly. It will be out, on the predicted timetable now, on the 17th. So we are shaping up to a last round of the Uruguay Round in the last month. That will be crunch time. We have positioned ourselves, I think, to exert as much influence as we could ever be expected to exert in order to get a good outcome for this round completed on timetable by 15 December and to ensure that the outcome is not a partial solution but a global package which features agriculture in a bold and balanced outcome for the round.

The trouble is, however, that new obligations continue to accrue, in particular, so far as peacekeeping operations are concerned, of which currently 17 such operations are in progress.

         Last week the administration requested the US Congress to appropriate $291 million for its 1993 regular budget payment and $66 million as a contribution to catching up on its arrears to the UN and a range of specialised agencies which were accumulated during the 1980s. President Bush had undertaken to clear those arrears by 1995. President Clinton himself repeated that commitment, including in his recent address to the UN General Assembly.

         Last week Congress appropriated the $291 million for the 1993 regular budget, but directed that 10 per cent of this figure should be withheld, pending the appointment by the Secretary-General of an inspector-general as a watchdog against fraud and waste. It also decided to cancel entirely the $66 million in repayment of arrears. Moreover, so far as peacekeeping is concerned, the administration sought $619 million for peacekeeping operations in the year ahead, which was itself something of a low estimate, given that the anticipated requirement of the US will be in the order of $1.2 billion.

         Congress has appropriated only $401.6 million of that and, in the process, directed the US administration to continue to work to reduce the US share of new peacekeeping operations to no more than 25 per cent of the total, whereas the United States' current assessment is 31.7 per cent. What all that means in hard percentage terms is that the US Congress has made provision for only about 30 per cent of the likely US UN peacekeeping bill this year. It has withheld 10 per cent of the US assessment to the regular budget and it has not made provision for any arrears payment in 1994.

         As to the implications of all this for UN reform, which is part of the justification for the congressional attitude, let me say that while we certainly agree with a number of the specific objectives the US has in this respect—in particular, we are sympathetic to the proposal to appoint an inspector-general to combat fraud and waste—we do, nonetheless, take the strong view that reform can occur only in an atmosphere of mutual confidence based on member countries meeting their obligations. The UN really would become unworkable and consensus for reform unachievable if countries withdrew unilaterally their financial support. We certainly hope that the majority of members of Congress will recognise that the United States' capacity to influence UN reform simply is not aided by a failure to meet its financial obligations to the UN.

One can make only informed guesses, and the assumptions on which those guesses are made may vary from person to person, depending on whether one takes into account legal and administrative costs as well as the final payment, or some notional monetary value for perhaps non-monetary compensation that is made part of the package.

That being the case, one of the things that I will probably be suggesting in a package that I shall put to my party later on in the year will include a levy for those on higher incomes in lieu of private health insurance.

I have been amazed at the comments made by Dean Brown, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, latching onto, as Senator Foreman said, criticism by one particular journalist in a couple of newspapers in Australia about two weeks ago, claiming that the Japanese were pulling out completely from the MFP.

         Last week, with the Chief Executive of MFP Australia, Mr Ross Kennan, I attended a seminar for the companies in Japan interested in being involved in the MFP. We both attended a seminar for several hours and spoke to representatives of about 40 companies that had indicated their interest. Not one of those companies indicated in any way that it wished to pull out of the MFP. They indicated that they wanted their commitment to continue, but they were honest enough to point out that, because Japan has gone into a recession, Japanese business at the moment is very wary about investing anywhere, let alone in the MFP.

They made the point that as Japan comes out of the recession, interest will therefore grow amongst Japanese companies to look at investment opportunities, including the MFP. They made it quite clear that it would be extraordinarily short-sighted for Australia or some Australian politicians to go around talking down the MFP, trying to bring it to a very sudden end. In fact, some of them were astonished that Australian politicians, for parochial or short-term supposed political advantage, would go around bagging this project.

         It is neither RAAF policy nor practice to allow unqualified pilots to operate RAAF aircraft during take-off or landing. The pilot who carried out the landing was a fully qualified B707 co-pilot who had recently commenced upgrade training to become a captain. The pilot was under the supervision of a currently fully qualified B707 flying instructor. In accordance with RAAF training policy, available flying hours are fully utilised for the training and development of aircrew. For that reason, on both B707 and Falcon 900 flights which are not carrying a VIP, the co-pilot, who is the backup and safety pilot for the captain, flies the aircraft to develop and retain his or her currency.

The appropriate repairs to the aircraft were undertaken immediately, resulting in a very minor delay to the departure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for CHOGM.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Foreman this day, relating to investment in the Multifunction Polis.

        Senator Schacht sought to use question time to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr Dean Brown, was talking down the MFP. In fact, Mr Dean Brown is recognising the reality that in all the years of the concept of the MFP, which must be nearly now a decade, there has been not one single financial commitment by a Japanese or overseas company to the project.

         As I heard in one interview last week, when these expressions of concern were emanating from Japan, as to why there had not been such commitments, the answer that was given—and it is a valid answer—is because there are not any projects in which the Japanese can yet invest. That is the tragedy of this concept—a concept that held great hopes for the future. Despite a decade in which it has been under the control of Labor, it has still not got to the stage where there is any project to which any international investment can be attracted. Surely one has the right to criticise that totally unsatisfactory state of affairs.

         The worst error of judgment that was made in relation to the MFP was the selection of the swamp at Gillman as the site. I have it on good authority that when the Japanese delegation came out and was shown the selected site—the site that the Australian side had selected at Gillman, the swamp—they were simply bemused. They could not understand why something that we would want to trumpet as attractive to international investment would have been selected to be planted in a swamp. Unfortunately, that poor judgment has put the total concept of the project years and years behind. This government has committed tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to try to reclaim the swamp in order that a start might be made to the project.

         It should be fairly said that we ought to be recognising with appreciation the incredible patience of the Japanese in relation to this matter. They are still committed to the concept of international funds helping to build science and scientific research with an industrial application at the really sharp end of international technology. They are also committed to the concept of partnership between Japan and Australia in that regard and of attracting investment from other countries. But we have let them down.

         That is what Mr Brown has said is wrong. He said, `If you can get rid of the concept of the swamp at Gillman and join these institutions in South Australia that have international reputations of the highest level, give them some further capital to help them develop in these areas that are particularly attractive to industry, and offer specific projects to international investors—the Japanese and others—you will have something that you can really develop within the framework of the original concept of the MFP'. If Labor did that, it has a hope of producing real material benefit for Australians.

         The way that this project has gone—this government committing the project to the swamp at Gillman, investing tens of millions of Australian taxpayer dollars which have simply been lost—is evidence of appalling misjudgment. That is what Mr Brown has every right to criticise. Under a new Liberal government in South Australia, the project will have a chance of success because it will get back to the area that has the potential to attract real capital. Finally, after all these years, we might start getting some commitment to projects rather than simply commitment to a concept.

         When this proposal was first launched in this chamber by a former senator, Senator Button, we had undertakings from him that no government money—that was repeated on many occasions when I asked questions; I think I asked some 15 questions on this over the years—was going towards this. This proposal was going to be privately driven. As far as I can ascertain, $167 million has been committed to the MFP at the Gillman site, not all of which has been spent. This is a totally unsatisfactory situation which needs to be repaired by pulling the plug on it now and not simply committing more and more funds to it.

         The other aspect to this, which evidently the opposition has not yet caught up on, is the way in which this Labor government has repeatedly and consistently, over much longer than a decade, run down Australia's research and development capability. It has done so to the point where it is now going overseas on bended knee to the Japanese and to anybody else and saying, `Please come in and provide us with the technology that we are now no longer capable of developing for ourselves'. Australia has been a remarkably productive country. Senator Hill mentioned a moment ago some of the research institutions in South Australia.

         We have been remarkably productive when it comes to basic research. When we have had a piece of basic research which could be turned into some profitable product for sale, we have failed to make the transition through that particular stage. The government needs to come in and recognise those areas and provide assistance. Instead, what this government is doing is further pulling the plug on Australian research and development. The Japanese and other countries that perhaps might be attracted here will take our basic research away and develop it overseas.

         Senator Schacht should know from his own publication, which he put out after the budget, that only 0.4 per cent of research and development funds in last year's expenditure in this area came from foreign companies. Foreign companies are not investing in Australia. We have seen absolutely massive salaries paid to those people who are promoting the MFP—public relations merchants, not scientists. That is where the money is going. As Senator Schacht knows, Mr Kennan is being paid $300,000 per year plus a $70,000 bonus. Over the past few months, a number of other very highly paid people have come in to promote this project because clearly it is failing.

         It is about time that the government recognised that it is failing and not go after the circuses. It is about time that it pulled the plug on it and put the money into those institutions that desperately need it. It should put the money behind those very good Australian scientists who are working with insufficient funds, who are working in decaying buildings with equipment that is falling into disrepair. The government should then get behind that research work and make sure that developments are developed in Australia and do not go overseas. That is what needs to be done, not this stupid idea of multifunction polises.

Senator Schacht, in the dorothy dixer given to his colleague Senator Foreman, was priming up a question which he thought might bring some small amount of embarrassment to his opponents in South Australia; it has blown up in his face. The state of South Australia is directly critical of Premier Arnold and of the minister representing South Australia in this government, Senator Schacht, for their failures to live up to the reality in my state.

         I wish to make two points. The first concerned the executive officer of the MFP, who has already been referred to and who has a very high salary—about one-quarter more than that received by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). His report, released in the middle of this year, was a very clear, plain speaking and straightforward analysis of the MFP as he discovered it in the three months since he had been appointed to the position. He said that there was a whole lot of hype and nonsense being spoken about the MFP—the project he has been appointed to administer—and he wished to disabuse those who were continuing with that hype. He called for a degree of realism in the way in which this whole project might be furthered.

         I see realism in the remarks of my colleague Dean Brown, the Liberal leader in South Australia, who made a clear statement about the reality of this matter in South Australia. I refer not only honourable senators but also members of the press and the Australian public generally to the considered remarks of Mr Kennan, who has been able to look at every element of the MFP. I think Senator Schacht would acknowledge that the realism which has come from that statement must be considered and taken into account, even by him, and he should desist from continuing with the hype and unreality of this matter.

         The second and final matter I wish to refer to is the comment made by Dean Brown, which is that any investment that would generate new activities, whether economic or academic, related to an international project such as the MFP ought to be invested by extension to the institutions that already exist in South Australia. South Australia has three excellent universities; a science and technology centre adjacent to one campus of one of the universities at Salisbury; another science and technology centre in the south that is developing and an industry base in various parts of the city and suburbs. It is in these established areas that the MFP ought to gain some real world shape by way of an extension of these already existing facilities.

         By all means, let South Australia be at the forefront in this country of fresh investment, especially in advanced technologies and in the extension of research, but let us be realistic about it; let us act upon the advice of the chief executive officer of the MFP, Mr Kennan and let us support the views of Dean Brown and the Liberal Party generally in South Australia. They are quite rightly castigating the federal Labor government and the state Labor government of South Australia for living in a world of hype and, ultimately, of nonsense and of misdirecting energies that could be put to a real world outcome. Let us see developments in South Australia which can be best furthered by the election of a Liberal government in the coming weeks.

        If the minister is to criticise what the state leader of South Australia has said he ought to look back and see what some of his state colleagues are saying about the MFP project. It is quite obvious that the remarks made by Dean Brown had been carefully considered in the light of what has happened to the MFP over the last few days and in the light of many of the other issues that have been raised, some by Senator Coulter, with regard to environmental impact of the Gillman site. I await with interest to hear what the minister's comments will be in regard to these matters.

         —I rise to speak to the motion that my question be noted. Firstly, I want to put a couple of things straight with respect to the history of this matter. I fully supported Mr Kennan's remarks made in the middle of this year that the Gillman site was not the only focus for the MFP. As the federal minister responsible for the MFP I welcomed that statement. Since Mr Kennan became the chief executive and now that the project is operating with a fully functioning permanent board, established by legislation in the South Australian parliament at the end of last year, we are now getting action at the MFP.

         I agree that there was unnecessary delay in the previous two or three years, but that was due to the fact that we did not have a functioning MFP corporation board or a permanent chief executive.

From the very moment South Australia won the MFP, Gillman was made the core site. It was known full well that it was an environmentally degraded site. An argument put in favour of the site was that one of the themes of the MFP would be environmental rehabilitation. The Gillman site would be used elsewhere as an example of environmental rehabilitation. That was mentioned in the submission that South Australia put forward to win the MFP. It was not something `snuck up' on the Japanese or anybody else; it was in the South Australian submission. The justification was using environmental rehabilitation as an example.

         The Japanese are still very keen on the environmental rehabilitation aspect of it. However, it has never been said from the beginning that the MFP would only be at Gillman. For example, there are discussions about part of the MFP project being involved in film production on a site in Queensland.

         If we listen to Dean Brown, who is talking about removing the core site and saying that it will only be an adjunct to existing institutions, I think we then run a risk that this will be seen as just another variation of a technology park or science park in Australia, which is different from the MFP. From the federal government's point of view, we are committed to the MFP because of its international nature—not just because it is a tech park. I suspect it will be much more difficult to convince my colleagues in the federal government to give special funding to the MFP if it is a local South Australian tech park. There are a dozen tech parks all around Australia run by state governments. They would all be queuing up for funding. It is the international nature of the MFP that gives it its distinct feature and which attracts the commitment, in principle, for federal government funding for a national project.

         I turn to the Japanese side. Mr Yahiro certainly expressed concern about the delay. I agree with him about the delay, but he made it quite clear that they are committed to the concept of the MFP. All the other senior executives I spoke to at that seminar said exactly the same thing. They made it quite clear that it is the recession that has delayed the investment that we would have liked to have seen. I agree that, until we got the full board and a chief executive this year, there was unnecessary delay back in South Australia with respect to getting that structure in place. We now have it in place. I think that South Australian senators opposite would be much better off being constructive in their criticism. They should remember that tech park and science parks sites are already included in the MFP site.

        A table in that same article shows that the gross annual wage of Mr Keating is $179,174 and that he pays a Medicare levy of $2,508. The questions put to Mr Keating should be: have you had surgery in the past couple of years? Did you go to a private hospital? Did you pay for it yourself? Any private hospital would tell us that 10 per cent of the people who are admitted to it pay their own way—they carry their own insurance. They are already paying a Medicare levy—$2,500 in Mr Keating's case—they are not accessing the public system; they are going to private hospitals and paying their own way.

        That is the way Senator Richardson works. I would like Senator Richardson to know that in the public hospital system—of which I was a proud employee for 30 years at three half days a week in the teaching hospitals in Brisbane—it was the medical necessity that determined where people came on a medical queue. It did not matter whether they were pensioners or whether they were prime ministers. If they had an urgent condition, they went straight to the top of the list. If they had a cancer of some kind, they went straight to the top of the list. We did not care who they were.

         During the election campaign people who were in a position to know how the health system was failing—which included the public hospital system, I might add—pointed out what needed to be done, and that is to encourage as many people as wanted to, to get into private health insurance. There are a lot of battlers in this country who have had private health insurance but who have dropped it, or who are struggling to maintain it.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thank you for your letter of 19 August 1993 to the Hon B. L. Howe, Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, regarding amendments NHP2/1993 to the Nursing Home Financial Arrangements Principles ("the Principles").
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In your letter, you raised concerns regarding certain of the amendments which make provision for determinations by the Minister and by the Secretary of the Department in respect of funding for adjusted fee government nursing homes (AFGNHs).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AFGNHs are State government nursing homes which are funded by the Commonwealth under a similar funding system to that for non-government nursing homes. New subparagraph 2(b)(ii) of the Principles sets out the transitional hourly rate (a component of AFGNHs' funding) which applies to AFGNHs for a maximum of 12 months after they become an AFGNH. The words "or such other amounts as are determined in writing by the Minister for the purpose of taking into account the changes with time in the cost of employing nursing and personal care staff" enable the Minister to vary the rates to take account of increases in award rates for relevant staffing categories. The transitional hourly rates are reviewed every three months and any variations are gazetted. If you consider it necessary, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services is prepared to take measures to amend the Principles to remove the above words, in which case, subparagraph 2(b)(ii) of the Principles will need to be amended every three months. However, the transitional hourly rates apply only to a very small number of State government nursing homes for a very limited time. Moreover, the transfer of State government nursing homes to the different funding system will be completed by the end of 1995/96 at the latest, after which this provision will cease to have any effect.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        New paragraph 18(5)(b) has been deleted by an amendment to the Principles gazetted on 30 June 1993 and tabled on 27 September (amendments NH4/1993).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        New paragraph 21(4)(b) and new subparagraph 32(30C)(a)(ii) both deal with funding for AFGNHs in respect of long service leave costs. AFGNHs' funding entitlement in respect of these costs is based on actual State average proportions of long service leave costs to nursing home payrolls for nursing homes other than AFGNHs in the funding year. During the funding year, the AFGNH receives an advance of its estimated entitlement, calculated using the actual State average proportion for the year before the previous funding year. At the end of the funding year, the home's advance is reconciled with its entitlement and any differences are taken into account in its funding for the following year. Paragraph 21(4)(b) covers the funding advance, while subparagraph 32(30C)(a)(ii) covers the reconciliation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The words "the proportion determined by the Secretary as being the State average proportion of incurred long service leave costs to NPCE for nursing homes other than adjusted fee government nursing homes" have been included in both cases so that, if at the time the State average proportions are calculated for the purposes of the funding advance or reconciliation, data is unavailable in respect of a number of homes, the Secretary can determine State average proportions on the basis of available data. Without this discretion, it would be necessary to include in the Principles, notional State average proportions of long service leave costs to nursing home payrolls based on earlier years, and to amend the Principles annually to update these notional figures.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There would be significant disadvantages in including notional figures in the Principles. What is important to the Government and to the AFGNHs is that the funding be based on accurate State average proportions. Notional figures based on earlier years will necessarily be inaccurate and their inaccuracy will be exacerbated by the lead time required to seek amendments to the Principles to incorporate updated figures. The use of notional figures could, therefore, cause AFGNHs to be significantly financially disadvantaged. If, on the other hand, there is the flexibility to make determinations close to the time advances are made and entitlements calculated, the determinations will relate closely to the actual State average proportions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The whole of the Commonwealth legislation on aged care is currently being reviewed by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Commission will be specifically looking at the role played by subordinate legislation and the issue of sub-delegation. I would, therefore, like to request your Committee to allow the new paragraphs 2(b)(ii) and 21(4)(b) and new subparagraph 32(30C)(a)(ii) to remain on an interim basis.

        Thank you for your letter of 19 August 1993 regarding your consideration of the Fifth Amending Deed to the Deed establishing an occupational superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees and certain other persons under the Superannuation Act 1990 and in particular the changes to Rule 1.1.1.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The changes to Rule 1.1.1 amending the definition of "spouse" and introducing a new definition of "marital relationship" were introduced in order to comply with the amended Sex Discrimination Act 1984 by removing certain discriminatory provisions. These new provisions mirror the changes made to the other Commonwealth schemes (eg the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the Defence Force schemes, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and the Judges Pension Scheme). Importantly the changes provide slightly wider criteria under which persons can qualify for spouses' benefits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Part 11 of the Rules provide an extensive mechanism for the review of decisions made by the Board or by delegates of the Board. These provisions have application where a person requests reconsideration of a decision but also apply where the Board decides to reconsider a decision of its own volition. The discretionary powers provided by the changes to Rule 1.1.1 are subject to these review provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I also mention that it is intended that the scheme under the Superannuation Act 1990 would be subject to the provisions contained in the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993 which are due to come into effect from 1 July 1994. A person could also seek review under that mechanism after the scheme's own review procedures have been complete.

        The need for this urgency motion has become increasingly apparent in recent months around Australia as we move into the 1993-94 summer logging season. There is an emerging consensus amongst conservation groups and those concerned to protect our natural heritage that the state agencies responsible for forest management are ignoring the conservation sections of the national forest policy statement. My own recent trip to the magnificent karri forests around Pemberton in the south-west of Western Australia has provided vivid personal evidence of the disregard shown by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management for the need to protect old growth and wilderness forests.

         The national forest policy statement, which was signed by the Commonwealth government and all state governments except Tasmania in December 1992, was effectively born out of the failure of the current government to obtain agreement in this chamber to its Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1992. That bill and the subsequent national forest policy document received unanimous condemnation from the conservation movement due in large part to their emphasis on harvesting the forests. It is now an outrageous fact that even the limited conservation provisions in this national forest policy are being ignored, confirming the worst fears of the conservation movement that this government was yet again paying lip service only to the concepts of forest conservation and protection.

The first is the establishment of agreed criteria for determination of areas to be protected; secondly, an assessment of forests by state agencies; thirdly, an embargo on forest management activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forests or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value until assessments are complete—that is the crucial one which we are debating today; fourthly, the establishment of conservation reserve systems to protect old growth and wilderness forests on public land by 1995, those forests on private land that are to be protected in conservation reserves are to be established by 1998; fifthly, the development of management plans to appropriately protect old growth forests and wilderness values.

         At this stage of its development, the key element of the strategy is the need for an embargo or moratorium on forestry activities in areas of forest likely to have high conservation value—the third element I mentioned before. If this element of the strategy is not adhered to by all parties, there will be little forest of high conservation value left to be protected. We find that the national forest policy is doing the exact opposite of what it is designed to do; that is, it is actually indicating those remaining areas of high conservation value and yet allowing a time lapse which the state departments are not protecting and which allows the industry to go ahead in those areas.

Also up for logging are sites of significance and reserve wildlife corridors. Harris Daishowa has recently been granted 20,000 cubic metres of whole logs from East Gippsland.

Some pine plantations are so poorly managed, for example, that the value of timber is being lost through lack of thinning and other maintenance operations, yet plantation management could provide both jobs and alternatives to old-growth forest logging.

         Jobs are, in fact, being cut by forest product companies. In the south-west forests of Western Australia, environmentalists have shown that job shedding occurs as the larger timber companies convert processing operations to more highly mechanised forms. Conservationists have shown that small mills, on the other hand, provide more jobs and use logged timber up to 50 per cent more efficiently. They process timber for higher value products such as furniture and building timber rather than woodchips or pulp.

Senator Murphy—and I note he has left since his interjection—was speaking with grave concern about the questionable value adding quality of this particular way of utilising wood. He said that it is very questionable and that the way in which we actually cut down trees should maximise value adding. He continued:

In case Senator Chamarette does not know it, it is not 1995 yet. There is still some time for that representative reserve system to be put into place.

         During the interim period, as part of this cooperative approach, it is also agreed that forest assessments are to be completed by the forest management agencies. These will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value. Both the Commonwealth and the states recognise that some logging in old growth areas has been necessary as their resources are vital to the veneer and sawlog requirements of a major part of the forest industries. Again, these industries employ many people. Veneer and sawlog requirements are a very necessary part of employment in rural and regional Australia. In accordance with these arrangements, the Commonwealth is keen to cooperate with the states. To date, that cooperation has been quite extensive.

         The federal constitution was not drawn up to be the plaything of federal politicians. This is especially so when state governments are behaving responsibly in their management of forestry and in land management. Senator Chamarette's desire to use federal powers to override state responsibility is not the way this country should be run. Federal powers such as export controls, corporations and external powers were never intended to be used in the way that Senator Chamarette is proposing. Although Senator Chamarette's motion does not refer to New South Wales directly, it is primarily about the New South Wales decision to log compartment 1402 of the south-east forests in the Nalbaugh special prescription area.

         In 1990 there was an agreement between Mr Hawke and Mr Greiner—the south-east forest agreement—that would lead to the declaration of a national reserve system in New South Wales. There would have been Commonwealth funding for this. This accord is still alive but has not yet been signed. What we really need is Mrs Kelly to stop the political point scoring and get on with admitting that the 1990 agreement is a valid compromise as a result of which the conservationists will get their additional reserve areas and the industry will get guaranteed access to the remaining resource.

They agreed, firstly, to determine criteria for identifying old growth forests and wilderness; secondly, to undertake assessment of forests for conservation values, including old growth values; and, thirdly—and this is crucial to Senator Chamarette's motion—to avoid activities that may significantly affect old growth forests or wilderness that are likely to have a high conservation value.

         Shortly after the New South Wales government signed the national forest policy statement, Mrs Ros Kelly wrote to the New South Wales government stating that a moratorium should be put in place until comprehensive regional studies, estimated to take four years, had been completed. This covered some 1.4 million hectares of forest in New South Wales and would have resulted in a 52 per cent reduction in the annual sustainable yield from New South Wales state forests.

The national forest policy, which was signed last December by all governments except Tasmania, is a document cynical in its intent. The policy commits the federal and state governments to a strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness areas. Since it was signed, the destruction of our last ancient, old growth forests and wilderness areas has continued apace. There has been no let-up, and there will be no let-up until there is strong pressure brought to bear on this government.

         On the issue of forest protection, the national forest policy outlines a strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness. State forest agencies are to undertake assessments of forests for their conservation and wilderness values as `a matter of high priority'. The strategy also states that until assessments are completed—this is the important point, picking up on Senator Sherry's remarks—forest management agencies will:

         Of course, it is also the role of government to ensure that all people have jobs, but the key point that this government seems unable to appreciate is that sustainable jobs are found in plantations and not in the ever dwindling old growth forests. They are not found in forestry practices that have moved increasingly into high capital, low labour woodchip exports. This government is not acting in the public good. It is in the pocket of the forest industry. If it were acting in the public good, it would use its powers to stop logging in high conservation value areas.

         of 9 and 10 October which reported the findings of a new international barometer conducted in 12 countries, including Australia. The poll found that Australia was a nation gripped with concern. What must come as a surprise to this government is the fact that 69 per cent of those polled worried about the environment. The environment was one of the top three concerns of Australians, coming third after unemployment and violence and personal safety. Australians worried more about the environment than any other country polled. This does not surprise the Australian Democrats, who know that the environment is a deep concern for many Australians. I have personally received many letters from people all around the country about the fate of our forests. These people are very distressed to see our natural heritage being destroyed year after year. They desperately want this federal government to take action to stop this desecration.

It is here purely and simply for the Greens to try to recapture the confidence of the people they upset—in fact, deserted—last Thursday; their own constituents in the Margaret River-Pemberton area where they got most of their vote. They will live with last Thursday's performance for a long time. But this urgency motion will not regain what they lost there because it is based on a false premise, particularly in Western Australia.

         Earlier this century forest services were formed by the state governments to conserve what was left—which was roughly half—of the native forests, and they have been well managed every since then. They have been managed for several uses, such as wood, water, recreation and conservation values. However, it was in the 1980s, due to rising pressure from the Greens in various states, that the federal government interfered, particularly in Tasmania and Queensland, and large areas of forests were locked up from multiple uses. This was due to political pressure stirred by the Greens and acted upon by the Labor government. This was to the detriment of workers in regional Australia.

Its purpose was basically to examine and take evidence about what the truth of the argument was about preservation versus multiple use of forests. In the end that report concluded that native forests could be used largely for multiple use, although some areas needed to be set aside for nature conservation—they needed to be preserved.

This was largely due to political pressure. That matter still has not been resolved.

         We can have our cake and eat it too in terms of providing timber production in agroforestry and in plantations, especially on land that at this stage has been degraded by some other farm practices. Smaller mills can be used for plantation artisan-based production. These areas can exist with beautifully protected old growth forests. Jobs can be created in areas which are attractive to live in or visit. This arrangement has the added benefit of providing extra income, in terms of agroforestry, to those farming sectors that are currently under pressure. We have a very one-sided argument.

         I wish to take this opportunity to address the tabling of the revised strategic plan 1991-93 of the Australian National Maritime Museum. The Australian National Maritime Museum is a cultural resource with great educational and recreational potential. It is important that this museum prevails as a viable cultural institution, both as a monument to the national service of past generations and to our maritime culture, as well as being an historical centre for Australians of the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The museum also represents a diplomatic relationship between Australia and the United States in that the USA gallery was donated to the museum by the former President of the United States, George Bush. The USA gallery is a most interesting gallery. I would recommend that when honourable senators who do not live in New South Wales are visiting Sydney they should go to see the National Maritime Museum and spend some time in that gallery. Australia can look to the museum as a bicentennial consecration of our defence bond with the United States by its portrayal of the history of that bond over the years.

          Currently, however, the Australian National Maritime Museum is suffering from a range of problems in the fields of finance, housing, administration and marketing. Dr Kevin Fewster has a great challenge ahead of him. The coalition supports him in his cause to address those issues and in particular through this strategic plan.

          The National Maritime Museum is slightly off the beaten path for the main group of tourists who visit that area, which poses a problem. Also, the museum was not purpose-built for the particular displays that it has. When I visited the museum I was told that there are enormous overheads on such items as air-conditioning for this very large building. I endorse the strategic plan's view to a more dynamic facility, including greater financial management of projects through staff training, formal procedures and post-project evaluation. The museum had hoped to be more self-supporting than it has been able to achieve and when one visits, one can see some of the problems because of its location and because the building was not specifically designed for that purpose.

          I commend to honourable senators the strategic plan and the museum. Visiting the museum, I believe, enables young Australians to develop a greater understanding of some of the historical developments in Australia because of our isolation. Those of us who remember going to the wharves to see friends off and throw streamers to ships realised then how isolated we were. It was not until we had the migrant postwar influx that many of us were exposed to other cultures in a way that I think many young Australians take for granted now.

          I endorse the needed thrust of the strategic plan towards raising the profile of the museum in the community, not only at the local level but also for the tourist dollar. I would like to take this opportunity to applaud the museum's move to tap into the market of Australian schools through Kay Cottee's promotional correspondence with schools, writing to them and suggesting that they visit the museum. I ask honourable senators to commend the museum to their schools when they are visiting. It is an important part of Australia's history and culture that requires our support. I commend the strategic plan to the Senate.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with 1993-94 Budget decisions and other decisions made by the Government in respect of higher education.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill provides for over $4.6 billion for higher education in 1996, including some $500 million to be provided by the Government through the HECS Trust Account. As well, the bill provides for funds that are additional to those already legislated for. These additional funds total over $50 million in 1993, over $270 million in 1994 and over $320 million in 1995. Measures put forward in the bill will also generate additional revenues of $123 million in 1994, $183 million in 1995 and $126 million in 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has framed the measures covered in this bill to meet the need for enhanced efficiencies in higher education funding. These measures will also advance national goals relating to access, equity, diversity and quality in the system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill's provisions include an amendment to the contribution made by certain students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme—HECS. The change requires students who have already had access to undergraduate, professional and postgraduate opportunities to contribute, in general, twice the standard rate of HECS from January 1994 should they enrol in a second undergraduate course. The reasons for this change are very simple. Every student who undertakes a second undergraduate degree is excluding a school leaver or another person from attending university at all.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other measures put forward in this bill modify repayment arrangements for HECS. From July 1994, repayment rates will be lifted from the present 2, 3 and 4 per cent levels to 3, 4 and 5 per cent respectively. Concurrently with this change, income thresholds for repayment of the HECS debt will be re-aligned with actual average weekly earnings. In addition, from July 1994 HECS repayments will be made on a PAYE and provisional tax basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The HECS amendments in this bill are both equitable and realistic. The measure relating to the amount of contribution stresses that as many Australians as possible should have access to higher education and that those who do have the chance to participate should contribute to the cost of that experience in the fairest way possible. This amendment acknowledges that in a climate of budgetary restraint the opportunities of newcomers to the system, including recent school leavers, have to be protected and that our students need to think very carefully about their study options. The amendment complements other initiatives which the Government is undertaking, in the context of its educational profile negotiations with institutions, to restore opportunities for those new to higher education, especially recent school leavers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All the HECS measures introduced in this bill will reduce Commonwealth Government outlays to higher education and hence the public sector financial burden. HECS is not a tax. It is a deferred repayment loans system. As such, it is in the first instance a Government outlay and any reduction in student contributions requires greater Government expenditure. Income received through HECS is directly linked to the Commonwealth's ability to provide additional student places. In the same way as HECS has already provided opportunities for more Australians to participate in higher education, the HECS measures in this bill are essential for the Government to meet its ongoing commitment to increased access.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provisions relating to income thresholds and the rates at which the HECS debt is repaid shorten the repayment period—from 15 to 9 years for the typical graduate—without increasing the actual cost to students. These measures also recognise that Commonwealth funding of the massive growth in higher education since 1989 has substantially exceeded HECS revenue. For example, income from HECS last year, including up-front payments, voluntary repayments and payments against HECS debt assessments by the Australian Taxation Office amounted to about $195 million. This was less than 5 per cent of the total Commonwealth 1992 outlay on higher education of $4.3 billion, which was $274 million above the level of funding provided in 1991. Outstanding HECS debts currently total in excess of $2 billion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under another measure introduced in this bill, students undertaking at least 75 per cent of a full-time study load through the new Open learning Initiative (OLI) will have access to a deferred payment facility similar to HECS. The OLI is already extending opportunities for a significant number of Australians who would otherwise find it difficult to participate in higher education by virtue of work commitments or other circumstances. Provision already exists for the Government to fund the development of a decentralised network to support open learning students. A deferred payment facility will further help these Australians by making it easier for them to make the required contribution to the costs involved in their education.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additional growth in higher education for 1994 and 1995 has already been announced. This bill further expands opportunities for access in 1995 and 1996 with its provisions concerning any spare capacity which institutions may have.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill's amendments in respect of research and postgraduate education funding reflect the Government's policy of encouraging the higher education sector to maintain and strengthen its quality of provision and high international standing. The Government will continue the Research Infrastructure Program beyond 1994 at an enhanced level, providing $56.4 million in 1995 and $60 million from 1996 with total Infrastructure Program funding amounting to $176.4 million over the 1995-97 triennium. From January 1994, the Government will integrate the Australian Postgraduate Research Awards, the Australian Postgraduate Course Awards and HECS Exemption Scholarships into a single Australian Postgraduate Awards Scheme. 20,700 of these new Awards will be available in 1994, rising to 25,500 in 1997, an increase that will help expand participation in postgraduate education and thereby assist Australia to enhance its competitive edge in higher education and research. These measures will complement the further deregulation of postgraduate provision, allowing universities to build a postgraduate fee-paying market. Universities will be free to innovate, for example, by using Commonwealth postgraduate load to subsidise fee-paying students.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's commitment to increasing the efficiency, flexibility and productivity of the higher education labour market is reflected in its support for the introduction of workplace bargaining. A national framework agreement for agency bargaining has been reached which the Government will support. This bill provides for on-going supplementation to be made available to universities for funding economic adjustments consistent with the Australian Public Service arrangements which provide 1.4 per cent followed by 1.5 per cent twelve months later. The arrangements cover both academic and general staff.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the Government will offer to each institution an advance of funds for a sector wide productivity related salary increase of up to 2 per cent for both academic and general staff. This would be conditional on there being agreement as regards a broad range of productivity related measures. There will be no on-going supplementation provided by the Government for productivity related salary increases.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill seeks to consolidate amounts at present specified separately in the legislation for quality, research, equity, National Priority (Reserve) Fund and advanced engineering centres. The distribution of funds across these programs is determined three years in advance but allocations to universities for most of these programs are made annually. This unnecessarily inhibits the capacity of Government and higher education institutions to respond to needs that emerge over the course of a triennium.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While this bill proposes the consolidation of funding, the specific purposes for which grants can be made will remain unaltered and programs will not be administratively affected. While the total level of available funding will continue to be legislated three years in advance, allocations will be decided annually and announced in the yearly higher education funding report. The value of this measure lies in the increased flexibility it will accord to recurrent funding arrangements. This will in turn assist universities and the Commonwealth to achieve their objectives with greater efficiency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In summary, the measures put forward in this bill are part of the Government's overall strategy for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the higher education sector. These measures seek to expand opportunities for Australians while recognising that there are limits to the contribution available from the tax-payer. They aim, in addition, to stimulate Australia's diverse higher education sector to maximise its capacity for providing a high quality product that meets the needs of its students and the nation as a whole.

It is considered that the proposed improvement will, in addition to restraining costs under the scheme, simplify its administration; and finally

        Secondly, amendments to the Excise Act 1901 (together with amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921) to address revenue loss due to the practice of brewing beer with the aid of commercial facilities in unlicensed premises (known as "microbreweries") and , in particular, to ensure that beer produced at microbreweries is subject to both customs control and to duties of excise. While the excise revenue loss is relatively minor at present, overseas experience indicates the potential for substantial revenue erosion;

        Thirdly, amendments to the Excise Act 1901 (together with amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921) to address substantial revenue loss through the substitution of excise free or low duty products for petroleum fuels. Resolution of this issue involves ensuring certain blended petroleum products and crude oil or condensate delivered for use otherwise than as refinery feedstock are excisable products, and that the excise duty payable on the blend,  the crude oil or condensate will be payable at a rate equal to either the diesel rate or the leaded petrol rate, depending upon the composition of the petroleum product;

        Fourthly, amendments to the Excise Act 1901 to provide that where either blended petroleum products or crude oil are duty paid at the rate applicable to diesel fuel and where the products are for use in an eligible manner for the purposes of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, then a rebate of duty under that scheme is payable; and

         —I will now add a few brief remarks to the second reading of the Childcare Rebate Bill 1993, as agreed. Firstly, this is a very appropriate time for this bill to be introduced as this is children's week. Secondly, it is also very appropriate because this is an election promised made and an election promise kept. The child-care rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense in earning an income. The government, in recognising that, does not intend to means test the rebate because it is like all other expenses associated with the earning of an income—they, too, are not income tested.

         This child-care rebate, taken with the other child-care initiatives, means that Australia becomes the first nation to put together a coherent and integrated program which caters for the needs of working parents. We recognise in Australia the importance of women having the opportunity to participate, particularly in the labour market. This child-care rebate contributes to that package of child-care measures to allow women real choices when it comes to work and family. In summary, we accept the reality that child care is a crucial support to the labour market and to labour market participation and recognises that it is a cost necessarily incurred by parents in the earning of an income.

        On 20 October 1993, the Senate referred eight Bills relating to the wool industry to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for consideration and report. These Bills reflect many of the recommendations and conclusions contained in the report of the Wool Industry Review Committee, which was chaired by Professor Ross Garnaut.

         The Bills establish two organisations. The first organisation, to be known as Wool International, will assume responsibility for discharging the $2.28 billion debt and disposing of the 3.9 million bales in the stockpile, currently held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The second organisation, the Australian Wool and Promotion Organisation will be responsible for generic wool promotion and wool research and development.

         The Committee held a public hearing last Friday, 22 October 1993, and received oral evidence from seven organisations and two individuals. The Committee was particularly pleased that Professor Garnaut made himself available, not only to give evidence to the Committee, but to participate in a round table discussion with other witnesses and members of the Committee. The Committee also received twenty submissions on the Bills.

         The report of the majority of the Committee outlines many of the issues raised at the hearing, particularly the fixed disposal schedule and the role of Wool International, as provided for in the Wool International Bill 1993. The Committee's report recommends to the Senate that the eight wool industry bills be agreed to without amendment. However, the Committee also urges the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to consult fully with the industry on the further development of Wool International and to give further consideration to the Government's position on the future funding of wool promotion. I should indicate that the document that I have just tabled includes a dissenting report from Senator Woodley.

         The problem that has arisen in the past is that many of the reports from the authority have contained wrong or inadequate information on which the minister has then made a determination. The applicants in the anti-dumping action were precluded from drawing this to the minister's attention because time simply ran out. The only course of action open to them would be to go to the court. The provision as its stands, `as soon as practicable', in reality meant very often after the minister made his determination. This is why I prepared the amendment that the report be published at the same time as it is given to the minister.

         (5.24 p.m.)—Senator Spindler has spoken to me privately about this matter. I cannot give the categorical assurance that Senator Spindler would like. I am only in my first six months in the job on Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority and am still coming to terms with dealing with 40-page reports about the whole procedure which technically is extraordinarily complex. However, one of the things I have quickly come to realise is that whichever way one jumps in relation to these reports, invariably someone will challenge and make complaints if they are on the losing side of a decision. Therefore, I am very cautious at the moment in making any commitment such as Senator Spindler seeks.

         When the reports come from the Anti-Dumping Authority at the completion of its inquiries, I shall try to deal with them as expeditiously as possible, so that the time I sign them is about the same time they are being distributed to the public. However, if Senator Spindler wants to set in concrete the situation that, before I sign and agree to the initial report from Customs or to the authority's report, they are released and circulated, that means that people will lobby me not to sign or they will put information for me to argue the case that I reject the authority's recommendations.

         That raises the issue that there is much more chance that the minister will be challenged in the court about why he made certain decisions. Then he will have to explain that company A, B or C came along and disagreed with the information. It then comes to the stage where the minister would have to argue that he has rejected information provided by the authorities for which he is responsible—namely, Customs and/or the Anti-Dumping Authority—after they have gone through a process of investigation, et cetera, and that he has taken advice separately from a company which may feel it is being hard done by in the report.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Judging by my limited experience so far, I would say that is somewhat of a Pandora's box. In my assessment of what Senator Spindler raised here in the chamber today, it would mean that there would be much greater emphasis on trying to convince the minister to overturn either Customs' initial report or the Anti-Dumping Authority's report later on, rather than relying on a process that this parliament has established with very clear-cut legislation about a transparent process. On balance, I would rather stick with the transparent process laid down in the legislation than try as a minister to second-guess before I sign or am lobbied. I think that would open up another argument about the political pressures, lobbying by sectional groups and so on.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not think this issue is as clear-cut or as advantageous as Senator Spindler may say it is. I am not saying that because I wish to avoid hearing representations or arguments. I hear them anyway because people who feel aggrieved by reports lobby all the time to have a re-hearing and so on, which is a process that is available under the legislation.

         Although I cannot give Senator Spindler the assurance he would like, I think that in the circumstances the wording `as soon as practicable' is reasonable. The authority, the bureaucracy itself, very much would like me to make it clear-cut. That is why they put the suggestion to me that it only be released clearly after I have signed it so that there is no doubt, which has some merit in my view in making the process very clear-cut. However, because of the views in the Senate, we are not proceeding with that. We are staying with the status quo. If Senator Spindler asks me the same question in six months, I may be willing, with a bit more experience, to chance my arm on some of this. I warn anybody that dealing with dumping inquiries is not a game for new players or for people to do things off the cuff.

         Each decision that one makes substantially affects industry, investment and employment one way or the other. Senator Spindler knows that because he has argued the case here so often. But I think any minister of the crown has to be very careful about that responsibility. I take on board what Senator Spindler says. I will discuss it with my officers in the Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority. I cannot give the honourable senator the categorical assurance he needs, but I do take on board what he has said.

         Secondly—and the minister might like to respond to both these questions: if the authority's representatives, through the department, are here, could they advise what the normal practice is when they provide the minister with a report? What is `as soon as practicable to the public'? Is it within an hour of delivering it to the minister's office; is it within a day; is it within a week; or is it waiting until after the minister has made a determination to cut off any influence or any attempt at rectification by the people concerned?

But, from my recollection of six months, the authority puts them to me for reading and signing before it releases them. Of course, I have the option not to sign a dumping authority. I have not refused to sign any; I have not rejected any so far. Again, the consequences of rejecting a report by the Anti-Dumping Authority would probably mean that I, as the minister, would very rapidly be in court trying to explain why I rejected the authority's report. As far as I can recollect—and I cannot be absolutely exact on it—Customs gets a determination out as soon as it can, irrespective of the minister's position, and the Anti-Dumping Authority, by and large, publishes or circulates it after I have signed it.

Again, I think that is a reasonable point. All I can say is that is one point to which I am sympathetic because of my experience on the Senate cost of justice inquiry.

         However, if we try to give people the opportunity to check the draft report, so to speak, I suspect there will be some hooks in it. There is then a question that some people may check and get something corrected and other protagonists may not have checked or had the same access in the same time. Arguments of natural justice may then occur about whether the process was even and transparent to all the parties concerned—whatever. But, because of Senator Spindler's and my concern about keeping legal costs down, I will raise that matter with both the Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority.

However, I could not help noticing that the bounties on computers—and I have mentioned some of the companies—are continuing until 1995. We are not sure exactly what the government or the opposition will do to support these kinds of bounties after that time.

         I also point out that, by and large, the spin-off from the necessary defence expenditure will very much flow into civilian applications. Senator Margetts has been talking about such things as satellite sensing and surveillance. Overwhelmingly the biggest market in the future within our own region is for quite benign civil application of such technology. For example, the remote detection of changes in sea levels will be done by satellites with sensing equipment developed first of all for a military application. There will now be a spin-off and this equipment will be used to do something that I would think the Greens from Western Australia would be very pleased to see; that is, monitoring for environmental reasons such things as the height of the oceans, land degradation and changes in the use of land.

Again, this measure is designed to help Australian industry. But an agreement was reached with the industry to extend further the wind-down in the book bounty. In both cases these are reasonable pieces of legislation in line with the government's philosophical position of reducing assistance and tariffs, where necessary, while providing bounties to assist and maintain an Australian indigenous industry that we all support.

The Greens are clearly in the protectionist camp and believe in protecting Australian industries. We join with the government in supporting the controlled, ordered reduction in protection of industries. There have been attempts through these bounty procedures to look after and protect the domestic computer industry. It is a furphy and is hypocritical for the Greens to suggest that particular industries should not be protected because of the morality of other activities that a particular company might be involved in.

         —Predictably, the opposition has jumped to the defence of the government's policy to rescue our economy on the basis of becoming armaments manufacturers and arms pedlars in the region. I would have thought it would be clear by now to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) as well the opposition that the cold war has ended, that there is supposed to be a new world order and that we are supposed to be turning swords into ploughshares. I would have thought it is not beyond the wit of our government and of our industries to start with the civilian uses of high tech rather than use that spin-off as a pretext for engaging in weapons manufacturing and arms peddling. The lack of morality in that stance has been well and truly established over the centuries. I really do not see how with equanimity we can tolerate a government that says that our economic salvation depends on the manufacture of arms.

         Certainly the argument that we need to be self-sufficient does not hold water. To be self-sufficient, we need patrol boats to ensure that our coastline is guarded; we need to be self-sufficient in the equipment that we need to guard our shoreline. We do not need equipment to become involved in so-called forward defence, which is part and parcel of other nations' global military strategies. I would have thought that the government would consider the changed strategic situation in the world and desist from supporting an industry that will drag us deeper and deeper into the mire of arms manufacturing and peddling on the pretext of producing some civilian spin-offs.

         Industries in the United States and Europe, which have so far been engaged in the manufacture of war planes, tanks and other armaments, are finding uses for high technology and their equipment to produce material and goods which are useful in peacetime and advance the social aspirations of their communities. I find it extremely disappointing that our government is prepared to shrug off these arguments and say that there is a buck to be made in making arms and peddling them to the region. I believe it is something that needs to be considered. In currently providing succour and assistance to these industries for these purposes, the government needs to conduct some careful examination and to make some adjustment.

         However, this is exactly the reason that I questioned why the government chose this industry as an exception. The exception is an industry which is involved with arms manufacture and arms exportation. Why are these things important? Why are other industries, which are being squeezed to the point of destruction, not considered important to support in terms of employment and the kind of revenue that they provide back to the government—revenue which many of these other multinational industries do not generate?

         —I do not want to delay the committee, but I have to make a couple of further points, particularly after Senator Spindler's contribution. I find it a little strange that Senator Spindler, who consistently argues for government intervention and support to develop industry, refers to the fact that the range of industries that are listed are definitely involved in defence. All the industries have civilian application and all provide work in Australia and employ Australians. However, Senator Spindler believes that this industry has to be wound down and that people have to be removed from it because the Cold War has ended. I certainly agree with Senator Spindler that the Cold War may have ended, but for the sake of public security there is still a need to maintain a sufficient defence force for Australia. Future consequences, which we cannot judge at the moment, may change.

         We have a modest defence force in Australia that is adequate for our needs. Part—not all—of the computer bounty is defence related and exists to help us have a self-sufficient defence force. What I find particularly strange is that the Australian Democrats have argued for a decade or more that they want a neutral position for Australia in defence matters and that we should not have any alliances. If that position exists, one then has to argue for a strong defence force because one will have no international alliances. An independent defence force would be needed to show the Australian people that we could completely defend ourselves against all contingencies without our having any alliances.

I may disagree or agree with aspects of his argument, but on this aspect I do not think he ought to get his fingers jammed in the door by saying, `Let's knock all this over because it is contrary to the Australian Democrats' defence policy which envisages an independent defence force for Australia'.

I would have thought that, if he was going to attack us, he would have said that the bounty is not big enough for these computer industries, rather than that it is too big. Again, I emphasise that these companies do not get the bounty if they do not comply with the requirement that the equipment has to be made in Australia. Compliance with that requirement makes them eligible for assistance. As a result, I am advised that there may be less in this list that is actually purely defence related than the list that Senator Margetts has tabled would indicate.

         I say to Senator Spindler and to the Democrats that we agreed, in negotiations on the budget, to introduce a $20 million bounty for the production of ethanol. I think that is a very good outcome for the industry portfolio. If, in the longer term, we can get ethanol to replace lead—even though I have some constituents in Port Pirie who make good quality lead at the Port Pirie smelter—that would be good for Australian industry. Above all else, it would be good for Australian kids. It is a bounty for ethanol production. We will not be selective about who is eligible for bounty, as long as they meet the production requirement. That is the way it ought to be.

When we say that Australia should be self-sufficient and independent in defence matters and should be able to defend its shoreline, we are not saying—or implying—that Australia must produce each and every item of defence equipment that it requires. That is clearly not feasible for a country of 17 million people. We are saying that Australia should be independent and that it should not become a weapons manufacturer or an arms pedlar, either to the region or to the world at large.

         —This is the third reading of the first tax bill, Mr Acting Deputy President. You will remember that that was the bill in which the government intended to increase tax on credit unions. It has been limited to some extent by a request of the Senate in that regard. It was another exercise of how a Senate committee—in that instance I moved for that, I think—served a useful purpose. The government has had to respond to the numbers in that regard.

         It is also the bill that included the government's intention to extend the fringe benefits tax in a way that would have detrimentally affected the tourism industry without any real research as to whether there was an abuse which needed to be countered at all, which was the interesting thing in that regard. We would support avoidance measures, but the government had not done the work and it came along with this astonishing notion that people were being subsidised to take more expensive hotel beds in lieu of salary. It did not make sense. When the government was asked to justify it, we found that it had not thought it through. It was just another revenue producing measure, but the government had also made a mistake in that it was unlikely to produce the revenue it had anticipated. The government has had no choice but to take that one away and rethink it. I doubt whether we will ever see it again because, I think, quietly, it recognises that it was not a very smart idea.

         Australia needs capital injection to build its tourist infrastructure, particularly as the Olympic Games approaches. What government in its right mind would impose measures that would have the contrary effect of reducing the incentive to put capital into speculative, as it always is to some extent, major capital infrastructure for tourism? These tax measures were not properly thought through. The third measure was the one that I started out with which was the retrospective taxation of accrued long service leave and accrued annual leave. The government has now been forced to back away from both of those as well.

         This is an exercise where at least the Senate has been able to fulfil a useful function and, to some extent, bring this government to heel. There is no doubt that we would have liked to have done it to a much greater extent. We were very anxious to defeat 1.4 per cent of the government's revenue in these taxation packages. There is no doubt about that because the government did not seek the mandate that it should have at the last election and as Senator Schacht's leader in this place, Senator Gareth Evans, said in this place in 1981 in relation to our sales tax bills, `It is legitimate that we oppose them because you did not seek a mandate at the last election'. Not only did the government not seek a mandate but also it lied to the Australian people about its taxation intentions. We, therefore, had every right to oppose those taxes. If we could have persuaded the minority parties in this place to support us, we would have defeated them and then Australians would have been even better off.

         Why would they have been even better off? Because the regressivity would have been overcome and because taxes on business—taxes that will be a disincentive to growth of business, investment in business and, therefore, the production of jobs—would not have been allowed to go ahead. But we were unsuccessful, I regret to say, in persuading the minority parties. To that extent, we only got them part of the way but at least the parts that I have mentioned are worthwhile changes and I am pleased that ultimately the government has had no choice but to therefore accept the request.

         I understand that Senator Hill felt the need to leap up and salve some wounded pride from the fact that the opposition set out to achieve one objective and failed and the government has overwhelmingly got the legislation that it wished passed with some amendments, some with which we agreed. I think the credit union amendment is an improvement and the committee unanimously made a recommendation. I welcome that and I think that was an improvement. I do not question that. Some of the others were not but they were within the acceptable parameters of getting an acceptable revenue outcome for the government.

         With regard to the linkage matter, it was always the case that whether the Senate resolved by legislation that linkage existed or not, it did, and now that all the revenue measures have been passed in accordance with the requirements which we set out in the first instance, obviously we no longer require that linkage clause in the relevant bill. We were happy, therefore, to accede to the request because the linkage was no longer required. The revenue measures upon which the passage of that bill depended have now been passed to the satisfaction of the government. But I do welcome the fact and I accept, as Senator Hill said, that the opposition is supporting the third reading. I do not want to extend the debate any more.

         The amendments in Part 1A of the bill are being introduced as a precautionary measure pending implementation of all the essential elements of the new arrangements based on the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA. In particular, the Commonwealth is concerned that most States and Territories have not yet introduced the complementary legislation which Heads of Government agreed would be necessary to give full effect to their July 1992 agreement on the National Vocational Education and Training System.

This new power is tied explicitly to the provisions of the Heads of Government agreement and could not be used by the Commonwealth to impose additional requirements on the States and Territories.

For this reason, the legislation provides that the new power to withhold funds would be available to the Commonwealth Minister only until the end of 1995. There would be no ongoing power for Commonwealth intervention in the allocation of funds through ANTA.

         This bill proposes an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 to complement amendments made last year to the nursing home benefit payments scheme by the National Health Amendment Act 1992.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health Amendment Act 1992 was enacted to address inequities in the recovery of unspent Commonwealth nursing home benefit when a nursing home is sold. These problems flowed from a quirk in the legislation which meant that amounts of unspent benefit were not legally characterised as debts to the Commonwealth. Where a nursing home proprietor accrued a liability and sold the nursing home, that vendor could not be pursued for the money after the sale. The purchaser became liable for that amount.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whilst the Commonwealth nevertheless had a statutory duty to recover such amounts, they could only be recovered via an offset or ongoing "negative fee loading" to the approved daily nursing home fee and, by extension, the amount of Commonwealth benefit payable each month. This sometimes resulted in the purchaser acquiring a home subject to a liability accrued by a former proprietor. Although the industry was well aware of these arrangements and usually made appropriate provisions in contracts of sale, problems still occurred.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health Amendment Act 1992 addressed this situation by providing that amounts of unspent benefit were characterised as debts recoverable from the vendor on sale. It contained a number of key measures to support its purpose, including a requirement for vendors to give 90 days notice of a sale. This period of notice enables the vendor's claims for Commonwealth benefit, books and records to be examined so that, prior to completion of the sale, a fair estimate of any overpayment can be made.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, these changes only apply prospectively, applying to benefits paid after the commencement of the National Health Amendment Act 1992 on 1 July 1993. Benefits paid prior to the commencement of that Act are not subject to its provisions and the pre-existing system of recovery by fee loading continues to apply in respect of benefits paid up to 30 June 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The two bills tabled for consideration in the current sittings together allow for the debt recovery measures to extend prior to 1 July 1993. The Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 imposes a "charge" on the vendor of a nursing home on sale, equal to the amount of any benefit unspent by the nursing home up to 30 June 1993. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 sets out the administrative arrangements for the collection and recovery of such amounts from the vendor on sale of a nursing home.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This latter bill also provides that where the Commonwealth holds monies in trust for the benefit of the vendor pending completion of an investigation of the nursing home accounts, and on completion it is found that money is repayable to the vendor, the Commonwealth is liable to pay interest at commercial rates on the amount repayable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These measures complement those in the National Health Amendment Act 1992. They provide, effectively, that amounts of unspent benefit paid prior to the recent prospective amendments, are recoverable from the vendor as debts on sale.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health Amendment Act 1992 received the support of both the nursing home industry and the coalition, as expressed in the House by the honourable member for Bradfield, Mr Connolly and in the Senate by Senators Newman and Patterson. Those who spoke did, however, express a concern, shared by the industry and the Government alike, that there was a need for those measures to be applied prior to 1 July 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 addresses that need by complementing the National Health Amendment Act 1992 to augment the protection already given to the rights of purchasers of homes, provide a more equitable system and enable the Commonwealth to recover unspent moneys in a more timely manner.

        Earlier this evening the Senate was debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 which deals with five separate social security matters. First, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to give effect to the government's election promise of a senior's health card. This card will be available to retirees with incomes below the part pension threshold who are not eligible for the pension.

        The coalition does not oppose this beneficial initiative but notes that the government has postponed its commencement until July 1994. The Australian public ought to be reminded—and I will continue to remind older Australians—that they were promised during the election campaign that the card would commence in April 1994. So yet another promise of this government has been broken. Older people were promised to be taken out of the taxation system by 1995 if they were on a pension. That promise was dismantled five days after the election because of some feeble excuse of the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins. In fact, the opposition believes the government knew before the election that it would not meet that promise. This is yet another promise that was broken after the election.

        The most contentious change in this bill is the decision to include certain employer funded fringe benefits, namely, motor vehicles, housing loans, school fees and private health insurance in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for Jobsearch and Newstart allowees aged under 18. This initiative, which is due to commence on 1 January 1994, is based on the premise that taxable income is not always a fair indication of disposable income because it includes a range of non-monetary benefits for which employers pay fringe benefits tax. The planned income test will apply when the total annual fringe benefit exceeds $1,000.

        The main bone of contention in relation to this provision has been its application to the Australian defence forces.

        When considering this contentious proposal it is beneficial to examine the history of these social security payments. It was the Menzies Liberal government that introduced child endowment in 1941. Senators on this side of the chamber should be justifiably proud that their Liberal predecessors had the foresight to introduce such an important financial recognition of the costs of raising a family. It was also another Liberal government, the Fraser government, which in 1976 replaced the child endowment with a non-income or assets tested family allowance system. The current family payments system, which comprises a basic family payment which has replaced family allowance and an additional family payment, is both income tested and assets tested.

        The main rationale for imposing these incomes and assets tests is the fact that in a needs based system of assistance finite revenue resources should be targeted to those families which are in greatest need. However, it is equally important in a needs based system that people with equal financial needs receive equal financial assistance. This is the principle of equity.

        It has become very apparent, both in the family payments system as well as in other payments such as Austudy, that the current income and assets test do not ensure that the finite cake is distributed equitably. People with notional incomes that are sometimes well above the cut out limits or thresholds are able to receive assistance because these notional incomes are not taken into account in the current income test.

        The coalition has recognised in its welfare policy that if Australia is to continue to pursue a needs based system of assistance then that system should be effective in ensuring that assistance is targeted to those who are most in need. With this initiative, the Labor government is belatedly recognising the fact that some people have been able to circumvent its family payment income test because it does not take such notional benefits into account.

        Hence, the coalition is in favour of the initiative generally because it will provide a better targeted needs based family payments system. However, its application to our defence and police forces is an entirely different matter. In both cases, the application of this provision would affect housing related assistance provided by the beneficiary's employer. However, in neither case could such assistance be reasonably considered to be a fringe benefit. On 2 May 1986, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who was then the Treasurer, stated:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees—especially higher income earners—by fringe benefit packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no possible way that the housing assistance that is provided to our defence and police forces could be considered to fit the ex-Treasurer's definition. The defence and police housing assistance is certainly not confined to higher income earners, nor is it an attempt to avoid tax.

Most importantly, there is absolutely no way that assistance by the provision of housing could be considered to be a `perk' in that normal meaning of the word.

        In the case of the defence forces and police forces, it is obviously compensation—but do not just believe me. The specific goals of the government's own policy in relation to housing for the Australian Public Service and the Defence Force include, firstly, compensating personnel for housing related disabilities consequent upon frequent relocation where this is required as a condition of service; secondly, providing adequate accommodation for personnel who are required in the course of duty to reside in locations where suitable alternative accommodation is not available, or who are required for essential operational reasons to reside at Defence Force or APS premises; thirdly, minimising financial disabilities of personnel required to relocate frequently, which are due to interregional differences in housing costs; fourthly, providing that an APS or Defence Force member not be out of pocket from reasonable expenses incurred in changing houses; and, fifthly, minimising housing related detriment to morale of personnel and families when personnel are required to relocate frequently.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The common theme that runs through each of these specific goals is the fact that such payments are compensations for conditions of service endured by the person who receives the payment. This fact was reiterated in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, which stated:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Defence force members are required to serve, when, where and as required, often in the most hazardous circumstances . . . Family moves are regular, sometimes seemingly random and frequently stressful . . . The ethos of service remains paramount.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the concept of service, in the context of this provision, is secondary to the overriding fact that these payments are not fringe benefits but are compensatory in nature, it nevertheless figured strongly in the evidence provided to the Senate committee by the police representatives. Senior Sergeant O'Gorman's evidence is very telling. He stated:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       If you are transferred to a remote or disadvantaged area, which is usually where the highest majority of our people are provided with housing, you have no choice about where you live; you will live in the house that is attached, sometimes physically attached to the police station where you will perform your duty. You are usually operating in areas where you are the lone police officer, or one of two.
      </para>
      <para>
       Later in the same address he said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       When the police officer is away from the residence or away from the station performing duty . . . the police officer's partner or spouse is required to remain at the residence/police station and continue the operational functioning of that police station.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would have liked to have said this to the Greens and the Australian Democrats. Senator Woodley is here, and I would like him to listen carefully to what Senior Sergeant O'Gorman said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       When people are arrested and placed in cells, the cells are usually in the yard of the police residence, usually within 20 metres of the house. The incessant abuse and the type of abuse that issues from those cells should not be inflicted on anybody. Police officers themselves can deal with it, but the families are required to deal with it. The families are required to feed these people and attend to their needs if the police officer is absent, and these are the families that this legislation is asking to pay a higher level of tax for the `privilege' of serving in those sorts of areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is not a fringe benefit. We are saying that it is compensation for the fact that they have to live in those places and also that their families have to deal with the sorts of things that Senior Sergeant O'Gorman was talking about. It is obvious that the application of this initiative to the housing assistance that is provided to members of our defence forces and police forces is a significant departure from the normally accepted definition of `fringe benefit'. In the committee stage, I will be moving to remove both the defence forces and the police forces from the relevant definition of `current employee' in the bill. This will have the effect of precluding the application of this fringe benefit income test from assistance that is totally compensatory in nature.

        —The amendments to the Social Security Act contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 before us today will impact in five areas. Firstly, they will make foreign currency provisions more responsive to market exchange rate fluctuations. At present, the exchange rates used in assessing overseas income for the purpose of determining pension entitlements are adjusted four times a year. With the daily fluctuations of the Australian dollar against other currencies, this system may not give an accurate indication of a person's entitlement. This bill proposes to have a new exchange rate for each nominated currency to be determined each and every pension payday.

        The Australian Democrats acknowledge the problem and accept this proposed change. My only concern with the move is that in response to the overseas income adjustments, a person's entitlement may need to be adjusted fortnightly. My concern is that this could lead to an absolute barrage of letters of advice going out to people. As anyone who has been a social security recipient would tell us, the number of letters they receive can be phenomenal. We hope this measure does not exacerbate this situation.

        As honourable senators will be aware, the issue of inclusion of certain employer provided fringe benefits in a number of social security income tests was the subject of an inquiry conducted earlier in the week by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The underlying issue which was the subject of the committee's considerations was whether or not taxable income is really an adequate measure to use when assessing a person's eligibility for certain social security allowances. The bill before us today seeks to include certain employer provided fringe benefits in the income test for family payment and in the parental income test for those aged under 18 applying for jobsearch allowance or sickness allowance. The Democrats support this change.

        The inclusion of these fringe benefits reflects the recommendation of the 1992 Chapman report on Austudy, and a similar change to that which we are now discussing for social security will shortly be effected to Austudy through regulations. The argument behind these changes is that, by including such benefits, we get a better picture of people's real income level and their need for government assistance. Under the current system of income testing, some recipients have real incomes which would normally exclude them from eligibility.

        The primary focus of the community affairs committee's considerations was to decide whether or not it was justifiable to include the benefits I mentioned before, particularly as they apply to service families and to police, in these social security income tests. The committee received representations from various service groups and the Police Federation of Australia and New Zealand. These people argued that there is a distinction between fringe benefits and specific conditions of service and that the rental subsidy provided to our service families and police is not a fringe benefit, but rather a condition of service which partially compensates for the disadvantages and difficulties inherent in service life. In particular, we are talking about the operational need for postings to various locations.

        The Democrats understand these arguments. However, we believe the overriding issue that needs to be considered is  people's ability to meet living costs and their associated need for government assistance. At the moment, the income cut-off for basic family payment is $64,938 per year with $3,249 for each additional child, combined with an assets limit, exclusive of the family home, of $600,000. These figures will be reduced next year to $60,000 and $550,000 respectively.

        At the inquiry the Department of Social Security indicated that it believes the majority of Defence Force personnel—about 70 per cent, I believe—to be affected by this change would be in the position of losing their basic family payment; in other words, those for whom the inclusion of fringe benefits will take their income above this $60,000 a year limit. This seems to be a large number of our defence personnel earning just short of $60,000, which surprises me somewhat. I am not sure that I agree with the assumption the department used in arriving at that figure, but I will leave that to one side for the moment.

        The income cut-off for maximum rate additional family payment, and the health care card that goes with it, is $20,950 a year with an additional $624 allowed for each extra child. The allowance begins to cut out at around $25,000 with an additional $3,800 allowed for each extra child. So a family with three children is allowed an income of around $36,000 a year before its additional family payment is withdrawn totally. The Department of Social Security estimates that around 30 per cent of defence families affected will see a change to their additional family payment entitlement.

Although the Greens certainly catch up more people in their amendment, there are still people left outside, and even more left outside of the proposed opposition amendment.

        I wish to spend a little time on the final change proposed in this bill for it relates to the Australian Democrats' long held concern for self-funded retirees. From 1 July 1994 all people of age pension or age service pension age with an income below the pension cut off point will be eligible for a seniors health card. The legislation before us today will provide holders of that card with concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions, and legislation to follow soon will provide card holders with certain dental and optometry services.

        The government has estimated that around 200,000 people will qualify for the card, including many who have been previously precluded from pension eligibility on the grounds that they are holding too large a level of assets, even though those assets may have been yielding only a very modest income. Self-funded retirees have often been behind the eight ball in this regard due to the level of the assets they hold. Those assets are funds that these people have put away throughout their working lives in order to provide for themselves in their retirement. What may seem like a high level of assets is in fact the fixed sum these people have to live off for the rest of their lives.

        It has been part of our aged persons policy for many years to extend the fringe benefits currently available to age pensioners to all retired people who have the same level of income as those pensioners who qualify for the concessions. As such the Democrats would not only provide these people with health cards but also with the public transport concessions, reductions in telephone and electricity costs, as well as car registration fees and household rate concessions that age pensioners are able to claim. Further, we would extend the existing age pensioner tax rebate to all retirees, provide a savings incentive in the tax system by paying a rebate on the first $1,000 of interest received by all taxpayers, including self-funded retirees, and would be looking to increase the tax-free threshold from its currently low level of $5,400 to a more reasonable figure of around $7,000.

        What fringe benefits does the Defence Force get? The government clearly states that such benefits are employer provided—motor vehicles, housing, loans, school fees and private health insurance. If one goes back to the days when the Prime Minister was Treasurer, one sees that he said income received as a fringe benefit was `one of the most rutted tax shelters and the most untouchable income of all.' He also said:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees—especially higher income earners—by fringe benefits packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So-called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is impossible to reconcile that with the members of the ADF. For a start, the government never gave conditions of service to the ADF as a tax shelter. That is nonsense. They are there as a form of compensation. Secondly, the great majority of service personnel who will be affected by the inclusion of these conditions of service as fringe benefits for the purpose of the social security family payment income test are not in any circumstance high income earners. Finally, Defence Force personnel do not negotiate salary packages with the government. Is the government really saying to the Senate that it created tax havens for members of the ADF?

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        By doing what it is proposing to do, the government is reneging on its obligation to compensate Defence Force personnel and their families for their conditions of service. That comes about because the conditions of service under which the Defence Force serve really are unique. It is quite wrong for Senator Woodley to preach a level of equity. I will come to that argument later, because members of the Defence Force are not senators; they are not members of parliament; they are not civilians in any sense at all. In 1989, the government put it this way:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Conditions of service are the elements of ADF remuneration that recognise, in a tangible way, that the profession of arms is a unique profession. Specialist allowances recognise special skills, and other allowances make up for disadvantages or difficulties inherent in service life, most of them clustered around the operational need for postings.
      </para>
      <para>
       So the benefits that the members of the defence forces are paid are compensation for what they do, particularly for the turmoil of being posted from one town to another. I was deputy chairman of the defence subcommittee which did an investigation into personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force. One of the passages in that report reads:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Conditions of service thus should encompass not only pay and allowances but also a comprehensive range of compensation relating to family and social issues, superannuation, hours of work, housing and operational privileges.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is quite wrong for the government to turn on the defence forces in the way it has in this bill, particularly in relation to their rental assistance. Housing at a subsidised rent is provided to Defence Force families who have no choice at all but to go where the government posts them, to fulfil the needs of the nation as they are seen from time to time. That is why it is classified as a condition of service, a point that the government itself has made time and time again. As far back as 1986 the government made it clear that:

        Whoever in the bureaucracy thought this proposal up has to be an ignorant fool. It is to the eternal disgrace of this government that it went along with the proposal. It is quite absurd to penalise defence families for accepting compulsory postings imposed on them by the government through the Department of Defence. Another statement of the government in 1986 was:

       Furthermore, operational questions are involved in the need to provide adequate housing.

       It is in the interests of the armed forces and the government to ensure that its members are adequately housed. One of the great successes of this government in its 10 years in office has been setting up the Defence Force Housing Authority, which has provided excellent accommodation for the defence forces and has lifted them from the squalor of the run-down state housing commission estates. But in addition to penalising them for their rent subsidy, the government is going to penalise them for their educational allowance, which is, in the words of instruction 0501:

        The other argument Senator Woodley put is absolutely fallacious. It is all very well to talk about equality of people before the law and beat the drum about equity, but the defence forces are not equivalent to civil servants. They live in a highly authoritarian society. They give up a lot of privileges when they put that uniform on. They are under orders the whole time. At the end of the day, the men and women of the Defence Force die on orders and there is no civilian, least of all Senator Richardson, who will die on orders from a superior officer.

       So Defence was not consulted. But the ministers must have had some idea when this matter was raised in cabinet. I was advised by the department in writing that consideration was given to granting the ADF an exemption from the intended provisions. However:

        The ADF is not part of the civil community. This is all part of a consistent move towards conditions which fail to reflect and properly compensate the profession of arms for its uniqueness. One of the sad things is, because the defence forces have been successful and we have lived in a period of peace for many years, the uniqueness of the profession of arms is lost on the Senator Richardsons, Senator Rays and Senator Faulkners of this world. Because the profession of arms has been successful, its reward is to join the ranks of the poor of Australia.

In fact, in Fightback, the family payment income test would take account of `total remuneration'. Total remuneration includes superannuation and all fringe benefits, not just the categories that the government has included tonight. There was no mention of a $1,000 free airing. No families, none, not one defence family was deemed to be excluded from this measure.

But, either way, where was Senator MacGibbon? Where was his voice of protest? How often did it ring through the corridors outside the opposition party room? Answer: he was silent—mute—he said nought as usual. He gets up here and he criticises Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner when he himself failed every test dramatically. He passed nothing. Where was the courage last year? The courage went the way of all flesh when all those opposite got so carried away with this great Fightback document—it disappeared and so, no doubt, will they.

In the submission put to the committee, to which Senator MacGibbon referred earlier, from the Service Families Association, concern was expressed about the situation of a soldier with three children, earning $27,000 and receiving $167.94 in additional family payment per fortnight and a health care card in 1993, being likely only to receive basic family payment in 1994. Senator MacGibbon exaggerated this position; he was saying that such a family would lose everything.

        In that situation the family's total additional family payment entitlement was, according to that, something like $4,366 per annum. To lose all of that through this measure, the family would need to be receiving almost $10,000 per annum in assessable fringe benefits. This family obviously was not receiving the maximum rate of additional family payment which would have been $185.70 per fortnight for a non-renter, much more than the quotient that Senator MacGibbon mentioned earlier.

        Since the family does not receive the maximum rate, they would be entitled to a health care card only under a savings provision which has applied since January 1993. If that were the case, they would retain their health care card in 1994 if they remained eligible for even some additional family payment. So Senator MacGibbon's example and his suggestion that they would lose all of their additional family payment stands up to no analysis whatsoever. It certainly cannot be concocted from anything that is before us tonight in the bill. I find that quite disturbing.

A private with about six months of recruitment and initial employment training receives an annual salary of $26,711, including service allowance but not including other benefits such as for housing or health and additional compensation if on peacekeeping, hazardous or active service. People who join the Public Service after three years of tertiary study have starting salaries of between $20,677 and $25,550—far less than what we are talking about for a private. Corporals in the defence forces earn an average of $32,000 per annum. The average earnings of working families receiving additional family payment at June 1993—and that is really the critical point here—were $17,652 per annum, and 85 per cent of them had incomes less than $25,000.

        It is pretty hard to work out how this is some terrible punitive measure wreaking havoc upon Defence families. It stands up to no analysis whatsoever. It certainly gives the lie to the statement of Senator MacGibbon that this measure forces Defence families to join `the poor of Australia'.

        While mentioning that Defence families are disadvantaged because they are frequently posted around the country to lots of different places, it should be noted that they do still manage to find a way to own their own homes, because the rent subsidies that they get can be quite generous. In fact, the 1991 census suggests that Defence Force families have a home ownership rate of around 71 per cent, which I think honourable senators would agree compares pretty favourably to the national average for families of 74 per cent. The figures are virtually indistinguishable. I cannot see how that disadvantage of which Senator MacGibbon speaks actually applies.

In our negotiations behind the scenes we said to them that we did not believe we could support the amendment being extended to the teaching service, an emergency service or a public works service, given the way that they had put the draft amendment.

That is one reason why, at the lower ranks of the Defence Force, they are now finding themselves paid at a level that the government, as I said, describes as low paid work. In that situation, additional family payments become critical to them. Yet this government, by its decision tonight, is removing from them some of those benefits, and that is what we object to.

The definition includes, within brackets, those employees.

         —It is true that the Greens of Western Australia have had considerable difficulty with this issue and with the opposition's amendment. Initially, our view was to oppose the amendment and support the government on the basis that if one group is excluded from the measure, then every group in the community should be excluded. While we felt that the argument that defence force fringe benefits are an offset for frequent moves required of members of the forces, we knew that the same could be argued by teachers and police officers, and by clergymen and people in private industry, such as bank employees.

         The extremely persuasive arguments of an opposition adviser encouraged us to look at this issue more closely. It is true that, while we felt it was inequitable to single out a particular group of people to support in terms of this amendment, maybe there was a hope of broadening the base if we voted on this amendment and then sought to vote for the other categories later on. We have changed from that position. It is not that we do not believe that this amendment carries weight. We do understand the argument that this is a compensation rather than a fringe benefit; that people who are transferred or relocated to remote areas do suffer disadvantage; that their children suffer disadvantage from changes in schooling and other changes that are required. We have not been able to ascertain with complete confidence whether it is mainly the lower paid groups within the defence forces and the police force who will be penalised by this removal, or whether it will apply right across the board.

         We prepared an amendment which we hoped we could support within the opposition's amendment; that is, we felt happier about not singling out two particular groups for an exclusion from this measure when there were other groups that could equally claim all those disadvantages of relocation, poorer income level, and dislocation of children in schooling. I accept Senator Patterson's criticism of our proposed amendment. I believe that our amendment required a more thorough definition for those opposite to be able to understand the point we were making. I thank them for looking closely at our amendment. I understand that, at this late stage, it is difficult for them to support our amendment, which had such a wide definition. To clarify the position for the chamber, this is the reason why we have not moved our amendment.

         Equally, we do not feel very comfortable in supporting the opposition's amendment which is piecemeal in that the issue of equity in these circumstances extends well beyond defence and police force personnel to teachers and to other sectors of the work force. There is a very good argument for why we should not support an amendment which singles out two professions—defence and police—for special treatment. We would be willing to support an amendment to make the whole measure more equitable. We put the government on notice in respect of that.

         We understand that the government sees that this measure will cause the agencies to re-work salaries and wages for their personnel rather than provide relocation allowances—subsidised housing in a manner which quarantines them from assessment. We repudiate that argument. We believe it is spurious. The government may be attempting to use an illegitimate mechanism to exact change.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We accept that there are significant costs for people who, by virtue of their jobs, are required to move around the country. An adjustment of people's wage and salary structures to offset the costs of moving may compensate these people satisfactorily, but this may then force them to lose their additional family payments anyway.

In the meantime, we urge the government to look more closely at this measure and to iron out all the equity issues before this chamber takes action to amend the definition of `current employee' in future bills.

         —I was very sad to hear Senator Chamarette speak. I wish I had a chance to speak before her. Maybe then I could have explained the ins and outs of the position, which I do not think she quite understands. Before Senator Chamarette came to the Senate and when the employment situation was very much better in Australia, there was a very serious problem of wastage in the Defence Force—that is, people leaving. These were people in whom an enormous amount of money had been invested in their training. They were leaving because of low morale and the wages structure. As Senator Hill mentioned a few minutes ago, they had gone through a long period when their allowances had not been brought up-to-date and where person management generally was inadequate and needed attention. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, led by Mr Manfred Cross, brought down a most excellent report which contained a large number of recommendations aimed at improving the morale in the Defence Force and trying to do something to retain these expensively trained people in Australia's service.

         The situation has changed since then. We now have massive unemployment. We also have a Defence Force full of people who are very unhappy but who no longer have the option of getting out. A lot of the training that they undertake is very specific to the Defence Force and is not easy to transfer into civilian life. My experience is that many civilian employers are suspicious and lacking in understanding of what skills Defence Force personnel can offer them when they transfer across to civilian employment. So it has not been so easy for them to get work as it was when employment prospects were much better.

         Tonight I listened to the discussion about compensation. It is very important to understand that such things as the secondary education allowance and subsidised housing, et cetera, are very much forms of compensation for the requirements of Defence Force service. In saying that, we also have to remember that the government has been trying to deal with artificial salary packages where people get a much lower income but where they get side benefits in lieu of income. It is a way of avoiding taxation, of course. I do not have a problem with attempts to deal with that, provided they distinguish between artificial salary packages and measures such as the ones in the Defence Force which were in place long before this rash of artificial salary packages became fashionable and were genuinely put into place because of compensation needs.

         When I was the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, for several years I tried to pursue the granting of the secondary education allowance—through asking questions in estimates committees and in the chamber. It is monstrous that tens of thousands of Defence Force families, many with secondary school children, are required to move at least every couple of years. Sometimes in a service lifetime, families might face up to 30 moves. We should think about what that means for a family. Taking all that into account, only 90 secondary school children who are the dependents of service personnel are eligible for these secondary education allowances. That is the way in which the criteria are written and it is the way in which the eligibility is determined.

         There is no suggestion that it is any kind of artificial contrivance. It is very hard to get that secondary student allowance. It is very helpful and very important for children who do not transfer well from one school to another and whose educational aspirations are going down the drain because of the difficulty of making new friends, the difficulty of adapting to new schools, having problems with new teachers and curriculum changes. These things which we as parents understand only too well, we try to avoid for our own children. But only 90 children in the whole of the defence forces are eligible for that allowance at any one time. One cannot describe that as any kind of artificial contrivance.

         There was some talk earlier about housing of Defence Force personnel. I would like Senator Chamarette to understand that from the time the Defence Housing Authority was set up by the government, the opposition has given its solid and consistent support, as I hope Senator Richardson would acknowledge. At every step of the way the opposition has supported that organisation. We have tried to see that it was properly funded and we have encouraged the improvement of Defence Force housing. Successive governments have neglected Defence Force housing and I am delighted to see it improve, as it definitely has. But there is still a long way to go.

         Subsidised rents have two justifications: firstly, there is still a considerable amount of substandard housing that Defence personnel must live in. I say `must' advisedly because frequently they do not have an opportunity to choose. They may be posted to an area where there is little or no real alternative, either because of cost in the private sector or because of lack of availability of rental housing in the private sector. So they are left with substandard housing. That is one reason why we would have subsidised housing.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, the teachers, the clergymen and the bank people to whom Senator Chamarette just referred can choose whether they go on postings. They can knock them back or they can actually apply for them. Defence Force personnel rarely have that luxury. They are under discipline and they must go if the service says they must. That is a very important distinction because that is the basis on which some of this compensation is payable. It is payable because they do not have control over their lives or the lives of their families in relation to where they live, how they live, in what they live and the amount of family time they have or otherwise.

         That discipline on Defence Force personnel is extremely extensive and requires people to spend long periods absent from their family. Frequently young children are being raised with the father—sometimes the mother—away for quite long periods. These are things which we should be considering in trying to determine whether these are artificial contrivances designed to avoid income tax, which, after all, is what I thought fringe benefits tax was meant to be about.

It is pretty serious at the moment because people cannot march with their feet out into civilian life and take another job if their present arrangements do not suit them. They are slipping behind in terms of pay and allowances compared with the wider community. They are not unionised—they do not have a union to speak for them. All they can do is bide their time until the economy improves and they can leave the defence forces. That is not really in the nation's interests.

         As I said at the beginning of my speech, we have invested a massive amount of money in defence personnel. We have an interest in keeping them there if we can keep them happy in the service. I think this is the most pettifogging, mean-spirited measure. I find this quite incredible when the government knows full well that it adopted all of the recommendations in the joint committee's report. To some extent, it has implemented them; it has dragged its feet on others. But to turn around now and allow this measure to go through is undoing any good work that it did in trying to improve the conditions of service for Defence Force personnel. I am sure Mr Manfred Cross would be appalled to know that the work that went into that massive inquiry and the excellent recommendations that came out of it, which were adopted by the government and the opposition, are starting to be unwound by this sort of nonsense that we have before us now that has hurt people and worried people so much.

         The other problem with the opposition's amendment is that it has argued eloquently about the Defence Force but its amendment catches the police up with the Defence Force and the two positions are not the same. I have already argued that the evidence given by the police was unconvincing and I do not want to spend a lot of time pulling it apart, even though I could. The police evidence was most unconvincing. The two services in this particular instance are not to be compared and so therefore there is a question of equity between those two categories.

For example, the opposition says the defence forces are the only people under orders to move when they are told to move. I can certainly mention a number of other categories of people who also have no choice in the matter. I suppose the most significant of those would be Salvation Army officers.

         There is still a question of equity. Even if the opposition splits its amendment into the two categories, the question of equity remains. If we were to knock out the whole issue, as Senator MacGibbon has indicated, that would be another debate altogether. We have not engaged in that debate. Until that proposition is put to us, we really do not have a position. That is not the debate that we are engaging in here tonight and that is not the logical extension, as Senator MacGibbon is pushing, of what I said.

         I look forward to seeing the amendment that Senator Chamarette comes up with. I hope she can address the concerns  we have had. I am not sure that she will. If she is unable to address those, the test will be whether she will still support our amendment about the defence forces and the police force. I hope she has listened to the arguments that we have put to her this evening. It seems odd that if she does put up an amendment with which we cannot agree, she would sacrifice the Defence Force and police force members because she cannot get all of her amendment through. That will have to wait for a later day. I leave the debate at this point with my amendment on the table and I presume that we will be dividing on it in due course.

He was saying that this was a measure which acted primarily against the lower paid and, similarly with Senator Newman, from the way she described the purpose of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, there seems to be a misunderstanding as to what the bill is about.

         This bill affects those whose incomes are already at the margins of family payments; that is, either the basic family payment or the additional family payment. That is what it is about. By exempting the first $1,000, those receiving relatively less in fringe benefits are obviously less affected. In fact, the Department of Social Security expects a far greater number of families to receive the basic family payment, the cut-off of which is about $60,000, than those who have additional family payment, which starts to phase out at about $21,000. In fact, 22,000 of the total of 31,000 families who may be affected come from the basic family payment category, something which seems to have been lost in tonight's debate, but does put it in some perspective.

         —The main effect of the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1993 is to overcome the Commonwealth's self-imposed deadline to ensure that the sale of Qantas proceeded by December 1993. I guess the purpose of the deadline was to show the market the bona fides of the government in relation to the programmed selling of Qantas, which has now been somewhat of a saga for at least five years. Indeed, with the prime motive of this bill being to delay the final sale of Qantas until June 1995, it seems as though the saga will continue for at least the next couple of years.

         The government has put forward a number of reasons as to why the sale has been delayed. The main reason, which we have no reason to doubt, is the state of the world aviation market broadly. The other reasons in more specific terms are the state of Qantas's profitability, the bedding down of the merger between Australian Airlines operations and Qantas's international operations and, finally, the bedding down of the 25 per cent stake in Qantas which was sold to British Airways for just in excess of $600 million. These are the range of reasons why the sale has yet to proceed.

         The coalition would argue that a number of the objectives of privatisation are not being met, and that the sale price and a number of other excuses made by the government are not the central core considerations of a government when it is seeking to privatise an entity as large as Qantas. If the government is waiting for the market to ripen for such a sale, what happens come June 1995 and we are in a position where international airline profits are still bubbling along in a subdued international market of high competition and where the world stock market has yet to fully recover from various uncertainties about the international aviation market? If the government decides then that it is still not appropriate to sell Qantas, we may well be coming back here and passing yet another bill to delay the sale again. Let us hope that does not happen.

         The point is that if we are always second-guessing the stock market, always second-guessing the state of the international aviation market and not proceeding on some other clearer objectives of privatisation, then the potential investors in that sale will begin to go off into other markets and wonder whether the sale will ever proceed.

         I am quite sure that the new chief executive officer of Qantas, James Strong, who we are told sat at his new desk for the first time yesterday morning, will be very keen to see this privatisation proceed as quickly as possible. One of the main objectives of that privatisation has been ably communicated by such pro-privatisation people as the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). He told the House of Representatives that one of the important considerations of the Australian Labor Party when it supported the sale of Qantas at its Hobart conference a few years ago was the need for capital expansion within the airline.

         Clearly, an operation as large as Qantas cannot compete internationally in such a competitive and growing market if it is relying all the time for its capital requirements on the diminishing resources of the Commonwealth government on the one hand and borrowings on the other. Of course, running an international airline is a heavily capital intensive business. Capital items such as aircraft are hugely expensive, requiring masses of maintenance money as well as operating expenses. To rely on government funding and funding by borrowings is not a way to go when one is operating in such a competitive, cutthroat, international marketplace.

         The need for infusion of equity capital is absolutely crucial. I am sure that the new chief executive James Strong will be working very hard on a range of priorities. I am sure that one of them will be to ensure that Qantas is made ready for sale at the earliest opportunity. James Strong has returned from a corporate mission in New Zealand to turn around the ailing—that is a bit of a pun—the failing DB Brewing group in New Zealand into which he infused some of his undoubted management skills, and particularly his skills in getting people to work together as a team to achieve a corporate objective.

         As probably the first parliamentarian who has spoken on Qantas since James Strong actually took up his appointment, I am sure that I say on behalf of all honourable senators and members that we wish him well in his new role as the chief executive officer of Qantas; that is, both in trying to maximise Qantas's involvement in the international airline traffic and more specifically getting Qantas ready for a successful sale.

         One of the worst features of this government in terms of asset sales is its record. I am sure the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) and his advisers on this matter are getting well and truly sick of members of the coalition quoting the failure of the government's budget forecasts on asset sales. But I would imagine that the more times we relate an account of the government's failure of its sales programs, the more careful and strident the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will be in trying to assess for annual budgetary purposes the projected income from sales.

         figures extracted from the budget papers which show the shortfall in revenue from the asset sales programs during the past five years. For example, in the year 1988-89 it shows a 24 per cent shortfall where the government forecast $700 million in income and received only $528 million; in the year 1991-92—a more recent year—the government set out to raise $625 million and indeed made a $302 million loss, which was a 148 per cent shortfall in that year; and last year—the most recent budgetary year—the government anticipated sales of $1.6 billion and received only $800 million, which was a 50 per cent shortfall.

I think there is significant doubt in the marketplace, around this place and certainly in those of us in this chamber who are interested in privatisation, that $2.4 billion will be received.

         —That leads to the next issue when it comes to considering privatisation, and that is, the use of the proceeds. This government continues to use proceeds for annual expenditures and annual revenues as is described in language that the public understands. It is very much analogous to selling the silverware to pay for this week's groceries. The coalition takes a very different stance to that. Our stance is that when we sell a national asset like Qantas the proceeds should be used to offset debt and, therefore, improve the budgetary situation not only in the current year but also in the out years as well.

         There is no doubt that Australia should learn from the experience of the Thatcher government, which this government so often compares the coalition to. One of the great criticisms of the Thatcher government's privatisation program is that it made some of the mistakes that this government is repeating; that is, it used proceeds for current expenditure. It sought to privatise government trading entities without seeking to enhance share ownership or have a better competitive environment—but, basically, it sought to sell things for the once off proceeds to help with the current year budget problems.

         The objectives which the coalition seeks for all privatisations are to enhance competition so that people get a better service, have more choice as to where those services can be derived, and better quality service from private sector provision of the service; and to have greater economic efficiency, which is a very important argument for the earlier privatisation of Qantas rather than the later privatisation. While the efficiencies of the marketplace are acting upon Qantas in a way that they cannot do while it is owned by government, it increases the international opportunities for Qantas. While it is restricted in its capital base the way it is now, while it is restricted in many of its management decisions and in terms of its share ownership, it does not have the full benefits of economic efficiency that privatisation would give it, particularly in the marketplace in which it operates.

         Importantly, when it has that restriction on its capital base it makes it that much harder for Qantas to break into new markets. It just does not have that flexibility to quickly get new equipment, set up new marketing links and so forth, even though—and I stress this—Qantas has been extremely successful, given the restrictions that it has. It is very good at opening up new products and markets. But one wonders at what Qantas could achieve if it was a private body and, clearly, the government has made the decision that it needs to be.

         I think I have covered most of the issues that I wanted to cover. However, I wanted to raise—and it is a matter that I did raise with some people from the asset sales task force in a briefing I received this afternoon—the status of employee share ownership schemes within Qantas and a number of the other privatisations which the government is undertaking this year. The government has been, in its public statements, fairly quiet about employee share ownership schemes. One of the objectives of the coalition in privatising these Commonwealth-owned bodies is to ensure that the employees of those bodies can gain a significant stake in the enterprise by which they are employed.

         It is quite crucial, in maximising the performance of a company or a business, that all of the employees have a very real feeling that what they contribute to the business is very important to the success of that business. There can be no better way of achieving that than the employees actually having a share in that business. I think in a people business there could be no better example of a business that so much replies on its people as an airline business like Qantas—from the people who check in, to the people who service the aeroplanes, to the people who handle baggage, to all the in-flight service people and the pilots; all the people in the airline business are crucial to making the airline successful. To maximise the performance of the airline, it is clearly desirable for Qantas employees to have a significant stake in their own airline. They will, of course, work that much harder at serving their customers if they have that stake.

I would caution the government in waiting for a better marketplace to sell Qantas. The actual level of proceeds of the sale should be one of the minor considerations.

         It will always be a temptation to wait for the perfect time in the market to sell Qantas for the best price, but if we proceed down the track and make the major objectives of privatisation greater efficiency and better competition, we will all be served better in the long run. That is why I genuinely say to the asset sales task force, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the government more broadly that trying to second-guess international stock markets will be doomed to failure. Much greater minds than the Minister for Finance or the asset sales task force have come major croppers trying to second-guess the stock market.

         The final point is that the government does argue that one of the reasons for the sale is that the stock market in Australia has far too many floats on it at the moment. This is another reason why a sales program that has some definite end to it is important.

         The market is always looking at who is floating what. In the last few months there has been an enormous number of floats. There are something like 25 or 30 floats of varying sizes coming onto the market. If the market knows when Qantas is going to come on, then it will adjust the other floats to it. If the government keeps saying, `We will put Qantas on when it suits us', the market will say, `Well, the government is never going to make up its mind. We had better just go ahead with our plans'.

         So in a healthy market for floating, as we have at the moment, the market will of course put more and more stock onto the equity market and there will never be a window for Qantas. Qantas is a large sale. The government needs to commit itself to achieving the objectives of economic efficiency and better competition and make the size of the sale revenue a lower consideration in its priorities.

         The purpose of this bill is to amend the date of the automatic repeal of the unproclaimed sections of the Qantas Sale Act from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995. In December last year, when that act was passed, it was expected that the divestment of the Commonwealth's interest in Qantas would be completed by October-November of this year. The bill contained a provision that any of its unproclaimed sections would be repealed if they had not been enacted by 31 December 1993. The government has since announced that the initial public offering of shares will be deferred under 1994-95. In the absence of any legislation, the provisions intended to commence on dates on which 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the airline is sold will lapse.

We know that and again we get to the end point where the most convenient solution is to sell it off, get it off the books, to say, `Don't worry about what it represents, don't worry about the whole argument of foreign equity and don't worry about stemming the flow of profits offshore.

         Qantas has very special role in the Australian psyche. It has been a major earner of foreign currency and this is something we welcome as one way of stabilising our foreign debt. One thing we do know is that a significant transfer of wealth occurs during the privatisation process. Privatisation tends to involve underpricing of share issues, as we saw in the Commonwealth Bank share issue and the privatisation of both British Airways and Air New Zealand.

         —Yes, you do. You just want to sell it off because you think in the short term it will raise revenue. In the long term, those opposite do not care about the consequences. Senator Campbell talked about the silver, but what if we want to buy Qantas back? What about if we see the error of our ways and want to buy Qantas back one day? It is sensible to limit the amount of foreign ownership so that people can start from a smaller base in wanting to buy it back.

         I do not oppose the notion of Australians buying shares in Qantas or Qantas-Australian, but the Democrats want to take the opportunity yet again to say that the jury is still out on privatisation. Privatisation has not delivered all of the wonderful benefits to the Australian economy that the opposition claims it has. It is horses for courses and it is not necessary for us to sell off 100 per cent of our national carrier in the interests of balancing the books.

         —I approach this debate this evening with some degree of personal interest because I was employed by Qantas in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the time of my employment it was a feature of Qantas that its employees never considered themselves public servants. We were not classified as such because of a loophole involving the board members of Qantas being the only holders of shares. But we were very proud of our company. We were proud of the very high standards that Qantas was known for worldwide. Staff training was of a very high standard. We were highly regarded by the travel industry and performed a large servicing role for the Australian travel sector.

         Qantas was also known internationally for the special care and attention it gave to carrying sick, disabled and young people. Our national airline does not gain a lot of profit from such a service. Passengers are not charged for the cost of providing proper, correct and advised care. However, that is the kind of service that Qantas provided. Qantas was very famous also for its very high safety standards. This, of course, was the position in the days when Qantas was not being asset stripped. I can only wonder how Qantas rates in these areas today.

         While the Greens do not support privatisation, we do not refuse to support the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. This legislation does not alter the fact that Qantas will be privatised. We wish to flag clearly, since the government seems uncertain in its ability to hear what we say, that we oppose the privatisation of the basic social infrastructure. Industry is not good at ensuring equity; that is not a part of its purpose.

         Government ownership of public infrastructure, education, water, power, communications, public transport and finance institutions or companies providing basic structure in a mixed market is designed to ensure that services are available in an equitable way and that the needs and desires of the community are represented. The only alternative to public ownership is strict regulation, as we find in the privately owned energy and communications industries in the United States of America. Private industry sets it own agenda; this is often not the agenda for the future that the wider community would wish. For this reason, it is important to support publicly owned service companies.

         We will support this amendment because in this case the amendment will have the effect of protecting the rights and conditions of employees, which are part of the conditions that will be extended. It may also allow for a more orderly and profitable sale of shares rather than a `fire sale'. We think the government may be right about delaying the sale, although the current market boom may not last. Certainly, the market has not been good, nor has recovery proceeded as predicted.

Of course the costs and benefits of privatisation should be assessed and assessed carefully; equally, the costs and benefits of not selling commercial assets owned by the government should also be the subject of careful analysis. I have no particular argument with that because I believe that, in most cases, particularly with large commercial bodies like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, consumers and taxpayers will be shown the strong advantages of a sensible privatisation program.

         My final point is that it is a bit rich for Senator Kernot to get up here and argue strongly for the need to assist Australian industry when the Australian Democrats have joined with the government to increase taxes of $2.6 billion, most of which are imposed on Australian industry. I share with Senator Kernot a very strong interest in wanting to promote Australian industry to make it competitive. The worst way to do that is to do what Senator Kernot and her party did last week—raise taxes on a whole range of Australian industries.

         That point is reinforced by the fact that the sale proceeds of Qantas are estimated to be around about $1.8 billion to $2 billion. One should understand that the average monthly expenditure on social security in Australia in any given month is roughly $2 billion; so the sale of Qantas will pay for one month's social security. Therefore, the sale proceeds are only a small consideration.

         The last point I want to make is that the coalition's agenda for privatisation is carefully considered, and carefully programmed and set out. It has been set out before each election, naming the bodies that will be sold and the specific years of those sales. It includes something like four or five items each year. We will, of course, issue again, before the next election, a manifesto setting out those sales. It is a well thought out program.

        So of 12 sentences in my original letter, two were published. The whole thrust of my argument was lost, and it appeared as if all I was doing was writing a brief comment to agree with Senator Richardson's view on prostitution. One wonders at the ethical standards of a newspaper which decides to print the first and last sentence of a letter to the editor and leave the other 10 sentences unprinted. Then again, apart from those professional journalists who work for the

         First, Australia's independence is being undermined by the government's action to allow UN committees dealing with human rights issues to involve themselves in Australian domestic activities. Secondly, these UN committees are already having a significant impact on Australian law. Thirdly, the UN committees themselves do not meet appropriate standards of independence and judicial process.

         I believe the decision to allow UN committees to have a role in Australian domestic disputes is wrong in principle. I happen to think sovereignty is important and should not be compromised by international treaties without very good reason and, above all, without demonstrable benefit to the nation. Nevertheless, those who support Senator Gareth Evans's so-called new internationalism should at least insist that the UN committees meet the highest possible legal standards.

         In relation to my first point, Australia's independence, there is no argument, even from the most passionate advocates of UN conventions, that Australia's sovereignty is eroded by the government's decisions on UN human rights treaties. For example, Senator Schacht is an enthusiastic advocate of UN human rights treaties. He was the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when it produced the report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there has been a tendency for the United Nations to limit national sovereignty. This evolution, therefore, increasingly demands a reconsideration of the principle of national sovereignty. United Nations conventions, now covering a wide range of activities, inevitably change the character of domestic institutions, affect domestic legislation and extend accountability beyond the usual domestic constituency.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senators will recall that this is the same Senator Schacht who ceaselessly argues the independence line when promoting his other great passion of the need for Australia to become a republic. The problem with this argument, as far as our constitution is concerned, is that we are already an independent country—at least we were until the Hawke and Keating governments acquired a fascination with UN treaties.

         The Australia Act 1986, among other things, abolished appeals to the Privy Council. With all the rhetoric about independence, one would have assumed the last thing any government would do is involve foreign bodies in Australia's legal system. After all, it was Gough Whitlam who said:

         After all these fine words, it took Labor five years to reverse the philosophy of the Australia Act. In 1991, the government ratified the so-called first optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which enabled Australians to take complaints to the UN human rights committee. In February 1993, the Keating government further opened the doors for Australians to litigate their differences before the UN by recognising the competence of two other committees—the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee against Torture—to consider complaints from individual Australians.

         I believe most Australians would not know that the government has taken these actions. If my recollection is correct, there was no debate in the parliament. No approval was sought from the parliament. What an irony of Australian history! The great advocates of UN human rights conventions were able to make major decisions affecting the legal system of this country without consulting the Australian people or their representatives.

         Now to my second proposition. The willingness to involve UN committees in domestic activities is of major significance to our legal system. Senator Gareth Evans, when questioned about the significance of these decisions to open up Australian domestic disputes to UN committees, becomes, in my experience at least, often abusive and ends up arguing that the findings of the UN committees are only exhortatory and advisory. A number of points can be made about this statement.

         But there are other ways in which UN committee findings can be of great significance in Australia. For example, a decision of a UN committee can provide the basis for action by the federal government to override a state government. Once the committee gives a view that a particular complaint is justified, the government would have the power to act even if it related to a state jurisdiction. For example, under current political circumstances it would be untenable for the federal government to legislate to override the criminal law in a state. However, if the UN human rights committee were to publish a decision stating that Australia is in breach of its international obligations because of state legislation, the federal government would not only have an excuse to act but would probably be obliged to act.

         The Canadian experience with the first optional protocol is instructive and provides a pointer to what will occur in Australia. Canada signed the protocol in 1976. An analysis of the cases which have been heard by the human rights committee shows that their determinations have clearly had an impact on government policy in Canada. There is no reason to expect that a similar experience will not arise in Australia.

         Senator Evans must have expected that the decisions on UN committees would have a significant impact. Why else would he take this decision in the first place? It is disingenuous to pretend that the government has not taken a highly significant act in allowing domestic disputes in human rights areas to go to the UN. There has been virtually no attempt to argue the case publicly for this decision to justify why our legal system needed this change.

         The UN committees are simply not appropriately structured to carry out a significant role in our legal system.

         There is no doubt that the UN is in need of major reform. Senator Evans and most observers have readily conceded this point. Nor should we forget that of the 185 nations that are members of the UN, 117 are classified by Freedom House as being either not free or only partly free. It is hardly surprising, then, that the UN committees concerned with human rights are also in need of major reform.

         The independence of the committees is compromised by their method of appointing members; the short-term nature of the appointment, with the option for reappointment; their dependence on the UN for funding; and the attitudes of some of their members. The procedures of the committees do not meet standards that Australia would want for high level tribunals. Critics have pointed to the fact that the short sitting times of the committees inevitably means that much of the work must be done by their secretariat. At times, I understand that there has been a failure to produce comprehensible reasons for a particular judgment.

Only rarely do these dual roles create conflicts; judges, university professors, retired diplomates or diplomates dealing only with bilateral relations are unlikely to receive directives from their authorities with respect to their work on the Committee. However, for a minority of members, primarily those belonging to the permanent missions of States Parties at New York or Geneva, such conflicts can be significant. They may find themselves in the awkward position of having to disregard their superior's directives while at the Committee table. Clearly, it is incompatibly with the Member's solemn oath of impartiality if his attitude is dictated by a member of his country's permanent mission. Nevertheless, it seems that not all the States Parties attach the same importance to these proprieties".

         I wonder what Michael Banton of the United Kingdom, Carlos Hevia of Cuba, Ivan Garvalov of Bulgaria, Sangu Shuhua of China and Regis de Gouttes of France thought when they read this government report which quoted sources that `racist attitudes and practices (both conscious and unconscious) against Aboriginal people pervade Australian institutions'. Anyway, Australia regularly makes reports to this committee so it can check out our performance and ask further questions.

         It is really beyond the pale that the Australian government reports and is answerable to such a committee. I wonder whether, in the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s, Billy Hughes, Jim Scullin, Joe Lyons or Ben Chifley would ever have felt they would have to report to the British Colonial Office on any matter in the way Paul Keating and Senator Evans report to the UN. Let me put a further proposition to the Senate: the affection that any pre-war Australian monarchist may have felt for the British Empire is nothing compared with the adoration that Senator Evans and Mr Keating feel for the United Nations.

         Australians must enjoy the highest possible human rights. Where human rights infringements occur they must be addressed quickly. That is why we opposed Labor Party initiatives such as the Australia Card and banning TV political advertising. We continue to oppose special privileges for trade unions and so forth. Indeed, Australia is in the forefront compared with virtually any other country, by any measure, on human rights. There is a high level of agreement between all parties on the major principles in relation to human rights. There is, however, inevitably controversy about human rights applications in particular circumstances, for example, the right to privacy versus the right to freedom of expression, rights of children versus rights of parents, rights of women versus ethnic rights, property rights versus community rights.

         The real question goes to how these judgments should be made between competing rights. Should the balance be determined by local courts or international committees? The balance determined by local courts in Australia will be affected by local social circumstances and mores. The balance determined by a UN committee may be different and quite alien to Australian society. Often very fine and sensitive judgments are involved in human rights cases. They are far better made, in my view, by a local body with an understanding of Australian society which is accountable to the Australian people. It is also important that decisions which have such a significant effect on the rights of individuals are made in an open court which follows fair procedures and gives full reasons for judgments, rather than behind closed doors and far from public scrutiny. The UN committees do not meet the tests.

         I believe it was a serious mistake to involve UN committees in Australian domestic human rights disputes. If our human rights laws and courts need reforming, the democratic way to do it is through our parliaments, involving our people and their representatives. The wrong way to do it is to address domestic human rights problems through the UN by opening up avenues of complaints to UN committees.

         —The new Labor member for Leichhardt, Mr Dodd, often makes completely uninformed comments, some of which in recent times, have been directed at me. I would not normally bother responding because Mr Dodd is such an irrelevance—a recent blow-in from Sydney to North Queensland. But following his efforts last Thursday, I simply cannot resist pointing out some of his more embarrassing inaccuracies. I had intended to speak for longer on the adjournment debate last Friday morning but, because of the way the Labor Party mismanages business in this place, I did not want to put anyone through the trauma of a long adjournment speech at 2.18 a.m. I will refer to some of Mr Dodd's more embarrassing inaccuracies.

         I have been shadow minister for local government since April 1992. According to the database, I have talked about local government in the Senate some 36 times and in Senate estimates committee exchanges on some 60 occasions. My counterparts, the Labor minister for local government—there have been two of them—Mr Simmons, between April 1992 and March 1993; and Mr Howe since then, have spoken a total of 18 times on local government.

         Following hot upon the heels of Mr Dodd's first inaccuracy that I do not talk much about local government is his claim that I am not talking to local government. Again Mr Dodd proves the old saying that if you are ignorant, it is better to keep quiet than open your mouth and prove it. Since my election I have personally visited over 300 of Australia's 915 councils in all the states, including just about every council in Mr Dodd's electorate. I have written to all councils. I have visited on several occasions all of the peak local government bodies in Australia in each state and I maintain regular contact.

        By that broken English, I think he meant that I claimed that SBS would not begin by the target date in Cairns. Once again, Mr Dodd has his facts wrong. I did issue a press release in Townsville highlighting the fact that certain areas in Townsville would not get SBS until a year after the rest of the city and this was because the government was not willing to pay the money this year to install the necessary two extra translators. I pointed out in my press release, and in questions in the Senate, that these particular areas—North Ward and the towns of Ayr and Home Hill just south of Townsville, where I live—were, in fact, the areas with the largest ethnic community and therefore the ones which, one would have thought, would get SBS first, not a year after everyone else.

At Lockhart River on at least 15 occasions, Liberal scrutineers saw voters place blank ballot papers in the ballot boxes, yet when the votes were counted in Cairns there were no blank ballot papers at all amongst the votes. Secondly, at Lockhart River electoral officials were clearly seen to be directing voters to vote Labor by pointing to the Labor box on the ballots as they were handed to voters. Complaints about this were ignored by the returning officers.

         Electoral officials at Lockhart River accompanied voters without invitation to the booths to assist them with their votes.

I also note the comments made by Senator Kemp, who on one occasion was shocked to find that I said I thought he had made a very thoughtful contribution to a previous debate. He is more likely to be satisfied tonight because I did not agree with anything he said tonight. I thought it was a rather sad and dated 1920s contribution and I suppose I should not be surprised, but I was disappointed. It was an attempt to wish that the world was different and that international scrutiny is not upon all of us.

         Firstly, his comment about the Townsville SBS is just another example of opposition members who think that overall expenditure should be slashed but in every individual area it should go up. They just have to work out that the whole equals the sum of the parts. We cannot say, as Senator Macdonald did, that there should be a big cut in SBS spending—10 per cent overall—as he said in the last election, but in the area in which he is interested in it should go up. That is the problem he has. He continues to advocate cutting the total but increasing each part and it does not add up.

        The Prices Surveillance Authority has conducted regional fuel pricing investigations, and has observed that there are usually legitimate reasons why some markets have lower retail fuel prices  than others. In the PSA's view, price variations can, in the majority of cases be attributed to the normal operation of competitive market forces.

        While differences between rural and metropolitan petrol prices can be expected as a result of freight costs, in the past year or so price variations have been, as the Honourable Senator suggests, exacerbated by the extent of discounting by oil companies at the wholesale level. The PSA influences petrol prices by endorsing a maximum wholesale price for each company, but it has no power to stipulate when, where or by how much oil companies should discount their petrol.

        Discounting has occurred mainly in major capital city markets, and certain strategic locations on highways, and has largely resulted from strong competition initiated by aggressive independents. Pump price competition can lead to reduced gross retail margins, increasing the pressure on oil companies to discount their wholesale prices.

        The difficulties inherent in attempting to narrow the city/country price gap are illustrated by events in late 1988, when Shell posted a state wide wholesale rack price which allowed for lower wholesale prices in country areas, thus transferring the benefits of city competition to non-competitive rural areas. In response, many retailers in the country simply increased their profit margin, denying country consumers the benefit of lower retail prices. Shell's subsequent wholesale pricing approach generally excluded country markets from such discounting.

        Regulatory attempts to eliminate price variations between  metropolitan and rural areas run the very real risk of eliminating discounting in the city, with no benefit to country people. In the Government's view this would be an unacceptable result. The Government considers that the most appropriate measures to address regional variations lie in preserving retail competition to the extent possible, through the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and in exerting pressure on oil companies through the Prices Surveillance Act, to adopt reasonable wholesale prices.

        (1) &amp; (2) A workshop of osteoporosis experts, convened by the Deputy Prime Minister and the then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, was held on 14 August 1992. One of the issues the workshop considered was the significance of osteoporosis in Australia in terms of its incidence and costs. The workshop reviewed available data sources and concluded that it was difficult to estimate accurately the extent of osteoporosis in Australia because of the lack of comprehensive national data. It was agreed that osteoporosis could affect up to one in three Australian women and a smaller proportion of men. It was also noted that two community-based studies which are being conducted would provide more direct estimates of the incidence and costs of osteoporosis in Australia: namely the Dubbo Osteoporosis Study and the Geelong Study.

        Currently, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Working Party on Preventive Activities in the Health Care System is undertaking, as part of its activities, a systematic costing of the proportion of health expenditure in Australia attributable to particular health conditions including osteoporosis. The Working Party was formed in 1990 to develop a guide on preventive activities for distribution to all medical practitioners and other health care providers. The project will provide comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the costs of osteoporosis in Australia.

        (4) Estimates of total Commonwealth Government health expenditure by area of expenditure (e.g. hospitals, medical services, pharmaceuticals, nursing homes etc.) are collated annually by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. However, differences in definitions and collection and reporting arrangements make it difficult to derive overall estimates of Commonwealth expenditure on particular diseases such as osteoporosis. In the case of osteoporosis, the problem is exacerbated because of difficulties in diagnosing the disease and its associated fractures.

        (1) No. In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government has committed funds to improve access to bone densitometry testing through the provision of a Medicare rebate.

Experts, however, agree that bone densitometry is a valuable test in the diagnosis and management of established osteoporosis and other bone density related conditions. It is on this basis that the Government will improve access to bone densitometry testing in Australia.

        (1) Yes, the Government has terminated the Resource Assessment Commission's (RAC) administrative functions while retaining the RAC legislation to provide for flexibility should an inquiry reference be appropriate at a later date. Since the RAC was established there have been significant developments that have enabled the Commonwealth to integrate consideration of economic and environmental priorities for natural resource allocation in co-operation with the States and in consultation with conservation and industry groups, including through the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment. Nationally coordinated policy developments such as the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, the National Forest Policy Statement and the National Greenhouse Response Strategy have removed much of the need for a Commonwealth-based inquiry agency. The Commonwealth also has a wide range of investigatory and general inquiry bodies including under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 through the Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority (CEPA), the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) and the Industry Commission (IC).
