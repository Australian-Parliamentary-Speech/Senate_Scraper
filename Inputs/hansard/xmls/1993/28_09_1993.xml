         There is linkage in three forms. It has always been absolutely clear that there is a linkage between the revenue measures in this budget. It does not matter whether or not they are in the form of one bill or separate bills with a clause indicating that one tax effect is subject to the other. Whatever legislative form it takes, nothing can take away from the fact that there is a fundamental economic linkage, which is unarguable, between the capacity of a government to deliver income tax cuts, which it thinks are justified, and the passing of the revenue measures that will make it possible.

         It has been clear from budget night that that linkage exists. Those opposite have to remember that in this budget we are bringing forward these tax cuts. What I am looking forward to is the circumstance on 15 November. If the legislation passes on 15 November ordinary Australian workers will get a major tax cut; a tax cut to which they are entitled. If they do not get these tax cuts because of the intransigence of the Senate, we will have a very interesting situation. I look forward to seeing those over there, who have been responsible for holding the legislation up, talking to the ordinary office workers on $500 a week about why they are missing out on a $5 a week tax cut, or talking to a nurse on $710 a week, who is not what I call rich.

         I look forward to those opposite going out to those workplaces, because we will be going out there explaining to people why they are not getting those increases. People talk about these cuts somehow being a pay-off to the wealthy, but we are talking about tax cuts that assist ordinary Australian workers to get the sort of tax cut to which they are entitled. Millions of Australian workers on average earnings will miss out on the extra dollars they are entitled to in their pay packet if the Senate continues with the irresponsible and damaging political game playing which those opposite have been undertaking until now.

Last Friday the commission commenced arbitration of the complex issues involved in this dispute on the basis that the parties had exhausted the negotiation process after several weeks of intensive talks. Last week I received a letter from the joint national secretaries of one of the unions involved in the dispute, the Maritime Union of Australia, requesting my personal intervention in this dispute.

The employer, Australian Stevedores, has also confirmed that it is prepared to participate in a conference if this will assist in the resolution of the dispute.

I understand that the parties will convey to the Industrial Relations Commission this afternoon the request to temporarily adjourn the arbitration proceedings to allow this conference to take place and it is intended that the parties will report back to the commission on Thursday.

         That bringing forward does one other very important thing that people do not like to recognise. The other important thing about bringing forward the tax cuts, and why we want to do it, is that they are also a very important economic stimulus. Bringing forward the tax cuts will provide an extra $300 million of expenditure. It will pump $300 million into the Australian economy before Christmas, if they are passed in time for them to take effect on 15 November. That extra expenditure starts to generate the retail sales which are good not only for the individuals who have the capacity to make it but also for the retail sector and for Australia's employment. It is an important element of economic stimulus, so we wish to be able to deliver the cuts.

         We also have in this budget over four years a deficit reduction strategy, which is a very important strategy. It is not an easy balance to strike to increase the deficit in the first year to generate the necessary economic stimulus and similarly over a four-year period to deliver a deficit reduction strategy which will get the deficit down to 1.1 or 1.2 per cent—very close to one per cent—of GDP. It is an outstanding achievement internationally and in the terms of Australia's macro-economic history. There are few occasions on which that has been achieved to that extent.

On that day they promulgated the new Cambodian national constitution, which was a vital step forward for the independence of that country. Today is equally a very important day for Cambodia.

         UNTAC's mandate formally ended on 24 September, the day on which the new constitution was promulgated. Under the constitution, Cambodia has become a constitutional monarchy, under which the monarch reigns but does not govern. Prince Ranariddh and Mr Hun Sen were appointed co-prime ministers. On the same day, Prince Sihanouk took office as King of Cambodia.

         The original black spots program was announced on 5 December 1989. It was a comprehensive road safety package which was aimed at reducing the national road toll. It had a planned three year life. It was always intended that the program would expire at the end of June this year. Between 1990 and 1993 an amount of $110 million was allocated to eliminate a range of hazardous accident black spots. Funding to the states and territories was conditional on their accepting a 10 point package of enhanced road safety measures—a reduction in the alcohol limits being one of the more prominent measures. This original allocation was further boosted by an additional $110 million worth of One Nation funds and a further allocation of $60 million in the 1992-93 budget.

         This total of more than $260 million was fully disbursed to the states and territories before the planned completion of the program in June this year. The package has been fully implemented everywhere, except Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where a few aspects await final implementation. Over 3,000 identified black spots have been eliminated during the three year life of the program, which is now being analysed by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. The report on this analysis will be completed later this year. I will make sure that Senator Spindler and indeed all senators get a copy of it.

         The purpose of the black spots program was twofold:  firstly, the program was offered as an incentive for the states to agree to national standards on 10 important road safety issues; secondly, the program was designed to demonstrate to state and local authorities the value in directly addressing known accident black spots within their funding programs. The vast majority of these black spots are on local roads or state arterial roads.

         With the new separation of road funding responsibilities arising out of the July 1991 meeting of heads of government, the Commonwealth's responsibility will be restricted to the National Highway and, as Senator Spindler knows, significant additional federal funds are to be distributed as untied grants. In conclusion, I do find it difficult to have sympathy for those states that demand additional road funding when they fail to spend the untied funds they currently receive on roads.

         Out of the discussions overnight—yesterday our time—there is now I think a real recognition by the Europeans and particularly in the United States that 15 December this year is a genuine deadline; that the Uruguay Round is of international significance and that it must be completed; that the talks that have been going on between the United States and the European Commission should be multilateralised—that is to say, other countries, as contracting parties to the GATT, should now be included.

This follows a joint report by the World Bank and the OECD which estimates that the value of a good outcome for the Uruguay Round—properly implemented up to the end of this century—in agricultural and industrial products alone will be worth an income boost of $327 billion to global economic activity by the year 2002.

The important issue is that farmers in France should not be able to jack up this round and hold the world to ransom. They constitute about four per cent of the GDP of France. For France not to recognise that its economic fortunes are best served by a good outcome for the round and to cave in to a small group of vested interests and jack up this round would be the wrong outcome. It is in the interests of France and the world that we now conclude it.

The evidence is of a substitution effect—people drink different things. One has to appreciate the fundamental level of economics—that that will generate the same or more jobs in other industries.

         The worst thing this Senate can do for the wine industry is what it has done so far, which is generate that massive amount of uncertainty which is causing great problems for the industry. If one talks to the industry about what its biggest problem is today, one finds it is uncertainty. If this wine tax is not carried, we will not have delivered certainty to that industry, we will have delivered continuing uncertainty because we will not have exhausted the government's interest in pursuing the question of equitable revenue in this area.

By way of preamble, I point out that the national forest policy agreed to by the Commonwealth and all the states, with the exception of Tasmania, undertakes to `avoid activities which may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value'. Minister Kelly has sent an indicative list of areas which required interim protection until the reserve system was established to each state. The list included the Nalbaugh State Forest in New South Wales. Given that the minister considers the Nalbaugh State Forest to be of high conservation value, what is she doing to prevent its destruction by the New South Wales Forestry Commission, in complete defiance of the agreed national forest policy?

She specifically noted the commitment to avoid activities in areas likely to have a high conservation value, pending assessment of these areas for determination against agreed reserve selection criteria and advised that funding assistance for assessments of old-growth forests and wilderness was available from the Commonwealth.

         On 31 May 1993 Mrs Kelly wrote to the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation seeking support for old-growth studies in New South Wales as a matter of priority. To date, no reply has been received. She shares the community's concern that the NFPS commitments are honoured by signatory governments. However, we must emphasise that the national forest policy is a joint Commonwealth-state policy statement and its implementation depends on the willingness of state governments who have signed the policy to give effect of its intentions. To this end, Mrs Kelly has requested information from the New South Wales Minister for the Environment on how current forest management practices applying to the Nalbaugh and Dewar areas serve to protect the high conservation values that have been identified in the region. She has also written to the Commonwealth Minister for Resources, given his responsibilities for export approvals, regarding the Nalbaugh special prescription area and the conservation initiatives of the NFPS.

I do not have to hand an assessment of what the outlook is for the export of uranium from Australia, in view of the lifting of trade sanctions to South Africa. It is true that there are uranium stocks in South Africa, to the best of my knowledge, and, if they become available to the world market, as is likely, then the price of uranium is likely to fall and the prospects for all uranium producing countries are likely to be bleaker in an already overhung market.

         But it is also true that South Africa is a competitive producer of many mineral commodities. On some of those commodities South Africa competes with Australia. The bans on South Africa were never imposed because of competition or fear of competition in respect of any mineral commodity or any other good or service. The ban on South Africa was imposed because that country formerly had an entrenched policy of apartheid in its constitution. We took part, with other countries in the world, in imposing a ban because that policy is racist and it is a fundamental denial of human rights. It is due to the changes in South Africa that we heeded the call of Nelson Mandela at the United Nations General Assembly just last week and removed our ban.

But the reasons for our policy have been explained in this place many times. I do not propose to go back over them now.

         In this case, in relation to an allegation of sexual assault, a court martial was convened. At the completion of that court martial a board of inquiry was held. That board of inquiry reported to the maritime commander, made recommendations to the Chief of the Naval Staff who, in turn, made recommendations to me. The action that was taken was strong and appropriate, and certainly stronger than that originally recommended by the board of inquiry.

One of the arrangements the government put in place for dealing with this issue was the establishment in the navy of a 008 toll-free number so incidents of sexual harassment could be reported; that is, from people who have been subject to it, confronted with it, or accused of it. That was established on Wednesday of last week. To date in the navy there have been three calls on that 008 number. That gives those opposite perhaps some indication.

         Honourable senators may know that while there are cuts in the child welfare budget, these go far more to the domiciliary care arrangements for children. Minister John assures me that the emphasis in Victoria is on the protection of children through assistance to families, rather than the removal of children to institutionalised care. In fact, Minister John praised some of the initiatives of the previous Labor government in Victoria that set up some of the family intervention programs which he judges are working very well and which his government is supporting.

         It is absolutely important that we do not lose sight of the main game here—and that is the protection of our children. There is no doubt that the prevention of child abuse is the preferred way to go. It is a very complex problem which needs multi-disciplinary programs to make sure it happens. Those things are contained in our strategy and will be put in place. Unfortunately, a lot of the abuse is best dealt with as it happens or as soon as possible after it happens; in other words, we want early intervention as well as prevention. I am very concerned, and I have made it my business to be assured by Victoria, that it is able to continue its programs for early intervention. I look forward to meeting with the national council so as to assure myself that the prevention strategy will be put in place and that Victoria will be able to meet its obligations there, too.

        While repayment rates for males and females differ, the study showed that most of the total debt (96% for men and 77% for women) will be repaid to the government. The Wran committee, which recommended the introduction of HECS, estimated that some 30% of the debt would not be repaid.

        It should be noted that the objective of the measure of introducing 1.5 HECS under clearly defined circumstances was not primarily to achieve savings, but to establish the principle that students who have consumed their `fair share' of higher education at maximum government subsidy should be required to pay more. It needs to be recognised that a student who fails to complete his or her course and who is permitted to stay at the university, excludes another school leaver or young person from attending.

        I am not suggesting that the minister ought not to have set up such an advisory group. I think the veterans community will welcome the opportunity to have greater contact with the government.

In particular, I am referring to the Vietnam Veterans Family Support Link Line, which is a large and growing group of people involved principally as carers of Vietnam veterans and who have a very special knowledge of the needs of many of the veterans and what could or should be done for them.

         That is not to say that the range of mechanisms that have been established in the department itself—for example, the treatment monitoring committees and involvement with our client needs and attitude survey—will not continue. I think Senator Reid ought properly to regard the ministerial advisory council as the establishment of yet another consultative mechanism, but certainly at a senior level with direct access to the minister and a capacity to give the minister independent advice.

         I also stress to Senator Reid—and I think this is an important point—that the people who have been appointed to the ministerial advisory council have been appointed as individuals. Inevitably, of course, because nominations have been sought from major ex-service organisations, there will be a suggestion of representativeness about those who serve on the ministerial advisory council, but they have been appointed as individuals and I am sure they will approach this task with the sort of responsibility that comes with membership of such an advisory council.

I give her that commitment today.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Spindler this day, relating to funding for the `Black Spot' road construction program.

       <para>
        During question time today, in answer to a question relating to road funding, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) was explaining the virtues of the black spot program. The black spot program was started as a political exercise. It was for black spots, but it happened to be the black spots in areas where there was high unemployment.

         I believe that that black spots program did do some good in the long term, but the states that kowtowed to Canberra and the minster for transport got the best deal out of it. Western Australia did not do quite so well because it was not going to be dictated to for quite a time. It had to adhere to the idea of bringing in the .05 breathalyser blood count to be able to get it.

         I was talking to Bob Brown the other day. I think Mr Hawke was the instigator of the program, but Mr Brown put it into action. If it was working so well, why did the government not keep it going? In other words, the political exercise was over as soon as the last election was over.

         The minister finished his answer by saying that he has no sympathy for states which do not spend untied road grants on roads. Untied road funds to states have been around for a couple of years now. Incidentally, I have always opposed untied road funds. I have been at odds with my own party and with Senator Macdonald on the issue, and I believe that in the long run I will be right. What I would like Senator Collins to tell the Senate is which are those states that have not spent untied road funds on roads and what amount is involved. Then we can decide for ourselves whether we should continue with untied road funding.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator McGauran this day, relating to the impact of an increase in fuel excise on rural and regional Australia.

         exactly where we stand in relation to the rest of the world. The countries that have a lower percentage of fuel tax than Australia are: Canada, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. The countries that pay more are: Austria—only just—Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey. These figures reflect the size of the countries. In other words, if Australia were to be taxed on fuel as much as any of those other very much smaller countries, each motorist in Australia would be taxed far more than in any part of the world when one takes the distance into consideration.

         In relation to prices, the countries that pay less than Australia for their fuel are: Canada, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Turkey and the United States.

The countries that pay more than Australia are: Austria—only marginally—Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Once again, they are smaller countries. I believe that this would be borne out if we did an exercise to multiply distance by percentage of tax. Unless Senator McMullan can come into the chamber with better figures, I ask him to stop saying that Australia is under-taxed in relation to fuel.

       Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations
      </title>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.

The Australian Securities Commission has been doing this of recent weeks. A fortnight ago I attended the seminar it arranged in Tasmania. It invited business people, accountants and commercial lawyers. We had an excellent seminar on this very topic. The feeling of that meeting was that we should avoid an additional act for the close corporation and that we should amend the corporations law and arrange to have a private company as recommended by the committee. I welcome this move by the government.

I look forward to seeing its response in detail. However, recent announcements from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) indicate that the government will be going down the line of the committee's report. As Senator Gibson has quite correctly said, we wanted to have a close corporations act which would not further complicate the corporations law and would not broaden it.

          From the evidence we received from the business community in our public hearings, there was no doubt that there is still an overwhelming feeling amongst the business community broadly—both the major corporations and the small business sector—that the corporations law remains far too complex in Australia. The overwhelming demand for a close corporations form of legislation and private company type body comes from the fact that the law is far too complicated. It is very hard to deal with corporations law in Australia unless one has extremely good, highly expensive legal advice. That does not help us in terms of being competitive internationally or in terms of formation of capital and raising capital for new business ventures. We must remember when we are focussing—particularly towards the year 2000—on trying to make Australia competitive in South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific basin broadly that the corporations law is a very crucial part of comparative advantage amongst nations in this region.

          The corporations committee travelled to New Zealand recently and found that New Zealand is just about to enact its new corporations law. Its corporations law is far more based on the US model; it is far less onerous in a regulation sense on the business community and relies far more on what we call `fuzzy law'—broad principles—than does the Australian law, which was broadly seen across the Tasman from the New Zealand perspective as far too onerous, far too rigorous and imposing upon the business community a far too complex legal infrastructure in terms of corporations.

          The first recommendation of that committee was that it be given an ongoing reference to monitor and report annually on specific initiatives undertaken to increase access to justice or reduce the overall cost of it, and on the cost of justice generally. That recommendation is supported by the Attorney-General. He wisely points out that in the end it is a matter for the Senate as to whether it chooses to give its standing committee that ongoing reference. I certainly hope that all members would support such an ongoing reference to the committee. The reason for that is perfectly simple. I presume it is obvious to everyone so it will not take much to elucidate.

          All I really care to say is this: we all know that, unless we are very rich or very poor, the opportunities for us to enforce our rights are simply not there. We call them rights, as though we can have them as of right. But, if we do not have the money, we cannot get them. It is a ludicrous situation that is getting worse and worse.

          They are not the sorts of sexy law reforms or policy initiatives that are ever likely to hit the front pages. On a one-to-one basis, people do not care about the cost of justice until they need access to it, and then they cannot afford it. It is then that they realise how expensive it is, and they join the band of people who realise what a deplorable situation we are in. It is not something that all Australians appreciate will, in the end, touch them in a very real way. Unfortunately, we have to wait until they are burnt by the legal system, or locked out of the legal system, for them to appreciate that point. Nonetheless, I am pleased that the Attorney supports that recommendation.

          The second recommendation was that the committee would contact each of the bodies that might have some influence in this area, and they are very wide-ranging. The cost of justice is not a problem that has been created by one particular group. We play a part in it as a parliament; state parliaments play a part in it; the legal profession plays a part; the judges play a part; and some consumers, who think the justice system should be there as of right for them to access willy-nilly, also play a part.

          The sorts of groups included in this exercise would be courts, tribunals, legal professional associations, legal aid bodies, law schools, various state governments and state government departments. What we want to do is get those people to simply indicate on an annual basis what they have done in the past year to increase access to justice or to reduce the cost and what they intend doing in the forthcoming year. It is a pretty simple exercise. It is not some expensive exercise in either time or dollars. It is just a simple report on what they have done.

          The purpose of this recommendation is to encourage those groups to focus on what they could do. Every little change mounts up in the end to a massive change across the board. So the purpose of this recommendation is to encourage a continual level of change, albeit at a small pace, and to focus the minds of those groups on the need to do something each year to increase access or reduce the cost of justice. In respect of that, the Attorney says that he agrees and indicates that he will write to some of these key organisations recommending that they go along with and implement that recommendation. The sooner those letters are sent the better, and I warmly commend that response.

          The third recommendation related to collection of statistics on the cost of justice by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Attorney had some things to say. He basically indicated that some statistical material is already collected. The bureau has indicated that it is prepared to discuss what else it could do to get better information. That recommendation has also been referred to the board of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for its consideration. So at least there is something happening on that front. What will happen in the end has not been resolved, but at least there is agreement that it is a sensible proposal put forward by the committee so that people in the future have some figures available to them on which they can base policy decisions. Hopefully, in the end this will result in a decrease in the cost or an increase in the access.

          The last recommendation made by the committee was that it be given the responsibility of convening a regular legal forum, open to the public, at which representatives of the groups such as those I have just mentioned have the opportunity to exchange their ideas and proposals for improvement. The basis of that recommendation was that it simply is not enough to have individual groups considering these things in isolation. In the end, we will maximise the contribution of each of those groups if they can come together and exchange their views. Often it may be that the procedural activity engaged in by one organisation and the reasons they have not changed in one way or another actually relate to a misunderstanding as to what some other group that they work with requires of them and expects of them. So, if we can organise an exchange of views, it will be very productive.

         This is a motion to refer the question of the government's proposed tax increases on credit unions to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.

          I think it is fair to say that the industry has successfully, from our perspective, made a case for a Senate committee to examine the government's proposal in this regard. My understanding is that the government's argument for increasing taxation on credit unions is to ensure equity in taxation with building societies. The industry believes that that argument is simplistic because credit unions are structured in ways other than those of building societies. So simply to affect one aspect of business, that is the taxation practice, would not achieve equality.

          More specifically, it is pointed out that credit unions do not have the same equity raising capacity that building societies have. Being under different legislation, building societies are able to seek capital through share issues in a way that credit unions are not. Therefore, credit unions have to rely on building up capital out of profit and the taxation on their profits becomes of greater consequence than it is in relation to building societies. The industry argues that one cannot simply equate building societies to credit unions and say that if one provides a similar tax regime then each is being treated fairly.

          That argument certainly warrants careful consideration by a Senate committee. The response of the committee might well be that the legislation under which credit unions are constituted should be changed so that they have the same equity raising capacity as building societies. I do not know whether that will be the response of the Senate committee, but it is obviously one option that might be open to it.

          This matter could be debated in this chamber but the careful analysis that is necessary of such issues is difficult to be achieved through a debate in this place.

Thus, I think this matter warrants that sort of consideration.

          The other argument that is put these days is that there are some similarities between building societies and very large credit unions. In fact, many credit unions are of a fundamentally different nature from building societies. I am speaking of the hundreds of smaller credit unions that are often linked to particular industries or particular regional or country towns which are set up on the principle of volunteerism. A small community or employees within a particular industry join together with no profit motive, of course, but to help to provide credit to each other.

          We are talking about structures that are fundamentally different from building societies. Because they are small and are often in regions of Australia that are suffering, particularly at the moment, from the recession or the aftermath of the recession, they are vulnerable. Therefore, it has been put to us that many of these small credit unions that fulfil worthwhile community services will not be able to sustain this new taxation regime, which, as I said, is really a taxation regime that has been applied to a fundamentally different type of credit provider, a large and strong building society and one that is able to raise capital through other means.

          As a result of these representations, which we in the coalition certainly believe warrant further and careful consideration by the Senate, I gave notice of this motion to refer the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry and report on or before 28 October 1993. I really chose the date on the basis of what seemed reasonable to allow the committee to do its job properly. In effect, what I was seeking was approximately a month. It seemed to me that that was warranted because there are so many credit unions in distant parts of Australia and they are often small.

          The danger in making these references too short is that the work that is done perhaps is not of as high a quality as the Senate has a right to expect. On the other hand, we all know that some committees have considered matters for a long time. Therefore, it seems to me that it was necessary to have a tight time frame. I am also conscious of the fact that for this chamber to deal with the bill it would need the committee's report.

          The Senate will be anxious to deal with the government's taxation package at least within the usual time frame for dealing with such legislation. I am advised that the normal time frame for taxation bills arising out of a budget is that they get into this chamber about mid-October. Therefore, it seemed to me that it was not unreasonable for this committee to report by 28 October. The date has been chosen as a balance between, on the one hand, the need for the committee to expedite such a hearing but, on the other hand, a desire for the committee to have sufficient time to do justice to the industry and ensure that its work is of the standard that we require.

          In relation to the terms of reference, I have mentioned that, in order to do the job properly, the committee should look at the role played by credit unions in Australia, in particular their structure, operation and community service. By that, I mean the way in which they operate compared with building societies and other credit providers. I am conscious that in many small towns the history of recent times has been that banks have been leaving those towns. They are generally not served by building societies and the credit union is actually becoming more important in the provision of consumer credit than was once the case.

          I believe that the committee should also look at the history of the partial tax exemption that the government is seeking to remove. Further to what I said a minute ago, it should look at the treatment of this particular industry in relation to capital formation and the capacity of the industry to continue to provide the financial and community services that it has provide in the past. It should compare the taxation treatment with other like bodies, if they can be identified as like bodies. Basically, the committee should give advice to the Senate as to whether there are still reasons for the differentiation of tax treatment between credit unions and building societies.

          I put this reference to the Senate today as a constructive effort to better inform the Senate on what is an important but nevertheless difficult issue in order that the industry and communities most concerned by this new taxation proposal of the government can be properly brought within the parliamentary process. This chamber needs to be fully informed so that its final determination in relation to the bill can be based on sound evidence and careful consideration, rather than what is sometimes the case—insufficient deliberation simply because of the nature of the conduct of this chamber.

          —The thing I find most passing strange about this motion dealing with the taxation treatment of credit unions is that it is being moved six weeks after the measure was announced in the budget. It presents all sorts of timing problems. Therefore, the government is not an enthusiastic supporter of referring this particular matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration now, because there are timing factors associated with the budget bills. The timetable that Senator Hill has laid down may make those timing issues very awkward.

          I will not go into the question of how the bills are linked or even try to untangle it all in my mind, although I might address that in half an hour's time in another place. The advice that Senator McMullan, who represents the Treasurer in this place, has given me is that we would have a timing problem with the report back date of 28 October. I therefore intend to move an amendment to omit 28 and substitute 18. I am under absolutely no illusion about the pressure that that date will put on the committee.

          To some extent, I believe that this chamber is abrogating some of its responsibilities to committees and that committees are not able to fulfil their obligations, from a resource point of view, from a timing point of view and, regretfully, from an intellectual capacity point of view. This has been reflected in some of the weaker reports that we have seen coming back from committees to this chamber over the past few months. That is to do not with a lack of diligence on the part of senators, but simply because of time constraints and massive workloads as more and more stuff is referred to committees.

          The attitude of the government is, `We don't think we have the numbers to stop this being referred to a committee, so why put up all the arguments at this stage; they will not have any effect whatsoever on the outcome'. But we do say that we have a more solid case to amend the terms of reference to make the report back date 18 October. As I understand it, when some of the other matters in these bills are passed, they cannot be implemented from day one. There are procedures that have to take place for these bills to come into effect and time is required for those procedures. Accordingly, I move:

          As I said at the start of my comments, this matter came onto the public record on 17 August. It is now being referred to a committee as a result of lobbying efforts on behalf of those people who have written to honourable senators about this matter—as they are entitled to do. Oppositions tend to respond in this way when they cannot quite grapple with the issue or when they think there may be some justice in it; one or the other, but usually the former. They say, `We'll set up a committee for you'—especially if they are not going to be on the committee, I might add—`and the committee can in some way sort it out'. There are certain things that Senate committees cannot sort out. I wish it well on this one, if it gets up. I wish it an early and quick deliberation.

The Australian Democrats have also been grappling with this issue, not out of any consideration for the big credit unions, which are effectively quasi banks, but more out of a concern for the original intention of the smaller credit unions, the friendly societies. We need to have a look at the impact of this tax on the capacity of the friendly societies to deliver the level of service that their members expect to receive from them.

          One of the fundamental issues is that the government is saying that the tax concession gives credit unions some sort of an advantage over their competitors. In fact, we need to take the time to expose the raft of additional constraints that they have to operate under when compared with banks and building societies. We may be able to produce the evidence to show that the concession only evens things up for credit unions, particularly the smaller ones.

       It is evident from its terms that this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt, Mr Duffy, under section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, often referred to as the HREOC act. That declaration was with respect to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.

        The effect of that ministerial declaration was, subject to its not being disallowed by either the House of Representatives or this chamber, to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN declaration within the definition of human rights in the HREOC act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights.

        It is important to make perfectly clear that the UN declaration has laudable objectives. It recognises that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. However, the action of the former Attorney-General has given rise to grave concerns among a wide range of religious groups and members of the public.

        Many, including archbishops, bishops and representatives of a range of christian and non-christian groups, have written to honourable members and senators. The main concern expressed by those people contacting senators and members has been that the effect of the incorporation of the UN declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC act will not be to protect religious freedom in Australia but to limit it. That is the concern that has been expressed.

        Members and senators have received hundreds of submissions from around Australia in relation to this particular UN declaration on religious freedom, and equally on the Attorney-General's declaration to put the United Nations declaration under the HREOC act. Those submissions, letters and telephone calls have disclosed close to a total lack of understanding among members of the public of the real impact of Australia's adopting a United Nations declaration and the means by which United Nations declarations and conventions can become part of the domestic law of Australia. It is sad that the submissions display a pretty broad and general lack of understanding and knowledge about the impact of Australia adopting UN declarations and the means by which those declarations and conventions in other circumstances can become part of domestic law.

        Of even greater concern, however, is that these submissions have also disclosed an alarming lack of knowledge about the role and powers of the commission.

        The opposition accepts that the ministerial declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law. The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens, as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of a human rights commissioner as contained in the HREOC act in relation to investigating conduct that might constitute a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies. Accordingly, it is important to note that some of the strong fears that have been voiced, and in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Despite the fact that those concerns are difficult to sustain, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should still be disallowed.

        It is important to put this matter into context. On 7 December 1962, the General Assembly of the United Nations initiated the preparation of a draft declaration and a draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. However, it was not until 1981, after 19 years of tortuous drafting and negotiation and renegotiation, that the declaration was finally adopted. Therefore, it was 19 years in the making, so to speak.

        In UN practice, a declaration by the General Assembly is usually a step in the process towards settling a convention or treaty, but a convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance has yet to be finalised, even though it is now almost 31 years since drafting was initiated. The delay in finalising the declaration and the apparent inability of the United Nations to agree upon the terms of a convention reflect not only political struggles that may exist within the United Nations but also, particularly, the controversy that is inherent in this subject matter and the difficulty associated with it.

        The former Attorney-General's actions, however, deserve some closer scrutiny. It is important to look at the circumstances under which the former Attorney-General put his signature to the declaration under the HREOC act. The United Nations declaration was adopted by a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations in November 1981.

        Although Australia supported the resolution in 1981, it was not until 1993—nearly 12 years later—that the former Attorney-General made this declaration under the HREOC act. The date on which it was done is also instructive. It was 8 February this year; the day after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal election. The day after the government decided that it was time to have an election, to go to the people to seek a reindorsement of its mandate, the former Attorney-General, nonetheless, decided that it was appropriate to make this declaration.

        Some months before that, the former Attorney-General had consulted with state governments. It may not be very well-known publicly that Attorney-General Hannaford of New South Wales advised the former Attorney-General that the New South Wales Liberal government opposed the incorporation of the UN declaration into the HREOC act, and so did Attorney-General Berinson, QC, of the West Australian Labor government. So attorneys-general from a Liberal government in New South Wales and a Labor government in Western Australia, when consulted a few months prior to this declaration being made by the former Attorney-General, opposed the declaration being incorporated under the HREOC act.

        I would be interested to hear from the minister an explanation as to why, despite the fact that two state governments were consulted and had a different view to put, one day after an election is called it is seen as so essential to incorporate this declaration, which is not a convention, under the HREOC act—some 12 years after we have agreed to it and 31 years after the whole ball started to roll. What prompted the former Attorney-General to sign this declaration 10 years after the matter had come before his government, on the day after the federal election was announced—an election which even Labor members were expecting to lose? That is the obvious question. An Attorney-General expecting not to be Attorney-General after the election decided at that point to make this declaration.

        We might look at the nature of the document to see whether that can give us any indication as to why the former Attorney-General would proceed on this path and also look at the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC act to see what we can find.

        The first point that one might want to make is that the UN declaration is not a treaty. Australia is not bound at international law to comply with the terms of the UN declaration; nor is it bound to incorporate its provisions into Australian domestic law. Its adoption in 1981 means little more than that the principles sought to be stated in the declaration were accepted by Australia as a step in the process of endeavouring to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. One might look then to see whether, by making this declaration, by putting this United Nations declaration under the HREOC act, one would be satisfying some sort of lack of power under the HREOC act, existing as it does now.

        The second point to be made is that, within the existing definition of human rights in the HREOC act, the commission has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringements of that freedom by the Commonwealth or its agencies.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are significant statements on the right to freedom of religion and belief in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That argument is fairly simple. Significant statements on the right to freedom of religion and belief have already been incorporated into the definition of human rights in the HREOC act. They are so incorporated because the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is already an appropriate instrument under the HREOC act. Articles 18(1), (2) and (3) of the international covenant state that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and belief, and the right to manifest that religion or belief. They state that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair those freedoms. This is virtually identical to article 1 of the UN declaration.

        If the definition of human rights in the HREOC act in relation to religious freedom does need extending, no justification for such extension has been offered by the government at any time. If a case were to be made, the legislation affecting the extension should be done in the most clear and readily comprehensible language. The UN declaration in relation to religious freedom does not have those qualities of clear and readily comprehensible language, as I will demonstrate with some examples.

        One could argue that it lacks clarity of meaning. I believe that the UN declaration is a document in which clarity of meaning has been sacrificed for the sake of compromise. That is no surprise, given the length of time it has taken to develop. The result is a series of vague, ambiguous and potentially contradictory provisions. The declaration contains general provisions that state that everyone will have the right to freedom of religion or belief and to manifest that religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching and that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his or her freedom to have a religion or belief of his or her choice.

        The declaration goes further than that and in article 6 expressly states what those freedoms include. It is worth quoting a few of them. One freedom is to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions. What, one might ask, is an `appropriate charitable institution'? Another function is to make, acquire and use to an adequate extent the necessary articles and material related to rites or customs of a religion or belief. What is `an adequate extent'? What, we might ask, are `necessary articles and material' as opposed to unnecessary ones? One might suggest, for example, that a sacrificial dagger is, according to some rites, a necessary article.

        Article 6 specifies a right to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas and to teach a religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes. What are `relevant publications' in this context? What constitutes a `suitable' place in which a religion or belief may be taught? Another purported right is to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief. Who constitutes an `appropriate leader'? We have seen recent examples of totally inappropriate leaders.

        These provisions are an attempt to codify to some degree religious rights and freedoms, but they give rise to a multitude of questions of interpretation. It is difficult to see how the commission could fulfil its functions of promoting understanding and acceptance of these alleged human rights. To give any meaning or content to them, the commission would have to engage in value judgments in respect of which the UN declaration offers no guidance.

        In addition to the lack of clarity of meaning in the declaration, there is possible conflict. The provisions of the declaration probably conflict with the provisions of instruments already incorporated into the HREOC act. There is probably also internal conflict between provisions of the UN declaration itself. An example is provided by provisions dealing with the religious education of children.

        Turning to the covenant first, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that the state parties to the covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. That is article 18(4) of the international covenant. There is a similar principle stated in the declaration on the rights of the child, which is also incorporated into the HREOC act in principle 10.

However, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, respect for freedom of religion or belief of others and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow man.

        The apparently absolute rights given to parents in the international covenant to ensure that the religious and moral education of their children is in conformity with their own convictions are also inconsistent with article 5(2) of the UN declaration. The latter states that whilst every child shall enjoy the right to have access to education in the matter of religion or belief in accordance with the wishes of his parents or legal guardian and shall not be compelled to receive teaching in religion or belief against his wishes, the best interests of the child are the guiding principle.

        Many of the most noble acts in history have been done in pursuit of an article of faith or a religious ideal. On the other hand, some of the most ghastly and inhuman chapters of history, even the very recent history, have also been the result of uncompromising beliefs of a religious nature. It is also a fact that there are many religious practices and beliefs which are not acceptable to the vast majority in Australian society.

First, the HREOC act already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. The case for further statement has not been made. Another statement is unnecessary. Secondly, the history of the UN religious declaration demonstrates the difficulties inherent in its subject matter. As a result of these difficulties, the UN declaration is vague and possibly internally inconsistent, and its impact is unclear, especially, as I say, in relation to those religions whose practices involve, for example, mutilation of the body or the allocation of an inferior status and set of rights to females in the community.

First, the government should amend the HREOC act to allow for the examination of international instruments prior to their being declared in relation to the other functions of the commission. If that exercise had been engaged in, perhaps some of the misunderstandings that we freely acknowledge do exist with respect to the concern in the community would not be there. It is not good enough to simply take an elitist approach and say, `We know that these people do not understand the exact nature of this. We know what is good for them, and we are going to proceed'. It would have been appropriate to resolve those misunderstandings, that misinformation and that lack of knowledge in the first instance. There is no rush, as we say.

        The HREOC act already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. Therefore, there was plenty of time for the government to make its case as to why an additional instrument relating to religious freedom should be incorporated under the HREOC act—and the government did not do that. So perhaps as a first step it would be appropriate to ensure that there is proper examination of international instruments prior to their being declared under the act.

        Secondly, the government should undertake to educate the people of Australia about the role of the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its various instruments on Australian law. The Attorney-General's Department does understand the role of the United Nations; I have no doubt about it. Plenty of people in the community understand it and are supportive of a wide range of United Nations instruments, be they declarations or covenants.

        But it is clear with respect to this matter that there is a broad misunderstanding in the community. That misunderstanding will not go away simply because the government decides to proceed despite that misunderstanding. A program should have been undertaken, probably long ago, to educate the people of Australia about the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its instruments on Australian law. After all, if the government wants to legislate, it should do so in a way that takes the community with it, rather than imposing something on the community.

        There is clear community concern about the declaration. The concern may be limited to a particular pocket, but that pocket feels very strong concern. There is no reason why that pocket should be deprived of that education prior to proceeding. There is no gain to those who are not confused by proceeding now. In fact, there is a loss to them. They would be better served if that education had been undertaken and the community as a whole could move forward in this respect. The government also, quite separately, should seek to educate Australians about the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. There seems to be some misunderstanding in that respect.

        The government itself, through failing to keep the people of Australia informed about these matters, is responsible for causing widespread concern in the community about this United Nations declaration and the effect of the ministerial declaration made under the HREOC act. This motion recognises that, while seeking to ensure religious freedom is in general terms a commendable pursuit, it is nonetheless an area which requires the most careful and detailed consideration. The length of time this declaration has taken to get through the United Nations is testament to that. The indisputable fact is that the government has not given the matter careful or detailed consideration and, as a consequence, I urge all honourable senators to agree to the motion.

        In order to try to understand the Liberal Party's position, I began by looking at the debate on this matter in the House of Representatives. The shadow Attorney-General, Daryl Williams QC, gave a very competent and thorough speech. It looked very much like Senator Vanstone's contribution today. But it appeared that his heart was just not in it; he just did not seem to display much conviction. He started off by describing the objectives of the legislation as `laudable'. He thought the fears expressed by some constituents about restriction of the religious freedom of individuals were `difficult to sustain'. He then tried valiantly to raise concerns about the declaration. He talked about its ambiguity and contradictory provisions.

But he never actually gets to the point as to why we should be opposing the declaration. I could not understand that. But there was a bit of a hint in that after covering the issues, he distanced himself quite clearly from those making arguments in this debate which he said were based on fear—those who sought to argue not on rational grounds but to beat up fear about what it would mean for the practice of religion in this country.

I think it is important to put on the record a contrary view to those being espoused by the Liberals in this debate. In that judgment he said that international law is `a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights'. He said that `this does not contradict the recognised principle of international law that international instruments, whatever their character, be they convention, declaration or protocol, do not have a force as of right in domestic or municipal law'.

The former Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, signed the declaration under section 47 of the HREOC act on 8 February 1993, the day on which parliament was dissolved. As a result, this declaration has become part of the definition of `human rights' for the purposes of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. In signing the declaration on that day, the former Attorney-General has ensured that, technically at least, his action did not fall within the previous government's caretaker period. However, I consider the timing was unfortunate in that it has prevented detailed parliamentary examination before today of this move and has given rise to concerns such as those I have adverted to before.

        The following points need to be made: the declaration is not legislation in itself but rather a more detailed definition of the matters already covered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. That definition already includes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—as has been stated before—which gives the commission responsibilities through articles 2, 18, 26 and 27 of that convention to protect the freedom of religion. Article 18 includes the freedom `to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching'.

        The convention recognises also that parents have the right to have their children taught within the framework of their religion and to organise the lives of their families accordingly. This is strongly supported by the Australian Democrats, subject only to any laws which are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. That answers the point that Senator Vanstone made when she warned that the religious practices of some religions in Australia would not accord with community standards or would even be contrary to our laws. Quite clearly, such practices would fall foul of our legal system and, I think, would be condemned by all members of the community. However, I repeat that the Australian Democrats believe strongly that parents have the right to have their children taught within the framework of their religion and to organise the lives of their families accordingly.

        If we were not able to reach the conclusion that the declaration signed by the former Attorney-General did not support this or in any way damaged it or endangered it, we would today vote for the disallowance of this declaration.

        The declaration applies to the existing powers of the commission in relation to the acts, practices and legislation of the Commonwealth. As well, the commission is already empowered to inquire into `any act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to any human right' and either to settle it by conciliation or `to report to the minister in relation to the inquiry'. That right already exists. It is not brought into existence by this declaration. It is noteworthy that the commission may not intervene in any other way, except to inquire and to report. In addition, the commission is to `promote an understanding and acceptance and the public discussion of human rights in Australia' and `to undertake relevant research and educational programs'. This is the addition, and the only addition, to the law as it stands by the incorporation of this declaration. This is an objective that hardly anybody could object to.

        The declaration does not confer any new powers on the commission but will make it possible for the commission to address freedom of religion in all its aspects and implications under its existing powers as set out in the declaration. It should perhaps also be noted that the declaration arose from the suggestion in 1991 by Sir Ronald Wilson, President of the Human Rights Commission, that the government should reassure Australians who profess the Islamic faith that harassment will not be tolerated. The action taken in no way limits similar protection afforded to people who practice the Christian or any other religion. This again is one of the fears in the community that has been fomented by this—I say advisedly—irresponsible action by the Liberal Party. In particular, it needs to be confirmed that Australia's international obligations cannot be used to limit the right of religious or charitable institutions to employ staff, including teachers, of their faith and to reject applicants who are not of their faith.

        In this area, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has adopted the view that the enjoyment of rights and freedoms on an equal footing does not necessarily mean identical treatment. This was confirmed in the case of Broeks v. Netherlands which established that differentiation based on reasonable and objective criteria will not amount to prohibited discrimination where the purpose is legitimate under the convention. Clearly, freedom of religion is one of the purposes which is legitimate under the convention. The declaration itself states in article 6 that the `freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief includes the freedom to teach a religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes and to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief'.

        Further, it should be noted that complaints under the general human rights provisions of division 3, part II are limited to Commonwealth employment acts and practices and do not apply to those of religious organisations. Where employment acts and practices are not so limited—and I refer to the equal opportunity and employment provisions of division 4, part II—the definition of discrimination specifically excludes cases where `a distinction, exclusion or preference is made in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed'.

        The position could not be clearer. I really wonder at the motives of people who have access to this law, who have access to this advice and who have access to these provisions but who choose to ignore them and, for their own political purpose, unsettle people in the community and engender fear and misunderstanding. It is a reprehensible misuse of the political system. It need hardly be said that, on the basis of what I have said, the Australian Democrats cannot possibly support the motion for disallowance of the declaration.

My colleague Senator Vanstone has made it clear that the coalition thoroughly endorses the principle that everyone should have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Our fear is that the declaration which the Attorney-General seeks to incorporate in the HREOC act may well serve to restrict, not enhance, freedoms that we now enjoy and may even lead to new forms of discrimination.

        In view of the comments made by Senator Spindler and, I think, Senator Chris Evans, the point has to be made that the incorporation of the declaration in the HREOC act makes this legislation. I have actually sought advice on this, in view of Senator Spindler's comment. It is part of the legislative framework which guides the work of the Human Rights Commission.

It is legislation that expands the power of the Human Rights Commission and allows people who have complaints based on the various articles of the declaration to bring actions against the Commonwealth or its agencies. To that extent, it is a significant act and an important one. In debating this issue, we should not stand up and try to demean it in that context.

        However, Senator Chris Evans raised an interesting issue about the whole nature of international law and the role that various UN conventions play in that area. It is true that over a very long period the Labor government has shown great enthusiasm for, and attraction to, ratifying and effectively incorporating in Australian law a whole range of UN conventions. We only have to look at the law relating to the environment, industrial relations and human rights to see that this has been a deliberate intention by the Labor government.

        There is a degree of irony here. Senator Chris Evans lauded the importance of international law and, of course, it does have importance, but in relation to Australian domestic activities, he highlighted one of the real dilemmas that the Labor approach has headed Australia towards. We are being told that the republican push is important because we need to assert our sovereignty and independence. Senator Evans is smiling at that because he understands the dilemma of the argument that I will be making to him. The problem with what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has described in his penultimate book on foreign policy in Australia as the `new internationalist agenda' is that it seeks to involve Australian law in the whole web of international UN agreements. Senator Gareth Evans is quite explicit on that and he does not resile from it.

        The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a very dramatic statement, and the Labor government did when, in 1991, it ratified the optional protocol and allowed Australian disputes to be taken offshore to be appealed to the UN human rights committee after they have satisfied all forms of appeal in Australia. Senator Chris Evans would know that this is a very important step by his government. It means that for the first time since the Australia Act 1986, Australian disputes can go offshore. I do not wish to explore this at any great length today but I point out to Senator Chris Evans that the nationalism with which he tries to promote the republican debate rings somewhat hollow when at the same time his own government is pursuing with great vigour and belief the need to involve international human rights committees, quasi courts and judges in Australian domestic affairs, which was quite contrary to the view that his party asserted as recently as 1986 in the Australia Act.

It was interesting to read in Donna Sullivan's article that the declaration to end discrimination against women does conflict in some areas with the declaration that the government is asking us to incorporate into law today.

        The declaration is ambiguous in many areas; it is vague in many areas; and it conflicts in a number of areas with other UN conventions which this government and other governments have ratified. When that occurs, it may take decades for this to start to wash through the system. But we are incorporating into the law of the land legislation which I believe we do not fully know the meaning of. If Senator Chris Evans had read this article, he would have understood that the case law, particularly in relation to a number of these UN conventions, is very new. The various UN human rights committees are now starting to build up case law as to what clauses mean and how they will be interpreted. Because of the vagueness of quite a number of these articles, we will not see for quite a long period how the international community interprets the meaning of these clauses.

        Why is there this wide concern? There is a growing nervousness in the community about the impact of UN conventions on the Australian community. Many people in the Labor Party have strongly supported such conventions but no-one would deny that they are having an important impact. I know from my own studies that no other comparative country has the same huge enthusiasm for UN conventions and instruments as the Australian Labor government. Other governments have special procedures in place—for example, Canada, whose approach to UN conventions is probably the closest to Australia's. Canada has a number of procedures in place which ensure that the various provinces have a say and a real impact when the central government decides to sign a UN treaty. West Germany in relation to the Lander, its own states, has similar processes. In the United States the Senate requires a two-thirds majority to ratify a treaty.

        According to the president of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, the objective of the declaration is to strengthen the resolve of the nation states in promoting religious freedom. I have been in this place 11 years. Many of my colleagues on this side of parliament have been here as long. In my 11 years experience I cannot recall one occasion when I have received a deputation, phone call or letter from a constituent who has complained that his or her religious freedom is not total. I have never seen any indication in the press that religious freedom is being usurped in Australia. Australia truly must be the most tolerant country in the world.

        However, this assurance has done little to allay the fears of many Australians, who are extremely concerned about what they see as the state further legislating on their religious practices. We have heard that the mainstream churches were not involved by Senator Gareth Evans. I have a list of some people who I believe represent the mainstream churches. The Charismatic Church has a membership well in excess of 150,000 people in Australia. It would have to be considered one of the mainstream churches.

They all oppose the declaration. Others include the Seventh Day Adventists; Full Gospel Churches of Australia; and the Christian Women's Communicating International. They are mainstream churches.

The level of community concern has been strong. I do not have to remind people here of that. I have received more letters over this than any other piece of legislation or United Nations declaration that has been dealt with.

        The coalition has received hundreds of letters on the issue. The declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief has a long, convoluted history. It started out as a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations when it was first put forward in 1962. It was finally adopted by the United Nations on 25 November 1981.

        It took more than 19 years of discussion, negotiation and compromise for this resolution to be passed by the United Nations. Yet we and the Australian people are supposed to accept it into Australian law after only about six months, six short months in which no explanation has been advanced by the government to demonstrate why we need this United Nations's declaration to become law. There has been absolutely no attempt by the government to allay the genuine fears of many people in the community about the very real prospect of the greater intrusion by the state into their religious lives.

I do not believe that we, as legislators who are elected by vote, should pass our responsibilities away to an unelected group of people that have their head office in Geneva. I do not know who are the 18 people on the United Nations court. I do not know what countries they come from. But one thing I am sure of is that any of those countries that those people represent around the world would not have the traditional freedoms that we have in Australia.

        I do not believe the Australian people want or need this United Nations declaration foisted upon them as law. Our religious freedoms are already guaranteed through section 116 of the constitution, as well as through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act which gives force to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As a party to this international instrument, Australia must comply with its provision to safeguard the fundamental human rights and freedoms of thought, conscience and religion. We do all that.

        With these religious freedoms guaranteed by the act, and upheld by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission—and there is section 116 of the constitution—why then do we need a declaration citing religious freedoms that we already possess? The last thing Australia needs is more law, particularly so when it is unnecessary, poorly drafted and unclear in meaning in several critical sections. The declaration is a weakly constructed document and open to interpretation and conjecture in several parts.

The most ambiguous section of the declaration is that which is related to religious discrimination. Article 2 prohibits discrimination by any state, institution, group or person on the grounds of religion or other belief.

        It is in the definition given for the term intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief in the second paragraph of article 2 where the concern lies. The declaration defines intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief to mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on religion or belief. Concern has been raised over the use of the word `preference' in this concept. Fears have grown that this could be taken to mean that independent church schools would not be permitted to specify the religious orientation of their staffs.

        It is a fundamental right that parents should be free to choose how their children are educated, and the sort of people who are entrusted with the education, guidance and pastoral care of their children. Discrimination in employment on the basis of religion would therefore seem to breach this section of the declaration. While there is an exception provided in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act for discrimination on the basis of religion, by religious education institutions, in order to uphold the religious teachings of the institutions, the government has done nothing to allay community anxiety that the autonomy of independent church schools may be under threat.

Article 5 of the declaration deals with the rights of both parents and children. This has also raised considerable confusion and uncertainty in the community. In this section, parents, as the legal guardians of their children, are given the right to organise their family life in accordance with their religious beliefs.

        As far as the actual allegation that I had obviously gone in to beat the members of the Conference of Churches of Western Australia over the head to pummel them into submission and into saying that they did not want this declaration, I have to say that the meeting that I attended at their request was a very cordial meeting and we canvassed both sides—for and against. The members of the conference simply wanted the pros and cons. I made it crystal clear to them prior to the meeting, at the meeting and in subsequent conversations and correspondence, that I was in no way seeking to influence them one way or the other.

        That is what I find quite despicable. Here we have another example from Senator Chris Evans, who comes in here and says that something took place that did not. I find that quite objectionable on behalf of those who attended that meeting, who were there in all their sincerity to hear both sides of the story. If there is someone who did attend the meeting who had a contrary viewpoint, I would be more than happy to talk to that person about it because there is no way that the tone of my letter or the tone of that meeting was anything other than seeking their input, and doing something that the Labor Party had deliberately chosen not to do.

        Senator Vanstone and Senator Kemp both asked why the former Attorney-General was so keen to move in this way. There is plenty of evidence available to answer that question. The impetus to make the United Nations declaration part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act came from Sir Ronald Wilson. It was at a multi-faith seminar at Monash University in 1991 that he, as chairman of that group, was made aware of the problems of minority religions within Australia and of the prejudice that many of them faced. It was a conference convened by the World Conference on Religion and Peace.

His letter to the Attorney-General in 1991 urging him to move in this way arose out of his concerns during the Gulf War in which Australian Muslims were subjected to incidents of racism which certainly impinged on their freedom of religion.

        I need to give the Senate some information about this booklet and where it comes from. The sponsoring organisation of the booklet is the Foundation for the Advancement of Christian Studies. This organisation is a front for a United States based movement known as Christian reconstructionism. It is ultra-Calvinist and exclusive. It has a mission to rule the world by translating into modern law many old testament prohibitions, including capital punishment for offences which I believe we would find quite bizarre. One of the contributing authors is Dr Rushdoony, who is the intellectual guru of the reconstruction movement in the United States. The Foundation for the Advancement of Christian Studies is linked with the Logos Foundation, as is the Network for Christian Values—another source of many of the objections which I received.

        Objections were also received from mainstream Christians. I do not want to play numbers games with either Senator Knowles or Senator Boswell, but the Council of Churches of Western Australia represents many thousands of Christians. The Uniting Church of Australia, which apart from some individuals has been very supportive of this declaration, represents hundreds of thousands of Christians in Australia. It is important, however, to try to answer some of the objections, no matter what their source is. By not supporting the opposition's motion, the Australian Democrats guarantee the freedom of those with whom we disagree to have their views heard, and we would want to do that.

        I move now to just a few of the specific objections which are recorded in this book. One of the objections which is reiterated on almost every page is a fear of the United Nations, which the authors of this book seem to see as some conspiracy or some monstrous enemy. For instance, it says:

       That is the way the authors of this book view the United Nations.

        Another argument in this book which supports an objection to the declaration is the constant affirmation that Australia is a Christian country. In terms of religion, Australia has a majority of Christians, but we need to understand the history of Christianity in Australia and to understand that Christianity in Australia is racked by division and sectarianism.

        Some of those who have objected to the declaration have said that we are protected by the Australian constitution. Again we need to understand the history of that particular clause in the constitution which prohibits the establishment of any religion. It was designed to overcome the sectarian debates of the 19th century in which the Church of England particularly tried to have itself established as the state church in Australia, as it had been in England. For that reason, the framers of the Australian constitution put into that clause the technical phrase that there should not be any religion established in Australia. For the same reason, the qualification of religion for any public office, as had plagued English history, was disallowed in our constitution.

        I have searched in this book for any theology or Christian values to justify the position which is taken. I find it to be almost totally lacking, apart from a few biblical references which are taken totally out of context. My experience as a university chaplain, dealing with students from overseas and those with religions other than my own, has served to underline the richness of the variety of the religions that we have in this country. But it also underlines the prejudice which exists between religious groups. I am sad to say that the most vehement religious prejudice is often on behalf of those whom Ron Boswell described as fundamentalist Christians. I regret that. I worked incredibly hard as a university chaplain to bring some of those groups together.

It is not about claiming that people have bullied religious groups. It is not even about counting religious groups. It is much more fundamental than that. It is about how we ensure freedom. Those on the other side of the chamber fall into what is called the positivist camp. They believe that it is possible in this world to create a set of rules and derive everything from those rules.

        Those of us on this side of the chamber differ because we base our philosophy very much on natural law. The fundamental principle, which Senators Panizza, Ian Macdonald, Ferguson, Watson or myself would all agree with, is that everybody should be free, except when that freedom infringes somebody else's freedom. That is the way one has a harmonious society. In a family one does not have to write down all the rules and say, `So and so shall be allowed to do this and so and so shall not be allowed to do that'. One says, `You have as much freedom as you want, provided that you do not infringe other people's freedom'. That precept requires people in the course of their actions to think about how what they do might affect other people.

So much for that protection. But when one builds a society that is based on mutual respect, the protections run much more deeply. It is totally ridiculous for anybody to say that we do not in our body of law in this country at this moment have protection for people's religious beliefs. Of course we do. It is well recognised.

        It is not as though the proposal that the government brings before the chamber is one that will add to the law. Is it that this proposal will make the legal system function more efficiently? That too is not the case because the body which will be charged with the oversight of these matters is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. This is not a judicial body; it does not follow the rules of court that one might find in the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of Queensland or in any of the equivalent courts in other states. It is a body that is not obliged to follow the usual rules of evidence. It is a statutory body, not a judicial body.

        What concerns me and those of us on this side of the chamber is that increasingly in this country we seem to be giving to statutory bodies and public office holders the right to hear matters which should be more appropriately heard in courts of law. It is strange that we have in this constitution of ours a prohibition on the establishment of religion. The government says, `We have a proposal that is going to enlarge religious freedom', but the interesting thing is that it gives the power to decide to Commonwealth officers. When one has government deciding on religion one really does have grounds for concern and fear.

The question is: are minority religions better protected through the positivist viewpoint or are they better projected through natural law? My unswerving belief is that they are better protected through natural law because at the end of the day they are always dependent under the positivist viewpoint on government. They are always dependent on what the government will let them have. Therefore, they are always dependent upon the goodwill of the government not to take away what they have been given.

Do not forget that this government, which comes before us tonight and says, `We are going to champion the cause of religious freedom', was also the government that came before this Senate during the last three years and said, `We are going to protect free speech by banning it'.

But what Senator Schacht does not understand—and this is the important point—is that when one has a natural law basis for one's freedoms one does not rely on people like Senator Schacht and the Labor Party to write the law. One relies on the essential equality of men and women for those freedoms and rights. I believe very firmly that the position that the National and Liberal parties have arrived at is absolutely correct.

This fear comes from the fact that the declaration is based on a UN declaration in which the clarity of meaning has been sacrificed for the sake of compromise.

        The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights require that the state parties to the covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. In a similar vein, article 5(1) of the UN declaration provides that parents and legal guardians of children have the right to organise the life within the family in accordance with their belief or religion and bearing in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be raised. Meanwhile, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship amongst peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, with respect for freedom of religion or belief of others, in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow man.

        A parent concerned to educate his or her child in accordance with the parent's religious commitments could well find that the tenets of his or her religion are not in conformity with these particular requirements.

But the point I wish to make is that it is inconsistent with article 5(2) of the declaration. This article states that, while every child shall enjoy the right to have access to education in the matter of religion or belief in accordance with the wishes of his parents or legal guardians, he shall not be compelled to receive teaching in religion or belief against his wishes. `The best interests of the child' is the guiding principle.

        It is this very phrase, `the best interests of the child', which I put to you, Mr Deputy President, opens the door for the overriding of parental wishes in relation to the religious education of their children. Many Christian groups, parents and churches are concerned that, as fewer and fewer families within society are embracing the once strong Western European Judaeo-Christian traditions within their families, these groups in the long term actually could become a minority. In the extreme case, members of our society could declare that the so-called Christian education and the transmitting of Christian ethics and values that occurs within these families could be regarded by others within society as not being in the best interests of the child.

        I know that this is the extreme situation and that many would say that this would not occur in a country with freedoms such as we have in Australia—guaranteed by a judicial system, by the parliaments around the country, including this parliament, and the constitution—but would occur only in places with a regime such as that in, say, the former communist USSR.

        The point that I am making is that the present HREOC act gives us freedom of religion. The vague definitions of what is religious freedom and what is in the best interests of the child really need very careful consideration. Therefore, I believe that any proposal for domestic legislation seeking to protect or promote religious freedom must be viewed with the greatest of care. The consequences of this declaration in practical terms have been aptly expressed by Bishop Daily, the Bishop of Sandhurst. In correspondence to my lower house colleagues he noted as one example:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Non Catholic Students attend Catholic Schools, and under this article they could maintain that their Religious beliefs are not catered for, also they could maintain that they will not abide by that Schools regulations with regard to Christian principles, and could maintain they are being coerced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amongst his many other comments he finally states that, effectively, governments could make state and church education systems one, with no religion taught in schools. Possible reasons that could be given are: that no one religion covers all beliefs and that religions, therefore, have no place in school curriculums. This is a view that has been put in certain states of the United States.

        This is a fear held not only by Catholic parents—and I ask my good friend Senator Barney Cooney, a man of tremendous tolerance and religious conviction, to consider this aspect. In Tasmania I have been approached by members of many of the Protestant churches as well. This very week, in fact, I intend to present another petition from 150 signatories who are prominent church people within my own town of Launceston and who are concerned about this declaration. They believe it could restrict the parents' right to oversee the religious education of their children. In addition, I have a file several centimetres thick of letters on this issue which have steadily been delivered to my office over the past few months. Many of these letters have five to 10 signatures. So permeating right across society there is this fear or concern that this is probably not necessary in Australia.

        Overall, I would say that several hundred constituents throughout Tasmania have contacted me with regard to this issue. These people are concerned. The possible loss of parents' right to educate their children in their religion is not regarded lightly by many constituents or, indeed, by me. I know that many will say that I am citing the extreme position. But the point to make is that, when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act is examined, it can be noted that it already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. There is no need to extend that freedom, as far as we are concerned, in Australia. It may be necessary in other countries, but it is not necessary here.

        The commission already has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringement of that freedom by the Commonwealth or, indeed, by its agencies. Therefore, I contend that there is no need now to extend through this declaration the definition of human rights, particularly with regard to religious freedom; and that this chamber, therefore, should disallow this declaration. But I look forward to the informed comments of my colleague, the deeply religious senator across the way, the honourable Barney Cooney.

        Let us look at the strategy that was used to have this declaration disallowed. The only basis for disallowance is the argument that there was no appropriate opportunity for public consideration. In other words, the motion itself does not contain any provision saying that there is anything wrong with the general thrust of what this declaration does. The declaration in itself is not attacked; the only thing attacked is the fact that there has not been an appropriate opportunity for public consideration. So debate in this house about other matters—that there is uncertainty and that the declaration may lead to all sorts of dire consequences—does not relate to the motion.

        To be fair, the honourable member for Tangney, Mr Williams, discussed these other issues. But these other issues are not raised in the motion. In his speech, Mr Williams said:

      <para>
       He accepts that proposition. In other words, the declaration does not in any way introduce into the domestic law the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief. He continued:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of the Human Rights Commissioner contained in the HREOC Act in relation to investigating conduct that constitutes a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       So all the declaration does is put forward propositions with which, I hope, everybody in this chamber would agree. The only practical effect it has in relation to anything being able to be enforced is in terms of the Commonwealth and its agencies. So it does not go, for example, to issues of relationships between members of a family. Mr Williams went on to say:

        Accordingly, it is accepted that some of the more extreme fears that have been voiced, and in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should be disallowed.
       </tab>
      </para>

       But the fact of the matter is that this motion attempts to disallow a declaration that does not have general application throughout the community, which does not in any way interfere with the way the domestic law operates, but which does contain great propositions that we would have hoped everybody would agree with. It is very difficult, given that situation, to see why this declaration should be disallowed.

        Its adoption in 1981 means little more than that the principles sought to be stated in the declaration were accepted by Australia as a step in the process of endeavouring to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination.

       Mr Williams uses that as an argument against the declaration and in favour of the disallowance motion. I would have thought that statement is an argument very much in favour of allowing the declaration and for voting against the disallowance motion.

        If we vote against the declaration, we will, according to the propositions put forward by the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, be voting against Australia helping to bring to fruition international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. By voting against this, we will be, on the very argument put forward by the shadow Attorney-General, rejecting a proposition that could help spread religious tolerance and anti-discrimination amongst the world as a whole.

        Let us be in no doubt about what will be the effect of voting to disallow the declaration. On the analysis of the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, we would be voting down a step in the process of endeavouring to reach `a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination'. What he is really saying is that he does not want that to happen but that there is uncertainty in the way the declaration is framed. Anything is uncertain. For example, section 92 of the constitution, which states that interstate trade will be absolutely free, is uncertain. This has been shown to be the case by the High Court, even though the meaning seems to be apparent at first glance.

        It could be argued that laws out of which uncertainty can be teased should be rejected. But on that basis, most legislation that comes before any parliament could be rejected. Mr Williams asked, for example, what is meant by `appropriate charitable institutions'—an expression used in part of the declaration. What does that mean? I would have thought that meant charitable institutions of a good quality; that one cannot get out of ones obligations under the declaration by setting up an institution which is inferior and really cannot be used for the purpose for which it is intended. In my view, that is quite clear. In any event, a court would have no more trouble in interpreting that than it would have in interpreting most legislation that comes through this place.

If fuzzy law is all right to guide corporations in this country, why is it not all right to guide the sort of conduct that we all instinctively know is right—that is, that there ought to be religious freedom and that people should not be persecuted for their beliefs?

        Mr Williams went on to tease out of the HREOC legislation and the declaration an apparent conflict. With respect to Mr Williams—a great lawyer—that is again taking a very technical approach. The courts and people in society generally know instinctively how balances are to be struck in legislation that is apparently contradictory. It is only contradictory when it is read in a very black letter way. Mr Williams says that the declaration might allow religious bodies to promote unacceptable practices involving mutilation of the body. He states:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In societies observing other religions, females are accorded inferior status and rights. Indeed, religious beliefs and practices which effectively make women and children second-class citizens almost certainly conflict with existing equal opportunity and sex discrimination legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is probably right. Any sensible person would say that if there is freedom of religion, it is not a freedom to mutilate women; it is not a freedom to treat certain sections of society as second-class citizens. It means that we all should be entitled to the deeply held beliefs we have. Towards the end of his speech, Mr Williams says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The government should amend the HREOC Act to allow for examination of international instruments prior to their being declared in relation to other functions of the commission. The government should also undertake to educate the people of Australia about the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its instruments on Australian law. The government should also seek to educate Australians about the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government, through failing to keep the people of Australia informed about these matters, is responsible for causing widespread concern in the community about this United Nations declaration and the effect of the ministerial declaration under the HREOC Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand the shadow Attorney-General to be saying, `There is really nothing wrong with this declaration', in spite of what has been said by his colleagues on the other side. He is saying that there is nothing wrong with this declaration, but that it has not been properly explained. That is consistent with the way in which the motion before us tonight is put forward; the only objection is that there has not been opportunity for public consideration of the declaration. The two things that come out of what Mr Williams says are: firstly, that there has been a lack of consultation; and secondly, that there should be more education of the people of Australia about how the United Nations works, how these declarations work and how the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission works. Those are all procedural matters.

        The content of this declaration is not taken to task. The issue of whether or not it is properly framed is not really a matter going to its substance; it is a matter that goes to the way it is expressed. That seems a most slender basis for rejecting this declaration. It seems to be agreed by the shadow attorney-general that the sentiments in the declaration are magnificent. Nobody could argue with that. It allows for freedom of religion, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience, and we are going to disallow the declaration on the most slender of grounds. We are going to cast aside a declaration which was adopted in 1981 by the Fraser government—a government of the coalition. Mr Williams says the declaration took 19 years in the drafting. It has been around since 1981. People understand this; they have surely discussed it. It has raised great issues. Yet tonight it will be rejected and, no doubt, that will be the end of the matter.

It was his suggestion that this declaration be brought in in the context of the Gulf War.

        If the declaration is voted down, it will be another example of the interests in this parliament simply centring on economic matters. Many of those economic matters are based on economic rationalism. An eminent judge in Victoria, Mr Justice Vincent, who today addressed the law conference in Hobart said, `There is not only economic rationalism, there is social rationalism' which means that those great aspirations that we should have as members of society are put aside in the interests of efficiency, whatever that may mean.

It has only a practical effect on the Federal government and its agencies. On the other hand, its passage would allow a great educative impact to occur in society where religion is, in my view, still of great importance, still the basis of our society and something we should give attention to.

        The common law, it would appear, does not regard discrimination on racial or religious grounds as contrary to public policy.

Such conditions may fail if no meaning can properly be ascribed to the terms employed by the testator or if no efficacy can be given to the application of the condition to the facts.

As has already been shown by well intentioned moves of the government in the past—trying to show the way to the rest of the world—the signing of these UN conventions and treaties has caused all sorts of troubles in our country.

While we might say it is the best thing they can have and it is good for them, it is a little like the GST argument. We tried to tell people that it was the best tax available and the best for them, but in the end they were frightened of it. I believe this is a similar type of thing; whilst it may look good on paper and it may be the perfect set of words, they are concerned because it interferes with what is to most people a basic right and a basic freedom.

        This declaration is further evidence of the government's attempt to divide our nation. As I said, there are two matters which are considered sacred by most Australians: one is the constitution and the other is religion. In recent months we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seeking to divide our nation on both these issues. He has proved that he will do anything to keep the nation's mind off the real problems at the moment—that is, the disastrous state of our economy, unemployment and the failed budget.

        It is quite clear to me, as I said earlier, given the amount of correspondence, telephone calls and whatever that I have received—not from organised religious bodies, but from people from all facets of society—that the majority of Australians do not want Australia to have anything to do with this declaration. It is also clear that neither the government nor the Democrats give a damn about what the majority of Australians think. If we proceed with this declaration, it will be against the wishes of the Australian people. It will show the Australian people that the government and the Democrats are more concerned about their own agenda than they are about the wishes of the community.

        I believe that the definition of intolerance and discrimination contained in the declaration is an unacceptable constraint upon the practising of religion in this country. I say that not just from the viewpoint of the Christian religion, but from the viewpoint of all those who practise their various religions in our country. That is a key point because the adoption by Australia of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief would appear to presuppose that we have some problem in that regard.

        From the opportunity which I have had to examine the religious freedoms available in other nations, I do not think there is any doubt that this country is one of the most tolerant in the world, so why would we want to change it? Australia is a multicultural nation where people live side by side, person to person and religion to religion. It is my view that the only religious intolerance which exists in Australia today is the type of inherently evil intolerance which cannot and would not be eradicated by 20 United Nations declarations.

        As an open-minded and fair nation, it is clear that there are parts of the declaration with which we would all agree. For instance, we all recognise that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. We already uphold the view that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. But there is a concern—and I believe it is a genuine one—that if we incorporate the United Nations declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC act, we will not protect religious freedom in Australia; rather we will limit it. This point has been made continually by all my colleagues.

        Like you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I attended the IPU conference here a couple of weeks ago. If you attended the drafting meetings on motions that we wanted to put down dealing with different nations, you would know just how much give and take there was to come to an acceptable form of words. Who is to say that, at the end of the day, the meanings of those acceptable forms of words that we agreed to cannot be misinterpreted? The motion about Bosnia-Herzegovina was agreed to only as a result of bowing to the wishes of some of the Iranian people who were of a different religion from the other people who were putting forward another point of view. I believe that is how these declarations are arrived at. As I said, they make look very good on paper, but it is the way that they are interpreted at the end of the day which is important.

        The declaration has special and concerning ramifications for our schooling system. This has been pointed out by more than one speaker tonight, but I will go over it again from my own point of view. The situation could easily develop under the declaration where students attending a school of a particular religion could claim that their own religious beliefs are being ignored. They could also claim that any attempt to have them conform with the school's principles of behaviour amounted to religious coercion. The declaration could also lead to a claim of discrimination by minority religious groups over larger religious groups over matters as straightforward as a government grant, for instance. These are some of the concerns that have been coming forward from independent schools. We have an independent school system which relies on government funding and we do not want to put in measures in a way that could interfere with the fair continuation of that system.

        As an aside, I was lucky enough to attend a school in Hobart—and Senator Harradine would be aware of it—which is the only Quaker school in the Southern Hemisphere. That particular school, at which I was a boarder more years ago than I wish to remember, was my first taste of different religious groups. On Sunday mornings we would all trot off to our own particular churches. There were some six or eight churches ranging from the Methodist Church through to the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church and the Presbyterian Church.

        The fact of the matter is that we attended a Quaker school and we abided by Quaker beliefs. But if one of the minor religious groups attending that school took this particular convention to its utmost conclusion, it could take issue with being taught by a particular person who is of another religion. Its students may say that they had been discriminated against because they would not obey the particular method by which they were being taught or the particular religions that they were asked to go along with. I suppose one could say that they do not have to attend that school and that they could go to another school where the religion might suit them. If that was to happen, I think it would create more divisions in the community and would alienate people in a way that we do not wish to happen.

        In summary, the HREOC act already covers religious freedom. The definition is vague and inconsistent and the impact of this convention that we are trying to disallow is unclear. It is not clear whether the declaration would condone religious beliefs or practices which Australians might find abhorrent. I am suggesting that the HREOC act should be amended to allow greater scrutiny of these international instruments because I believe that until now they have caused great concern amongst Australian voters. If we do not come up with a better system of scrutinising them, they will continue to be a problem to members of both sides of the chamber, I suspect. I suggest that this might be a good idea in theory, but in practice it will be a disaster and just cause more division in our community when we should be pulling together in all sorts of ways. I look forward very much to hearing the comments of my Tasmanian colleague Senator Harradine.

        Surely we all believe that everyone should have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion? They are the most fundamental of human rights. I am not suggesting for a moment that those people who initiated debate in this area as far back as 1960 or 1961 believed other than that the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion were the most fundamental of human rights. I am sure that they believed that these were fundamental human rights and that action by the United Nations would advance and promote these fundamental human rights. We have to realise that these freedoms are the inherent right of every human being. Why? It is because human beings are created by God and the relationship between human beings and the creator is the most fundamental of all. Therefore, we obviously all agree that this is the most fundamental of human rights.

These human rights are inherent, universal and inalienable. They cannot be taken away by states or by human rights and equal opportunity commissions and they cannot be given away by the bearers of those rights. Those rights are needed to ensure the full flourishing of the humanity of each individual who bears those rights.

        I do not suggest for one moment that the persons who formulated this declaration were ill-intentioned; on the contrary. However, as I see it, there are problems with this declaration. It appears to attempt to qualify the provisions in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was agreed upon by the United Nations in 1948. It appears to qualify provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I believe it is a bit like what happened in Vienna in June of this year when a 28-page document on human rights qualified, in my view, very substantially the very simple six page Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted in 1948.  Certain provisions  of  the  Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief are vague and open to the possibility of misin-terpretation. That is the key to the problem. The motion moved by Senator Vanstone calls for a public debate on this declaration before it becomes an attachment to legislation.

It has happened before. Tomorrow, when we come to deal with the rights of the child convention, I will give the Senate an example of where a misinterpretation of the provisions has led to actions by the international monitoring committee which I believe are quite contrary to the intentions of the drafters of that declaration.

        As I say, Australia has changed. Leading jurists in this country have recognised that change, but the opposition still remains barricaded to the past. One can ask oneself why in 1981 it was the then Liberal-National party government that voted for this particular instrument internationally; why it was part of a universal and unanimous position internationally to adopt this instrument; and why some 12 years later the coalition has gone backwards. Have the Liberal and National parties gone backwards or was it hypocrisy at the time? That is a stark choice for those who may be interested in this debate to try to discern. They either did not believe what they were doing in 1981 or, as Malcolm Fraser said of the Liberal Party just before the election, in economic thought the party has gone backwards. It is obvious in social thought that it has not progressed at all—it has even gone backwards from 1981.

        It was the Liberal-National party government which put up Australia's hand at the United Nations in support of this instrument some 12 years ago. But it is the opposition that continually shows itself to be isolated in terms of the public debate, the social debate and the changes that are going on in this society. As I say, the instrument was adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 1981, and it has not let it rest since then. Earlier this year in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, under its agenda item on the implementation of the declaration, a resolution was passed calling on states to ensure that their legal systems provided adequate guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and so on. The UN has maintained an interest in this matter as have people in this country.

        Once again, as in 1981 when the instrument was adopted unanimously, this year a resolution encouraging member states to implement measures to embrace the instrument was co-sponsored by 38 countries and adopted without a vote. If one wants to see to what degree the opposition is isolated on this matter, one only needs to look at the list of those countries who urged this measure. Those countries not only included Australia, Canada and Ireland but also the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. Who are those opposite left with? Who are their friends internationally?  There is not one member state. There was unanimous adoption in 1981 and unanimous encouragement now for governments to embrace this international instrument.

        As I said earlier, in 1991 Sir Ronald Wilson took the initiative in 1991 and wrote to the Attorney-General on 4 March of that year initiating discussion for the adoption of this instrument. This letter talks about the passage of a unanimous resolution at the World Conference for Religion and Peace Consultation in Melbourne in 1991. This shows how isolated the opposition is. I think the following passage from Sir Ronald's letter should be placed in the

I answered in the affirmative, whereupon there was spontaneous applause. The meeting then resolved unanimously to that effect and I was asked to bring the suggestion to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

        Sir Ronald Wilson then raised the matter with the Attorney-General. That then led to the consultation in 1991 that Senator Harradine now demands. There was some 18 months to two years of consultation. How much more consultation does one have to have before one gets stagnation through consultation?  Mr Duffy then embarked upon a process of consultation. High level consultation was appropriate having regard to the commission's existing responsibilities.

         Attorney-General Duffy wrote to all states attorneys-general in March 1992. He received replies from all states, and only Western Australia and New South Wales had objections. We have since seen those objections to be without substance and as a consequence the government embraced the instrument.

        We have another by-product in the debate this afternoon. Opposition senators have been running hot with their arguments and their fear campaign. What does the shadow Attorney-General say about the basic point that those opposite are concerned about? They are concerned that what we are doing by embracing this instrument is to incorporate into domestic law the articles of the instrument. This is the concern of the New South Wales Attorney-General, but it is not a real concern. There is no inconsistency because we do not incorporate into domestic law the provisions of this instrument. Those opposite do not have to believe me and they do not have to believe either the former Attorney-General or the current one. Let me quote what the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, said in the debate in the House of Representatives on 1 September 1993. In total contrast to what has been put by some opposite speakers this afternoon, he said:

       The debate this afternoon by those opposite has been fuelled by fear and is of no substance. Their own spokesperson in the other chamber has acknowledged that by embracing this declaration we do not introduce into Australian domestic law the provisions of such declaration. As a consequence the fears of inconsistency that the New South Wales Attorney-General Hannaford had are no longer valid.

        I will not go on for too long on this because we have gone on long enough. The government has embraced this instrument for a number of reasons. The reasons have already been spelt out by the Attorney-General in the House of Representatives. We feel that it is important for us to reaffirm our position in respect to the protection of rights of religious freedom. It is a position that we have held and that is embraced by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

        It is important to reaffirm it in an instrument which consolidates the jurisprudence on this particular matter. That is the second reason why we are proceeding with this particular provision. The effect of the provision will be to ensure that HREOC will not only ensure that the Commonwealth government, its laws and its practices, conform with the declaration but also will have the function of promoting religious tolerance in the community. We feel that in the context of a diverse multicultural society—with 120 to 140 different ethnic backgrounds and a whole range of religions—it is important for us to do that.

          —By letter dated 27 September 1993, Senator Ferguson, pursuant to standing order 81, has raised with me a matter of privilege, and has asked that, in accordance with that standing order, I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges. The issue raised by Senator Ferguson is whether false or misleading information was given to Estimates Committee E or the Senate in relation to the proposed diesel fuel rebate tax.

          Senator Ferguson has set out in his letter the sequence of events relating to this matter. It appears from the facts as stated by Senator Ferguson that Estimates Committee E was told that legislation was not necessary to introduce the proposed tax, and that this information was given to the committee after instructions had been issued to prepare legislation. Senator Ferguson has also raised the question of whether appropriate action was taken to correct evidence given to the committee when the real facts became known.

          The giving of false or misleading evidence is declared by Senate Privilege Resolution No. 6 to be a contempt of the Senate. Past references by the Senate to the Committee of Privileges, reports by that committee and action taken by the Senate in relation to those reports indicate that the Senate takes very seriously any suggestion that false or misleading evidence has been given.

          In considering whether to give precedence to a motion to refer a matter of privilege to the Committee of Privileges, I am required to take into account criteria laid down by the Senate. I have explained to the Senate in previous cases how I apply those criteria. In essence, the principal criterion refers to the seriousness of the issues raised, and I give precedence to a motion which is capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting that criterion. The other criterion refers to the unavailability of another remedy, and I give precedence to a motion if there is no other readily available remedy.

          The matter raised by Senator Ferguson clearly meets the criteria I am required to consider. I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the privileges committee may have precedence. I table the letter from Senator Ferguson. Senator Ferguson may now give notice of a motion.

By arrangement, I allowed the Democrats to move their amendment first and to let them explain it so that we could understand what it was about, having only just seen the amendment as we walked into the chamber.

         My foreshadowed amendment was to omit the proposed amendment to subsections 8(2) and (3) of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. I understand that since that time the government has come to a conclusion on the amendments, including the amendment foreshadowed by me, and that it will move an amendment very much along the lines of the amendment that I was going to move. I will not be proceeding with my amendment if the government is intending to move an amendment in exactly the same terms.

        This amendment received considerable attention from coalition senators, notably Senator Watson. The purpose of it was to bring to the government the opportunity to place in legislation those actions which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) had already taken with regard to Exit Cave.

         I would expect the government to support this amendment because of that very fact that the minister has taken action in this area. If that action was worth taking under ministerial directive, it is worth incorporating in legislation. If the action was not seriously taken by the minister, but, rather, she was forced into this situation, as I believe she was, then perhaps the government will back away. I believe the minister was forced into this position by the consistent and constant pressure applied not only by me on behalf of the Democrats but also by those who are concerned for the future of this World Heritage area in Tasmania.

         Without the action that the minister was obliged to take in defence of the World Heritage values of this area, those values would have been compromised. Having forced the minister to take this action, I believe the only responsible thing I can do is to press for the incorporation into the legislation of the action that the minister took. I will take the first opportunity to do that, and that opportunity presents itself here.

         The bill is largely about correcting mistakes that were found in earlier legislation. It is yet another in a litany of bills which demonstrate the government's appalling management of its legislative program. Legislation is rushed through this chamber, indeed rushed through both chambers, without adequate scrutiny, and then—I know my colleagues agree with me—six months later the government comes crawling back to this parliament with corrections saying that it is very, very sorry but it has got to `fix this up'.

         The changes in this particular case are relatively minor. The most substantive of them relates to the secrecy provisions in the Health Insurance Act. As honourable senators would be well aware, departmental officers often receive requests for information about public and private hospitals. The information sought includes names and addresses of hospitals, bed capacity, kinds of services provided, teaching status and whether the hospitals are public or private. The incredible thing is that under current legislation this important information is protected, although it is readily available in the public domain. Obviously, it is a nonsense.

         What is important to debate—and this bill gives us an opportunity to do so—is just what has happened to the health care of Australians under this government. The budget has given us some more examples of missed opportunities and the mismanagement by this government of the health care of Australians. We have all seen the back-pedalling by the government on a number of measures. But, even with the changes that appear likely to go through, this is still a regressive budget.

         Following pressure from the coalition, the later protests of the Australian Democrats and the Greens and, finally, the caucus revolt, the government announced its intention to rescind the decision that optometrists' fees would no longer be claimable from Medicare. This government went to the last election fighting about the preservation of Medicare; it claimed that the opposition was ready to dismantle Medicare. What sort of government would now have the hide to come in here and start to dismantle Medicare? That is exactly what happened with the optometrists' charges. Under that change which was proposed from 1 November, average Australian families would have been forking out almost $50 for a first consultation with their optometrist and another $25 for a follow-up consultation. Yet, at the moment they pay nothing because over 90 per cent of optometrists bulk-bill.

         Those changes that were announced in the budget constituted a tax on spectacle wearers of $50 a year. Now that that measure has been dumped, there is a $90 million hole in the health budget. We do not know how the government proposes to address this funding shortfall; we will be very interested to find out. It is certainly going to make for some explanations at some stage or other. I think we will be waiting for some time for an answer to that question because the government continues to address some of the very important issues in the health portfolio, and that is but one of them.

         The budget has failed to tackle in any substantive way the real problems in the health portfolio. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the principal savings. They are built on a false edifice. Claims that this budget will reduce medical fraud and overservicing are quite unconvincing, particularly in the light of the government's past performance. The National President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, has questioned the extent of the savings, as have I.

         Let us turn to the reduction of hospital queues. Senator Richardson appears to be conducting a sleight of hand. The government made a great play during the election about how it would do something about hospital queues and, as I recall, there was a promise of $100 million over four years to reduce those queues for elective surgery. These are the queues where your grandmother or your aunty is waiting for a hip operation, or uncle is waiting for a prostate operation; they are waiting in pain for months or years for those operations. So the government, which had been in charge of the health budget for 10 years, turned around at the election and said, `Okay, quick, quick; we'll throw $100 million at it over four years'. If we look very closely at the budget, that is not what the government is doing at all.

         Last year in an existing program the Labor government committed $48 million to the states and territories to reduce waiting times; this financial year it is allocating only $12.4 million. In a new program this year the government has allocated an additional $12.4 million. So the old program has been reduced by about $36 million and the new program will receive $12.4 million. That is where the sleight of hand comes in. It appears that there will be $23.2 million less available for getting hospital beds in the private sector than last year. So much for the election promise of $100 million over four years. It was not much of a promise anyway because, as Dr Nelson has pointed out, buying private beds for public patients will exacerbate the decline in the number of people who are privately insured. With not enough money coming into the system through encouragement of the private sector, increased rationing is inevitable.

So the money the government will spend, which is less than we expected it to be spending, will be spent on studies. This is a government which delights in spending taxpayers' money on studies. It has consultants here and consultants there. The government tends to spend quite a bit of the money in the last couple of months of the financial year, I have found. Some of the anecdotal evidence which has come to my attention from various departments is that these things get filed away at the end of the financial year. It has something to do with not losing the funding for the next year, I understand.

         Let us look at other matters. The budget rations the access of members of the general public to pharmaceuticals. They face a higher safety net and when they reach the net they will no longer receive drugs free. Senator Richardson has also recently announced a review of the Medicare benefits schedule. This is a longer term measure since it is to occur over a period of two years starting later this year. He has also said that he will be taking a package of measures to cabinet late this year aimed at addressing the problem of a plummeting number of Australians holding private health cover.

         But the trouble is that, on purely irrational and blind ideological grounds, Senator Richardson has ruled out the measure which would best address this problem—tax incentives to encourage greater participation. It is clear to Blind Freddy and his dog that tax incentives are the best way possible to allow low to middle income earners to afford to stay in private health insurance. The number of people who are on relatively low incomes and who are clinging to their private health insurance like grim death is really very surprising. It is an indication of how important it is to many Australians; yet this government does not recognise the financial difficulty that they are under in trying to maintain that private health insurance.

         Senator Richardson is prepared to sock the wealthy; he is prepared to give a stick to those wealthy, like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is not prepared to pay for his own private health insurance but insists on using the public sector and taking beds from those who cannot afford private health insurance. Senator Richardson is prepared to deal with people like the Prime Minister; he is not prepared to recognise that people on low to middle incomes want desperately to stay in private health insurance; and he is not prepared to help them through tax incentives. It is a nonsense. If Senator Richardson were to go down any main street in Australia he would find people saying to him, `Please, help us with tax incentives'.

         I would be interested to know just what role Senator Richardson played in the decision to increase the price of leaded fuel by 10c a litre as originally promised in the budget, because the government has defended this increase on health grounds—a concern for children and for the level of lead in their blood. In my view that is a totally specious argument. It is simply a massive tax grab which hurts low income earners more than anyone else. In a searing article just after the budget was brought down, Margo Kingston, the columnist in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        Why, he was asked, was he raising the price of leaded petrol above that of unleaded, a tax targeted at the poor who couldn't afford newer cars? He used children to try to sell that one. Apparently it's the children of the poor who suffer most from lead poisoning. Apparently that means their parents should pay extra. He said he was encouraging the poor to buy non-leaded petrol cars.

         How could they, when he'd devalued the value of their current car overnight, increased their petrol prices, and raised the price of newer cars? If he really cared about children's health why didn't he use the funds raised for a rebate to convert old cars to non-leaded petrol?

        I think that expresses it extremely well. The government cannot parade in these hypocritical clothes trying to pretend that that tax grab on fuel is anything to do with the health of children. It is clear to all Australians that the government has been motivated by the need for increased revenue rather than a commitment to improving the health of Australians, in particular, Australian children.

         I conclude by pointing out that more than a quarter of all households in Australia are now mainly dependent on welfare. While the major issues at the head of this government are the republic and the flag—the modern version of the bread and circuses to distract a people in trouble—one million people are without a job; 100,000 of them are waiting in queues for elective surgery; and more than a quarter of households live on welfare. No wonder the suicide rates among our young are rising. The health and the life of this nation are in jeopardy.

         —This evening I will look briefly at the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. The Australian Democrats basically have no problem with this legislation. The legislation makes a number of minor amendments, quite a few of which are simply to correct drafting errors. There are two main areas of change. The first is the creation of criminal offences within the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act.

         These offences relate to the giving of false or misleading information in support of various applications and submissions made under the act. These applications and submissions are basically for the purpose of obtaining financial assistance from the Commonwealth government or, indeed, for cancelling the right of someone to financial assistance. It has been assumed that false information given under the act came within the ambit of the general provisions of the Crimes Act; however, this has been challenged and the government has now moved to clarify this situation.

         The bill makes it clear that it is an offence to give false or misleading information in certain circumstances under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act. The Democrats do not have any problems with this move. The government should be able to rely upon the accuracy of information it is given when it is making decisions about the suitability of people to provide aged care services. Other recipients of public funds, for example, social security recipients, are expected to provide accurate information to the government and can be prosecuted if they do not. I cannot see any reason for the providers of nursing homes, hostels and other aged care services not to have the same obligation.

         The second major change is that this bill contains a number of amendments to the National Health Act dealing with nursing homes. The one which has caused some concern in certain sections of the industry is the requirement upon nursing home proprietors to keep records which can verify their entitlement to Commonwealth subsidies for a period of seven years. Again, this is in line with similar requirements placed upon corporations under the taxation law and we do not have any problems with requiring recipients of Commonwealth funds to keep such records. Proprietors should be able to produce valid records in support of their claims, and I do not see that this is in any way onerous or unfair.

         The reality is that, since this government has been in power, the people that were prepared to put money into the system are no longer prepared to do so. It is bankrupt. It is as simple as that. The levy was increased to bring in what appeared to be an increased sum of money and all it did was make up for the numbers that have gone out. Only a little over a third of the population in this country pays any Medicare levy. People do not realise that.

They pay their Medicare levy but, because the income level at which the Medicare levy comes in is higher than the taxation level, they may pay as little as $50 a year. They feel that they are entitled to the benefits that they get. The average expenditure on health care for people in Australia is now about $1,700 a year. Because some people pay $50 a year they believe they are entitled to it. That is what they have been sold by the government—`It costs you nothing. Be in it, mate. You are entitled to it.

         Since this government has been in power the 75 per cent of the population who were prepared to be covered by private insurance has decreased to less than 40 per cent. In my own state of Queensland, the figure is down to 30 per cent. That may be rock bottom level. The same 30 per cent who are privately insuring are paying the Medicare levy. The rest is coming out of taxation. Any system that is funded by taxation is bust. It is bust because we have an aging population; two-thirds of the health care dollar is spent on people over the age of 60. It is bust because of the cost of technology. The only answer which the government has is rationing.

There are people dying on the waiting list. We will not hear about it. People do not like going to the press to complain about this. They are grieving. They are not going to create a fuss about it.

         The system is bankrupt. Senator Richardson has been floating balloons all over the place that say, `We should privately insure. We have to increase the money people pay to privately insure'. The answer? Give them rebates or tax deductions. Interestingly, the new, brave, Democrat Clinton plan will allow tax deductibility for private insurance in the United States. The big difference is that 80 per cent of premiums in the US are paid by employers. In essence, there will be a compulsory levy in the US which will come out of the pay packets paid for by employers. That is not an answer either. The answers are there; it is as simple as `get out'. Senator Richardson does not have to go running around the country to find out from everybody what the answer is. It has been as plain as a pikestaff for the last 15 years. We should encourage people to go into private insurance, to accept responsibility for their own health and to contribute towards it.

         There has to be a symbiotic movement between the public and the private sectors. They exist. To a large degree the public sector contributes to health care through major surgeries, such as liver and heart transplantations, which none of us could afford because of their intense cost. The private system can do it equally as well, and in many respects does it better. As a Queenslander I am proud to say that Queensland has the best private hospital system in Australia. For example, more gastroenterology is done in the private hospitals in Brisbane than in the public hospitals because of the long waiting lists there, and the standards are higher. The only machine that can mash up kidney stones, to use the vernacular—a lithotriptor—is in a private hospital in Queensland and public hospital patients have to be transported across to have the procedures done there.

         —Tonight the Senate is debating the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. I will be discussing the parts of the bill that Senator Newman did not address. Parts 2 and 6 of this bill make relatively minor changes to legislation governing the aged care program. According to the explanatory memorandum, these changes—which will commence on the date of royal assent—will have no financial impact. Part 2 would make it an offence to make a false or misleading statement, knowingly or recklessly, in support of various applications or submissions made under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act. This particular part of the principal act relates to the Commonwealth's subsidies for hostels and community aged care packages. Applications that are included in the proposed section include applications for financial assistance, an approval for a service, an approval to transfer a service or an approval as an approved operator.

         The offence would also apply to documents given to the minister, unless it is indicated that the document contains false or misleading information and reasonable steps are taken to provide the correct information to the minister. The maximum penalty laid down in the legislation is five years imprisonment. A similar offence with a similar penalty would also be introduced for making a false or misleading statement in relation to submissions seeking to contest a ministerial decision to revoke an approval.

         The coalition supports the proposed sections which would introduce an important safeguard into the parent act. Until now there has been a need to rely on the general offences under the crimes act. The government has indicated that the application of these general offences in this particular circumstance has been called into question.

         Part 6 of the bill provides that nursing home records which are required for the verification of claims for Commonwealth benefits under the national health act shall be retained for seven financial years. This seven-year retention requirement would also apply to any other records that the secretary requires a proprietor to keep as a result of serving a notice in writing. The seven-year financial period will commence on 1 July, after the financial year to which the records relate.

         The penalty for not keeping such records for seven financial years is 200 penalty units. For those who are used to having their fines defined in hard currency, the government is changing the way that it expresses penalties under various acts. Amendments made last year to sections 4AA and 4BB of the crimes act introduced a penalty unit with a monetary value of one hundred dollars.

         Relating penalties to a central reference point in the crimes act means that the government does not continually have to update the value of penalties with inflation in a large number of relevant Commonwealth acts. However, this is not of much consolation to a nursing home proprietor who has no idea of the definition or monetary value of a penalty unit.

         When I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I was acutely aware of how difficult it is, with the amount of delegated legislation that there is, for members of the public to access information. The more difficult it is to access information about laws pertaining to citizens, the more likely it is that they will have to seek legal assistance to actually get that information. I think we should do everything in our power to make the law as accessible to people as possible.

         As it ponders over whether it will agree to this very reasonable request, the government may like to explain why the seven-year retention provision carries a maximum penalty of 200 units, which is double the maximum penalty for a breach of the general retention provisions for nursing homes under section 61 of the national health act. It would also be useful if the government could explain to me and to other honourable senators why it has seen fit to increase the maximum penalties in relation to the retention of records from $1,000 in 1991 to the equivalent of $20,000 in 1993. In anyone's estimates this would seem like a fairly severe price hike.

         While the coalition will not oppose the introduction of the seven-year retention provision, it is important to point out that this amendment has been made necessary as a direct result of the department's totally unacceptable tardiness in validating expenditure by nursing homes under the post-1987 funding system.

I think that motion was circulated in the chamber, but I am indicating that I will not be moving that motion in the committee stage of the bill. However, as indicated by a notice of motion earlier today, I now intend to pursue this matter in the business of the Senate. The coalition will not oppose those parts of the bill relating to the aged care portfolio.

         The involvement of the Australian Commonwealth Military Forces, the AIF, in Belgium and later in France was the foundation on which Australia's very successful military capability was built. In my judgment, Gallipoli does not have its correct place in Australia's military history. Gallipoli tends to be seen as the most important campaign by Australian forces in the First World War.

         At Gallipoli, the AIF fought with incredible determination and courage. It was the first major campaign of a new and untried force. But it was a force that had no military experience to draw on. While it fought valiantly and courageously and with great enthusiasm, victory did not come its way. In a sense, the military lessons to be learned by the Australian Army as a consequence of the Gallipoli campaign were limited.

         It was in Belgium in the Ypres Salient in 1916 and 1917 and in the Somme Valley in 1918 that the AIF learnt its skill at arms and became the finest infantry force fighting in that war. It learned there what needed to be done to be successful in the field of battle. From Passchendaele and Messines in Flanders, from Fromelles, where the 5th Division was almost wiped out, Pozieres, where the 1st and 2nd Division lost more killed and wounded than Australia has ever lost before or since in one area, and at Bullecourt lessons were learnt that culminated in the brilliant successes from March 1918 to final victory in November 1918.

         In March 1918, the first German breakthrough occurred. The German army drove westward with the objective of capturing Amiens and splitting the British armies in the north from the broken and exhausted French armies in the south. The five Australian divisions rushed down from the north, held the advance of the German armies for all time when they were within site of Amiens. After the German breakthrough was held, the Australian divisions, with the Canadians, the New Zealanders, the British army and, finally, the newly arrived Americans, drove eastward until the German forces capitulated.

         Through those eight or nine months leading up to the armistice, the combat abilities and successes of the AIF took second place to no other army. The AIF became the dominant force in the Somme Valley. After the main breakthrough, the German army had been halted. In April, the Germans captured the high ground in which the town of Villers-Bretonneux was situated. In a brilliant night action, mounted immediately after the seizure of the town and with only hours of preparation, Brigadier Glasgow's 13th Brigade and Brigadier Elliott's 15th Brigade retook Villers-Bretonneux. From there, the five AIF divisions, fighting together, displaced the German army from the Somme Valley through to the Hindenberg line.

         Hamel, a small town just east of Villers-Bretonneux, was one of the first of those victories. In a sense, Hamel is the site of the first occasion when modern land warfare tactics were used. By this time, the Australian Army was operating under its own leaders. General Monash was now the Australian Corps Commander. Monash, a civilian soldier and engineer from Melbourne, was the outstanding general of the war. Of very high intelligence, he had a flexible, innovative mind and, though older than many of his contemporary generals, he was always ready to develop and apply new tactics after he had meticulously thought through every detail.

         Hamel was of great interest. The infantry advanced behind a complex artillery fire plan which lifted at set intervals before the advancing waves of attacking infantry. That had been done many times before. But in Hamel there were two new innovations. Monash had seen a demonstration by the Tank Corps of the new mark V tank. After the disaster at Bullecourt in April 1917, when the earlier tanks failed completely with huge casualties for the Australians, the armoured corps or the Tank Corps, as it was called then, was persona non grata with the AIF. Monash saw the greatly increased capabilities of the new mark Vs and saw the opportunity of using them with infantry to break the barbed wire entanglements and suppress the deadly machine-gun posts. He integrated into his plan the use of armour and infantry working together.

         Lawrence Wackett, from 3 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps, had developed a technique of parachuting machine-gun ammunition into the battlefield into the hands of the advancing infantry. The supply of ammunition, particularly machine-gun ammunition, in an advance was a major problem. It all had to be carried by soldiers over broken ground under fire. In putting these elements together, Monash developed the tactics of the modern battlefield and broke, albeit still at a high human cost, the dominance of barbed wire and fixed defences.

When thoroughly trained, adequately equipped and properly led, those achievements of 1918, which made the Australian Army second to none in the field of combat, are still possessed by the Australian Army.

I think I should forewarn honourable senators that the information I am about to share this evening deserves to have a heading of environmental illness and what is called multiple chemical sensitivity, often abbreviated as MCS. The fact is that chemicals are about profits, and therefore politics. It is also an issue that impacts on humans and the environment creating a need for regulation, control and repair. The human consequences of toxic chemical exposure in Australia must urgently be addressed.

         Announcements from universally respected institutions place the situation in its true perspective. An investigation by a body of 20 prominent American scientists resulted in the Winspread report, which came to light in Wisconsin in the United States in July 1991. Its focus was chemically induced alterations in sexual development—the wildlife and human connection. The paper discussed the reproductive viability of many species which had been exposed long-term to toxic chemicals. Its conclusion expressed concerns for the future of the human race. The gravity of their comments may well have influenced the World Health Organisation to declare that toxic chemicals and the illness they cause are the plague of the present decade. That claim was made in the Commission on Health and Environment's report entitled

         Nevertheless, there are many reasons why there is a marked reluctance to accept the notion of chemically induced illness. It has huge implications for governments, employers, insurance companies, chemical manufacturers themselves, their agents and advertisers, and those who have to pay sickness benefits, workers compensation and pensions. There is also a perception that doctors who prescribe drugs which often come from the same sources as many toxic chemicals do not take the issue of chemically induced illness seriously, or they regard all illness as a purely medical problem.

I am sure that honourable senators have heard some of these trendy names that have been applied. Many of these names have strong clinical overtones.

The symptoms of MCS, I hasten to add, often also involve generalised pain and mood swings; concentration and memory lapses are frequently reported, as are dermal ulceration and rashes. Many chemical victims tell of recurrent flu-like episodes linked to periodic contamination of their environment with substances to which they become sensitised. Toxic agents, after doing their damage, often leave the body with no residual signs, except in the case of substances like organochlorines, lead and some other elements which may remain in the tissues permanently or for an extended period.

         Many classically trained doctors focus on germs as a cause of an illness, as they have long done, and often write off their MCS patients presenting with a cluster of symptoms as hypochondriacs or malingerers because no germs can be found. Chemical victims are either sent packing or told that they are depressed, and have even been sent to psychiatric hospitals for electroconvulsive therapy. Sometimes they are diagnosed as suffering from the mysterious myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome.

        Environmental Illness and MCS can be likened to an iceberg, showing only the visible tip of its immensity. The US National Academy of Sciences has estimated that 15% of the American population is adversely affected by chemicals which should alert Australian authorities to the gravity of the situation, particularly since many chemicals long since banned or restricted overseas, are still freely being used here. Some of these are DDT, Vapan, Prothiopos, Halaxyfop-methyl. MCS deserves recognition, acceptance and appropriate treatment like any other illness or injury, particularly as its effects are more enduring and far reaching than many other illnesses.

         One particular issue raised in this report has been a preoccupation of the Australian Democrats for some time. The Auditor-General sees a pressing need for a new east coast armaments complex, ECAC, to replace the Kingswood and Newington depots. The Democrats agree; however, the government has only said that it will move Newington. We would be very interested to hear from the minister on the future of Kingswood.

         The government has dragged its feet on ECAC. Because the defence department and the minister have been fixated on building ECAC at Jervis Bay, they have repeatedly delayed taking a submission to cabinet, apparently in the vain hope that the opposition would just go away. Well, it has not and the government should bite the bullet and rule out Jervis Bay. There is no serious support for Jervis Bay in cabinet, yet the navy is still running a promotional campaign to drum up local support. This charade has to stop.

         As the report notes, attention has been given to alternative sites for an ECAC, including Port Curtis near Gladstone, Point Wilson in Port Phillip Bay and Twofold Bay near Eden. The Auditor-General has found that the studies of alternative sites have been inadequate and that a new study with a broad based input is needed. That is a damning indictment of the department, with which the Democrats agree. The ECAC issue should be brought out of the closet and into the public domain. The secrecy has gone on for too long.

         The auditor believes that plans for ECAC should be developed as part of a comprehensive explosive ordnance plan. The Democrats agree and would like to know why this has not happened before. We would add that the ECAC decision must be made as part of a naval facilities plan, especially given the well-sourced rumours that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is investigating the relocation of other naval facilities now in Sydney. Again, a piecemeal approach should be avoided. ECAC should be considered within a total facilities plan.

         In our opinion, Gladstone has clear advantages as an ECAC site, particularly if the fleet base is moved there at a later date. Point Wilson has other virtues but comes equipped with one large obstacle: it is also the planned site of a chemical storage site to replace Coode Island in Melbourne's western suburbs and the two would not be compatible on present planning. We know that Defence has commissioned a Department of Administrative Services study on whether both facilities can be located at Point Wilson, separated by an appropriate safety zone. We have approached Senator Ray for a copy of the study and we would like him to expedite its release to cast some light on the ECAC debate.

         It is high time the ECAC decision was finally made and made properly. The minister should concede that Jervis Bay is out of the question and that the public should be brought into the decision making process. This report underlines the fact that his department has failed to take an objective look at this issue. It is time someone else had a go.

         This story is about a woman called Mrs Nola Sillars. Mrs Nola Sillars cannot tell her story because on 10 September she took her life. She took her life in exasperation at what she saw as an uncooperative bureaucracy and a legal system in relation to corporations which was very difficult to understand. Having discussed the matter with her surviving partner, I thought it appropriate that we lay these matters before the Senate.

         Mrs Sillars was married originally to a gentleman called Mr Ian Sillars and they lived in Western Australia. They jointly owned, through a company called Ticket Seal International Pty Ltd, the machinery and the rights to produce scratch-off lottery tickets and scratch-off promotional tickets that some honourable senators may have received in places such as McDonald's and so on.

         Mr and Mrs Sillars had a marital separation in early 1983 and she sought some legal advice. In retrospect, I think the legal advice she received was poor, to say the least. It may also have been that the legal advice she received was not given in her best interests. She sought to have the assets of the company and the associated family assets frozen, for the creditors to be paid, and then to sort out the financial arrangements between herself and her husband. It seems as though she was advised that the appropriate way to do that was not to put the company into liquidation, a belief that she held for the remainder of her life. I believe that she may have been poorly advised in that and that, had a separate course of action been followed, maybe this problem would not have occurred.

         It appears, however, that her solicitor was not diligent in pursuing Mrs Sillars's instructions. I also note that her solicitor later served a gaol sentence in Western Australia for matters arising from misconduct during the course of his professional duties, but not in relation to Mrs Sillars's case. Mrs Sillars, however, believed that he should have been gaoled for misconduct in relation to her case.

         Subsequently, it appears that her husband took the assets of the company—the machinery, the rights, the contracts and everything—went to Sydney and continued to trade under the name, not of Ticket Seal International Pty Ltd, but Ticket Seal International Sydney. My office has conducted company searches with the Australian Securities Commission and although we can find Ticket Seal International Pty Ltd, which is now a company in liquidation, there seems no evidence that there was ever a Ticket Seal International Sydney.

         What is even more disturbing is that, before the company in Western Australia was liquidated, Mr Sillars alienated all of the assets of the company for the princely sum of $5,000—what is known in the insolvency game as the sideways shuffle: all of the assets go one way and all of the liabilities stay where they are.

         Mrs Sillars had extreme difficulty in trying to get an amicable solution to this. During the disputation her 12-year-old daughter was also kidnapped from her. I understand that she did not see her after that time. She sought, with no success, to have Mr Sillars brought to justice for the things that he had done. The fraud squad in Western Australia looked at it and seemed to have arrived at the conclusion that it was too difficult. It subsequently appeared that after much pressure from Mrs Sillars the liquidator of the company did form a view that Mr Sillars's conduct was legally unsatisfactory. But Mr Sillars cannot be brought to answer for that because he has fled to the United States and shows little intention of returning to this jurisdiction.

         My concern was in relation to Mrs Sillars's attempts to get some explanation from the Australian Securities Commission as to what had happened. Her letters to the Australian Securities Commission are truly depressing. There is one letter on the file dated 11 November 1992 pointing out that in that year she had written to the Australian Securities Commission on 11 October, 16 October, 22 October and 26 October. She also wrote to the Australian Securities Commission on 15 December and again on 26 January this year. What she sought was some information in relation to the winding-up of the company. In particular, she sought to be assured that the information that she had provided at what she obviously thought could have been a grave risk to her own personal safety had been acted upon. The Australian Securities Commission was very unwilling to provide the information.

         Ultimately, on 12 February 1993, a letter was received by Mrs Sillars. In fairness to the ASC, it is not a bad letter, but it could have gone further. It indicates that the liquidator of the company spent six years pursuing a preference action which was subsequently lost. I do not pass any judgment on that, but it does seem very strange that it would take six years to bring and pursue a preference action.

         It also appears that the liquidator sought advice as to whether Mr Sillars could be pursued in relation to what was described as possible bankruptcy action and the outcome of a charging action relating to another company, but it appeared that there was no possibility of bringing him to justice. One wonders, however, why this conclusion was not arrived at until after Mr Sillars had had ample opportunity to strip the company bare and flee the jurisdiction. That should be a source of some concern. The Securities Commission refused to release the section 418 report which dealt with these matters in detail.

         Mrs Sillars, being both a former director of and contributory to the company, was also a person against whom it may have been possible to raise imputations if one were not seeking to form an honest opinion of the facts.

         She was so frustrated by this that she contacted me and other senators, seeking assistance, to get the relevant information released to her. On 10 September she gave up waiting and took her own life. On 15 September my staff received a letter from the Australian Securities Commission, which appears a little confused. It states that thus far the commission has not had to consider the question of whether or not a section 533 report or a section 418 report is available for access pursuant to the FOI act. One of the concerning things is that Mrs Sillars did not have the resources to pay the costs associated with an FOI application.

         None of this makes much difference now, I suppose, to Mrs Sillars. The wishes of her family are that this matter be pursued and that we attempt to get a change in attitude so that dreadful situations like this do not happen again. I cannot help reflecting on the conversation I had with her partner. She was fortunate enough in the last years of her life to have a loving and caring partner in Sydney. His stated wish to her on many occasions was that maybe she should give up this fight. He wanted her to settle down and for them to get married. I have spoken with him. He is a very good man and a man who is immensely upset by what has occurred. I wish to place on the record here, in this place, at this time, my condolences to him, to Mrs Sillars's surviving family and to the people who attempted to support her.

         I would also like to commend the Australian Defence Force for the absolutely magnificent way in which it performed its important ceremonial support role during the mission. In my judgment, its participation helped to make the national tribute to those who sacrificed their lives on the Western Front a full and appropriate one.

         To the World War I veterans and the war widows who took part in the mission, I can only join Senator MacGibbon in expressing my highest admiration for their remarkable courage and stamina during the mission. I think it is fair to say that they were an inspiration to all of us on that mission and, I have heard since my return, certainly an inspiration to all at home.

         I believe that everyone who accompanied the mission was really grateful for the opportunity to see at first hand where these veterans had fought, and really appreciated the opportunity to share with them the moving tributes to their fallen comrades. As I said, it was an experience that will never be repeated for any of us.

         Sadly, Mr Hugh O'Donnell, who was a veteran from South Australia, died a week after returning from the mission. I am pleased to say that, even though he developed health problems on the trip, he really was determined to participate fully in our mission—and, indeed, he did just that. On his return to Australia, his health gave rise to some concern and he was admitted to Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney for observation. The Department of Veterans' Affairs flew his wife and daughter to be with him during his last few days and, as I say, he died soon afterwards. It really was a privilege to know such a fine old man, and I certainly express my deepest sympathy to his wife and family.

         I would like also to report to the Senate and to the Australian people that our war dead of the Western Front rest certainly in peaceful circumstances, obviously a peace for which they unselfishly gave their lives. It was a great opportunity for us in France and Belgium to see the role that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission plays. I believe that all who were on the mission were genuinely impressed with the way memorials and cemeteries have been kept throughout the Western Front.

         I would like also to place on record my gratitude to all those who were involved in organising and conducting such a successful mission. It was planned and it was executed in an absolutely exemplary manner by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The veterans and war widows, who were the focus of the mission, received the very best of care throughout the mission.

         The 75th anniversary commemorations of World War I will culminate on 11 November, Armistice Day, with the dedication of the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Australian War Memorial. This will be the last significant anniversary of the First World War at which surviving Australians from that conflict can be present and in which they can participate. The tomb will provide a solemn and inspirational focal point for the large number of Australians and others who visit the memorial each year. With overseas battlefields, cemeteries and memorials so far away, I think the tomb is going to be a place where visitors can go to grieve, to place a flower of tribute or remembrance, to remember, and to reflect—and to do that in this country, Australia.

         When I announced on 7 July the names of the veterans and war widows who would be taking part in the 75th anniversary commemorative mission to the Western Front, I observed that there would obviously be very great disappointment amongst those who were selected for the reserve group for the mission but who would not be part of the mission. I invited them at that time to travel to Canberra with a family member or carer, at government expense, to attend the dedication of the tomb of the unknown soldier. I certainly hope they will be able to join us here—I believe they will—and I think that this event will be a very fitting climax to the government's very full and significant program of commemorative events to remember and honour Australia's participation in World War I.

         Finally, again I would say a sincere thankyou to the veterans, the war widows and all those who accompanied this commemorative mission to the Western Front. I believe that our veterans and war widows really did our country proud in France and Belgium, as did the veterans, of course, before in 1916 to 1918. I know that the whole of the delegation—everyone on the mission—was honoured, as I certainly was, to be part of this historic occasion. It is an experience that I will certainly never forget. I am sure that for all those who participated in the mission it is something which will stand as perhaps one of the most important life experiences and certainly something that will stay with us for the remainder of our lives.

        (2) No fax dated 29 September was sent from OIB's visits section, which is in Canberra, with the names of people Mr Payne wished to meet. However, a list provided by Mr Payne to the Public Affairs Section at the Embassy in Washington was forwarded to Canberra and I believe it is this fax that the senator is referring to. This document has already been released under an FOI request which was lodged with my department. It was released with certain deletions because it referred to the personal affairs of individuals. The office of the Privacy Commissioner has provided the department's legal branch with preliminary advice that release of the complete document would be contrary to the department's obligations under the Privacy Act. Therefore, the document is attached with deletions.

        (3) The Australian Government's efforts were directed at achieving a balanced and detailed account of the state of  the koalas in a well-respected quality magazine. The Public Affairs Section at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC points out that during a number of meetings with Mr Payne, the journalist `was adamant that he wanted to do his own research and develop his own views about the position of the koala. He was essentially not particularly interested in the Embassy view of this issue. The discussions therefore mainly centred on the logistical and administrative arrangements for his travel to Australia. The Embassy did not pay for any travel costs.'

        (1) For the Australian Defence Force, unused long service leave lump sum payments accrued up to 17 August 1993 will continue to attract a concessional rate of tax. Future long service leave lump sum entitlements as well as all unused annual leave will be taxed as normal income. As announced in the Budget, existing concessions will remain for bona fide redundancies, invalidities and approved early retirement schemes. This is identical to the way the Budget measures apply to the rest of the community.

        (2) No. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme are not early retirement schemes. They are Funds providing superannuation, invalidity and death benefits and are not to be confused with early retirement schemes which provide for the early termination for employment of employees. The Budget measures have no effect on the two military superannuation schemes.

        (1) Comcare Australia generally allows all employees 28 days to present their case where an entitlement is under review. Depending on the circumstances of each case, an extension of time may be given. For current employees, the appropriate date for the actual cessation of the payment of benefit is agreed between Comcare Australia and the employing agency. Payments to former employees who are paid directly by Comcare Australia are ceased from the commencement of the next available pay period.

        (4) No. However, an inconsistency of practice with regard to the ceasing of entitlement was identified during an evaluation undertaken by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The evaluation specifically focused on the consistency of practices and procedures followed by Comcare Australia, Telstra and Australia Post. As a result of the evaluation Telstra issued its national policy regarding advice of intention to cease entitlement.
