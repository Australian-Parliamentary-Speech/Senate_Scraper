        In recent years the Government has used fiscal policy to deliver a substantial boost to the economy. This has helped to stabilise activity and support the early stages of recovery. As the recovery proceeds and, in particular, private investment returns to more normal levels, the Government will withdraw that fiscal stimulus.

        The Government will also continue to keep inflation low. The considerable reduction in inflation which has occurred in recent years has resulted in lower inflationary expectations in the community and has enabled interest rates to be reduced to their lowest level in over twenty years. In turn, this provides a sound basis for encouraging the recovery which is now underway.

          By letter dated 29 January 1993 Senator Walters has raised with me a matter of privilege. The essence of the matter raised by Senator Walters is that a person has allegedly threatened to publish certain supposed information concerning Opposition members of parliament if the Opposition members adopt a certain policy in relation to X-rated videos. Senator Walters refers to certain press reports containing the alleged threats.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The possible contempt of parliament contained in the matter raised by Senator Walters is that of seeking by threats to influence senators in their conduct as senators. This is one of the well-known contempts of parliament, and is referred to in privilege resolution 6 under the heading `Improper Influence of Senators'.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The alleged threat is directed to Opposition members generally and not to any particular person, but it is well established that a threat to unnamed members, or to a group or category of members, or to members in general, can be a contempt just as can a threat to particular members.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The alleged threat as reported is also directed to Opposition members of parliament generally, and does not distinguish between members and senators. If the threat as reported were made, it could be regarded as being directed to senators as well as members of the House of Representatives. This is so particularly having regard to the fact that senators could, and probably would, participate in the formulation of any policies relating to X-rated videos.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The formulation of such a policy by a group of senators clearly falls within their duties as senators and their conduct as senators within the terms of privilege resolution 6. A threat such as the one reported obviously has the potential substantially to obstruct senators in the performance of their functions.

          The matter raised by Senator Walters therefore is clearly capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting criterion (a) which I am required to take into account.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In relation to criterion (b), the availability of another remedy for the act which is the subject of the complaint, if there is another remedy, is not clearly or readily available. It may be that, if the alleged threat were made, a prosecution for certain criminal offences could ensue, but it would be a difficult and uncertain process for senators to bring about such a prosecution. A civil suit undertaken after the alleged threat had been carried out and the supposed information published would not be a satisfactory remedy. I therefore think that there is not a readily available other remedy.

          By letter dated 20 April 1993, Senator Reynolds, as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies, has also raised with me a matter of privilege pursuant to standing order 81.

          The matter relates to a letter addressed to the committee by a spokesperson of a company called Eros Foundation. One paragraph of the letter contains what appears to be a threat that unless the committee makes some `reassessment' of its findings, actions for damages will be undertaken, presumably against the committee or individual members of the committee.

        <para first-indent="16">

          If this interpretation of the paragraph is correct, the paragraph would clearly be capable of being held to be a threat made against a Senate committee and its members in the performance of their duty and therefore a contempt. It is well established that a threat to take legal action made with the purpose of influencing a committee or its members, or actually taking legal action for that purpose, can constitute a contempt.

        Paul Hasluck was born on 1 April 1905 at Perth, Western Australia and educated at the Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. He began his working life in 1922 as a journalist for the

         He joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941. In his six years in the department, he travelled on diplomatic assignments to Canada, New Zealand, the United States and Britain, culminating in the post of counsellor in charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations in New York. Sir Paul resigned in 1947 and returned to the University of Western Australia as a reader in history, contracting to write two volumes of the official war history.

         The year 1949 saw him enter Federal politics. He stood for and won the seat of Curtin and became the Minister for Territories some 15 months later, remaining in that portfolio until 1963. He subsequently became, as the motion states, Minister for Defence and Minister for External Affairs. He held the seat of Curtin for 20 years and was on the front bench of successive Liberal/Coalition governments for 18 of those years. It was a distinguished parliamentary career by any reckoning.

         I did not have the privilege of knowing Sir Paul personally, but as it happens my senior adviser, Geoff Bentley, worked as his Private Secretary in the mid-1960s. Mr Bentley recently wrote for my department a memoir on Sir Paul as external affairs Minister, from which I think it is worth quoting a few passages:

        Sir Paul was a tireless worker and prepared much of his own briefing, often calling for files to work on himself. He was among those of our ministers who have demanded the highest standards and who have achieved them. He believed in careful research and precision and clarity in drafting; unexplained acronyms were a particular hate.

        Seemingly formal and aloof, Hasluck was personally modest and unassuming with little time for humbug and pomposity. In a quiet and unobtrusive way he encouraged many younger officers. Away from work he enjoyed a yarn—particularly about rugby—and he and those around him were genuinely at ease visiting aid projects in the backblocks of Thailand and Vietnam. It was not surprising then that he enjoyed the easiest of rapport with Asian leaders. He was concerned—at times too concerned—not to impose Australia's will on Asian decision making, and by today's standards might be thought less than persistent in pursuit of our agenda. On one occasion he complained that a division head wanted him to put an Asian president on the ropes when, first up, he only wanted to get to know the fellow. That evening, at the president's banquet in Hasluck's honour, they both played in the band.

        Our world then was dominated by an unpredictable Sukarno and Indonesia's "Confrontation" of Malaysia, Singapore's separation from Malaysia, British military withdrawal east of Suez, Chairman Mao and the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, involvement in Vietnam and the theology that our northern neighbours were dominoes in danger of falling before the communist menace.

        Then, as now, work in and on the Asian region was demanding and professionally satisfying. Despite the testing issues, the early post-colonial period was marked by warm relationships. Apart from Australian MPs being able to call routinely on the likes of the Tunku and Lee Kuan Yew, we had access and expertise that both the Americans and British envied. Our embassies joined the top rung in most Asian countries and perhaps for the first time it was recognised that Australia could carve out its "destiny" in the region. Looking back, life must have been simpler and the foreign policy agenda not so vast. After all the then Department of External Affairs, including the forerunners of AIDAB and the Overseas Property Group, occupied a mere three floors in one of the 4 blocks of the present Foreign Affairs and Trade building and boasted just one photocopier. It was with few resources at his disposal that Sir Paul Hasluck laid some of the groundwork for where we are in Asia today.

        That memoir ought to be acknowledged. Sir Paul went on to serve as Governor-General of Australia from 1969 to 1974. It was also during this period that he was able to complete the second of the volumes of the official war history that he had contracted to do back in 1947. From 1974 onwards he returned to his writing and produced several works—historical pieces; essays; his popular autobiography entitled, rather implausibly,

He worked unstintingly in the service of Australia and the Australian people. He will be remembered as a great, indeed an outstanding, Australian. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his wife, Alexandra, and to the family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

         Looking over the many things that have been written about and by Sir Paul Hasluck, it is clear that he was motivated by clear principles, many of which I feel a strong identification with. For his time, the young Paul Hasluck was unusually sensitive to, and aware of, the plight of Aboriginal people. It has been said that he supported what was then called assimilation on the grounds that the alternative would have been some form of apartheid. As questionable as his preference may look from the vantage point of 1993, I think there is no question that his motives were humane and honourable.

         As a Minister and Governor-General, Sir Paul showed an unusually deep and philosophical grasp of the importance of a strong parliamentary democracy and Public Service. One of the ironies of history is the suggestion that had he been Governor-General at the time of the 1975 constitutional crisis, it would have been resolved in a more appropriate way. The irony lies, of course, in the fact that he was appointed by a Liberal-National government, while his controversial successor was a Labor appointee.

His legacy there may be seen by history as mixed. On the one hand, he appears to have been alive to the ultimate need for self-determination; on the other, the model of economic development which was established for Papua New Guinea—presumably with his involvement—has been a mixed blessing, most notably in the case of Bougainville.

         Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General in 1969 and, from the start, was determined to take an activist role. He believed, as I do, that the Governor-General should act as a brake on the Executive's enthusiasms. He did not believe that the Governor-General could impose his own ideas on the government, but rather that the Governor-General should ask questions, encourage, and ensure that the government's decisions were in accordance with the Constitution and the law. He closely followed the process of government administration through extensive discussions with his three Prime Ministers, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam. He later said that they were prepared to seek his advice because they knew that he had extensive political experience and because they knew that he did not have his own political agenda.

         —I rise with a deep sense of personal sorrow to support this motion of condolence on the recent death of Sir Paul Hasluck. Probably unlike anybody else here, I knew Paul Hasluck personally for a number of years. I first knew him when he stood for the seat of Curtin in 1949, but I really did not get to know him until later when I became an office bearer of a Liberal Party branch in his electorate. Following some years in that role, I became president of the Curtin division.

         During that period of eight years or so, I worked very closely with Sir Paul Hasluck. I came to have a very high respect and regard for him, as one would naturally experience for a man of such outstanding attainments and qualities. I do not wish to repeat all those qualities; they were very well summarised by earlier speakers on this motion.

         There has been a misunderstanding about Paul Hasluck's nature as a remote figure, probably unsuited to politics. The fact was that, apart from having a very acute social conscience and sense of public duty, Paul Hasluck also got on extraordinarily well with ordinary people. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) made that point by referring to a memo from a person who knew him very well. Sir Paul was a very good grassroots politician in the sense of being able to handle seriously the problems of his constituents. He made that a priority. He had a fairly good patch of grass to care for in the Curtin electorate as a Liberal. He always stressed to me that a member of parliament cannot write people too many letters. He was a great believer in letter writing. Obviously, the Government has adopted that view as well, with its generous postage allowance—something which I am sure Sir Paul would have made the best use of.

         Sir Paul Hasluck listened very closely to people. I worked with him in several election campaigns in the electorate of Curtin. He was a great believer in going out and meeting people on street corners; he favoured that very much. I was able to see another side of him—a different side from the historical model. I rose today to emphasise that particular aspect of him.

         Sir Paul Hasluck had a tremendous sense of dedication to any job he took on. He was particularly dedicated to the people of Papua New Guinea, for whom he was responsible for 12 of the 18 years that he was a Minister of state of the Commonwealth. In those years he laboured tremendously for the advancement of the people of Papua New Guinea and succeeded very effectively. He made great contact with people, rather than being just an administrator.

        In regard to Sir Paul's qualifications for political office, despite all the other qualifications he had which have been mentioned—as an author, poet, historian and so on; all qualities which are not usually associated with successful politicians—he was a very successful Minister and politician. It often troubled me that he was not more recognised—certainly not recognised for the leadership of the Liberal Party. When the opportunity came his way after the death of Harold Holt, it seemed to be clear that he was the person to whom the Liberal Party should have turned. I have often speculated what benefits we as a party may have had had that right decision been made early in 1968. We certainly would have been spared some very embarrassing moments, with the untidy demise of John Gorton and the prime ministership of Billy McMahon. Whether he would have won the 1972 election is another matter. At least he would have kept the Liberal Party in much better shape through a very difficult period of our history. However, I do not want to speak today about those particular matters.

         After he retired from public life, Sir Paul Hasluck remained extraordinarily active. He took up all sorts of small causes. He travelled a good deal; I often used to run into him travelling from west to east, but he did not spend long away from home. He spent a lot of his time at his home and at his small property in the hills behind Perth. Another important side of him was that he was a deep lover of nature; he was also a very keen and active horseman until his later years. It is with great sorrow that I have to speak on his death. I extend my deepest sympathy to his family.

         —Sir Paul Hasluck will be remembered by many as the unpolitical politician who nearly became Prime Minister of Australia in 1968. Yet Sir Paul, who disliked the wheeling and dealing of politics, left an even greater legacy to this country as a journalist, historian, university lecturer, diplomat, politician and Governor-General.

         newspaper at the age of 17 and later lectured at the University of Western Australia. As has already been mentioned by my Senate colleagues, he entered politics in 1949 as the member for Curtin and, within 15 months of being elected, was appointed Minister for Territories, a portfolio he held for 12 years. This therefore brought him a very close relationship and partnership with the constituency that I represent—that is, the Northern Territory. In 1963, Sir Paul was made Minister for Defence and, a year later, the politician who hated politics was promoted by Sir Robert Menzies to the crucial post of Minister for External Affairs.

         Yet Sir Paul remained an enigma. A brilliant Minister, he was a private man who believed that merit should bring its own reward and that it was undignified to have to persuade people of the fact. On one occasion, in 1974, the usually reserved Sir Paul announced that Australians were:
        </tab>

        Importantly, Sir Paul believed that the Northern Territory could, and eventually would, manage its own affairs. This was demonstrated in the changes he initiated and supported in the structure of the Northern Territory Legislative Council as well as the progressive transfer of responsibilities to the Administrator and his council from the Department of Territories in Canberra.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Indeed, Sir Paul made it patently clear to his officers in Canberra that administration as well as policy proposals from the Territory Administrator would be adopted unless there were compelling reasons to the contrary. This led to friction between the Administrator and his officers and the department's secretary and his officers. However, Sir Paul's judgment and wisdom were such that he could effectively balance strong and competing interests.

         At this time in the 1950s, I was a teenager in the Northern Territory. I can certainly recall Sir Paul being one of my political icons. Naturally, he was well publicised in the Northern Territory. I can certainly recall meeting him on a number of occasions personally and feeling very challenged by both his presence and the activities that he undertook. He had a close relationship with my father in developing Aboriginal education, also in the early 1950s.

         Mr Harry Giese, a retired senior Commonwealth public servant still living in Darwin, recalls that one of Sir Paul's first tasks in the Northern Territory was to assist the transfer of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies to Darwin from Melbourne. According to Mr Giese, Sir Paul subsidised linguists from the institute to study and record some of the 103 Aboriginal languages spoken in the Territory. It was the first concentrated effort to record Aboriginal languages in Australia.

         Despite the wide geographic and administrative diversity of the territories portfolio, Sir Paul maintained close contact with department heads in the Northern Territory, regularly joining them on field trips. In 1958, Sir Paul made the first major change in the composition of the Northern Territory's Legislative Council by appointing some non-official members, letting members elect their own president and generally extending the authority of the Administrator. Certainly in his later capacity as Governor-General he took a very keen and continuing interest in the Northern Territory.

I cannot recall ever meeting Sir Paul, although as a member of the Liberal students at the University of Melbourne and subsequently an active member of the Liberal Party I, of course, closely followed his career and his contributions to public affairs. The extensive writings of Sir Paul Hasluck make it easy to refresh one's memory about the man, his attitudes and his impact on great events. Indeed, in the last week I have had the opportunity to read some of the articles written by Sir Paul and look at some of the books that he published. In my view, his thoughts are often particularly pertinent in light of the issues which have come before this Parliament.

         One of the themes which comes through the remarks that others have made today, and which is certainly backed up by my own readings, is that few, if any, men in our political life have had as much of the intellectual in their make-up as Sir Paul. His interests ranged across the theatre, literature and music, and he was also an avid collector of Australiana. In the last year, at the age of 87, he published a series of articles in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Quadrant
         </emphasis>
         dealing with changes in social mores in Australia over his lifetime. The articles covered the topics of gambling, thrift, conversation and religion and he compared the attitudes and conventions of his childhood and early adulthood with those that he observed in contemporary Australia. The overwhelming impression one gets from reading those articles is that he felt something of the essence of Australian life had been lost and that we were the worse for the losing of it.

       <para first-indent="16">

         He clearly had a sense of unease about the changes he perceived. As Sir Walter Crocker said in his own tribute to Sir Paul Hasluck in

        He was uneasy and apprehensive about certain tendencies in Australian life and culture, such as increases in dishonesty, in violence and in intolerance . . . and the decline in the mass media, not least in the press. The debasement of the English language in Australia in recent years was an alarm bell for him.
       </para>
       <para>
        His uneasiness with what he perceived to be the debasement of Australian life is reflected in his general concern about attitudes to and proposals for changing the Australian Constitution and, more specifically, to the standards observed by parliamentarians. Sir Paul was very strongly of the view that the Constitution as it stands is both strong and adaptable. His view was that, so long as it was treated with respect and good sense, its endurance would ensure continued good government. His thoughts are worthy of careful consideration as, while not a constitutional lawyer, he was well versed in constitutional history and the workings of government. In the 1992 Sir Samuel Griffith lecture, Sir Paul reflected:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our biggest worries in the government of Australia are not whether the text of the Constitution is perfect but whether we have the wisdom—or even enough plain commonsense—to govern our nation wisely.

        In the same lecture he stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Constitution has given a sound basic structure, system of government and the political institutions for handling the changes that have taken place in Australia during the century. It has proved sufficiently adaptable to meet the changing needs of an emerging and evolving nation. Our Constitution is not an outworn obstacle to political wisdom or administrative skill. I can see no strength in arguments that we need a new Constitution or a new system of government even if there are very strong arguments for the need for some adjustments to meet changes.

         In the speech delivered to the Samuel Griffith Society, Sir Paul decried what he referred to as the `weakening, and in some cases total disregard, of the unwritten conventions in our Constitution'. He pointed out:

Through all this, it is not the Constitution that has hampered us in the handling of public affairs or prevented governments from working together.

         That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 17 April 1993, of His Excellency Turgut Ozal, President of the Republic of Turkey, expresses its deep sympathy to the family of the late President Ozal, and to the people of Turkey, in their bereavement, and requests that this motion be conveyed by the President on behalf of the Australian Parliament to the Government of Turkey.

        Turgut Ozal will be remembered by his fellow Turks as an economic reformer who worked very hard to consolidate democratic principles in Turkey.

         He will also be remembered as a close friend and ally of Australia. The late President was awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia in the course of his visit to this country in 1991 in recognition of his efforts to develop relations between Turkey and Australia. In particular, Australians will remember Turgut Ozal with special affection for his role in organising the 75th Anzac commemoration at Gallipoli in 1990 and his part in the Turkish Government's decision to rename the landing place of the Anzacs at Gallipoli, Anzac Cove.

         I personally certainly remember President Ozal very well as a very lively and engaging interlocutor in my conversations with him, both in 1991 on his visit to Australia and more recently during my visit to Turkey in October 1992. His instincts, even on the most delicate and difficult of issues like Cyprus, struck me as essentially constructive and moderate. Turgut Ozal was keenly aware of the importance of consolidating Turkey's regional status as a democratic secular state. I do believe that he will be greatly missed by his compatriots and, indeed, by the international community. I hope that all Australians and members of this chamber will join with me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his death.

        The assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa on 1 May was an appalling act of violence which deserves the condemnation of all Australians. It was a tragedy for Sri Lanka and for its people. Ranasinghe Premadasa was a popular president, a man of humble origins with a genuine concern for the poor and underprivileged. The economic reforms which he promoted with such vigour have done much to open up the Sri Lankan economy and to encourage investment in the development of the country.

         In his very last speech President Premadasa referred to the unprecedented pace of progress in his country over the last four years and the great transformation taking place there. Under his presidency, the record on human rights in Sri Lanka improved dramatically. When I met him in Colombo in August 1990, he impressed me with his commitment to improving human rights in Sri Lanka. He had worked hard to increase awareness of and respect for human rights, recognising that his government and the armed forces needed to very much improve the application of basic human rights in that country. Even through the serious problems which beset peace in Sri Lanka, he remained tied to reconciliation and peaceful processes.

         The record of human rights violations as taken by the United Nations makes really quite appalling reading. The United Nations working group on forced or involuntary disappearances recorded some 12,000 disappearances in Sri Lanka between 1983 and 1992—the highest number ever recorded for any single country. This report confirmed the findings of Amnesty International which, in turn, reported evidence of gross violations of human rights and large-scale executions and disappearances, particularly in the north east of the country where the fighting is concentrated.

         Fred Hollows was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 9 April 1929. In his early years he thought he might become a minister of religion or perhaps a psychologist, but never really imagined that he would enter the field of medicine. It was not until he was offered a place at the University of Otago to study medicine, at age 22, that he first thought seriously of such a career.

         He became interested in eye surgery and by 1961 went off to the UK to complete his Diploma of Ophthalmology. He spent some time working in Wales before coming out to Australia in 1965 to head the Ophthalmology Department at the University of New South Wales. With Fred's urging it was not long before there was a separate eye clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital. By this stage Fred Hollows had adopted Australia as his home and his work with Aboriginal people, for which he was so well known, had begun. First, there was the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Centre at Redfern and then the national trachoma and eye health program.

         Fred Hollows developed a tremendous affection for and rapport with the Aboriginal people.

         From early 1987 onwards he extended his program to the Third World. He managed to establish clinics and training programs in Eritrea, Nepal and Vietnam. He acted as a consultant in the extension of his surgical techniques to places such as Bangladesh, Burma, Tibet and various parts of Latin America. Fred's plan was not merely to train local doctors in the surgical techniques, but to build the factories to make intra-ocular lenses. He saw this as the only way of making eye surgery and lenses readily available to the poor of these countries.

         Fred Hollows was a passionate man with deeply held convictions. His politics were to the left of the Labor Party—even the Victorian branch—and he gave politicians of all stripes and colours, including me, a consistently hard time. He had a wholesome hatred of red tape and he avoided bureaucrats wherever possible, preferring instead to deal with those directly involved. When it came to Ministers, however, whatever we did do—whether it was with the aid program or anything else—was never quite enough. Fred always wanted more, but, of course, it was always because he wanted to help more.

         While to his patients Fred Hollows was unfailingly generous and compassionate, his relations with most others were a little more robust. He was forthright—some would go so far as to say rough as guts—and his methods often quite unorthodox. His professional colleagues were certainly not spared the acid of his tongue; not least at the memorable conference organised by the College of Ophthalmologists in his honour when he told them—and I hope you will forgive the expression in this context, Mr President—`You are only pissing in my pocket because I am dying'. Fred in his autobiography summed up the way he got things done:

         Fred Hollows was held in very high esteem by his colleagues both here and overseas, he was worshipped by his patients, and he was loved very much by his family and friends. His death is a deeply sad loss for us all, but I am sure that the excellent work that he began will be continued in the same spirit and with the same dedication through the Hollows Foundation. On behalf of the Government I extend to his wife Gabi and all the children our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

He was an extraordinary Australian. In 1990 he was named Australian of the Year and he was awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal; and in the following year he was named Australian Humanist of the Year and he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia.

         Professor Hollows arrived in Sydney in 1965 as an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of New South Wales and almost immediately attracted prominence. After visiting the Gurindji people of Wattie Creek, he was appalled by the extent of eye disease that he encountered and he observed that of a camp population of 150, all the children had trachoma. Soon after, he helped a group of young Aborigines to establish their own medical service in Redfern, the first of its type in Australia and the prototype of many more around the country.

         In 1975 the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists launched the national trachoma and eye health program and  Professor Hollows took to the outback as head of a mobile medical team. In two years, 105,000 people in 465 locations were examined, 15,000 Aborigines took part in treatment programs and about 1,500 operations were performed. Under his guidance, the program achieved extraordinary success, halving  the incidence of curable blindness among Aborigines.

         It was after meeting an Eritrean with an eye condition in his Sydney office that Fred Hollows organised an AIDAB grant for training an Eritrean eye doctor in Sydney. He himself later travelled to the country and conceived the possibility of establishing an artificial lens factory there. In Eritrea and other Third World countries, Fred Hollows introduced preventative medicine and surgical techniques which returned sight to so many people. Building intra-ocular lens factories to combat Third World blindness became the sustaining passion of Professor Hollows in his later years.

         What we found extraordinary in Eritrea was the recognition there of Professor Hollows and the incredible benefit that this brought to Australia in terms of attaching credit to our country derived from his work and his reputation in that country. This, to me, was a real reminder of the effect that one individual can have upon the reputation of a country. It was quite an extraordinary experience to go out into villages of Eritrea, which one may have thought very few, if any, Australians had ever visited. When we identified ourselves as Australian, the first comment we heard was about the wonderful work of Fred Hollows. Credit for the good work Fred Hollows had done in so many villages was being accorded to Australia. I found it quite humbling to be part of that experience. It is a great credit to Fred Hollows and to his memory.

         I remember travelling down through Sudan and finally reaching a place called Rota where there was an underground hospital which was equipped with quite sophisticated medical equipment. We talked to a number of staff there who in the previous months had been trained by Fred Hollows himself on his first visit to Eritrea. The most moving occasion of all was when we met a former patient of Fred Hollows who said that because of Fred's work she had had her sight restored after many years of blindness. I suddenly realised then that this man Hollows was someone exceptional.

         I agree with Senator Hill's remarks that everywhere one went in Eritrea, Fred's fame and service to that country had spread—so much so that the credit Fred Hollows had established in that country rubbed off on us as Australian visitors. I met Fred when I returned to Australia and, in common with Senator Evans, was overwhelmed by his style, language and presentation. This meant that one was either 110 per cent with Fred or one had better watch out.

         I remember one occasion when he came down to visit Parliament House to get the funds for the intra-ocular lens factory in Eritrea. He wandered into my office and shouted out, `Come on, Schacht, let's go round and get hold of Blewett. I need $200,000 for this factory'. I said, `Well, have you got an appointment?'. He replied, `I don't need a bloody appointment—we will just go to see him and we'll get it off him'.

         Before I knew what I was doing, I was leading him around to Dr Blewett's office. We walked in and Neal had quickly got a bureaucrat to come over from AIDAB who was sitting there rather nervously, because he had already heard about Fred's reputation. Fred started the conversation by saying, `Look, Doc, I understand Schacht has got a few numbers for your preselection back in South Australia. Unless you get this money for us, you might be in trouble getting re-elected'. It was the most amazing start to any representation I have ever seen and away Fred went from there.

         The conversation lasted about four minutes. Fred's bulldozer effect was very effective because Dr Blewett said, `I am sure we can make arrangements' and the bureaucrat got the message. Then Fred said, `By the way, it is not $200,000 Australian; it is $200,000 American'. So the value had suddenly doubled. Since then the equipment has been prepared and it is on the way. I understand that the Eritreans will name the intra-ocular lens factory after Fred Hollows; it will be called the Fred Hollows Factory. In Eritrea there will always be a very effective reminder of the contribution made by Fred Hollows.

         On a number of occasions since then, I have had opportunities to meet Fred at functions. I was given the great honour at an AIDAB conference to introduce Fred as the guest speaker. The first 10 minutes of Fred's speech related to his version of Marxism and the evils of the capitalist system, which startled most of the audience. He then proffered a few views on how AIDS could be controlled in Australia, and that upset the rest of the audience.

         Most of the people at the conference had come along to meet this fantastic character, Fred. By the end of his speech they were rather confused about the range of issues that Fred got himself involved in and how he expressed his views. But when they met him afterwards privately in conversation, despite, as Senator Evans said, his `rough as guts' attitude, they saw some great charm about Fred such that, in the end, one could not help but be on his side. I have never yet come across a person who had some meeting or some period of time with Fred who was not, in the end, an absolute devotee of his cause.

         There is great sadness with Fred's passing. The cause of his death, cancer, caused a slow deterioration in Fred. But throughout it all, even when he was greatly affected, he was still working flat out for the causes, still performing his work as a doctor, still making phone calls, still getting people to make the commitment to raise the money for the causes in which he so strongly believed. The state funeral that was conducted at the cathedral in Sydney was one of the most moving occasions at which I have been present in my period in public life in Australia. So many people from all walks of life attended and the orations from various people about Fred's career were very moving, from that given by the Catholic Bishop of Sydney to that given by the well-known communist Frank Hardy. They all made it clear that, obviously, Fred was a remarkable person.

All I want to say in conclusion is that not only was Fred Hollows a great Australian—in my period in public life, I cannot think of a greater Australian I have met—but also he was a great human being worldwide. By any measure, Australia has been very fortunate to have had Fred Hollows as an Australian citizen. He brought great credit to our country right around the world. It is only appropriate that he is one of the few private citizens who has had the honour of a condolence motion in the Australian Parliament.

He was able to inspire those around him, to instil in them the same sense of dynamic enthusiasm he had for the work he was doing. He was an exceptional man; simple, gruff, possibly some would consider rough—and I think that has been exemplified by what Senator Schacht said of his knowledge of Professor Hollows. These attributes endeared him to so many, and enabled him to relate to those with whom he worked. I met him only once, but the impact of that meeting was immense. He had compassion reaching far beyond that of most of us. He had, with his whole being, no more important a goal in life than to help, no matter what the personal sacrifice. I understand his energy was limitless and we would do well ourselves to think about how Fred Hollows channelled his energies. His selflessness was remarkable. He was a man who gave back to life far more than he took from it.

It is unfortunate that it was acknowledgment of the traumas in his life that instigated recognition of the outstanding work he was doing.

        (1, &amp; 3) I know of no `government report' that states there is only a 2 percent chance of any company making a profit from sand mining in the Shoalwater Bay area. However, in mid 1990 the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics (BMR) was requested to prepare a financial evaluation report on the leases now held by Pivot Mining Pty Ltd, which cover only a small portion of the Shoalwater Bay area. This evaluation concluded that there is a `98 per cent probability that the project would show a zero or less rate of return'. The analysis was based only on data set out in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) submitted by Pivot and estimates made by the BMR. Its conclusions take no account of the potential for discovery of further heavy mineral deposits, either within the area of the  leases or elsewhere in the Shoalwater Bay area.

        (1) Yes, the department disseminates all media releases of its responsible Ministers to organisations apart from national media organisations. The media releases are widely released to advise interested individuals or organisations of changes in policy, membership changes to industry organisations, customs and anti-dumping regulations and similar matters which may not necessarily be reported in the national media. They are also directed to specialist media outlets such as Chambers of Commerce newsletters, science journals and industry publications. At present the media release mailing list contains 690 addresses. Individuals and organisations are placed on the list at their request.
