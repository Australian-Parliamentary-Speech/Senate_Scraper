        We the undersigned wish to register our concern at the feasibility of twice daily signing by parents of timesheets.

        A further concern is the lack of consultation by Government bodies with those directly affected by changes.

It would appear that the rights of consumers and workers have been negated.

         You may or may not be aware that any person having difficulties conceiving children may decide to take part in the IVF or GIFT Programmes. Due to a Medicare Legislation, people on these programmes are not permitted to go through the cycle more than six times. With your support, through this petition, we are hoping we may be able to have this Legislation changed, giving people on these programmes the opportunity to take part in more cycles therefore, increasing their chances of conceiving. It may take six cycles to conceive your first child therefore you miss out on having any other children through this programme because you have used your six cycles. Please sign this petition to support the change of the Legislation which could affect any one of your in the future. Thank you.

Tax relief would encourage existing members to retain their private insurance and more uninsured would join a fund, therefore removing much of the cost from the Government. It would also balance the inequity between Public Hospital waiting lists and empty Private beds.

         During the Cold War era, the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the Western powers meant that the Security Council was seriously hampered in addressing international crises. The end of the Cold War has seen the Council begin to function in the way the founders of the United Nations envisaged it would. It has taken action in regard to a number of the world's most troublesome conflicts—in the Persian Gulf, in Cambodia, in Somalia and in the Balkan conflict, to name some of the most prominent. In some cases the Security Council has determined that the imposition of economic sanctions is necessary in order to bring to an end a breach of international peace and security.

         In recent times, such sanctions have been imposed against Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). A failure by member states of the United Nations to implement those sanctions would inevitably erode respect for, and the authority of, those decisions. It is therefore important that Australia play its part in strengthening international peace and security by placing itself in a position fully to implement obligations that may arise from measures mandated by Security Council decisions. Further, Australia, as a member of the United Nations, is required as a matter of international law by Article 25 of the Charter to implement those decisions.

         Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions generally decide that `states shall prevent' specified transactions with the offending state. Australia's obligations under such resolutions have previously been implemented by way of the making of regulations under the Customs Act 1901, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Banking Act 1959 and the Migration Act 1958 and by way of appropriate directions issued by the Treasurer to the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Up until now, the Australian Government has been able to use those methods to implement, directly or indirectly, sanctions mandated by the United Nations against Iraq and Libya and those mandated against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) last year. However, recent events have shown that this ad hoc utilisation of legislation designed to be used for other purposes is no longer adequate.

         The Security Council adopted Resolution 820 on 17 April 1993. The Resolution provides for the imposition of strict new sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as from 26 April. The Government has been advised that Australia lacks a legislative basis by which it could ensure compliance with the obligations imposed by the Resolution in a number of important respects—for example, the freezing of funds held in Australia by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or companies based in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Nor, under existing legislation, can the Government prevent Australian individuals or firms from providing services—such as accounting services or the installation of computer software—to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The High Court held as long ago as 1973 that the Commonwealth did not have the executive power to cut off the telephone and mail services of the "Rhodesian Information Bureau" in Sydney, pursuant to a Security Council resolution. A failure to comply with the Resolution would place Australia in breach of its international obligations.

         In examining its options in relation to the implementation of those sanctions, the Government had regard to the ways in which other countries have done so. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have had facilitating legislation in place since the 1940s designed to allow a quick response to an obligation to implement Security Council sanctions. The Canadian and New Zealand legislation is particularly close in its wording to that proposed in the Bill.

         The central provision in the Bill before honourable Senators is the insertion of a new section 6 in the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. The section will enable the Governor-General in Council to make such regulations as are necessary or convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter. The Government will thereby be able to implement promptly by way of regulation economic sanctions introduced by the Security Council. As Honourable Senators would be aware, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances agreed in its Ninety-third Report of December 1992 (Scrutiny of Regulations Imposing United Nations Sanctions) that it was appropriate that Australia's obligations under Security Council resolutions be implemented by way of regulation. The reason for their conclusion was the need for speed and flexibility in the implementation of the sanctions and the fact that the regulations merely filled out the details of Australia's existing international legal obligation to comply with the sanctions.

         The wording of Section 8 reflects the fact that the sanctions introduced by regulation are those currently mandated by decisions of the Security Council. Once the Security Council decides that sanctions against a particular state are no longer necessary, it would obviously be inappropriate for the regulations implementing those sanctions to remain in force. Whilst prompt action will be taken to repeal or amend the regulations formally in line with the decision of the Security Council, this section will make it clear that they cease to have effect as soon as the sanctions are lifted by the Security Council. It also makes it clear that the Government may decide, consistent with the position regarding the introduction of sanctions, that the continued implementation of particular sanctions is no longer in the national interest.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you may be aware, on 29 January this year, I announced changes to defer the allocation of licences under section 96 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 for subscription television broadcasting services delivered on multipoint distribution systems (MDS).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Government was aware that mandating digital technology for the satellite services could provide a window of opportunity for MDS, it was never intended that MDS should take the dominant role in providing subscription television broadcasting services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In fact, in mandating digital technology, the Government seized the opportunity to place Australia at the forefront of world developments in broadcasting technology and to present exciting opportunities for Australian industry with employment and export potential.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following the calling of tenders for the remaining MDS channels, it became clear that major commercial interests had developed plans to provide extensive subscription television broadcasting services through MDS.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        MDS had been seen by the Government as providing a useful competitive ancillary to a national satellite or cable system, but because of its inherent limitations of audience reach it was not envisaged that it would provide the backbone of a national subscription television broadcasting service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is concerned that the early development of an extensive MDS subscription television broadcasting network may prevent the subsequent provision of high quality subscription television broadcasting services on a national basis through satellite transmission or a cable system. Because of the head start enjoyed by MDS technology, MDS systems could corner markets in a handful of major population centres. This would affect the commercial prospects of any national service to be  delivered by satellite.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government considers that if MDS services were to provide the basis of a national subscription television service, they should be subject to the same sorts of rigorous controls on concentration of ownership and cross media ownership or the Australian industry development requirements which apply to satellite subscription television broadcasting services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the development of widespread MDS based subscription television broadcasting services could prejudice the ability of the ABC to provide an effective nationally available service as was expressly provided for under the provisions enacted late last year.

        This policy was notified to the Australian Broadcasting Authority under section 161 of the Act. Further, the ABA was directed to act in accordance with that policy in exercising its licensing powers. No applications for subscription television broadcasting licences had been lodged at the time the policy was announced and the direction given to the ABA. However, applications were subsequently lodged by one company which then challenged the policy notification and direction to the ABA in legal proceedings brought in the Federal Court.

         The purpose of this Bill is to clarify doubts concerning the interpretation of Section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953, requiring the issue of guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner relating to information obtained under the Medicare Benefits Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program.

        Under these two programs the Government receives annually claims for approximately 157 million medical services and 94 million pharmaceutical prescriptions. Over $6 billion annually is spent on these services by the Government. Efficient and accurate processing of this huge quantity of information requires the use of large computerised databases.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Legislation provides for the privacy of all information gathered as part of the administration of these very large and complex programs. Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 and Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973, require officers to observe secrecy in respect of all information obtained in the course of their duties. The Privacy Act 1988 also applies to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information which is obtained in the administration of the Medicare Benefits Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program. In addition, the agencies responsible for administering these programs have agreed to be bound by the Privacy Commissioner's Data Matching Guidelines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953 complements this general framework by expressly providing that the Privacy Commissioner shall develop, in consultation with affected organisations, privacy guidelines relating to information obtained under the programs. This section was enacted in 1991 following an amendment moved by the Opposition in the Senate which was accepted by the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Privacy Commissioner's subsequent consultations on the guidelines, and advice from the Office of General Counsel in the Attorney-General's Department which was provided to the then Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, revealed a number of problems relating to the wording of that section. For example, on one reading of the current provision, personal identification information held in the eligibility enrolment databases (i.e. name, address, Medicare card number and Pharmaceutical entitlements number) would need to be deleted and reconstructed each five years thereby necessitating the issue of new eligibility cards at considerable public expense for no net benefit. Similar problems may relate to databases containing the names, addresses and qualifications of all approved providers of services and goods. A further difficulty relates to uncertainty as to whether the section applies only to information received after the commencement date of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991 (i.e. 27 June 1991).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        The purpose of this Bill is to clarify Section 135AA to overcome the problems identified during the consideration of the draft guidelines. It repeals the existing section and substitutes a new Section 135AA with, subject to the differences identified below, the same general structure. The Privacy Commissioner will still be required to issue privacy guidelines for the management of information stored in computer databases and to conduct consultations with affected organisations. The guidelines will also have to be tabled in the Parliament as a disallowable instrument.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To avoid the need to delete and reconstruct eligibility enrolment databases every five years, the new Section 135AA makes it clear that the guidelines to be formulated by the Privacy Commissioner do not extend to information contained in databases maintained for the purpose of identifying persons eligible to receive benefits. For similar reasons information simply identifying the practitioners and pharmacists who provide goods and services or issue referrals in connection with claims are also excluded.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill restricts the scope of the proposed guidelines to databases as it is not practicable to cover information held on paper files (e.g. otherwise the guidelines would require the removal of patient names from general files containing Ministerial correspondence). However, the Bill does require the guidelines issued by the Privacy Commissioner to specify the circumstances in which creating paper copies of information in computer databases is prohibited.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Notwithstanding those exemptions, the disclosure of such information will continue to be regulated by the general secrecy provisions under the National Health Act 1953,  the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Privacy Act 1988.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new section also specifies the content of the guidelines. In particular, it requires the guidelines to cover the ways in which information may be stored; the circumstances under which the making of paper copies of the information in the databases is prohibited; the uses to which agencies may put the information (e.g. to process claims, to investigate fraud); the circumstances in which agencies may disclose information. It also requires that information obtained from claims for medical benefits must be stored in a separate database from information obtained from claims for pharmaceutical benefits; and prohibits linkage of such information except in the way specified in the guidelines. It also requires the guidelines to make special provisions in relation to the storage and retrieval of information that is more than five years old.

        Under the new arrangements, the Health Insurance Commission can plan and establish a scheme which will allow the payment of rebates for child care costs to parents who are working, studying or training or seeking work. Such an amendment to the Act is required to enable the Health Insurance Commission to devote resources to develop and establish systems and procedures to register carers, register eligible families and make payments under the scheme from 1 July 1994. The new arrangements will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to administer a Child Care Cash Rebate as specified by an Act. Such a scheme will be specified in amendments to the Child Care Act 1972 which is scheduled for amendment in Autumn 1994.

         During my second reading speech on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992 on 16 December 1992, I gave notice that the Coalition would review in government, Division 18 of that Bill relating to unrealised capital gains on listed securities.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation's inquiry into Divisions 16-19 of this Bill, a number of important organisations including the Council of the Ageing and the Australian Stock Exchange expressed very significant concerns about this initiative which is due to come into effect on 20 September 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From the start, the Coalition has doubted the validity of the principle underlying the government's proposal. However we were effectively prevented from opposing these amendments due to the political difficulties entailed in disaggregating this proposal from other beneficial measures in such a social security omnibus bill. However we have adhered to our commitment to review this legislation after the election.  After undertaking this review, we have decided to seek to repeal these amendments to the Social Security Act.  This Private Senator's Bill is the first step in that process. A companion Bill which will make similar amendments in relation to the veterans' affairs portfolio will be introduced at a later date.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present, the value of share dividends is regarded as income for pension purposes. However capital growth is ignored. The effect of the government's proposal was to extend the current rules applying to managed investment to capital gains and losses during the previous 12 months on shares and other securities listed on the stock exchange.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        According to the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill, this measure would realise estimated program savings of $44.5 million in 1993-94 emanating from reductions in pension payments. On the basis of material provided to the Shadow Minister by the department of social security last year, it is estimated that annual savings would be in excess of $60 million although annual estimated savings as high as $85 million have been quoted.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government's main argument when introducing this measure was that it would mean that listed shares and securities would be treated in the same way under the social security income test as managed investments. Central to the government's argument was the fact that in 1988 the parliament had moved to prevent pensioners from circumventing the income test by treating unrealised gains from managed investments as income.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From its consultations with affected groups and individuals, it has become obvious to the Coalition that this measure will neither result in the estimated savings claimed by the government nor introduce any greater degree of equity or fairness into the income and assets tests for pensioners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        According to Budget Paper No. 3 1992-93, the ongoing assessment of capital gains and losses of listed shares and other securities would result in net savings of $44.1 million in 1993-94, $61.8 million in 1994-95 and $64.1 million in 1995-96.  The Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill estimated that net savings from the initiative in 1993-94 would be $44.5 million.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Information provided by departmental officials to the Shadow Minister late last year indicated that 60,000 social security pensioners would be affected by the measure with an average pension reduction of about $1,100 a year. These assumptions indicate that annual savings would be in the vicinity of $66 million a year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However none of the financial estimates for this proposal include an assessment of the inevitable impact it would have on investment behaviour. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation quoted the chief economist of the Australian Stock Exchange as stating that a "significant number of pensioners" would sell, adding that he doubted the government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year, "because no-one will have the shares''.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the angst in the pensioner community about this proposal and the very high effective rates of tax that it would impose on affected individuals, the Coalition contends that it would result in a very significant movement of pensioner assets  away from listed securities to less productive and less liquid investments such as real estate and collectibles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition believes that this proposal, if allowed to go ahead, would have a similar end result as the government's luxury car tax.  That is, the disincentives against pensioners' investing in listed securities would become so great that the benefit of any savings derived by the government would be more than offset by the detrimental impact on the Australian securities industry. What is more, this measure would encourage both current and future pensioners to dispose of productive assets to maximise their pension entitlement.  This is a highly undesirable scenario at a time when Australia's savings ratio is at a record low level.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government's argument that this measure would result in the more equitable treatment of pensioner investments is fundamentally flawed.  Not only would the government's proposal mean that listed securities would be treated more harshly than investments in other areas such as real estate, art works, antiques, non-listed securities and offshore securities. It would also result in the bizarre situation whereby identical investments in identical listed securities could result in different pension entitlements under the social security income test.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to point out a number of the unforeseen consequences of this hastily conceived government proposal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, this proposal perpetuates the questionable practice in the social security area whereby unrealised capital gains are treated as income under the income test rather than being assessed under the assets test. This approach is in stark contrast to the treatment of capital gains under taxation law.  The proposal runs counter to the Senate Select Committee for Superannuation's recommendation "that the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security form a working party to examine income tax and social security legislation with a view to maximising the consistency of definitions and treatment of matters of common concern to the two systems and that the report be tabled in Parliament by the end of 1993." (December 1992: page 50)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to recognise that unrealised gains on shares are often largely illusory and based on short term, extraneous matters rather than underlying value.  More than any other group, pensioners and retirees place great importance on achieving a maximum degree of certainty in relation to financial decisions. The Coalition contends that this proposal would seriously undermine the certainty in investment decisions relating to listed securities for pensioners. We contend that this erosion in investor certainty, resulting from pensions being increased or reduced on a quarterly basis due to temporary fluctuations in the share market, would be the primary reason why significant numbers of pensioners would divert their financial assets away from listed securities into other often less productive avenues of investment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If a government was putting forward such a proposal, one would think that, at very least, it would ensure that capital gains and capital losses would be treated on an equitable basis. Pension entitlement should not change if capital losses offset capital gains over the assessment period. However the formula proposed by the government maximises capital gains (and hence pension reductions) while minimising capital losses (and pension increases).  This means that a pensioner may have his or her pension entitlement reduced even though there has been no net change in the capital value of the share portfolio.  It also means that identical managed and unmanaged investments are treated differently under the social security income test.  Also of concern to the Coalition is the fact that pensioners with identical portfolios would be subject to differing outcomes simply as a result of the arbitrary assessment dates.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Not only would this measure result in the inequitable treatment of listed securities compared with other investments such as real estate and collectibles.  It would also mean that pensioners who invest in publicly listed companies would be subject to this additional income test while those who invest in non-listed companies would not. For example, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange has argued that a pensioner who invests in TNT (listed company) would be subject to the unrealised capital gains income test while a pensioner who invests in Linfox (an unlisted company) would not.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is also a strong argument that this proposal could have the effect of moving many small investors offshore. The Australian Stock Exchange has pointed out that unrealised capital gains on investments on overseas stock exchanges would not be subject to the social security income test.  The Australian Stock Exchange has made considerable headway recently in attracting small investors into the local share market. This proposal has the potential to discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition contends that the government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the social security income test is ill-conceived, fundamentally flawed and poorly researched. It is questionable whether the estimated savings from this initiative would ever be realised and it will not result in any greater equity or fairness in the social security income and assets tests which the Coalition contends are in urgent need of a thorough review. After carefully considering this proposal in line with our pre-election commitment, we intend to move expeditiously to ensure that it is repealed prior to the government's proposed 20th September 1993 start-up date.

         The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian National University Act 1991 to ensure that the Council of the University is solely responsible for the application of money appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the University and for the management of the University.

        The Australian National University is established by an Act of Parliament which specifies that there will be a research school in the field of medical science and that it is to be known as the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It also states that the Australian National University Council should have the entire control and management of the University.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any attempt to actually separate these powers of management and control from the ANU Council would certainly  be against the spirit of the Act. Any attempt to do this without the full knowledge of the Parliament is an attempt to circumvent the will of the Parliament.

        Yet this is what the then Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has done. This Bill that I have introduced is structured to prevent this blatant abuse of Ministerial power.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the arrangements as intended by the ANU Act 1991, the Australian National University receives its funding from the Department of Education, Employment and Training and then distributes it accordingly. This preserves the autonomy of the University and the integrity  of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, as was originally intended by the founders of the ANU.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Baldwin plan, the John Curtin School will be singled out and funding responsibilities transferred to the Department of Health. Thus the Department will be able to determine the funding levels for the School, and will be able to influence the research profile of the School. The Department may very well decide that the School's activities should be wound down. Research in Australia has already suffered enough through the machinations of the Australian Research Council and the education profile process. Handing the funding for the John Curtin School over to the Department of Health is paving the way for even more centrally-determined research priorities. This stifles research, particularly that research in which the John Curtin School excels.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There needs to be a plurality of effort and funding in research. In this way money is provided for a variety of projects, including pure and applied research. This allows expansion into different fields that may produce a variety of benefits. Centrally-funded research leads to a blinkered vision of where research should be heading.

        It is this invasion of the autonomy of a university that must be prevented. Government interference with and intervention in higher education institutions have been both disruptive and destructive. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. Independence of the education system has had to make way for bureaucratic favours while the Government enforces policy with the threat of withholding funds. Now this ruinous policy has gone as far as threatening the John Curtin School of Medical Research.

        The John Curtin School of Medical Research is a world class biomedical research institute. Its greatest strength is that it nurtures and tolerates long-term research on a diverse range of problems. It is one of the few institutions left that still continues this research—research which is not politically motivated but which ultimately yields the most beneficial results.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The John Curtin School of Medical Research is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the ANU. The Institute is an entity that consists of various research schools which interact with each other. It is that interaction that is very important. The burgeoning areas of science are the interdisciplinary areas. The interaction between the various research schools is therefore becoming increasingly important in joint projects. If these corporate ventures are to succeed then it is essential that the John Curtin School be a full corporate member of the Institute and not be separately funded.

        The unique qualities of the John Curtin School should be treasured and nurtured. It is through institutions such as the School that Australia can stay at the cutting edge of scientific advancement. The John Curtin School was not established to be just another arm of government policy. This was clearly not the wish of its founders, who include such eminent Australians as Sir Howard Florey, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombs. The latter two have objected strenuously and publicly to the proposed changes. The Government has tried to gain control of the School by circumventing the authority of the Parliament through manipulating the ANU into delegating its powers. This cannot be allowed.

        The Minister's actions in relation to the John Curtin School of Medical Research have put all Australian universities on notice that the Federal Government will not hesitate to intervene at any level in their internal affairs.

The Government has inflicted its policy on the ANU and the School against the wishes of almost all concerned. These actions must be rejected.

        The Bill I present for the Senate's consideration today will ensure that funding for the John Curtin School, or for any other section of the University, stays under the control of the University.

        The John Curtin School of Medical Research must remain under the auspices of the ANU as has always been intended.

        This action by the Government will also set a worrying precedent for intervention in our other institutions of higher education. Once the Government feels that it can get away with this invasion of the autonomy of a university they could undermine other universities in a similar way, changing the education profiles of the various institutions. This would be detrimental to the development of the knowledge and expertise that will be essential if Australia is to have any future in a competitive internationalised world marketplace.

This action by the Government must be reversed and prevented from recurring. The passage of this bill by the Parliament will ensure that.

        I note that Senator Patterson has introduced a very similar Bill and the debate on it has been adjourned. I suggest that we proceed with this motion now, for the sake of efficiency, because there is no need to rehearse the arguments again in this chamber. In fact, the coalition has made its position public. According to convention, I would incorporate in

        my second reading speech, and Senator Lees and I would not speak to the Bill. The matter of convention arises because, normally in this situation, a private member's Bill cannot be guaranteed the support of the chamber. But we know, as Senator Patterson has just demonstrated, that there would be support for our Bill. I suggest that, to save a lot of time and to have cleared up a matter which the coalition is on the public record as stating that it supports, we could do it right at this moment.

         It would be ridiculous if, later in the day, Senator Patterson were to introduce a similar Bill to achieve exactly the same purpose. If the coalition really believes in what we are attempting to achieve here, then its members will not play political games but will actually debate this matter now. In fact, if anybody suggests an adjournment of this debate, as convention would require, what they would be doing would be denying the passage of something which is held to be quite dear by, and very important to, a number of people who have contacted me on this matter. I invite coalition senators to make any slight amendments that they think are possible or necessary, I invite them to do anything they like to this Bill, but I invite them to pass it now.

         Essentially, the Government proposes to change the way in which pensioner investments in shares are to be treated from September this year. At present, only the dividends paid to shareholders are taken into account for the purposes of the income test for social security payments, while the actual capital value of the shares is included in the assets test.

         Until now, the capital growth on listed shares has been disregarded. The Government wants to change all that and provide for net unrealised capital gains on listed securities (other than bonds and debentures) to be taken into account under the income test. Under these changes, losses accrued on listed shares (or similar investments) can be offset against the capital gain over the same assessment period, but cannot be carried forward. When it introduced these changes, the Government claimed it was bringing listed shares into line with managed investments—where capital growth on the investment is treated as income.

         There are several aspects of the proposal which are highly unsatisfactory. Firstly, it continues the questionable practice in the social security area (which is at odds with taxation practice) of treating an unrealised accretion to capital as income, rather than assessing it under the assets test.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, it discriminates against shares as an investment, because similar treatment is not meted out to other investments (such as antiques, art work, collectibles and other less liquid investments where there could also be an unrealised capital gain which is not to be treated as income).

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, shareholder pensioners in similar assets and income positions will be treated differently because of the type of share asset owned. In a submission made to all Senators last year, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr. Laurence Cox, pointed out this would mean shareholders in a publicly non-listed company (such as Linfox) will not be affected by the change, but investors in a listed company (such as TNT) will be affected.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Fourthly, it is possible that investors will be encouraged to invest overseas and not in Australia, as those investments are unaffected by the proposed change. For example, Mr. Cox has suggested investors may elect to invest in IBM shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange purchased through an Australian broker, rather than invest in BHP. Accordingly, this move may well discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.

         The likely outcome of the Government's move is that many, if not all, of the 85,000 pensioners presently holding share portfolios will sell their shares. Mr. Michael Heffernan, the Stock Exchange's chief economist, stated his belief last year in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         </emphasis>
         (5 December 1992) that a "significant number" of pensioners will sell, adding that he doubted the Government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year "because no-one will have the shares''.

         Fifthly, the formula to be used in assessing gains and losses is seriously flawed which, when operating in the volatile world of the share market, will result in substantial inequities. The potential for inequity is graphically illustrated by the examples Senator Kernot used in her minority report—examples which a large number of pensioners and retirees have informed me are a precise reflection of their own situations.

         Example 1: A share portfolio increases in value from $10,000 to $12,000 over the 12 month period prior to the day of assessment and pays a dividend of $500. The return (for social security purposes) is $2,500: the increase in capital value ($2,000) plus the distribution ($500). The return expressed as a percentage of the value of the asset at the start of the review year is 25%. Under the formula, the past rate of return is applied to the current assets value. So the past percentage value is applied to the asset value on the day of assessment—that is, 25% of $12,000, or $3,000.

         Example 2: Where share prices fall, the dollar amount of the loss relates to the value of the assets at the start of the review year and the resulting percentage is applied to the lower closing price. For example, in the situation above, if—in the subsequent year—the asset value reverts to $10,000, the $2,000 capital loss is related to the $12,000 opening value and the result is a negative rate of return of 16.67 per cent. That percentage is applied to the closing value of $10,000 and a negative return is calculated ($1,667) which may be offset against gains on other securities, but not other source of income.

         In the example above, a $2,000 gain was assessed as $2,500; however, a $2,000 loss attracted a credit of only $1,667. This problem is exacerbated where a shareholder has two parcels of shares, one of which rises in value and the other falls in value. If the shareholder's two parcels are each valued at $10,000 and one goes up by $2,000 and the other falls by $2,000 (assuming no dividends are paid), the shareholder's DSS calculated income will be $800 ($2,400 income offset by a $1,600 loss), despite the fact there was no capital gain across the entire portfolio.

         The greater the variation in the price, the greater the calculated income (irrespective of whether or not any actual gain has accrued).

         But it also demonstrates another inequity in the treatment between a person with an "individual" share portfolio and a person who has invested in a managed investment with an identical shareholding. Each gain and loss on the individual's shareholdings are going to be separately assessed and will result in assessable income even if there is no overall net change in the asset value. But the managed investment will have no assessable income where there is no net capital gain.

         It is also quite clear that, unless DSS reviews are all carried out on the same day (and there has been no suggestion this will occur), pensioners with identical share holdings and the same dividend income could have markedly different pension outcomes.

         The operation of the formula makes a mockery of statements by the Government that the move is "fair" because reductions in share values will be able to be offset against gains.

         Another concern we have is that the unrealised gains are being assessed on the basis of a market assessment and that assessment could actually bear very little relationship to reality—for example, individual shareholders may not be able to obtain the quoted market price. We are, after all, talking about relatively small shareholders who are likely to be holding unmarketable parcels or parcels of unusual sizes. There may also be family or personal reasons as to why a small shareholder could be restricted in their ability to divest their shares.

          —The Australian Democrats will be supporting this suspension, as would be consistent with the position I indicated earlier in trying to get this matter resolved today. We would suspend Standing Orders because to bring this matter forward now is to recognise the importance of a sad event which occurred last December. The events on 16 December, just before the dinner adjournment, made that a very sad day: the Government proposed to introduce some penny-pinching legislation which would take advantage of pensioners who happened to hold a few shares and to deem that they had made a profit, made an income on them, if their value rose in the stock market. That paper profit would be called income and applied against their pensions. The coalition at that time, surprisingly, voted for that legislation, saying that it opposed it but would vote for it. That was a very sad day indeed.

          I hope that today, however, by supporting the suspension of Standing Orders we will bring about the resolution of that very strange situation. At last we have an Opposition that has recognised that it has the balance of power in this chamber, that the Government can propose something—the Labor Party proposes to take money from pensioners—and, if the Democrats oppose it, the coalition has to make up its mind, to make a decision. It has done so today and has decided that it will actually resolve this unfair imposition on the 86,000 people in Australia who are affected by this. At last the coalition has recognised that it has the balance of power in this matter. Having voted against the proposal through some contrivance of its political strategy, with the arrogance of thinking it might be in government at this stage, it is now deciding to vote against it. Of course we support the suspension of Standing Orders and we support also the bringing on of the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill 1993.

          —The Government will not be extending the debate on the question of suspension of Standing Orders. I will be the only government speaker. I want to place on record this view: it has been traditional on a Thursday for the Opposition and the Democrats to use the provisions of the Standing Orders in general business to deal with private members' Bills, as every honourable senator would know. It is true that government business this morning has been hijacked. The Government was not aware of Senator Bell's proposal. The Government did allow Senator Bell to read his second reading speech on his Bill, even though Senator Patterson and, I think, Senator Tierney incorporated second reading speeches. I noted that the Opposition did not pay the courtesy to me, as the duty Minister, of allowing me to incorporate second reading speeches on—

It is not a question of a courtesy to allow a Minister to incorporate a second reading speech; the tradition is that Ministers in the Senate read their own second reading speeches. The courtesy we granted this morning to the Manager of Government Business was to allow him to incorporate three speeches on Bills that we did not ask him to read. I would ask him to amend his expression.

          —Mr President, be absolutely clear that the appropriate time for this debate to take place is this afternoon during the consideration of general business when there is an hour and a half to bring on a private member's Bill. This can be interpreted as nothing more than a deliberate attempt to derail the government business program that is before the chamber at the moment. That is not to say that the issues contained within Senator Patterson's Bill and Senator Bell's Bill are not important; I am not going to the substance of the issues, but I am going to the argument of the capacity of both the Opposition and the Democrats to utilise their own time to do this as is ordinarily adopted in this chamber.

          I would suggest to Opposition and Democrat senators that that is not an appropriate way to go. We will be opposing and dividing on the issue of this suspension. I do not want to prolong the debate on the motion for suspension, but I do point out what I believe is a very significant breach in the conventions that have operated in this chamber for a long period of time. I am disappointed that the Democrats, particularly Senator Bell, did not at least have the courtesy to communicate to the Government through the Government Whips in this chamber what was being proposed. I would say to Senator Bell that I think that is just a modicum of decency and courtesy which would be expected.

He has to recognise what has been done here this morning, in that the Democrats not only did not tell the Government what they wanted to do and achieve this morning, but also they did not tell us. They are accusing us of not being serious about the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill 1993 that Senator Patterson brought into the chamber earlier. The Democrats could have at that time indicated that they wanted to pass our Bill immediately and they did not do so.

I agree with Senator Faulkner that this is not the time to be doing it, but I believe that the Democrats are putting us in a position where we are being forced to deal with it at a time that we recognise is not the appropriate time.

There is an agreement in relation to the importance of this issue because it impacts very adversely on 86,000 pensioners who happen to hold shares. It is an urgent matter, and I would remind honourable senators that it is well within the capability of this Senate to determine that this is an urgent matter and that it will deal with it now and not when the Government wants to deal with it. I simply stress to Opposition senators that they also have a stake in ensuring that this Senate remains supreme and that its functions and its operations are not subverted by the executive government or by any particular Minister dictating the terms under which we shall debate or shall not debate certain issues.

         Essentially, the Government proposes to change the way in which pensioner investments in shares are to be treated from September this year. At present, only the dividends paid to shareholders are taken into account for the purposes of the income test for social security payments, while the actual capital value of the shares is included in the assets test.

         Until now, the capital growth on listed shares has been disregarded. The Government wants to change all that and provide for net unrealised capital gains on listed securities (other than bonds and debentures) to be taken into account under the income test. Under these changes, losses accrued on listed shares (or similar investments) can be offset against the capital gain over the same assessment period, but cannot be carried forward. When it introduced these changes, the Government claimed it was bringing listed shares into line with managed investments—where capital growth on the investment is treated as income.

         There are several aspects of the proposal which are highly unsatisfactory.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Firstly, it continues the questionable practice in the social security area (which is at odds with taxation practice) of treating an unrealised accretion to capital as income, rather than assessing it under the assets test.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, it discriminates against shares as an investment, because similar treatment is not meted out to other investments (such as antiques, art work, collectibles and other less liquid investments where there could also be an unrealised capital gain which is not to be treated as income).
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, shareholder pensioners in similar assets and income positions will be treated differently because of the type of share asset owned. In a submission made to all Senators last year, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr. Laurence Cox, pointed out this would mean shareholders in a publicly non-listed company (such as Linfox) will not be affected by the change, but investors in a listed company (such as TNT) will be affected.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Fourthly, it is possible that investors will be encouraged to invest overseas and not in Australia, as those investments are unaffected by the proposed change. For example, Mr. Cox has suggested investors may elect to invest in IBM shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange purchased through an Australian broker, rather than invest in BHP. Accordingly, this move may well discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.

         The likely outcome of the Government's move is that many, if not all, of the 85,000 pensioners presently holding share portfolios will sell their shares. Mr. Michael Heffernan, the Stock Exchange's chief economist, stated his belief last year in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Age
         </emphasis>
         (5 December 1992) that a "significant number" of pensioners will sell, adding that he doubted the Government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year "because no-one will have the shares.

         Fifthly, the formula to be used in assessing gains and losses is seriously flawed which, when operating in the volatile world of the share market, will result in substantial inequities. The potential for inequity is graphically illustrated by the examples Senator Kernot used in her minority report—examples which a large number of pensioners and retirees have informed me are a precise reflection of their own situations.

         Example 1: A share portfolio increases in value from $10,000 to $12,000 over the 12 month period prior to the day of assessment and pays a dividend of $500. The return (for social security purposes) is $2,500: the increase in capital value ($2,000) plus the distribution ($500). The return expressed as a percentage of the value of the asset at the start of the review year is 25%. Under the formula, the past rate of return is applied to the current assets value. So the past percentage value is applied to the asset value on the day of assessment—that is, 25% of $12,000, or $3,000.

         In this situation, the DSS calculated income figure of $3,000 is $500 more than the actual return.

         Example 2: Where share prices fall, the dollar amount of the loss relates to the value of the assets at the start of the review year and the resulting percentage is applied to the lower closing price. For example, in the situation above, if—in the subsequent year—the asset value reverts to $10,000, the $2,000 capital loss is related to the $12,000 opening value and the result is a negative rate of return of 16.67 per cent. That percentage is applied to the closing value of $10,000 and a negative return is calculated ($1,667) which may be offset against gains on other securities, but not other source of income.

         What these two simple examples illustrate is that the formula magnifies gains and minimises losses.

         In the example above, a $2,000 gain was assessed as $2,500; however, a $2,000 loss attracted a credit of only $1,667. This problem is exacerbated where a shareholder has two parcels of shares, one of which rises in value and the other falls in value. If the shareholder's two parcels are each valued at $10,000 and one goes up by $2,000 and the other falls by $2,000 (assuming no dividends are paid), the shareholder's DSS calculated income will be $800 ($2,400 income offset by a $1,600 loss), despite the fact there was no capital gain across the entire portfolio.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The greater the variation in the price, the greater the calculated income (irrespective of whether or not any actual gain has accrued). In other words, pension losses caused by share price increases cannot be fully offset by the same drop in share prices. The Democrats do not believe this can be construed, in any way, as being fair.
        </tab>

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But it also demonstrates another inequity in the treatment between a person with an "individual" share portfolio and a person who has invested in a managed investment with an identical shareholding. Each gain and loss on the individual's shareholdings are going to be separately assessed and will result in assessable income even if there is no overall net change in the asset value. But the managed investment will have no assessable income where there is no net capital gain.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is also quite clear that, unless DSS reviews are all carried out on the same day (and there has been no suggestion this will occur), pensioners with identical share holdings and the same dividend income could have markedly different pension outcomes.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The operation of the formula makes a mockery of statements by the Government that the move is "fair" because reductions in share values will be able to be offset against gains. That is clearly not a strictly accurate statement—as many pensioners, retirees, financial journalists and investment advisers have been pointing out since August last year.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another concern we have is that the unrealised gains are being assessed on the basis of a market assessment and that assessment could actually bear very little relationship to reality—for example, individual shareholders may not be able to obtain the quoted market price. We are, after all, talking about relatively small shareholders who are likely to be holding unmarketable parcels or parcels of unusual sizes. There may also be family or personal reasons as to why a small shareholder could be restricted in their ability to divest their shares.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, this measure may not only fail to realise the expected savings for the Government (because many pensioners will move to divest their shares prior to the commencement date), it may in fact result in significant additional administrative costs for the Department of Social Security as it tries to keep abreast of market fluctuations.

         I can recall the dreadful measures that were taken by this Government last year, with the support of the Opposition, with respect to the detaining of refugees. The day before the Federal Court was to decide on the issue, the Government rammed a Bill through this Parliament which prevented some refugees from exercising their undoubted rights to have the question of whether or not they were being detained illegally by the Government considered by the Federal Court. I do not think that is an appropriate situation. I indicate right here and now that I am going to support these measures. I know a fair bit about the background to it.

If the Government brings in a Bill that it wants dealt with in a day or two, I want to be able to say, `We have not had an opportunity to look at it. We have not had an opportunity to take it to our party room, and we want to do so to find out whether we support it'. It is a difficult and dangerous precedent.

         The Government's Bill, which now is law, does not come into effect yet. Pensioners have been living with the concern and worry of it for some time, and I certainly look forward to this being changed. I feel that in regard to the procedures of the Senate it is better that we do not rush forward today; but, as I have already said twice, I do not want that interpreted as an attempt to back away from the Bill. I want us to be able to deal with each other in the future with some sort of decorum—with some sort of conventions.

         Senator Chamarette is now in the chamber. I suspect she would support this Bill, but I doubt whether she has had an opportunity to read Senator Patterson's incorporated second reading speech as yet. We all know what has happened this morning. We know what we are trying to do. I think it is time we all took a step backwards and let this thing proceed properly, with the Minister perhaps giving an undertaking as to a time next week when he would allow us to do that. If it is forced to go ahead this morning then somewhat reluctantly I shall vote on the principle of the Bill that we have put forward, but for the sake of the procedures of the Senate I would like us to do it a little differently from the way we seem to be forced to go at present.

         In terms of the guarantee which Senator Reid seeks, I think reasonably, about when we can deal with this again, I cannot give the exact moment in our business because I would have to consult with Senator Faulkner about that, but it will be as early as possible in the first day of sitting next week. When I say `the first day of sitting', my definition may not be brilliant, but generally speaking I do not regard days on which we are considering the Estimates as sitting days because we do not come here and do this.

         —I want to make only a couple of points. Firstly, we are quite happy with the general principle that the detail of the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill in relation to the committee and third reading stages be delayed, and that the Bill not proceed through all its stages at this time. However, as both Senator Patterson and Senator Reid have indicated, the broad principle of the Bill is very strongly agreed to by both the Democrats and the Opposition. I understand that the Opposition will be introducing a similar Bill in the House of Representatives. We would certainly support the idea that we get this Bill to the end of the second reading stage, take the vote on the second reading, and then adjourn the committee stage for whatever time. It should not be too long—perhaps a week or something like that—and then we should bring it back and deal with the committee stage. The Bill, in fact, is very brief. It is only a single page, so it should not take anybody too long to read the Bill and explore its ramifications.

         As to the urgency of it, I think there are a couple of points that need to be made. The full operation of this legislation will not occur until later on in the year. Nonetheless, right at this moment pensioners are selling shares or being advised to sell shares in anticipation of the way in which the law will operate, and those people are being very significantly disadvantaged. I think it is also for that reason that it is important that we get this to a vote at the second reading stage; so we get on the record in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard

         that there is solid support from the senators of the Opposition and the Democrats for this Bill, and so the matter will proceed and cannot just simply disappear.

         Not only are pensioners selling their shares or being advised to sell their shares because of the imminence of the application of this legislation, but also the legislation does not apply to foreign shares. It applies only to shares in Australia. We want pensioners with small amounts of excess funds to invest in Australian companies, not to go and invest in foreign shares. We want them to invest. We want that money put to productive use. The fact that they may be selling shares in Australian companies and shifting that money elsewhere is something that needs to be addressed urgently.

We are quite happy if the committee stage and the third reading are delayed until sometime in the near future—I stress, the near future, the not too distant future—and the matter is brought back. That would provide adequate time for everybody to look at this single-page Bill and make sure that there are not any hiccups in the wording and the extent to which the Bill covers this matter.

Those people have been directly affected since the notorious events of 16 December, when we saw the coalition actually support the legislation and cause panic and uncertainty for financial advisers, people who had made some attempt to be partly self-sufficient in their retirement and those who had invested in Australia's future.

I suggest that the Minister would be interested to know that when pensioners have contacted the Department of Social Security, asking how this measure will be administered, how the assessments will be made, what will be deemed, by whom, at what date and with what effect, those very pensioners have been unable to get proper answers from the Department of Social Security, which has been confused about the administration of this matter.

         It could well be that many pensioners, as has been observed to me in writing by several astute pensioners, having done what Senator Coulter suggested might happen—and as Senator Lees mentioned in her contribution to this debate on 16 December as likely to happen—have thought about this and some have considered investing in foreign companies, be they companies such as IBM, Feltex, Fletcher Challenge or whatever, or be they British companies. There have been people who have taken their much needed extra capital from Australia and invested it in foreign companies. That effect is starting to happen. On the strength of that, any examination by the Government of the effect of this measure would probably show that it is revenue neutral: we are going to lose as much as we are going to gain. It is going to cost us as much to administer it as we will gain, or even more.

A few astute pensioners have pointed out to me that the chances are that it would be pretty close to revenue neutral.

         As far as notice is concerned, and with regard to knowing what is going on and being aware of this legislation, on 16 December the argument was well rehearsed. Senator Lees, in her contribution to the debate in this place on that date, made sure that honourable senators all knew and were fully informed about what the effect of this was. In spite of that full exposition by Senator Lees, the coalition decided in favour of a faulty strategy, to vote with the Government. I would have thought that honourable senators who then were interested in the debate would have informed themselves by looking at Senator Lees's speech at that time. That speech, by the way, incorporated a large slice of the dissenting, minority report made by Senator Kernot when the matter was considered by the Senate committee. Anybody who then wanted to be informed on the matter could have read that, yet we still have people claiming that they needed a bit of notice.

         , about the matter of the investment community's anticipated enthusiasm for the launch of Woolworths onto the Australian stock market. In writing to the newspapers about that float, I made the observation, and I think it should be taken on board by the Government, that, as with the partial float of the Commonwealth Bank, the sorts of investors who are attracted to longstanding institutions—major retailers in Australia and major components of our economy such as the Commonwealth Bank—and who are relied upon to take up a significant proportion of that float, are the so-called mums and dads of the investment community.

         I warned in my communication on this matter that the mums and dads will not be there in this Woolworths float. The mums and dads are the very people to whom such an investment will be most unattractive because of what this Government has done and because of what the coalition has done in supporting the Government. I think there is an urgency to pay regard to that and not to distort our financial community by removing such a significant and relied upon component of major floats.

         I am not suggesting that it be done for the benefit of the Woolworths float, but I am suggesting that the further selling or abrogation of responsibility by the Government is typical. The further 19 per cent sale of the Commonwealth Bank will be affected in exactly the same way. They are the two significant factors which I think the perpetrators of this penny-pinching crime against pensioners were obviously not fully cognisant of. However, they jolly well should have been because it has a huge effect. As Senator Coulter said, and quite rightly, a clear, strong indication should be given today to those who are interested in this area. It can be given when we vote on the second reading.

         I want to come to why we are here. When income and assets tests are designed for a pension system such as ours, the design is done with equity in mind. It is not always perfect; it is not always easy, but that has to be the underlying principle. The assets and income test that pensioners now must face has stood the test of time pretty well. We managed to get it pretty right when we first introduced it and, over time, when anomalies have come up we have acted to get rid of them. That is all that this legislation does. What we had was a situation where pensioners could be treated better by investing in shares than by, say, putting money into managed investments. All that we have sought to do in this legislation is to make sure that, no matter what the pensioner might care to invest in, he or she can expect the same treatment. So one investment is not better than another; they are all supposed to be treated the same.

         While it has been claimed that those who are pensioners with shares are being singled out, I think the real truth is the exact opposite. For a number of years shares have been treated concessionally. In the past, pensioners who have had shares have been able to be treated singly, and now that anomaly disappears. What the change does is bring the treatment of shares into line with the treatment of most other kinds of investments. For example, equity trusts where people invest in shares indirectly should be treated—

         —I am not sure how many pensioners own them. I suspect that, of Australia's l.4 million pensioners, there are not too many worried about the price of antique clocks. I am certainly not. To get back to what I was attempting to say, however: if we look at equity trusts, where in fact people invest in shares indirectly, there is absolutely no reason why pensioners who are in those now should be treated differently from those who invest in shares directly through the share market.

         It has been suggested that it is also unfair to assess unrealised capital gains. We have to look at what has been underlying the assets tests since they began, and that is that those pensioners with assets are able, if they choose to do so, to realise them. The problem is for those without assets. They are going to be treated pretty unfairly if we simply allow the accumulation of assets by those who have got the resources to accumulate them. The gains represent an increase in resources that can be used by pensioners to provide income support for themselves if they so wish. If we are going to have a needs based social security system—and that is what we have got—it is only fair that they utilise those gains before they call on the taxpayers to give them support.

         It does not mean, as I think Senator Bell and Senator Coulter were suggesting, that shares suddenly become a bad investment for pensioners. What it does mean is that the pensioner-friendly treatment of shares will be removed so that investment in shares is based on the intrinsic merit of the investment and not on some concessional treatment by the Department of Social Security. It means that pensioners who invest in shares do not have an advantage over those who are using their savings to generate some income rather than simply generating unrealised capital growth.

         Whether pensioners do sell shares to access this growth and supplement their income or whether they just retain the growth as an increase in the value of their investment will be a personal choice, but taxpayers should not be called on to provide a higher level of income support than necessary to such people if they choose not to utilise the gains. I doubt very much that all pensioners will sell their shares, as is being claimed today. They are not all going to race out and sell their shares. Some of those pensioners have been holding them for decades and they have held them through all sorts of changes in the way shares were treated before they were pensioners. They are not going to change the way they do business now.

         The rules that will apply to shares have applied to most managed investments for five years. A pensioner with funds in a managed investment knew that there would be gains taken into account and that his pension would be reduced accordingly. Over that time, some 128,000 pensioners have invested in managed investments on the basis of their merit as an investment. Those 128,000 pensioners have managed to do it with managed investments, and we will find that those who hold shares will do exactly the same thing. Let me tell the Senate the numbers so that we get the argument into some perspective. There are about 60,000 Department of Social Security pensioners and about 24,000 Veterans' Affairs pensioners affected by this change. Overall, less than 3 per cent of the pensioner population will be affected. I hope this debate does not become a replica of the first assets test debate nearly a decade ago, when the Opposition sought to frighten all pensioners although only a tiny percentage of them were ever going to be affected.

         It also has to be noted that those most affected are those with large shareholdings. Some pensioners have $100,000 invested in shares. When the vast majority of pensioners have nothing invested in shares and precious little invested in anything else, we have to ask ourselves whether it is fair for pensioners with $100,000 invested in shares to be able to avoid any kind of pressure to realise any of the gains. If they choose not to realise the gains, should the people with absolutely nothing have to subsidise them? The Government came to the conclusion that the answer to that was, clearly, no. Pensioners with a small number of shares—and that is the vast number of the 60,000 who are affected anyway—are hardly going to be affected. The change is not going to affect them to any significant extent.

         Savings of some $80 million in a full year are going to be raised by this measure. I think that $44 million was claimed by the Opposition, but I am advised that the savings in a full year will be $80 million. That amount of money deserves serious consideration. I would think it is in the interests of all pensioners, when that kind of money is available to be collected from those who have been treated concessionally over the years, to want to see the Government do it.

         We can be judged by what we do to help those who are in the greatest need. That includes the increase in pensions that was provided in January of this year and the extension of eligibility for fringe benefits that was implemented in April to pay for those kinds of measures. The money does not come out of the air. It has to come from somewhere. I cannot think of too many more appropriate places than this place. Over 50 per cent of pensioners affected by the share change will benefit from the change I have just mentioned, receiving benefits of up to $20 a week. Pensioners with shares will benefit also from the accompanying measure to allow reductions in the value of shares to be offset against gains on shares or managed investments.

         I am not certain whether these matters are to be raised in Senator Patterson's as yet unread speech, but there was a press release from Mr Ruddock yesterday in which he raised a number of matters that I think ought to be cleared up. Firstly, he claimed that pensioners will redirect their savings to overseas shares because the change does not apply to those shares. But, of course, it does. In saying that it applies to overseas shares, it should also be noted—as I am sure Senator Coulter and Senator Bell would be well aware—that there are not too many pensioners with great company structures set up in the tax havens of the world to avoid taxes. It is not going to be a difficult task to locate the vast majority of those who seek to do it and to take it into account.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, there is a claim that the measure will impact on the floating of shares in public enterprises. Senator Bell has added his weight, if that is the correct term, to this by referring to the Woolworths float which is about to take place. But, as I said previously, the change will ensure that pensioners wishing to invest in shares make their decision based on the intrinsic merit of the investment, not on any concessional treatment.

         I for one would not be prepared to say that there is no intrinsic merit in investing in a Woolworths float. Woolworths is a great company and its management has achieved such an increase in market share in the course of the last decade, to the detriment of some very well-known competitors, that it would be difficult to see pensioners walking away from the intrinsic merit of that investment.

         There has also been a lot of comment about the method that will be used to implement the measure. Most of that comment is based on a misunderstanding of the way in which the income test works in practice and has worked for years. That method has been endorsed as the appropriate way of operating the income test by the High Court. The basic principle is that the income test is intended to measure the financial resources available to a person at a given point in time. It does not and it should not assess past dollar gains or compensate for past dollar losses.

         It ought to be noted that pensioners with shares are around five per cent of all shareholders. Most of them have got small holdings. It ought not be the case that pensioners who have had experience with these investments for years are simply going to run away because of a change in the treatment. It will make the investments marginally less attractive but it will make the tests that are applied to pensioners more equitable across all pensioners—those who have got the funds to invest in shares and the vast majority of pensioners, the 97 per cent, who have not.

         —in reply—I regret in some ways that we have had to debate the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill in this way, on the second reading speech. It has occurred as a result of, maybe, some misunderstanding between the Democrats and me about the order in which the formal motions were put this morning. We did not actually run in the order on the paper and I think Senator Bell thought that I had jumped to my feet a little earlier than he had. He missed the fact that Senator Tierney had actually moved his formal motion, the President was looking around to see whether there was another formal motion and I stood. That was not meant to gazump Senator Bell, but that was the way it may have been interpreted.

         I find it interesting that Senator Bell has entered this debate at this stage. Obviously he got some pressure from some pensioners during the election campaign, but he did not speak on this Bill when it was going through before. We had been having negotiations with Senator Lees's office about the passage of our two Bills and we had hoped that we would have a smooth passage of them, being able to debate this Bill in a manner which gave the Independents time to see it. But that was not what happened and we are now in the second reading stage.

         I reject the comments that the Democrats made about our having had some sort of vision on the road to Damascus and changed our view about this. When I spoke on this Bill, taking the Bill through on behalf of the then shadow Minister, Mr Connolly, I expressed our concern and said that after the election we would be looking at reviewing that Bill. We were not in the position to review it from government but we decided that, since we had made that commitment, we would review it from opposition. That is the reason we have taken this action.

         The Democrats have said that we should have done so at the time, but it was in an omnibus Bill and there was a gun being held at our heads that, if we did not agree with this, the other benefits flowing from the measures in the rest of the Bill would not go ahead. So we were in a cleft stick, or between a rock and a hard place. Because that provision was not coming in until September 1993, we agreed with that part of the Bill in order that the other benefits would flow, and gave a commitment to review it. So I reject the assertion that Senator Bell makes, that we had not actually taken an interest in this and were not concerned about it. We expressed concern and I expressed concern in that speech.

         I listened to what the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, had to say. I believe that there ought to be a total review, so that equity is established; but patching it up or trying to do things in the way he has done does not make it equitable. I do not agree with all his assertions that people will not change. Also, there are other pensioners coming on stream, many of them with superannuation payouts that are not sufficient to live on but are sufficient to invest. They will be discouraged from doing it.

         We also have to look at the future. I do not believe, nor do many other people in the community believe, that the Government will make the savings that the Minister claims. Let me say that the social security department has had a very poor record on estimating what gains it will have, and Senator Richardson knows that. I will not reiterate them all here in the chamber, though I could; but the department has been a long way off the mark in its predictions of savings, and so has the Health Insurance Commission. For predictions of savings, I would give the Department of Social Security about two out of 10 at the moment—not a pass—so I do not believe the savings in this. I believe the Minister needs to put a much better argument. He needs to put up a review of the whole area, because there are anomalies. We know about the Auditor-General's report on land. Is the Government going to look at unrealised gains on land? Is it going to look at unrealised gains on art works? The Government needs to get its house in order and make sure that we have some standard and that we have some equity in the system.

         I would also like to take Senator Richardson up on the fact that he said this will come on next Wednesday. There are a lot of older people who are affected. Despite the fact that the Minister says the figure is only five per cent, there are a number of them. He makes out that they seem to be the rich, but they may be the more frugal: those who have saved and saved and saved to have that $100,000 to invest. He should not make out they are running around with huge amounts of money. Some of those people have been very frugal and put that aside through their savings, and that is what we are trying to encourage Australians to do. We need every bit of saving we can get in this country. I hope that the Minister will bring it on as he has promised on Wednesday so that we can deal with this issue and so that there can be some predictability for those pensioners who have been concerned about this issue.

          —Yes, but I think the Minister said that it had been circulated. I do not think it has been. I have got several concerns regarding this particular change to the procedure. To begin with, it sets out very clearly that the Senate will never again have the right to debate the reports of the Senate committees. I cannot imagine why the Government would want to cause that to occur except that it seems imbued with a sense of power over there, even though it has got only 30 senators in the new Parliament. We will have 36. It still believes that the estimates committees should not be entitled to full debate about expenditure and what goes on in the estimates committees. We have in the past had a watered down system that the Government does not seem to think has worked. It is still wanting to cut time. I know that some of my colleagues would agree with that and would be voting the opposite way to me on that issue.

But in the past we have had reports chastising a department for late answers, for wrong answers or whatever. All sorts of comments come up in the report from an estimates committee that must be brought to the attention of the Senate. There is nowhere for them to go if they are not. So if the estimates committee believes that the department has been obstructive, it says so in its report. If the committee believes that perhaps the chairman has not carried out the full obligations of the chairmanship as the committee believes they should have been carried out, that can be contained in the report.

I believe it is very important that those reports of Senate committees not be disregarded, as is presently suggested by the Government's motion that we are looking at. That is only one of the many concerns I have but that is one to which I foreshadow moving an amendment.

          The other thing is that, since this Government has been in power, many of the rights of honourable senators have been taken away. We used to be able to speak for an hour. Some people would remember Senator Cavanagh. On a very technical Bill, when he and Senator Wright were in the Senate, an hour was a more appropriate time for people of that quality to debate a Bill. I am sure that the Deputy President would remember many occasions when Senator Cavanagh and Senator Wright were debating something. They often tangled in the Senate. Those debates would take considerable time, and rightly so. As a result of a speech going for over half an hour, some good amendments would come out of the debate.

          But that time has been cut from an hour to half an hour. Our estimates committee procedures in the Senate have been cut considerably. Many of the rights that honourable senators had previously have been cut. We are gradually getting to the stage where the Government says that we cannot even debate the estimates committee report. That is over the fence. We know that the Australian Labor Party does not approve of the Senate, to begin with. It has had that in its policy for many years. While it is no longer in the written policy, Senator Coates, Senator Evans and many others on that side say that it is of no value. Indeed, Mr Keating has said that there is no value in having a Senate. That would put all the power into the hands of the Prime Minister of the day, and that is where the Australian Labor Party, when it has been in power, has said it should be.

          It has to be understood that the Government does not have the numbers in the upper house. Therefore, it must respond to the wishes of the Senate, not of the Executive Government. It is most important that the Senate does not allow the Government to take away the right to debate reports of the estimates committees here. At the moment, it is allowing only amendments and requests to be debated and is refusing to allow debate on the reports themselves.

          In my view, the downgrading of the Committee of the Whole is wrong—and this has nothing to do, let me stress, with my amendment. It ought to be maintained as it is—but then I was disappointed when it was changed from the original intention and procedure to what it is at the moment. Again, I am disappointed that the intention of the Government is to downgrade that even further and not allow a full debate. I know some of my colleagues disagree with me on that particular issue, but I am sure that they would agree that the report itself should be debated, and that they will not give up gladly the opportunity of debating the committee report. I hope the Government agrees that is an important thing to abide by and will agree with my amendment.

          —I rise to oppose the motion and to support Senator Walters's foreshadowed amendment. The abolition of the Committee of the Whole is but a further step in reducing the capacity of the Senate to scrutinise the expenditure and outlays of Australian taxpayers' funds. It will be argued that the debate of the Committee of the Whole which has thus far taken place will be transferred to the supplementary or additional debates of the estimates committees. Of course, that is just not the case. There is a vast distinction between debating in this chamber and the questioning of Ministers here and that of inquiring of them certain information in the estimates committees. It is not only a truth in reality, it is also a truth in perception.

          It is not without consequence to observe the distinct difference in the demeanour and attitude of Ministers when they are being asked questions in this chamber, from that in the estimates committees. Very rarely can a Minister sustain the position of simply refusing to answer questions put to him or her in this chamber for any length of time. In the estimates committees, however, if the Minister thinks that a question does not deserve a response, there have been numerous occasions when they have declined to answer the question and suggested the questioner move on to the next item. Also, while a chairman presides over the meetings, contributions are made by a number of other senators, invariably because of the multiple combinations of political parties of partisan persuasion. So the general conduct, the general environment and the general attitude in the estimates committees are vastly different from those of the Committee of the Whole.

          The effect of abolishing the Committee of the Whole would be, of course, to limit the debate. I have always had the view that it is a fundamental trampling upon the democratic processes and the functioning of the Parliament to reduce the speaking time available to members and senators. I have never supported the reduction in speaking time on any occasion and I shall not be doing that in the future. I think it is fundamentally wrong in principle for any member or senator to make a judgment—which is inevitably subjective—about the quality of the debate and the contribution and the relevance of the debate of any other member or senator.

          If that is to be the case, the strength of that argument can only be sustained by moving a gag in this chamber. The fact is that there is grave reluctance to do this on the part of any particular political party, except in extreme circumstances. Invariably, that only prevails at the end of the session when we are running into a deadline and there are a number of Bills to get through. There has always been a grave reluctance on the part of any political party to move a motion to deny any member or senator speaking time. The reason for that grave reluctance is because it is an imposition on one of the fundamental purposes for which senators are elected to this chamber.

          I note on page 7 of the report, `Estimates Committees and Appropriations Bills', 19 December 1991, under option (4) it is suggested that these additional hearings could be held outside the Senate's sitting times, but the sitting of the Senate could be suspended to allow the hearings to take place if the Senate's program of business allowed.

         Given the quite natural partisan nature of estimates committees where there are those on the committee seeking to scrutinise—for altruistic or political purposes, probing and testing and questioning—we have an equal number, on some occasions, who see their primary function to preserve the Government and to protect the Minister. So to suggest that these additional committee hearings would have a specified time limit would, of course, be at the behest and at the pleasure of the majority and the majority inevitably would be the Government. So we are making a partisan decision about the level of contribution that the chamber as a whole can make.

          There is some question as to whether or not the Bills would proceed past the second reading stage prior to the supplementary hearings. On page 8 under the heading, `Progress of the appropriation bills', it is claimed:

          Of course, that has the effect of formalising the marginalising of the supplementary hearings and, inevitably, unless there are amendments or requests regarding the appropriation Bills, the legislation will proceed through the chamber to its conclusion while the additional estimates committee meetings are being held. So they will be marginalised and once they are marginalised their irrelevancy will become apparent and the purpose of pursuing them will, of course, diminish.

          I note that under `preferred option' the committee observes that it believes that these proposals will overcome the problems identified in this paper without diminishing the rights of senators or the ability of the Senate to scrutinise thoroughly the Estimates and appropriation Bills. I have to say, with respect, that is an absolute nonsense. I can see no justification for that argument. The truth of the matter is that these proposals are not intended to make the process more efficient.

I do not recall the last time I saw any Labor senator cross the floor on debates on Standing Orders, notwithstanding the fact that convention has it that it is a free vote. Senator Ray always used to proudly skite that it was a free vote over there, but that they all had the brains to make sure they voted as one. That leaves us in the absurd position of some of my colleagues exercising their right and, inevitably, losing. However, be that as it may, the object of this report is not to make the process more expeditious or more efficient; it is simply to cut down the time available for the scrutinising of the expenditure and outlays of government revenues.

As I said yesterday, I would have thought the findings of the Western Australian royal commission, in which Senator McMullan presumably has more than a passing interest, would be a salutary lesson to those who believe that there is something clever, something slick, and something smart about expediting government business through the chamber with the least amount of impediment or the least amount of objection by what might be described as a recalcitrant opposition.

          —The facts are not getting in the way of the argument. The truth of the matter is that, if the Government managed its affairs and the business of the Parliament properly, there would not be a problem. Senator McMullan is now saying to the chamber that it is more important for legislation to be passed than for legislation to be scrutinised. If there has to be a conflict between whether legislation is scrutinised properly, examined carefully, and subjected to second deliberation, and whether it is a question of getting the damned legislation through because the result of the legislation is more important than the scrutiny, we will always go for the latter proposition. That is the object of the argument. The contempt in which this Government holds the Parliament is shown by the way we are now governed by fear. We are now governed by public press release.

          If the Treasurer wants to change the legislation fundamentally, that happens as a result of him issuing a press statement. The legislation becomes effective from the date of the press statement and then when it is introduced it is made retrospective. That is because of the contempt of this Government for the parliamentary process, in no way better manifest than in the observations of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that this chamber—this States house, this house of second deliberation and consideration, this chamber of sober reflection, this chamber which has more time to scrutinise the legislation carefully—is, in his words, `unrepresentative swill'. It is no secret that if the Prime Minister had his way he would abolish this chamber. This comes from a political party that argues that the level of corruption alleged in the States comes from a bicameral system in one circumstance. The truth of the matter is that because of the vanity and the arrogance of this Government, its members are much more concerned for their legislation than they are for having it scrutinised or having it right.

          Madam Acting Deputy President, it gravely disappoints me that we are confronted with this proposal. I take it that the Democrats will be supporting the Government, for reasons which I definitely do not understand. The Democrats have always very properly argued that the forum of the Parliament is the proper forum for the scrutiny of the Government. As a minor party not likely to have to concern itself with the treasury bench, the contribution the Democrats make, as Don Chipp always said, is to scrutinise legislation. Perhaps he put it in a more crude way; he said, `Keep the bastards honest'. One of the fundamental instruments available to the Democrats is the proper scrutiny of the Government in its conduct and in its legislation. To that extent, the Democrats quite properly have never been reluctant to use select committees whenever an issue has come up which they have considered deserved further attention; to the point that the then Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, threatened that he would cut off funding if the legislation was inhibited as a result of further scrutiny and further examination by a select committee of this chamber.

          To that extent I find myself in a state of confusion as to why the Democrats will support this, why the Democrats propose to reduce speaking time from 20 minutes, why the Democrats are supporting the reduction of the number of standing committees from nine to seven, and why the Democrats chose not to support my commendable amendment yesterday to increase the number of estimates committees from six to eight. I just hope that the Democrats will do as they always claim, give this proposal the serious consideration it deserves, and support Senator Walters' amendment. To do otherwise would be simply to reduce the capacity the Democrats have in this chamber to maintain their relevancy. That is true of us, and that is true of all parties other than the Government. To accept these nonsensical proposals is simply to hand a further instrument to the Government to disguise, to camouflage and to hide its legislation and its outlays from public, proper and careful scrutiny.

          As far as the substantive motion goes, the Procedure Committee on 19 December 1991 adopted a report into estimates committees and the virtual re-running of estimates committees in the chamber in the Committee of the Whole. I was a member of that committee at the time—I still am—and I thought it was a very good report. I think we would all have to agree that substantial time is spent on looking at appropriations, and so it should be. It is a very big Bill. It is basically the estimate of the amount of money the Government is going to spend in the next year and what it is going to spend it on. It is very important, and it should be scrutinised closely.

This is not monumental but I recall that in the Procedure Committee it involved quite a bit of discussion, which was quite interesting.

The first report of the Procedure Committee stated, concerning the proposed amendment suggested by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Democrats, that the effect of the proposed amendment would be that, when government documents are not presented until after 12 noon—as is always the case on sitting Mondays and Tuesdays, when the Senate does not meet until two—consideration of those documents under standing order 61 would be deferred until the following sitting day. If there were deferred documents to be considered on any sitting day as well as documents tabled on that day, the time for consideration of both groups of documents would be 60 minutes.

          That would allow time for honourable senators to examine documents which were not tabled until after 12 noon before the documents were debated.

          The problem that the Procedure Committee established with that proposal was that sometimes topicality of these documents is very important. We agree that sometimes it is. The committee suggested that, as an alternative, it be provided that, when the Senate sits at two, government documents may be tabled before Question Time. There would then be at least the 60 minutes taken by Question Time and usually the 90 minutes taken by Question Time, petitions and notices for examination of those documents not made available to honourable senators before tabling, before the documents were debated under the standing order. To prevent the tabling of government documents delaying the commencement of Question Time, it could be provided that documents may be tabled by a Minister by handing them to the Clerk without any announcement to the Senate. The Chair would announce the earlier tabling of the documents when government documents were called on for consideration under the standing order.

         When I gave notice of my motion yesterday and when I sought its formality today, to its credit, I received support from the Government, even though some of the measures that I proposed, no doubt, implied criticism of what the Government has or has not done in the area of containing the cost of justice. The coalition parties, however, saw fit to oppose the measures that I suggested should be taken to make the legal system more accessible to all Australians rather than to perpetuate the present position in which only the very rich or the very poor have access to the courts.

         Let us now look at some of those measures which the Opposition obviously thinks are not worthy of consideration. The first measure which, I believe, is absolutely essential if we are going to get anywhere with the containment of costs is to have independent tribunals with consumer representation to fix lawyers' fees and court charges. The legal profession must be just about the only profession that is able to fix its own remuneration. It is quite clear that, if we are to have any confidence in the need to have certain costs charged and certain fees imposed on people seeking legal advice and legal representation before Australian courts, the fees charged by lawyers should be subjected to impartial analysis. Yet there seems to be a great reluctance to accede to that request and there seems to be a great push from the profession to retain the privilege of fixing its own fees.

         The other proposition that I wish to put forward is closely allied to that. It is the establishment of independent complaints tribunals for the legal profession and, for that matter, for judges. Various inquiries of the Parliament—most particularly the cost of justice inquiry carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Joint Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act—have received a number of submissions and a lot of anecdotal evidence. No doubt every honourable senator in this chamber has received correspondence from members of the public who have been charged enormous amounts and who have had to suffer the consequences of mistakes made by members of the legal profession who have represented them. They have found that, if they want to do something about it and complain about Caesar, they have to go to Caesar to complain about what has happened to them.

Yet when that person sought intervention from the Law Institute she was told that she could go before the Law Institute tribunal but that the most she could expect in terms of damages or satisfaction was $2,500.

         We have also had, I believe, a number of cases where people have alleged bias on the part of judges. It is time that we recognised that the judiciary has certain responsibilities in our community and that they should be subject to scrutiny. It is also time that we recognised people who feel that they have had—to put it bluntly—a raw deal on the basis of bias by a judge or even negligence where a judge has totally disregarded evidence that he or she should have taken into account. Those people should not be forced to go to yet another appeal, which very often could be to the High Court at tremendous expense, but should be able to have such a complaint scrutinised by an independent tribunal. These are matters that I have brought up repeatedly in both the family law inquiry and in the cost of justice inquiry but, as yet, the other members of those inquiries have not seen fit to support such measures.

         I will now turn to the question of legal aid. In this time of rather limited government finance it must be said, yet again, that both State and Commonwealth governments have the prime responsibility to ensure that members of the community who cannot afford, of their own means, to retain lawyers, must receive legal aid. We find that, currently, more than 50 per cent of applications for legal aid are rejected. For most of them, it is not because the case has no merit but rather that the funds are inadequate. In relation to that situation, I find it rather strange that that particular source of funds, which is under the control of the legal profession, is strangled and is not allowed to flow freely into the legal aid coffers.

         I will now refer to the interest being derived from solicitors' trust accounts. In all States, except Tasmania, there exists legislation which allocates the disbursement of interest collected, at a lower rate, I might say. The banks are getting some profit out of that, too. That is collected into a guarantee fund. Part of that fund, in the first instance, certainly is allocated to legal aid. However, what I call the mistakes by the black sheep of the profession are also compensated out of that fund. When solicitors, due to fraudulent behaviour, have caused losses to people who have put funds with solicitors for investment, or simply in their trust accounts, these defalcations are made good out of the interest on solicitors' trust accounts.

         These and other matters are of great importance. The attempts of the profession to retain all manner of privileges, which can be described only as restraint of trade, make it imperative in my view that the Trade Practices Commission should be given the power to supervise the legal profession and to hold it to account. Other examples of why I think that is absolutely essential include the advertising of fees. We are told that there should be a free market in all goods and services to get the best service at competitive rates, yet there is clearly no knowledge on the part of consumers when it comes to legal services. Even where it is permitted for solicitors to advertise their fees—and barristers certainly are not permitted to do so at this stage—there seems to be a cultural barrier. I have yet to see widespread advertising of comparative fees and costs by members of the legal profession.

         Another area is the contribution that judges can make. Clearly, increased case management by judges is needed to ensure that issues are identified early, that documents and evidence are provided quickly, and that the delays of the court are not used as a tactical measure to starve out the less financial party to a dispute. I am glad to say that during the inquiries of which I have been a member various representatives of the judiciary have expressed willingness to engage in more decisive case management, and are in fact already doing so. Finally, there is the alternative that our legal system should offer to people who are faced with a dispute or who feel they have suffered an injustice: the mediation process, which should be fostered as an alternative to the legal profession.

         —No. One can find 50,000 definitions for ministerial responsibility, and Senator Hill knows it. The one I like and support, because I think it is the one that is the most sensible, is the one I quoted yesterday which was espoused by Waterford. But I will go over the ground again. In a modern parliamentary democracy—and I had this view in opposition—the only sensible, reasonable and responsible definition of ministerial responsibility is this: a Minister has to behave with propriety and responsibly, in the true sense of the word—in other words, those two conditions, as I said yesterday, cover things like deliberately misleading the House on an issue which, of course, is an instant hanging offence—and a Minister has to behave competently.

         The charge of which I was accused yesterday was in fact of being deficient in not sitting down and reading this particular tender document. I have just discovered that I signed seven determinations last week for about $50 million worth of roads contracts. I will not go back and second-guess and sit down like a corporate secretary and read all those again.

         But, to conclude, a Minister is rightly held responsible for the administrative failure of a department when there has been a systemic failure of administration while he has been the Minister and he has failed to correct it. For example, where a report from the Auditor-General indicates that there is a serious failure in the department, it has been brought to public attention, and the Minister does nothing about it; he should correct it.

         But I will tell honourable senators what the facts are in the midst of all this hyperbole—and everyone is having a great time with this. I came into this portfolio three years ago as a junior Minister in its transport side. In the whole time that I was in that portfolio there was not the slightest evidence to me, or indeed the public, of any systemic failure. Furthermore, it is a matter of fact that, not in terms of process but in terms of the advice I received from the department, that period has resulted in successful massive changes in shipping, aviation, road and rail transport that have provided enormous benefit for this country and will provide significantly more in the next three-year program in transport.

         When I got into the telecommunications side of the portfolio, under difficult circumstances last year, we processed a mass of legislation through the House, set up spectrum management authorities and set up the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Again, I had no reason to believe that there was any administrative breakdown in my department at all, and the public record shows that.

         The first occasion on which I became aware that there was a serious problem of administration in the broadcasting division of my department was last Friday. I immediately took action. I asked the secretary to the department to commence an investigation into that breakdown. I have now moved to set up an inquiry into that. The investigation has been going on since Friday. I took instant action the minute I knew that there had been a breakdown; the first one that has occurred since I have become a Minister in this portfolio. Having done that, we are now moving to set up an inquiry. The inquiry will be constituted by a qualified person independent of the Public Service.

         As I said before, all those po-faced hypocrites who sit over there casting aspersions would not know because they have never been Ministers. I have no doubt, having talked to some of my colleagues, that if they ever become Ministers—and I have to say that that prospect is looking more and more unlikely with every passing minute—they will know that sensible procedures are adopted in order to handle the paper flow through a Minister's office. In this case those procedures were not followed. I found out that they were not being followed last week. I have instituted an inquiry. Let us get to the real nub of this issue.

Thirdly, the institute itself approached the Government about this matter at a time when the Government was considering the national strategy on violence against women, which deals with such issues and such programs. Fourthly, the chairman of the institute, Justice John Clarke of the New South Wales Supreme Court, has applauded the Prime Minister's announcement that the institute would receive funds to develop the program, and he made that comment publicly in the

That is my problem, too; there is no deposit. He was then told, `Well, the Government is fixing that. They are bringing in amendments to make sure there is a deposit. Are you going to support that?'

By simple definition—and Senator Alston is supposed to be a lawyer—how could we assert that we were introducing amendments which were in conflict with the Attorney-General's advice I tabled in the chamber yesterday?

         The cold hard facts are that it is clear that the departmental officers who were involved in preparing these tenders in the way that I assumed they would—in the same successful way as they had for the third mobile licence for which we got $140 million just a few months ago, and for television licences and radio licences, all of which required these deposits—did not do so. That matter is now going to be investigated by an independent investigator from outside the Public Service. The key question is this: if Senator Alston's problem is the deposit and if the Government has moved, as we have, to quickly address that in a way which still preserves the legal rights of the successful bidders to pursue their bids if they can—if that is his problem and we are fixing it—why will he not support it?

         —I am very happy to do so. The general purpose and function of the joint facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar were, of course, described by the then Prime Minister in his statement to Parliament on 22 November 1988, but it may be very useful, in a post-Cold War context, to explain again their continuing importance. The original impetus to establish Nurrungar during the Cold War was, of course, to provide early warning of ballistic missile attacks and that vital role did help to prevent nuclear war. While the threat of nuclear confrontation is now hugely reduced as a result of recent developments, hundreds of ICBMs with thousands of nuclear warheads do still exist, so the original early warning role of the defence support system remains, to that extent, entirely valid.

         The end of the Cold War has brought new international and regional uncertainties of which we are all acutely conscious, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them, such as shorter range missiles. During the Gulf War, Nurrungar played a very large part in helping to defend civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia from attack by such missiles. Maintaining this capability will help to deter the proliferation of ballistic missiles around the world, including in our own region.

         Moreover, the facilities make a vital contribution to the increasingly important post-Cold War agenda of collective security. Nurrungar and our other facility at Pine Gap continue to make a really quite critical contribution in monitoring and verifying the arms control agreements which have transformed the strategic landscape in recent years. A clear opportunity now exists to build international cooperation to prevent war. The US, Russia and others, including Australia, have been exploring in recent times a global protection system, with one option being to share data on ballistic missile launches. Nurrungar would be a key element in such a system.

         At the regional level, Nurrungar may yet have a further significant role. Australia may conceivably come to rely more than ever on this facility if a ballistic missile threat were to develop in our neighbourhood. On the other hand, the early warning capabilities of Nurrungar offer possibilities for new orders of cooperation with direct benefit to our neighbours' own security. The monitoring of arms control agreements, the discouraging of ballistic missile proliferation, the probabilities for defence of cities against missile attack and opportunities for new forms of regional cooperation are all on our agenda in the post-Cold War era.

         I think it is also worth making clear that Australians are fully integrated into all aspects of operations at Nurrungar, because there continue to be claims to the contrary. Of the approximately 450 personnel at the site, slightly more than half—240 at the moment—are Australian. Australians also fill at least two of the four crew commander positions—at the moment they fill three—and a RAAF wing commander is the deputy commander of the facility. We participate fully in all aspects of the operation of the facilities, including tasking of them, to provide information in Australia's particular security interests.

         Finally, those like Senator Spindler who argue, however sincerely, for the closing down of these facilities have yet to explain how world security or regional security would be better without them. The Government has absolutely no doubts in this regard. We need to be prepared to back up our strenuous efforts internationally to achieve and develop support for arms control measures by demonstrating that we are also willing to support active measures, such as the missile launch detection capability served by Nurrungar, which help to guarantee compliance with international arms control obligations and to promote non-proliferation objectives.

         The Government also recognises the increased opportunities for the United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role in securing peace and enhancing collective security in the post-Cold War era. We have encouraged the UN to enhance its collective security role, including through peacekeeping and preventive diplomacy. Again, the joint facilities support these and all our other initiatives to secure a more lasting and durable peace in the post-Cold War era.

But these are not isolated international examples. This year, five Australian films gained official selection at the Cannes film festival, which is being commented on around the world by a number of media commentators as being an outstanding performance by the Australian film industry. It is certainly not doing Australia's image over there any harm.

         Two Australian artists went to the Venice Biennale, which is the showcase for international contemporary art. Those two artists, Jenny Watson and Hany Armanious, are not just good artists but are artists at the cutting edge of modern high-tech art. They have a significant capacity to change the way that Australians are perceived internationally. For those who have had the opportunity to make intelligent decisions about where they go overseas, this might be a significant advantage. I could cite a number of examples in the areas of ballet, Aboriginal art, et cetera, but I have no intention of doing that because the list is inexhaustible.

They are not. The criticisms are that they thought this was going to be a disaster because a beauty contest was not entered into. In all the examination I did of this issue, and it was extensive, before the Bill came into the House last year, if on balance I had come to the conclusion that a government or a government agency was a better test of a company's financial viability in the marketplace, I would have gone for that merit-based system. If I had come to the conclusion that a merit-based system was better in terms of not burying the process in litigation, I would have done that. The classic example is the third commercial television licence in Perth; but there are hundreds of examples, not just here but around the world.

         The difficulty with merit-based processes, with respect, is this: does a price-based process, on balance, on the records that one can look at, produce a better return for the asset? The honest answer to this is yes, it does. Does a price-based process, at the very least, produce as good a result in estimating the future financial viability of a company as a government or government agency? The answer to that question is, on balance, yes, it does. It certainly produces no worse a result, because there have been failures in both.

It ended with the Minister receiving direct official advice from the department of the Attorney-General that his Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was acting unlawfully—advice which he then ignored and was censured for ignoring in the House of Representatives—and he was called upon to resign. Of course, the Minister did not resign. All I can say is that nothing hangs on these inquiries being made because the speculation was right across the board.

It is an absolute furphy; it is claptrap. I took a decision in January to intervene on this matter that Senator Baume has just asked about. I took that decision based on one very simple premise: that this Parliament had decided that there would be a national satellite system providing the major television coverage for pay TV for Australia, and that as part of that coverage there would be a role for our national broadcaster as part of that national pay system. That was one of the major issues. I thought the Senate would have supported my action on this because it was the Senate that insisted on this being done.

         I do not believe that it is useful for Senator Newman to jump the gun, anticipate all sorts of problems and draw very long bows indeed. The reason that the Health Insurance Commission legislation has to be introduced is precisely because we need a new database and a new program to deal with this payment. It is not covered under the Medicare arrangements, and will be quite separate from them. So I think it is considerably mischievous of Senator Newman to make the associations that she has.

        I refer to the question on notice from Senator Boswell regarding the level of access to RAS in Queensland
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Support for farmers under the Rural Adjustment Scheme takes account of the realities of operating a rural business in Australia. Over time there will be movement of producers into and out of the industry and the RAS is aimed at smoothing this processes so that the competitiveness and efficiency of the industry is not reduced.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consequently RAS support is targeted at those farmers who have long-term prospects for profitability, but who require some short-term support to improve their productivity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the exceptional circumstances provisions, support is available for carry-on purposes when a farmer is facing difficulty due to certain exceptional circumstances. The recent national allocation of $50.6m is directed at producers suffering hardship from the exceptional circumstances of the prolonged drought in parts of Australia and by the depressed prices for wool.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In Queensland, under the exceptional circumstances provisions, additional Commonwealth funds of $11.3m have been provided under the RAS to provide interest subsidies of up to 100% for farmers
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        this $11.3m consists of $6.3m for specialist wool growers and $5.0m for drought. This is in addition to a further $9.5m provided to Qld for drought since Sept last year.

        In answer to the Senator's specific questions, I can advise him as follows:

         1. I have been advised by the RAS administrators in Qld that for the period 1 July 1992 to 31 March 1993, the approval rate for all RAS applications is close to 65%, whilst the approval rate under the existing Special Drought Assistance is 95%

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         2. The Senator's question assumes that if 40% of producers are not receiving assistance, then they will all leave the industry. I should point out that people are assessed as ineligible for RAS for two principal reasons.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        One is that they have the capacity to support their debts and operations out of their own income or assets—a situation in which it is inappropriate for the Commonwealth to be providing subsidies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The other is that they are found not to be profitable in the long-term. In this case, farmers may be eligible for Farm Household Support, which provides support to farmers either while they arrange the sale of their property, or supports those farmers who believe they have a future in the industry but are unable to obtain further commercial support. Farmers who move out of farming may also be eligible for the increased re-establishment grant of up to $45 000.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         3 &amp; 4. The number of producers who will be assisted under the package will depend on the number of applicants who are assessed as eligible and the level of interest rate subsidy offered to each successful applicant. Funding was provided to each State Government on the basis of an independent assessment of need by the independent RAS Advisory Council after consultation between the Commonwealth and each State Government.

         5. Producers who are assessed as eligible for Farm Household Support will not also be eligible for RAS support. However any producer who has previously received RAS support may be eligible for Farm Household Support if they cease to be eligible for RAS.

         6. It is difficult to forecast just how many producers will actually receive interest rate subsidies for the first time under the exceptional circumstances provisions. However, Queensland report that an increased number of producers received assistance last year for the first time and they expect this trend to continue.

        Today in Question Time I asked the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), by way of a supplementary question, whether he was aware that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet received similar high-level advice, as his department did, of the prospect of collapsible bids corrupting the tender process, and that this advice was received after tenders opened but in plenty of time before the close of tenders to allow this potential shambles to be corrected. Maybe the Minister was too busy chatting with his colleagues to listen. I then asked whether the Prime Minister's department informed the Department of Transport and Communications of this advice that it had received. I will go through it slowly for you.

         Senator Collins has told the Senate on numerous occasions that he was not at fault because his department did not tell him. But he has also told us that he did not want to intervene. So it follows that, even if his department had told him, he still would not have done anything. As Senator Baume has said, he did not want to know, so it was irrelevant whether or not he was told. He had already made it clear to the department that he did not want to know about these things. He wanted the department to handle it so he did not have his hands dirtied. So whether he was told or not is no defence, given that he has already stated very clearly that he did not want to intervene.

         In other words, even if he had been told, he would not have done anything about it. That is the problem. Even if he had been told, he already told them that he was not going to do anything. So, at that point in time he had created the very opportunity for this situation to occur. By sticking his head in the sand, by saying, `I don't want to know what is going on in my department in case I get blamed for it', he has created a situation where this nation has been laid open to spivs and con men to perpetrate frauds on the public and where we are an international laughing stock—all because he did not want to assume the ministerial responsibility that comes with the red leather.

His contemptuous treatment of this Senate today matches the contemptuous nature in which he has dealt with his ministerial responsibility.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Colston this day relating to the Nurrungar defence facility.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister offered a number of reasons why Australia should continue the so-called joint facility arrangement at Nurrungar. I say `so-called' advisedly because I believe that it is well and truly on record that the base is under effective United States control. The Australian personnel, including the deputy commander, play an extremely subservient role, and there are a number of cases on record where not only were we not consulted before a decision was made and were not involved in the decision but also, very often, we were not even told about it. I shall return to that point shortly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the reasons that the Minister advanced as to why Nurrungar, in its present form and organisation, is still useful is the contribution it can make to collective global security. I am quite ready to admit that this may well be a useful contribution but, if that is so, it should not be under the control of one particular nation; not the US or even the Australian nation, but the United Nations. Australia could do nothing better than to further and strengthen the role of the United Nations and its current peacekeeping efforts and the growing responsibility it accepts in that area. Australia should transfer control and supervision of Nurrungar to the United Nations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other reason offered by the Minister was regional security. If regional security is a concern, surely it should be under the control of the Australian Government rather than a government that is rapidly withdrawing its forces and its concerns from this particular region.

         I return to the point I made before. It is quite clear that the United States has effective control of Nurrungar and if it is true, as the Minister says, that there is an early warning role against nuclear attack from other quarters of the globe, by other nations, then the truth is that Australian citizens are likely to be the target of a first attack. If people wish to launch a nuclear conflict—a conflict that involves the United States—the first thing they are likely to do is to knock out United States' communications facilities. That should be very obvious, as has always been acknowledged.

         The reality is that our Government is exposing Australian citizens to that particular risk in the potential conflict which we would not originate, which we would not know about, and which we certainly would not have a part in. It is for all those reasons that we should review our participation at Nurrungar and should either abolish it or radically change its organisational structure.

         The truth is that the Australian taxpayer currently contributes $30 million to the upkeep of the Nurrungar base. My question to the Minister is: what do we get for it except risk to Australian citizens? Not only do we get risk to Australian citizens, we are also apparently prepared to accept the very

         At a time when the Government is moving very rapidly towards establishing a more independent form of government for Australia—a republic, which the Australian Democrats support as a general principle—it seems extremely curious that we are prepared to give up effective sovereignty in this particular way. I will not raise the question of economic sovereignty and the way we open Australia up to overseas imports.

         Accepted with modification. While direct monitoring of kangaroos is a State Government responsibility, the Commonwealth sees itself as having a role to assist the States, where feasible. The high cost of aerial surveys already places heavy demands on the resources of State agencies and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS). Rather than to arbitrarily assign survey frequencies, surveys should be more frequent in States where harvests take a high percentage of the population and less frequent where harvests take low percentages. Annual surveys in the eastern States and triennial surveys in Western Australia are seen as sufficient to ensure kangaroo conservation.

This is, currently only the case in Tasmania. Tasmania supports this recommendation, however the other States are generally opposed.

         (14 and 15) Accepted in principle. The Government agrees that there is scope for expanding export control over kangaroo products and sees inspections at fleshing works to fall within the responsibilities of the National Wildlife Protection Unit (NWPU). The issue of controls on the export of native wildlife had been the subject of comprehensive reviews of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. Recommendations contained in this review together with those of the Senate Select Committee will form the basis of operations for the NWPU. The development of uniform containers for export and the process of sealing would however require more detailed investigation along with other alternatives such as tattooing to identify individual skins. The NWPU will give a high priority to investigations to consider the most cost effective means of preventing illegal exports.

While the Government agrees that the most humane means of harvesting kangaroos should be employed it notes that no currently approved export programs involve poisoning. The Government also notes that the determination of control methods outside the export harvest is a State responsibility. As Tasmania currently has no approved export program, the issue of wallaby poisoning is a matter to be decided by the Tasmanian Government. The Government does however support research being undertaken by Tasmania, or in association with Tasmania (under the proposed Kangaroo Research and Survey Supplement) to quantify the impacts of 1080 or any other poison on wallabies in areas where it is currently used.

          It is interesting to see that recently in Canberra our Governor-General fell foul of the animal welfare lobby in dealing with his problems with kangaroos. For some reason or other, the legislation in the ACT seems to be a little different from that of the other States and from the committee's recommendations. A reading of the Governor-General's problems shows that he certainly got into hot water, if not kangaroo tail soup, when he suggested that he would cull the kangaroos and have a kangaroo feast afterwards. That comment certainly brought upon him the wrath of some animal liberation groups.

The multiplying of the kangaroos at such a rate makes it easy to understand why we have such a problem all around Australia. As my colleagues Senator Cooney and, particularly, Senator Burns, who is chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee, would know, the overabundance of kangaroos was manifesting itself when we had inspections around Australia to look at the effects of the drought on the farming communities and what could be done about it.

          European settlement and the provision of more pasture and water have combined to vastly increase the number of kangaroos in Australia—to huge numbers. Figures in the report of five years ago—I suspect they would be much higher now—indicate that the number of kangaroos in Australia was then reaching 32 million. The effect of kangaroos on the degradation of land through their competing for pasture with the few sheep that are now left is quite obvious when you move into the back blocks of the western districts of Queensland and New South Wales.

I cannot understand why everybody in Tasmania, particularly Ms Peg Putt, is getting so uptight about the method of shooting kangaroos down there. After all is said and done, the regulations they were bringing forward were to limit shooting of wallabies to certain times of the year and to tag the animals, which is exactly what happens in Queensland, the State from which Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator MacGibbon come. It has been going on for many years up there. It is Queensland's way of controlling the numbers of kangaroos being culled. Even so, we still see emotions running high, with people writing to the papers and getting uptight about the killing of our national emblem. I can understand that but, as I said earlier, killing kangaroos, as opposed to cows or sheep, for consumption seems to engender much more discussion amongst certain groups in our community.

If the fuss and bother that has occurred in Canberra over a few kangaroos at the Governor-General's residence is any evidence of the feeling in the community, the culling of kangaroos in Australia will always be something people will get upset about. I hope this report, and the responses that have come through at last, will quieten some of the more extreme elements of the animal liberation lobby in our community.

I am a strong supporter of the Australian National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour, Sydney, and of the extent to which it can be made available, through newsletters and membership, to Australians in every State. Its predecessor, in Port Adelaide, which was directed by the national museum's current director, Dr Kevin Fewster, is another important resource and is an excellent predecessor to this wider canvas that we now see in Darling Harbour.

          This annual report is very significant because it is the first substantial report. During 1991-92 the museum was officially opened—one of the last acts of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. During President Bush's visit to Australia in January last year, he made a speech at the museum and the contribution to the museum by the United States was officially received and acknowledged by the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and also by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson.

I am sure that that is in hand, but on my own visits to the National Maritime Museum I have always asked questions of the director and other executive officers about the financial viability of the centre.

         In speaking to the erratum to the annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission, I am glad to have the opportunity of drawing the Senate's attention to the fact that tourism is now one of Australia's largest and fastest growing industries. This is borne out by the following statement in the managing director's report:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Australia moved back into strong, sustained growth during 1991/92, with short-term arrivals growing by 13 per cent to a record 2.5 million.
        </para>
        <para>
         On page 10 I noted that the Australian Tourist Commission's prime task was to market Australia internationally as a tourist destination. In fact, on that same page it is stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Australia has been rated as the most desirable holiday destination in Japan, the US, Singapore and Sweden.

         On page 13 the report goes on to state:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Tourism's developing relationship with the aviation industry and the environment emerged as important policy areas for the unit outside its core planning and evaluation role.
        </para>
        <para>
         The aviation part of our tourism industry is something which I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate. Successive federal governments have for decades promised Brisbane an international airport befitting the city's stature as the international gateway to the State's tourist attractions. But unfortunately this has been put off time and again. When we think about the growth of tourism in Australia, we need to recognise that Queensland is a very important tourist State and the money that comes from tourism is of great help to the economy. In view of this, I think it is very important that the Government does do something as soon as it can to help get the new airport facility built. An editorial in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Courier-Mail
         </emphasis>
         the other day said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first and most damning observation to be made is that the present international terminal is a disgrace. It is cramped and substandard compared with similar terminals in other States.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is something we would expect to see in the Third World rather than in a thriving capital city. Indeed, Queenslanders have often complained that Brisbane international airport is little more than a shed compared with the world-class domestic terminal that is sited across the runway.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As Queensland depends heavily on its reputation as a popular tourist destination, it is very important that something be done. When we realise that Queensland's economy is set to lose $27 million in visitor revenue unless the international airport is completed before its scheduled opening date of January 1996, it is very important that action be taken.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Apparently, the main stumbling block to a revised schedule is that the Federal Government will have a shortfall of $8 million. However, when we consider that Queensland's economy stands to gain at least $27 million from an expedited completion date, it is hard to understand why the Federal Government hesitates at all. The Federal Government is, in effect, turning down a 350 per cent return to the economy. When we acknowledge the fact, as I said earlier, that tourism is one of this country's largest and fastest growing industries and may indeed hold the key to an economic recovery, surely it should be one of the main priorities of any government at this time.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In 1991 alone, tourist expenditure in Australia amounted to $25 billion and tourism's contribution to GDP exceeded 5 per cent. Tourism accounts for approximately 450,000 jobs, either directly or indirectly. Indeed, some 1,000 jobs are likely to be created should the Government see fit to fast-track this project. I ask the question: how can the Government afford not to encourage this industry? The continuing growth in our tourism industry has contributed to the fact that Queensland has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in Australia. The fact that our economy has such a large tourism base largely accounts for this.

          When we talk about tourism matters, I always indicate with some pride that the airport at Cairns in Far North Queensland is a great example of what can be done when local people are given the opportunity to direct how an international airport should be built and operated. Indeed, the international airport at Cairns was constructed by the Cairns Port Authority, a semi-government authority made up principally of prominent people in business and government in Cairns. The authority constructed that airport many years ago now and Cairns has not looked back since.

          There has been enormous tangible benefit to Australian tourism from the building of that airport. Cairns is now the tourist gateway to Australia. It has many more international flights than, for example, Adelaide and the number of flights continues to increase all the time. This has occurred because the tourist people in Cairns have supported the airport as well as the other infrastructure and development that needs to be implemented to attract overseas tourists to our land.

These established businesses are now looking to expand their activities. I know of a tourist operator involved in whitewater rafting who is now taking people into New Guinea. He is even going further afield into the Pacific islands. This business, which is all generated from Cairns, is assisted by the fact that the Cairns airport is so good and so popular.

It would have benefited quite substantially from the additional money that we would have made available for advertising and promotion, particularly in Europe and America from where we attract a lot of tourists to far North Queensland.

          —I was not going to speak on this report, but I find the remarks of Senator Macdonald rather hypocritical. On other occasions Senator Macdonald has spoken very strongly in favour of the building of the Tully-Millstream power station; in his speech a few moments ago he talked about the excellent business which has been developed in Cairns for whitewater rafting on the Tully River. This activity, which employs quite a large number of people, will be totally destroyed if that power station is built. Senator Macdonald then went on to say that tourist operators in Cairns are taking visitors from Cairns to experience whitewater rafting in New Guinea. Of course, the reason they have had to use other rivers is that, if he had his way, he would close off this option.

          I have rafted down the Tully River. It is an absolutely magnificent experience and one that should be protected. Quite a large number of people are engaged in giving tourists an experience that they can gain in no other way. People are employed not only to operate the rafting but also to make videos of tourists' experiences and to provide meals and transport. As such, this activity really needs to be looked after.

         The significant thing in this report of the Australian War Memorial is the reference to the 50th anniversary of the opening of the museum in 1941. I will deal with the routine part of the report first. The most significant part is in the new acquisitions list which includes the acquisition of a P40-E aircraft for the collection. The museum has sought this type of aircraft for many years because of its great Australian military relevance. It is a worthy addition to the collection of memorabilia in the museum.

          Mr Deputy President, you will remember the problems we had in the Senate estimates committee hearings, both the main estimates and the supplementary estimates, where the $550,000 cost of this aircraft was to be paid for in part by disposing, in quite a reprehensible way, of an equally historic aircraft. It is not without amusement that I see the statement in the report:

         I am sure that slipped past the editor of this report. It is quite wrong to be disposing of what is appropriate material in the collection at present. That is a matter we will raise at one of the estimates hearings in the near future.

          The Senate should reflect on the great achievement in setting up the Australian War Memorial. It is a memorial that in my experience is unique in the world. It is a very fine memorial to those Australians, men and women, who served this country in all the wars that we have been involved in. The memorial has a budget of $15 million. The great difficulty that the museum faces, and which it refers to very politely in the report, is shortage of funds. There is nothing new about that. Governments of all persuasions since the museum was opened have failed to come up with adequate funding. But, as each year passes, the collection gets larger, the responsibilities of the museum and its obligations thereby increase and so the gap gets wider between what is required and what is provided.

          One sees that critically in the curatorial services and their inability to maintain the collection. Some of the material in that collection now goes back over 100 years. It requires highly skilled curators with sophisticated techniques to keep it in a condition whereby it will survive not only for another 100 years but for times beyond that. The memorial also needs considerable storage space. This report does refer once more to the difficulties of inadequate storage and the problems that that brings.

          The other great difficulty that comes from lack of funds is the inability to change displays. Whether it is an art gallery, a museum or a memorial, to maintain public interest one must be able to rotate a collection. The actual collection in a facility like the Australian War Memorial is many, many times the number of exhibits that are on display at any one time.

          The Australian War Memorial is an institution which I think attracts more visitors than any other similar institution in Australia. There is a huge throughput of Australians and overseas visitors going through the war memorial. As the war memorial report says, the system works against getting repeat visits from visitors because of its financial inability to change the displays that it would like to.

          Only about 10 days ago, I was fortunate to be in France for the 75th anniversary celebrations for the battle of Villers Bretonneux. While I was there I met the director of the Historiale de la Guerre, the new museum at Peronne. It was very interesting to see what is being done there with respect to new display techniques. It is a great pity that because of shortage of funds the Australian War Memorial, which actually loans some material to that museum, cannot avail itself of the modern display techniques, including modern videos and the simple format of the displays that are being used in France at present in that museum.

         I wish to speak briefly to the Anti-Dumping Authority annual report and in particular advert to page 11 of the report which provides a brief run-down on the legislative amendments made to the anti-dumping legislation last year. One achievement that we can record is the reduction of time in the prima facie decision stage, which came down from 35 to 25 days.

          That was rather disappointing. Originally, the Australian Democrats had an amendment before the Senate to reduce it to five days and the Opposition had a similar amendment. That amendment was passed in the Senate, but when it went to the House of Representatives the Government rejected it. When it came back the second time before the Senate, the Australian Democrats were deserted by the coalition. We stood alone on the question of the five days and obviously that amendment was defeated.

          It was an important amendment for Australian industries which are being hit to leg by a rising tide of cheap imports, as we have again seen demonstrated by the recent balance of payments figures, the worst for three years. It is important that we make it easier for Australian industries to fight the dumping of cheap goods. Other countries are doing it. The United States accepts a prima facie judgment and when it finds an industry is facing what they call `disruptively high levels of imports', the United States authorities do not hesitate to slap immediately emergency countervailing tariffs of up to 100 per cent on these imports to make sure that their industries do not go down the drain.

          We do not seem to have that same concern. At the moment it seems to me that the Anti-Dumping Authority should be renamed as the `importers authority' because it helps importers. It helps people who compete with Australian products because it is taking a very sharp stance against Australian producers.

          Another aspect that needs to be looked at is the interpretation of the legislation by the Anti-Dumping Authority. The provisions of the legislation require that an industry shows that not only are the products being dumped at prices below their production cost in their own country, and not only is damage being done in general terms to the Australian industry, but also that a causal relationship is established between the damage that the applicant has experienced and the dumped goods.

          Two celebrated cases, Caford Castors in Melbourne and Greenseas cannery in Eden on the New South Wales coast, were able to show the first two, but the authority rejected their claim for the second. I have read some of those reports. It is beyond me how it is possible to say, in general terms, that the industry is suffering damage; yet the applicants are judged not to have shown a direct link between that damage to the general industry which has been linked to the dumped goods and their own particular difficulties, despite the fact that these companies are experiencing a drop in turnover and consequent retrenchments.

          Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know, as we all do, as we have moved around Australia over the last couple of years, particularly in the pre-election period, that people were very concerned about the Government's proposals to reduce tariffs—proposals which, in some instances, the Liberal and National parties agreed with. We do live in a more competitive world and we have to realise that on many occasions tariffs, while they benefit one industry, are quite substantially paid for by another industry.

          When people demand level playing fields, they do not seem to understand that under the anti-dumping and countervailing measures there are proposals to stop goods coming into Australia and being sold at a price lower than their cost of production; or goods and services being sold in Australia that have been subsidised by their government in their country of origin. If we were effectively able to stop those goods coming in with those unfair advantages, a lot of the concern that is expressed about removal of tariffs would dissipate. The coalition recognised that. It had a very good plan to improve the Anti-Dumping Authority to ensure that goods that were coming into Australia unfairly would be stopped and penalised by the imposition of anti-dumping duties.

          In the Fightback proposals, we indicated that we would ensure a fairer trading environment by introducing effective anti-dumping and countervailing procedures. We proposed to reduce the preliminary inquiry period to 65 days, after which provisional measures could be imposed. We would then allow the Australian Customs Service five working days to determine whether a complaint lodged met with formal requirements. The ensuing preliminary inquiry would, in normal circumstances, take a maximum of 60 days and up to another 30 days in exceptional circumstances. Provisional measures would be available after a positive preliminary finding. The preliminary inquiry would be followed by a final inquiry of up to 90 days.

          To ensure that a fully informed decision was made within these time limits, the coalition, if in government, intended to provide adequate resources to both the customs service and the Anti-Dumping Authority.

Hopefully, in the term of the current Parliament, the Government will take up the proposals. I hope that, in its next report, the Anti-Dumping Authority will be able to report that the Government has adopted our proposals and that, as a result, Australian industries are given a much fairer go against subsidised and less-than-cost-of-production imports.

          Honourable senators may remember that last year during Question Time I asked a question about the AHC. I referred to the perceptions in the community that the commission was becoming increasingly remote from the community and from environmental groups. I had heard from environmental groups that significant concern existed about the role of the commission in the regional assessment process. I had also heard that concern existed about the general direction in which the commission was heading; that is, away from more open community involvement and community organisations and towards a greater interface, specifically with the forestry industry. Concern was expressed that the commission was being co-opted by State forestry agencies.

          The commission established a regional assessment group to cope with the increasing workload created by these additional responsibilities. The commission has worked on two major regional assessment projects, one in south-west Western Australia, which has been completed, and one in the East Gippsland region of Victoria. The Western Australian agreement has been criticised by environment groups because it has led to a situation where the State forestry agency has legitimised and entrenched its role in the logging of native hardwood forests. In fact, logging activities in the karri and jarrah forests have increased in intensity since the agreement was finalised. A regional assessment in Tasmania has been proposed. However, I understand that there is very little cooperation with the Tasmanian forestry agency and suspicion from conservation groups in relation to this process has also meant that the process has not got very far.

There is a real perception in the community that the AHC is working more closely with industry and less now with the public. I appreciate that the staff within the AHC are very concerned about this perception and that they recognise that community participation is still highly valued. In fact, the AHC has recently completed two major studies into the enhancement of community participation in the National Estate. But my main concern, I stress, is about government policy, and that concern remains.

         I commend the annual report of the Central Land Council for 1991-92. This 80-page report very comprehensively covers the activities of the Central Land Council. I am certainly one to criticise at times much of the administration of land councils in the Northern Territory, but, as honourable senators will appreciate from my comments in a few minutes on the next two reports, the reports of the Anindilyakwa Land Council and the Tiwi Land Council, and on this one, the report of the Central Land Council, I extend a compliment to those three land councils on the way they have carried out their activities. I will be making far more critical and trenchantly strong remarks about the activities of the Northern Land Council, which I do not hold in high regard at all. I think its report to this chamber is lousy.

          But in looking at this particular report of the Central Land Council, the work that is obviously being undertaken with regard to agreements and attitudes to policy in all aspects is very important on behalf of the people of central Australia. I was very pleased to note the comment on page 61 of the report, where the council gives an analysis or a quick comment on the coalition green paper on Aboriginal affairs by Dr Michael Wooldridge, the then shadow Minister, in June of last year. The paper gave it the same tenure and status that it afforded to a number of other Northern Territory Government, local government and Federal government initiatives in that year. I am certainly aware that the work that is imposed on many of the commissioners is onerous, particularly when they are drawn from a large geographic area.

          In particular, I note that the expenditure and financial statements are unqualified in the auditor's report. I find that very pleasing. I am also pleased to note the special references to the trust administration by the Central Land Council of the royalty trust accounts that it undertakes. The details that are set out on page 79 and 80 of this report properly analyse the trust details on behalf of various trust accounts. Unlike the Northern Land Council, which has omitted these sorts of statements in its report, it is commendable that the Central Land Council has fully met its obligations in this regard. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         For honourable senators and others who may not be familiar with the Aboriginal pronunciation, the Anindilyakwa Land Council was created on Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This is the first annual report of that body. It is interesting to note the following, in the Chairman's opening remarks:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Some of our people here wanted to have their own Land Council because they thought the Northern Land Council was too big to help them personally. They didn't know our culture or our people because they came from different places.
        </para>
        <para>
         This report is unqualified in regard to the financial statements. I commend the Land Council in that regard. It is interesting to note the range of activities that the Land Council has undertaken on behalf of the Aboriginal constituency they represent. It has been, as it acknowledges, involved in negotiations with Telecom, organising telephone services. It has negotiated with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority concerning lighthouses. It is involved in negotiations with BHP, which is very important as the manganese miner, regarding mining agreements. Of course, as anyone would expect from an Aboriginal land council, it is deeply and sincerely involved in discussions about sacred sites, sea closures and other issues. This first report is commendable. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         The Tiwi Land Council is that area of administration that is generally known to many people as encompassing the Bathurst and Melville islands to the north of Darwin. It is also an important small land council and a breakaway group from the Northern Land Council, which has been so controversial and which has obviously not met the aspirations of Aboriginal people. The Tiwi Land Council has been operating for some time. It engages in a number of commercial activities on behalf of Aboriginal people. The report highlights many issues. I wish to comment on three. The first issue is—and I quote from the Chairman's report:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the growing interest and academic success of our younger people at diploma and University access level. Sixty-seven Tiwi students, comprising 4.5 per cent of our population, are studying at tertiary level. . . Ten years ago we recognised the future required proud and secure Tiwi people. The welfare net may save our bodies, but our hopes were drowning. We still have much to do, but there is now evidence of a belief in our future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second issue relates to what the Tiwi Land Council believes to be a census anomaly. The census has identified a declining Tiwi population in the area and the Land Council is taking steps to ascertain what is happening to the population. I note that there are particular illness problems on the Tiwi Islands. Further in the report mention is made of the incidence of kidney disease in the Tiwi Islands and the important work that is going on there by the Menzies School of Health Research.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The third issue that the chairman has drawn to our attention is that of the mining views and the views of others who seek to influence the Tiwi people. Again I quote from the report of the Chairman, Mr Kerinaiua:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . we . . . were very surprised at the determination of non-Tiwi people to tell us what we should do. Stories that our land would sink and disappear or blow-up in an atomic explosion, were told to frighten us. Our visits to existing mineral and sand projects allowed us to see just what goes on.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are important prospects for sandmining on the north of Melville Island and the Tiwi Land Council will have to deal with those matters very intricately, and I know they are doing so very responsibly. It is a pleasure to note the keenness, the determination, of this particular community and the fact that their accounts are unqualified. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         Unlike the comments that I have made, very pleasingly, on the Central Land Council, the Tiwi Islands and Groote Eylandt, this report of the Northern Land Council is very concerning and ought to concern every honourable senator. The activities of the Northern Land Council need almost a royal inquiry. Next week, at the Senate estimates committee hearings, I certainly intend to pursue a number of issues very keenly. The point which requires our most urgent attention is the auditors' report for the year ended 30 June 1992, which is qualified by the following:

         The Northern Land Council needs to be condemned for its profligacy and its total inattention to the proper standards of good administration on behalf of its Aboriginal constituency. It has obviously become a very political and involved organisation. For a number of years it has relied on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and the former Minister, Mr Hand, propping up its annual budgets and throwing more money at the problem rather than seeking decent solutions. I have put three very important issues before Minister Tickner since early this year. The first relates to very severe allegations of rorts of fringe benefits tax by senior management personnel within the land council itself.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Secondly, the trust accounts and mining royalty funds which the Northern Land Council administers on behalf of its own constituency are not even covered in this annual report, other than to get gobbled up as two one-line items in the annual balance sheet. There is no listing of the trust balances as there were previously; there are no statements of income, revenue and expenditure, as should properly be set out in these particular accounts.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The third issue that I have raised with Minister Tickner is the excessive use of consultants to carry out anthropological, legal and administrative functions of the land council. This has amounted to in excess of $1 million in the last year as a proportion of its budget. Many of these consultancies have been going to former employees of the land council who have retired or taken redundancy packages, or who are relatives of senior executives within the organisation. There have been jobs for the boys. There have been all sorts of pay-offs. Certainly, in the Senate estimates committee hearings next week I will be demanding and looking for explanations. I am concerned that, in the comments by the chairman on page 1 of this report, attributed to Galarrwuy Yunupingu, is the statement arising from and following the Mabo decision we all deal with in so many areas. Mr Yunupingu says:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On first hearing the news of Mabo I said the Federal government should quickly negotiate a treaty and implement national land rights. That would be a good start. The alternative is plenty of court cases around Australia, but this is not the best answer.
        </para>
        <para>
         That second paragraph of the chairman's annual statement in the NLC's report highlights how political this organisation has become and how much it has moved away from the good and proper focus that it needs to give for the constituency it should and ought to be serving. The administration and finance of the NLC are a disgrace. The budget blow-out is totally unacceptable and this matter needs a major inquiry at the earliest possible date. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         I bring the 1991-92 annual report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the notice of the Senate because of the outrageous claims it makes in relation to government education policy. The report quite correctly notes that the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 has been amended to implement the policies outlined in the report. However, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and his department then go on to claim that the changes to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act 1988 increase the autonomy and flexibility of our universities. It is important for the Senate to know that this statement is complete rubbish and, in fact, the opposite has occurred.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The changes to this Act which the report refers to actually has resulted in all universities in Australia being placed under the direct control of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. This completely bypasses the role of the States which are constitutionally responsible for our universities. Up until 1987 there was a reasonable degree of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States on policy formation for the universities. This State authority has been eroded severely since 1987 and now has been eliminated altogether.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The report reveals an even more disturbing change. There is a big difference between the funding of the universities of Australia through the appropriation of Parliament and funding them through ministerial determination. Under the new arrangement, the appropriation is not subject to scrutiny. There is no debate in the Parliament and amendment is no longer possible. Under a ministerial determination, the whole decision is left up to one person's discretion—the Minister's.

          I also point out to the Senate that this ministerial determination has not as yet been presented to the Parliament and that universities are still obviously operating with funding. The question therefore arises: why has the determination, which is a disallowable instrument, not been tabled?  What is the Minister hiding?  Why is public comment being hindered by the Minister's delay in presenting his determination?  In the

        <para font-size="-=2">

         He also says that the new legislation is:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         divisive, can wreck universities' autonomy, will eliminate the states' role and put unnecessary power in the Minister's hands. It has the potential to be an insensitive, centralised and dangerous power. The universities in Australia are too important to be placed under the ministerial thumb.
        </para>

         signed by seven professors of the Australian National University, including one of its founders, Sir Mark Oliphant. It is therefore clear that, contrary to the claims of this report, the higher education sector has lost autonomy and flexibility under the policies of this ALP Government.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government is continuing to centralise control of the higher education sector, and our universities are losing their autonomy and their independence. As higher education funding now stands in Australia, the Minister of the day has the power to determine how much funding each university will be allocated and the Minister will base his determination on a set of criteria which universities have met through his insidious profiling process.

          The only real scrutiny the Australian Parliament has over the higher education funding sector is in the global amount for the entire sector. This means that the universities may be forced to abandon their own research and teaching agendas and follow the social and economic vision of the Labor Government.

         It is with pleasure that I rise to speak to the annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for 1991-92. ATSIC has done a very credible job in the time that it has been established. It now has the bipartisan support of the Liberal and National parties. Initially, we were a little concerned at the establishment of this commission but have acknowledged its worth and support it.

          In speaking to another related report yesterday, I mentioned that the commission has now recommended changes to the Government which will, in effect, take on board many of the policies which we proposed for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission prior to the last election. I am very pleased to see that ATSIC has adopted those proposals and recommended them to the Government, which is also intending to adopt most of those major proposals and reforms.

         The commission has done good work. It is not perfect, but then none of us are. I look forward to a continuing role for the commission and an even more progressive adoption of the work and the policies that it has set out to implement. One of the aims of the commission—there are several—is to promote the development of self-management and self-sufficiency among Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait islanders. That role is a very important one for the commission.

          I also note that one of the roles of ATSIC is to ensure coordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait islanders by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments. I am very pleased to say that the Australian Local Government Association is working with ATSIC to enhance the role of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders with local government.

         I think we are all desperately anxious to overcome many of the disadvantages that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people suffer. There is very widespread support within the Australian community to improve the health, education and housing disadvantages that face many Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders.

          I issue a warning to the Government and also to ATSIC. I ask them to look carefully at the fact that a lot of the programs that ATSIC and the Government become involved in do not seem to be nearly well enough explained. I regret to say that a lot of things that are done without proper explanation and proper implementation—there is a lot of mismanagement of a lot of money that is allocated for Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander affairs—are causing a real backlash among what I might call white Australians. I wish to raise this now for the benefit of the Government and ATSIC so that they are aware of it.

         There is much in this report of the Automotive Industry Authority that we can be pleased about. The quality of cars produced in Australia is judged to be equal to that produced overseas. The price that we have to pay here for the six-seater family car is approximately equal to the prices that are charged, for instance, in the United States. Our exports in the automotive industry are up by eight per cent.

          However, there is also another story. Table 2.5 of the report shows that from June 1988 to June 1992 imports of passenger vehicles rose from 65,000 units in 1988 to 147,000 units in 1992, an increase of 82,000 units—over 100 per cent. Table 25 in Appendix 1 shows that during the same period 10,756 jobs were lost in the industry. The accelerating trend of imports in recent years is highlighted by the import figures for the period 1991 to 1992 when there was an increase of 23,698 units. During the same period—the link is very clear—the producers of cars, the assemblers of cars and specialist component producers shed 5,113 jobs.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         When jobs are shed because of increased productivity, in one way we can be pleased about that so long as we ensure that provision is made for retraining and relocation of the people who are affected. However, when jobs are lost to imports, despite the fact that a level of prices and quality has been reached which on the face of it makes us competitive, I believe this calls for a second look at our policy as it relates to the car industry.
        </para>
        <para>
         We should be very cognisant of the fact that this is one industry in which the Government has decided to intervene. We have a plan, statistics and a policy so that we can monitor what is happening. This report is extremely important and deserves further consideration. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       I will briefly go through this motion. Basically, paragraph (a)(i) states that the wool industry is in the worst situation since wool production began in Australia nearly 200 years ago. In fact, each woolgrower today is losing approximately $30,000 per year. The people and towns that rely on individual woolgrowers, especially those in areas where nothing but wool can be produced, such as some pastoral areas of Australia—some pastoral areas can run cattle, but some are limited to producing wool as they cannot run cattle or grow cash crops—are in a very extreme financial situation.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I make particular mention of the towns and industries that service those areas. If the woolgrower does not survive or make a dollar, neither will the corner store, the ever decreasing number of doctors, nurses or pharmacists, the small business people who service and sell machinery or the supply stores in those remote communities. Everyone in those areas will suffer badly.

        When debating this motion we must recognise what the wool industry has done since its inception in Australia. Not only has it supplied massive amounts of income tax to the Treasury but also it has employed people, and provided an opportunity for dealers to sell their machinery and service people to sell their services. We have to recognise that when looking at establishing a system for the future. That is one reason why we have to recognise the woolgrowers and help them to survive the situation that they are now in.

        I, like most woolgrowers, and everyone else in Australia believe that there is still a long-term future for the wool industry in Australia. In the last 40 years I have known at least three sharp downturns in the wool industry. Each time, the industry has revived and prospered and then prepared itself for the time when wool prices again drop. It happens in most service industries and the other industries that keep Australia going. Successive governments have recognised this by making special contributions or allowances available when they occur. It happens to all industries.

There is no need—it will not do anything for the industry—for political point scoring. We have to move forward in a united way because this problem will require more than a six-month solution; I am looking at a five- to seven-year solution, if not longer.

        I have twice asked Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to come to Western Australia to address the growers. I know that he talks to the peak bodies of primary industry around Australia. It would help if he spoke to growers person to person so that they could hear what he has to say and he could hear first-hand what they have to say. Amongst other things, woolgrowers need some personal commitment to, and understanding of, their problems as well as financial help in these extreme circumstances. I am very disappointed that, as at this time, Mr Crean has not seen fit to travel to Western Australia, even though he recently travelled to the drought areas of Queensland, after which he came home and recognised that there is a problem there.

        I will digress for a moment. I have listened to a few first speeches in the last few days. I took particular note of the speech by our new Labor senator from Victoria, Senator Kim Carr, and the speeches of two new members in the House of Representatives—Mr Smith, from Western Australia, and the member for Capricornia. They had the common theme that Australians have shared responsibility and that we share the wealth of Australia.

        I think that principle of sharing wealth with industries remains true of the Labor Government, except when it comes to the rural industry. Rural industries have certainly shared their wealth by paying massive taxes when wool prices have been high. I believe that it is time that the Government recognised the situation that woolgrowers are in and did something to help them in the future.

        Because we have quite a number of speakers on this subject, I will briefly explain what the situation has been in recent years. Senators may remember that in 1988 the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, agreed to lift the reserve price from 700c a kilogram to 870c a kilogram. That was the beginning of the disaster.

        The Government had its own representatives on the board of the Australian Wool Corporation to investigate the reserve price scheme. The Minister was fully aware of what was going on at that time. There were a lot of woolgrowers around Australia who were not at ease with increasing the reserve price. But the Minister agreed with the Australian Wool Corporation's recommendation. That was the wrong thing to do at the time, but that is water under the bridge. If the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Mr Kerin want to wipe their hands of the situation, they must remember that they were part of the decision that was made to lift the reserve price. They must also realise that they caused the disaster.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Nobody needs me to tell them again what has happened since. Even though the scheme collapsed in February 1991 because of rising debts and massive production rises, the corporation still operated the reserve price until 30 June 1991. As a result of that collapse we have a massive debt. Australia now has a debt of $2.1 billion and a stockpile of 3.9 million bales. As woolgrowers we must take responsibility for that debt; no woolgrower wants to walk away from that debt.

        There were a lot of inequities, which I will point out, in having this unreal reserve price scheme. These inequities led to overproduction. In 1985-86, 173 million sheep were shorn in Australia. In 1990-91, due to the unreasonably high reserve price, 212 million sheep were shorn. Production in greasy kilograms went from 813 to 1,030 million during that period. That was far too great a production to sustain such a price.

        The Government was part of the decision to introduce a reserve price for wool. I know the industry was at fault, but the Government was also because it agreed to the scheme. Mr Kerin was running around the world giving guarantees which upset our relationship with the other trading nations.

        One solution put forward is the destruction of the stockpile or dumping the stockpile in the ocean. This would mean that the stockpile would not act as a dampener on prices.

        It has been suggested that the stockpiled wool could be given away as foreign aid. I do not think that solution is very practical. One could suggest that the stockpile be sold at a premium, but I cannot see the stockpile moving. The stockpile has moved very little in the last 12 months. The idea of putting a floor price on the stockpile does not seem to work either.

        At least 1.8 million bales of wool in the stockpile are made out of locks, bellies and pieces that never, at any stage, should have been in there. They should have been sold at the price offered at the time and the reserve price should have been used only for premium wool. I believe that that wool should be put out to tender immediately and got rid of.

        I believe that the long term solution lies in more aggressive marketing and in developing markets in places where wool can be used but is not being utilised at present. The main thrust, and the Government's thrust, should be towards eastern Europe where mills have been sold off at bargain prices for government enterprises, as eastern Europe enters a new found democracy. If we could exchange our raw material for equity in those mills—we are allowed up to 51 per cent equity in those enterprises—we would have those mills captive forever for Australian wool. That is the way to go.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        There are some mills that are not on the market whatsoever but, as those countries do not have the hard currency to buy raw material, we should give them raw material in exchange for equity towards the finished product that goes on to other markets. I was with a parliamentary delegation to the region, led by our own President, Senator Sibraa, and we could see the opportunities that lie there. So the solution lies in creating long-term demands, because we have lost our market share with the high prices that we have had in the past. Cotton and synthetic fibres have increased their market share, which we will find very hard to get back.

        But other speakers will outline further our belief and the way that the Government, or everyone in Australia, should attack the wool crisis. But in those five or seven years it will take to rectify the position in Australia, the Government has to do more than the various superficial measures it announced last week. One of those measures was to extend debt repayment simply for another year. The Government has to do far more than that to make sure that those viable woolgrowers can remain in position to take advantage of the situation when the wool industry revives, hopefully by these measures that will be put into place with a bipartisan approach. I will leave it at that, and let my colleagues further the argument.

I think his points (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), which recognise the problems the wool industry is facing and outline the particular contribution of the wool industry to Australia's economy, are quite valid.

I will outline a little later the details of the package that was announced last week.

        The Minister did visit Queensland. His primary purpose in doing this was to look first-hand at the effects on the wool industry, and also because that area is stricken by a terrible drought. Senator Panizza expressed concern that there had been no visit to Western Australia. Frankly, even though I am sure that the wool industry in Western Australia is suffering similar problems, it is very difficult for the Minister to visit every wool region in Australia. The Minister did not visit Tasmania, and personally I would have liked him to do so. But it is a bit impractical to expect the Minister to visit every wool region in Australia. The important thing is that the Minister visited a representative area of the industry as quickly as he could, analysed the situation and put together a package, which in a moment I will briefly outline, to deal with some of the problems faced by the wool industry.

        Our outstanding wool debt with the former Soviet Union now totals some $260 million. I do not think anyone in this place seriously suggests there is much chance in the short term of collecting too much of that $260 million. The wool arrears have been rescheduled and are to be repaid in 10 equal and successive six-monthly instalments. The first repayment is to be made on 1 January 1995 and the final one on 1 July 1999. I think it will be very difficult to collect the existing debt, let alone sell any significant amounts of wool to Russia and expect the payment fairly quickly. I think that is a very important part of the wool debate that Senator Panizza did not touch on in any detail.

The package includes $5 million from the Commonwealth to provide support under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the RAS to drought affected woolgrowers in Queensland and New South Wales. It also includes the maintenance of the wool tax at 8.5 per cent from 1993 to 1994, and that will mean 3.5 per cent for wool promotion.

        It was quite interesting listening to the Governor-General's speech the day before yesterday. He delivered the speech under headings from A to Z. I listened the whole way through for a mention of the rural crisis. When he was talking about A for agriculture, I thought that something would be mentioned but nothing was. When we got to D, I thought we would hear something about drought or something about the disaster facing the wool industry. When we got to F, I thought there would be some mention of farming or perhaps the wool industry. When we got to P, I thought we would hear something about the pastoral industries and again nothing was mentioned. We could have had a bit about primary industry, but the closest we got was `pharm', which ended up as pharmaceutical. The Governor-General did not even talk about the farm. I am therefore worried about whether the government of the day has an interest in the wool or farming industries because there was no mention of them whatsoever. Even when we got to W for wool, there was no mention—

        The wool industry was once Australia's biggest export earner, the one which carried Australia for decades. It was largely responsible for opening up this great nation of ours. This is the industry which the Keating Government has absolutely failed. In fact, the Australian community has ridden on the sheep's back for so long that it is now time the rest of Australia gave a little bit back to the industry which has helped them so much over all those years.

        There is a mountain of problems out there. There is a mountain of problems which were actually created in the first instance by Senator Sherry's Government putting interest rates up so damned high that people could not jump over them. Interest rates were at 20 per cent plus. The Government drove farmers to the wall before the commodity downturn came. They were driven to the wall before they even had a drought.

They have had some rain in western New South Wales since we were out there. However, the problem is even worse now because they have had a commodity downturn, they are still paying off debts caused by those high interest rates that the Government foisted on them, and they are not getting the help and assistance they so justly deserve.

        I was talking to some people in the western division this afternoon and two agents from the Broken Hill area cited some interesting figures which I believe are pretty correct. The on-farm price for a bale of wool is now about $185; that is about $1 a kilogram. In round figures, 30 fleeces go into a bale. Shearing costs for that bale of wool are about $3 a head. So that is $90-odd for that $185 net on-farm bale of wool. Drenching of each sheep costs about $1.50; that is fly control, dipping, et cetera. So basically, by the time we have paid our costs, interest rates and debt, and looked after ourselves, we are well out of pocket on that net on-farm bale of wool.

It is not helping with the alleviation of government charges, and it is not helping with the levy alleviation because it is still making those farmers pay their 8 1/2 per cent levy. If the Government had given them a bit of assistance with that, it would have given farmers a little money to put food on their table.

The Governor-General's speech would give little hope to those who are struggling to resolve the actual problems which are being faced by woolgrowers today. It was not a speech which inspired us to action. Indeed, for some of those in the chamber, it was such a somnolent sort of arrangement that it inspired quite the opposite.

That is a suggested action which would have disastrously negative results, not the least of which I would have thought was patently obvious. One of the many letters to the editor about this particular subject observed that it would be interesting to watch Mr Wayne Goss of Queensland actually trying to burn the stockpile; he would need a few packs of matches to do that. Mr Merrylees of Euroa, who wrote a letter observing that, is to be congratulated because the sort of superficial, glib action that is proposed in that way is a bit harder to deliver.

        As honourable senators would know, the stockpile is not a bunch of bales of wool stuck beside the wharf in Melbourne. What we have is wool distributed throughout Australia in various places, and at one stage there was even a considerable amount of it overseas. The cost of administering, safe-guarding and storing that wool stockpile is considerable and has to be borne by those very people who have produced it. To go along with a match and set fire to it is, frankly, physically rather difficult.

        The fact is that we need to be looking at a very large part of the stockpile to be marketed not in the traditional way that wool has been marketed—not necessarily as a textile, not necessarily recognising all the fine qualities of wool, but recognising some of the other qualities. I have already mentioned wool's innate resistance to being easily burned, its elasticity and its insulation properties. The fact is that wool that has been bought at 700c or 870c is wool that is not readily seen as being the raw material which it in fact is. It is an insulator; we should be promoting it as that. I have insulated my home with it and, as a competitor to synthetics, it is miles ahead. Those who have worked hard to establish it as an alternative insulation product should be supported.

        Wool is not only a heat insulating product but also a sound insulating product. We import a lot of synthetics to stick in cars to deaden the noise under the bonnet and to do all sorts of things in sound deadening, but wool is remarkably good in that sphere. We are still importing synthetics and we are still making wool bales out of synthetics. It has been demonstrated that some of the sorts of wool that Senator Panizza was talking about would be eminently suitable for manufacturing into wool bales themselves. It would have the side effect of reducing the contamination which is such a problem in the wool industry. This contamination is sometimes added to during core sampling when some of the synthetic fibres become mixed in with wool.

No other industry is in the crisis situation that the wool industry faces today. That is why it should receive particular attention in this re-elected Government's program over the next three years.

        It seems that the only thing we can agree on about wool in Australia is that we do not agree about the extent of its difficulties, and in particular about how the problems of the wool stockpile should be solved. The longer the argument goes on, the more the industry continues to suffer. There is no argument that some of the problem is not of Australia's making, but it cannot be argued that it is not our problem. Australia must find the solution to this problem.

        I have great difficulty accepting the arguments of some farmers that the stockpile should be frozen. One can understand the concern behind that reasoning. Many farmers feel that unless the stockpile is frozen, they will be left insecure and that it is a gamble. Perhaps 10 or 20 years ago that view may have been correct. But I believe that freezing the stockpile simply leaves that insecurity hanging over the heads of the industry, and of growers in particular. As long as that stockpile remains, it will have a depressing effect on the international demand for current production and therefore a detrimental effect on the current price of wool.

        We have to recognise that the world of trade is now a vastly different place from what it was many years ago and that a 3.9 million bale stockpile of wool, which represents 85 or 90 per cent of the current annual production of the wool industry, will continue to depress wool prices. By its continuing existence the stockpile will create a necessary increase in the wool tax to pay for both the storage and the interest costs of that stockpile. Those costs are simply a burden that wool growers can no longer afford to carry.

        It currently costs about $240 million per year to maintain that stockpile through the interest payment on the debt and through storage costs. Growers simply cannot afford to pay that in the current situation where they are receiving such historically low prices for their raw wool. There is no other way forward but to aggressively market that stockpile, cut the industry's losses and move forward without crippling the future financial ability of the industry.

        It has been clear for many years that we have to develop new and alternative uses for wool. For consumers worldwide, paying for wool and caring for wool has rendered it a luxury item when compared with man-made fibres—synthetics. While that has been addressed in advertising terms, we have been tardy in researching what can best be described as the big picture of where wool is heading. This has resulted in the current crisis, which is the culmination of many different difficulties peaking at once. We have lacked the managerial skill to deal with that crisis.

        A wide range of possible initiatives have already been put forward by wool industry bodies. They include placing wool in markets where access to hard currency is restricted, using wool from the stockpile to establish equity in joint venture processing facilities in specific mills or in those countries with hard currency problems, using stockpile wool for the development of domestic processing facilities in Australia, using stockpile wool for specific foreign aid programs and to cement Australia's relations with specific countries, and ensuring that more aggressive marketing of the stockpile is done in a way that does not damage the selling of new wool from current production.

        The overriding consideration of all of these initiatives is the need at all times to isolate stockpile sales from existing ongoing demand. In my view, the best way to get an urgently needed substantial reduction in the size of the stockpile, while allowing its eventual use in any or all of the ways that I have just outlined, is to call tenders for the purchase of specific quantities and types from the stockpile on the condition that wool so purchased must not find its way back into existing uses and markets, which would only further depress the market and price for wool coming onto the market from current production.

        There may be some practical difficulties in policing this requirement. However, I understand that, for example, it is possible to chemically treat wool to make it impossible to be used in textile manufacturing. This would ensure that purchasers would have to find new uses for the wool that they have purchased by tender, whether it be for insulation, oil spills or any other alternative use that might be developed. I believe there would be entrepreneurs willing to punt on their capacity to resell wool for such alternative uses, if the tender process was initiated.

        The Australian Wool Corporation recently addressed this need through the establishment of a contamination task force. The task force investigated quality systems for the wool industry, and its report recommended the adoption of total quality management. We can market successfully only if we have a quality product to sell.

Firstly, there must be a higher quality product; secondly, there must be efficient channels of distribution and market information; and, thirdly, there must be cost-effective promotion. The current crisis of the wool stockpile must provide the catalyst for appropriate action to be taken in the future to ensure that this industry remains a viable one, not only to the benefit of woolgrowers, but to the benefit all Australians.

I would also like to discuss a few things which I believe could be done to improve the current situation. I express my dismay that wool was not mentioned in the speech made by the Governor-General the other day. One must justifiably criticise the Government and the wool industry for not having in place a long-term strategy for handling the stockpile and the production of wool in this country at the time the reserve price collapsed.

        We on this side of the chamber made our position absolutely clear. We even went so far as to suggest a slaughter scheme, but we were knocked all over the place. At that time, we said that the production of wool would have to get down to 700,000 kilos a year if there was to be any chance of our handling the stockpile without crunching the market. We now know that production is still over 800,000 kilos a year, and that is a fundamental problem.

        This can be done in a number of ways, as long as it is pursued with vigour and a little bit of vision. Other uses of wool have already been mentioned. I particularly want to mention the utilisation of wool as an insulator. Like Senator Bell, our house in Perth is insulated with wool. It is cheaper and better than alternative forms of insulation, but one never sees it advertised or promoted. With the right promotion, effort and marketing, this area can expand, and the Department of Trade must assist with this. China, for example, is utilising only 60 per cent of its production capacity. We have a wool scouring operation in Fremantle, which we visited recently, that is working three days a week. That could be utilised in part of the process. It needs some leadership, promotion and effort. Hopefully, at a later time, I can enlarge on this issue.

        The second issue I wish to mention in respect of utilising wool and addressing the stockpile situation is the importance of upgrading the overseas marketing of our live sheep and mutton, which is something that has been forgotten. That is the other side of the equation. It will be a real challenge for us to go back to the situation we were once in, but I do not believe it is impossible. It is not only a challenge to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean); it is also a challenge to the new Minister for Trade (Senator Cook). We need to market in the Middle East, Asia and these other countries. We need to carry out proper promotions and trade negotiations so that we can get rid of the surplus sheep that have nowhere to go. That is another option we have which has not been pursued. I understand that we still have only three agricultural attaches in the whole world. Looking at the agricultural production in this country, that is certainly an area that needs to be addressed.

The challenge to the Government in this motion which we are supporting is to take a bipartisan approach to solving this problem. Pain and suffering are occurring in rural Australia now. Every woolgrower in this country is losing $5 a sheep every year. That cannot be allowed to continue. In fact, it is a disgrace that it has been allowed to go as far as it has. No other section of the community has ever been put under so much pressure, in terms of its social wellbeing, its financial wellbeing and its contribution to this country—after all, it did put $3.8 billion into the economy last year—and been neglected for so long.

I cannot—and I do not think it is appropriate in the sort of broad brush policy speech we are making at the moment—go into those sorts of details but I can tell Senator Sherry, and I hope he takes it back to the Minister, that these woolgrowers, to whom I have spoken at some length over the past couple of weeks, have said that the rural assistance scheme, or RAS, as it is known colloquially, and the RAFCor. are seen as totally inadequate schemes for delivering the sort of assistance that is required in this crisis.

It is easy to say that but if I had a stockpile of any product—be it, say, motor cars; for example, Ford Capris—the last thing I would do to sell it or to try to get rid of it would be to set up a series of bureaucracies like the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The way to run down the stockpile and to market wool more aggressively is to ensure that we get the process in the hands of small entrepreneurs and sales-based people and out of the hands as much as possible of bureaucrats sitting in offices earning set salaries, regardless of how much wool they sell in a particular year.

        I have also met a number of entrepreneurs in Western Australia in the last couple of weeks.

He has told me of the frustrations he has had dealing with the Australian Wool Corporation. He is not allowed to use the Woolmark on the houses in which he puts the insulation. When one has a house that has wool insulation in the ceiling, the very minimum one could do is put a Woolmark on the front door; it actually becomes a trendy idea to let people know that one has wool in one's roof.

        I want to approach this debate in a bipartisan way because this industry deserves the support of the total parliament. The Crean package was welcomed.

I accept that and I acknowledge it. But I want to contrast that amount of money, a little over $200 million, with the amount that the Fraser-Anthony Government provided in drought relief in 1982—$400 million in 1982 dollar terms or $700 million if that figure is carried forward. So this Government has put $200 million into the wool industry, as against what the Fraser-Anthony Government put in for the 1982-83 drought.

All these things are happening out there in the bush at the moment. Fifteen thousand growers are currently receiving interest rate subsidies; 6,000 to 7,000 of those growers will come off contracts at the end of this year. Some of the contracts will be renewed, but where do those 6,000 or 7,000 growers go? They go on to the RAS and they will end up exiting their farm.

        Nothing will help woolgrowers in the long term unless the price of wool returns to a market price that will give some returns at sustainable levels. I know it is important to give the aid, and I know that RAS is accepted. Every dollar is accepted; every dollar is necessary out there. But unless we can find a solution to increase the price of wool, every bit of aid, the $200 million—I hope Senator Sherry is listening to this—will not go anywhere. We will have to think laterally to provide a way of increasing the floor price. I know that `floor price' have become dirty words, but we will have to think about it. I know that other people wish to speak and Senator Panizza is giving me the wind-up signal. I think the Senate should debate this issue at a later time in greater depth.

          —In the wee small hours of the last occasion that we sat before Christmas, Mr Punch, the former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, tabled the Midford Paramount report. We were unable to do that in this chamber on that occasion because we were engaged in long and lengthy debate; we rose at 6 o'clock in the morning. So, in effect, the report was presented to the Senate whilst we were not sitting. This is the first opportunity that I have had to address this very important report which is the result of two years' work.

          The report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into Midford Paramount is the tale of the punishment of defendants who were not convicted of any crime. The inquiry arose out of a Senate estimates committee investigation into the Australian Customs Service and a reference to the Public Accounts Committee upon a resolution of the Senate. It was a reference that the Government opposed but, in the end, a bipartisan report was brought down unanimously by all members of that committee.

          The matter revolved around the directors of Midford and its tariff adviser who were charged in June 1988 with $4.5 million of Customs fraud. A year later the committal was discontinued soon after the DPP withdrew the charges. In February 1989, costs of around $365,000 were awarded against the Commonwealth. Despite the withdrawal of charges and the award of costs by the magistrate, the committee noted that the defendants suffered enormous financial losses through unreimbursed legal fees and diminution of the value of their businesses. Others involved in the case also suffered.

          After an exhaustive two-year investigation the committee generated a report and 134 recommendations concerning the Midford Paramount case—and we said it was indeed a paramount case of a failure of Customs. Many of the 134 recommendations are simply sensible statements, either of commonsense or of basic good management. It is a terrible indictment of the Australian Customs Service that such fundamental matters needed to be raised in the report. I will give an example of some of those recommendations. Recommendation 1 states:

         The committee found that the Australian Customs Service was at best incompetent or at worst conspiratorial and deceitful. An excessive number of inconsistencies, inaccuracies and contradictions was found in evidence by key witnesses from government agencies.

          Importantly, the committee concluded that the Comptroller-General cannot be held personally responsible for every action of individual subordinate officers, but he must accept responsibility for the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of the Australian Customs Service, the prevailing culture in the service and the changes that must be made.
         </tab>

        <para>
         The report shows a constant refusal of the customs service and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to accept the verdict of a court of law and demonstrates what some would call a vendetta against innocent parties. It was best summed up by the statement made to the committee by the Australian Customs Service's National Manager of Investigations, who said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Magistrate's summation has been studied carefully. It is his opinion. The Australian Customs Service does not share his view and in fact strongly disagrees with it.

         At every turn, there was no willingness to accept the rule of law. But the findings of the report are totally consistent with the findings of the magistrate, who said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As was disclosed from Cabinet papers and other confidential papers, a cover-up permeated throughout the department (that is, DITAC). I find it totally unbelievable that (the DITAC witness) knew very little of the Cabinet paper disclosures. In my opinion, the two officers—

        <para>
         The Public Accounts Committee hopes that the Australian Customs Service will view the recommendations in the report positively and improve its operations to regain the trust of those it is meant to protect. Challenging the committee's findings is not a good start.
        </para>
        <para>
         The committee found it necessary to recommend:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         that the powers of the Customs officers be limited; increased emphasis be placed on protecting the rights of individuals through improved mechanisms for investigating and resolving complaints against the customs service; the expertise, training, qualifications, supervision and management of the Australian Customs Service investigation officers be improved; investigations be conducted into apparently false representations made by ACS officers to Ministers; and allegations that an Australian Customs Service officer forged evidence during a recent Crimes Act prosecution.
        </para>
        <para>
         Since the release of the report, to date bureaucratic wranglings have done little to progress the matter. It is understood that initially it was proposed that Customs and DITAC would determine what compensation should be paid. Naturally, the intended recipients rejected major involvement of ACS and DITAC in the process.

          The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently agreed that an interdepartmental committee be formed which would have a DITAC and Australian Customs Service observer. However, it now appears that the observers chosen by those two agencies are at the deputy secretary level, far outranking all other members on the interdepartmental committee.

         Justice cannot and will not be seen to be done under an arrangement where there is a potential for undue influence from the two offending agencies, especially given repeated demonstration of recalcitrant attitudes by those agencies.

          The court and the Public Accounts Committee have already conducted extensive examinations and found that the defendants have already been severely punished, even though not convicted of any crime.

Throughout this inquiry witnesses from the Australian Customs Service have constantly maintained that Midford had not been cleared of the charges, that it was guilty of crimes and that the magistrate was wrong.

         On Tuesday the new Minister responsible for the Australian Customs Service, Senator Schacht, announced a review of the operations of the service. The Minister's press release stated that he will review and examine issues of responsibility and accountability, the relationship of the service to other agencies and the public overseas developments and Customs administration. This appears to be a bland statement. We do not know who will conduct the inquiry, we do not know the role of the Parliament, if any, and we do not know who will head it. But I do welcome the statement and I do welcome the fact that the Minister says that the Government is committed to ensuring that the shortcomings identified by the Midford report and other reports are corrected. I can assure the Minister that he will certainly have the utmost cooperation from me and, I am sure, from other members of the committee.

          —Before dinner, I was speaking about the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Midford Paramount case and the Australian Customs Service. As the new Minister responsible for Customs, I explained that I had thoroughly read the report. Although I do not accept automatically all the criticisms contained in the report, I indicated that Customs had overwhelmingly accepted most of the 130-odd recommendations that related to it, excluding the issue of compensation; that is being dealt with by an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Finance, which is in accordance with government administration.

          Two days ago, I announced a major review of all the operations and aspects of Customs. I did so after consultation with the portfolio Minister, Mr Alan Griffiths. We believe that it is necessary not just because of the Midford report, which dealt with only one aspect of Customs operations, but also because of the very important nature of Customs itself. It collects over $13 billion in revenue for the Commonwealth government and employs nearly 5,000 people throughout Australia. It also delivers a number of bounty program payments to the Australian public. Of course, it is responsible for maintaining the integrity of Australia's international border controls. It has a particularly onerous and difficult task in fighting the illicit drug trade and smuggling. At times, that means it has to exercise powers that do not make it popular with some members of the public.

          The Midford report dealt with some of those areas. Of course, the Government will bring down a response to the Public Accounts Committee report by the middle of the year. In the meantime, I thought it would be appropriate for the Government to conduct an independent review of all the services of Customs, particularly because there has been no overall review of it since 1985 when it became a statutory authority. There have been many individual inquiries. Many of them were at the parliamentary level and dealt with specific areas.

          In the last three years, a major work has been done by the Australian Law Reform Commission into the Customs Act. The Customs Act is one of the oldest Acts of the Australian Parliament; it was established in 1903. I am informed that there has been no major review or rewriting of that Act since then. Of course, it has been substantially amended piecemeal over the decades. The Australian Law Reform Commission review recommended a major rewriting of the Act. While those recommendations are before us—I have certainly had discussions with Customs about a timetable for rewriting the Act and when it could be introduced into the Australian Parliament—it seemed to me to be opportune to combine the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the rewriting of the Act with a review into the administration of the customs service.

          I have certainly encouraged Australian Customs Service officers to see the review in a positive and constructive light that puts forward the very good work that they have been doing and the good service that they have provided to Australia. The Australian Customs Service has a very good story to tell in many areas. It is at the cutting edge of any world customs service in the introduction of electronic procedures to make it easier for importers and exporters to deal with customs with the minimum of inconvenience. Other customs departments elsewhere in the world are looking at taking up a number of the new initiatives in this area that the Australian Customs Service has developed.

I can assure the Senate that it will be an independent review to which the public will be able to make submissions. As I said before, I encourage Customs to make its own submission about its activities. I am sure that it will. I also believe that the review is part of the public debate about public administration. No government department should escape the need to have an independent review of its activities from time to time, because that means that we will have better administration and better quality in the performance of government departments.

          The problem we discovered in this report was addressed in our minority report. The problem was that the Government was not looking at ways in which to improve the delivery of services to those with disabilities. I am particularly concerned, when referring to people in the electorate who have various disabilities, whether they be mental or physical disabilities, to find that the services being provided to them are inadequate.

          It is for that reason that Senator Lees from the Australian Democrats has made a reference to the committee about the facilities for those affected in terms of mental health. As a parliament, we have to look at ways in which we can deliver these facilities far better. My colleague Senator Walters, who wishes to speak on this report, has also been a member of that committee. We need to be able to assess the facilities that are being provided.

         I think that is of particular concern to a number of people because in a hard and tough economic climate there is great difficulty in getting employment for people—full stop; period—let alone for those who have disabilities. The concern that was constantly raised with the committee was how people with disabilities would be able to compete with those who were ablebodied.

         It is of great importance that we look at some of those areas, because we have been concerned for a number of years that this will discriminate against those who are able bodied yet not give an opportunity to those who have disabilities. The further requirement for the private sector to put on extra staff members to cater for those who have disabilities is also a barrier to employment, which we discovered in that committee.

         a proposed motion to take note of a particular matter in an estimates committee report

        <para>
         We are worried that `a particular matter' could mean any particular matter, so that anything that was tacked onto an estimates committee report could be taken note of. I do understand that Senator Walters does have some reservations that extraordinary things may happen in estimates committees which would need to be debated on the floor of the chamber, and I tend to agree with her; however, I am not convinced that this is the way to overcome it.

          I suggest that there are times when these sorts of things can be addressed. They can be addressed at Question Time;  suspension of Standing Orders is always available, as are referrals to committees—the possible misuse of Department of Social Security printing facilities has been referred to a committee. We are concerned that this is not the best way to address that point, but because of our concern that Senator Walters does have a good point—and we have not yet given it enough thought—after we have finished with this motion we would like to refer to the Procedure Committee the concerns Senator Walters raised in her speech.

I have not spoken in this debate, which is about the implementation of a reform which would have the effect of abolishing the Committee of the Whole debate on estimates within this chamber. It seems to me that before the Senate abandons any of the opportunities it has for ensuring proper financial accountability of the Government, it should ensure that it is at least putting in place an alternative mechanism that can reasonably achieve the same objective.

          I understand that colleagues who have spoken before me have made the point that the loss of the opportunity to address questions to Ministers in the form of this traditional Committee of the Whole debate will be the loss of an important opportunity for the Senate to examine the Government on its expenditure in detail. Therefore, this is a decision that should not be taken hastily. There has been a debate, I concede, at the level of the Procedure Committee and there is no doubt that in here tonight the numbers—that is, the Australian Democrats and the Government—favour passage of this change that will abolish—

          —I was just saying that the Government and the Democrats between them have determined that this change should be passed tonight—and that is a change that will abolish an opportunity for the Senate to require financial accountability through the examination of Ministers. But, in acknowledging that that will occur, it is nevertheless important that we look in some detail at what the Procedure Committee puts before us and determine whether it adequately achieves the objective that the Procedure Committee is seeking.

          It seems to me that the alternative that the Procedure Committee has put is that, instead of coming in here for a debate in the Committee of the Whole, matters such as unanswered questions by Ministers should be referred back to the estimates committee which should then hold a supplementary hearing to deal with those matters rather than honourable senators being given the opportunity to question Ministers directly in this chamber.

          However, when I looked at the drafting of that proposal, it seemed to me that there was no obligation upon the Government to ensure that such supplementary hearing takes place before the Bill is returned to this place for what will simply be the third reading stage of the process. I have had drafted a very simple amendment which is designed to ensure that the estimates committee hearings do in fact take place and are completed, in accordance with the design that the Procedure Committee has put to us tonight, before the Government brings the Bills back in here for passage.

          It might be said that the Government would not do this; it would not seek to curtail the procedure. But we have a certain responsibility to ensure that the procedures of this chamber will not be avoided by governments which no doubt will tell us at the end of each session that there is great urgency and that the supplementary procedure perhaps should be abandoned. Therefore, I move the following amendment:

         I cannot imagine any argument that the Government, let alone the Australian Democrats, would put against the passing of an amendment in those terms—an amendment which, presumably, would simply ensure the implementation of the process in accordance with the spirit in which the Government has brought these procedural amendments to us tonight. I therefore commend this amendment to the Senate.

          —Mr Deputy President, might I ask for clarification from Senator Bourne. Did I understand her to say that she would support referring the matter to the Procedure Committee? If so, do I take it that by doing so she would be prepared to defer the Government's proposal—because to not do so is simply to pre-empt the motion—or, alternatively, move that the debate be adjourned to give her a proper opportunity to examine the amendment? I would have thought that course of action eminently sensible. If it has merit, it should be referred to the Procedure Committee. I am simply trying to find a sensible way of dealing with this matter. Senator Bourne seems to have a legitimate complaint when she says that she did not have the opportunity to consider it until just now. Let us adjourn the debate and give her a proper opportunity.

        —in reply—Last night I spoke about what I considered to be the gross hypocrisy of the Opposition in trying to erode the powers of Parliamentary Secretaries that were established in this chamber during the last Parliament. I pointed out that the hypocrisy of this move by the Opposition is manifest and obvious when one considers the fact that, in the case of the Government, there is only one Parliamentary Secretary in this chamber, Senator Sherry. But, in the case of the Opposition, which wants to curtail the powers of Parliamentary Secretaries in this chamber, Dr Hewson, the temporary Leader of the Opposition, has seen fit to appoint five shadow Parliamentary Secretaries in the Senate out of nine shadow Parliamentary Secretaries overall.

The truth of the matter is that, notwithstanding their great ability, none of our secretaries will be appearing before estimates committees. This is a debate about the apprentices appearing before six estimates committees when the Government has 10 Ministers; it is not about the quality of our wonderful front bench.

        What is being proposed in this motion is no different from the sessional order that was in place during the last Parliament. There is not a skerrick of difference. While this debate was ensuing yesterday, we heard so many eulogies and so much praise about how well Senator McMullan did his job as a Parliamentary Secretary. One would think the Opposition would have been convinced. Apparently, times have changed. It was good enough for the Opposition to support this arrangement then.

        —It is worth remembering that the Fraser Government enacted the Parliamentary Secretaries Act. It is under that Act that the Parliamentary Secretaries operate. Again, it seems to me nothing short of gross hypocrisy for the Opposition to oppose this sessional order. There is no reason for not following previous practices in this House and there is no reason, in relation to the Parliamentary Secretary issue in general, for not following previous practices in both Houses.

        Let us be absolutely clear about this. Why is it not better for a Parliamentary Secretary, who has responsibility in a particular portfolio or ministerial area, to appear before an estimates committee as opposed to a Minister who represents a House of Representatives Minister in this chamber. I would suggest to those opposite that the Parliamentary Secretary may well have a more immediate and closer understanding of many of the issues that Opposition and Democrat senators would want to explore before the estimates committees.

        There is absolutely no justification for the amendment that has been moved by Senator Calvert. On this occasion the Government is doing nothing more than putting forward a sessional order that worked well, effectively and in the best interests of the Senate during the last Parliament. I believe that any reasonable person would support the proposed sessional order in its entirety. I ask the Senate to reject the amendment, as moved by Senator Calvert, and to support the motion standing in my name.

        —by leave—I want to address Senator Calvert's amendment, which is a very sensible change to the Government's proposal. I take the opportunity to remind the Senate what this debate is all about. The Government now has 10 Ministers in this chamber, yet feels that 10 Ministers are unable to fulfil the normal duties and responsibilities of Ministers—so much so that it has to have an extra Parliamentary Secretary to whom it wants to give similar responsibilities and powers. No case has been made out at all by the Government as to why it is necessary for Senator Sherry to carry out these functions in this chamber when the Government already has 10 Ministers to do the job.

Government members have not really even sought to make out a case. It is rather one of those examples which we experience so often in this place where the Government moves a motion and we are just told that we should basically support it.

        What are the functions that Senator Sherry must carry out in this chamber that are so necessary and that cannot be performed by other Ministers? One of the functions, we are told, is that he is to take the place of a Minister before the estimates committee. There are only going to be six estimates committees. There are, as we have said, 10 Ministers but yet the Government still says that one of those Ministers should be avoiding the responsibility of appearing before, and taking the appropriations through, the relevant estimates committee.

        In this instance it seems that it is being specifically provided for the benefit of Senator Cook, because Senator Cook has the representational functions in this chamber which cover exactly the same areas that the Government is giving as a responsibility to Senator Sherry. Why cannot Senator Cook carry out that function before the estimates committee? Has the Minister sought to explain to the chamber why Senator Cook cannot meet that responsibility? If he had sought to do that and convinced us of a sound reason for doing so, he would have made his case, but he has not put before this chamber one single reason why Senator Cook cannot do the job.

        We might have our doubts about Senator Cook's capabilities, but I presume that we are not intended to interpret this as a vote of no-confidence on the other side of the chamber in relation to Senator Cook. Certainly we know that in relation to primary industry Senator Cook had all that experience in the last session with the AQIS debate—experience that he will not forget.

        Therefore, there is no reason why the amendment put by my colleague Senator Calvert—that Parliamentary Secretaries should not have a responsibility in relation to the estimates committee, that Parliamentary Secretaries should not take the role of Ministers in relation to the estimates committee—should not be accepted by the chamber. I presume, because there has been no argument put by the Government, that the Australian Democrats will finally, on this occasion, support us in this amendment and that Senator Calvert's amendment will be successful. So I have pleasure in supporting this amendment and look forward to this vote.

The Manager of Government Business has told us today that we should not be doing this because we are overturning precedent. We are actually in the business of overturning precedent this evening, by the look of it. I tend to agree with what Senator Hill has said. We cannot see any problem with Ministers turning up to all the estimates committees. We cannot see any problem with Senator Cook turning up for the estimates committee. As Senator Hill said, I am sure that Senator Sherry is a very able and apt person to turn up in place of a Minister for estimates committees. But we do have 10 Ministers here, all of them very able, and we would really like them to turn up to estimates committees. We would like to be able to question them about their own responsibilities, in particular, and about the responsibilities of those people whom they represent each day here in Question Time. So we will be supporting Senator Calvert's amendment to the motion.

       There is very little difference here between the position that has been enunciated by Senator Hill on behalf of the Opposition and the position of the Government relating to the time limit for an answer to a question in Question Time. The Government is proposing a time limit of four minutes for answers and the Opposition is proposing a time limit of three minutes. Both the Government and the Opposition are proposing a time limit of one minute for supplementary questions and a time limit of one minute for supplementary answers. As I understand it, that is the position that Senator Hill has adopted.

        I have been invited by Senator Kemp to address the Senate at length on this matter, but I have decided to reject his kind offer. I think honourable senators are aware of the issues. Experience has shown that the time limits in Question Time have not altogether been a disaster for the way in which the Senate has worked. In fact, I think the time limits have probably provided a useful discipline at times. I find it a little hard to be terribly emotional about this issue, but I think the motion outlines a reasonable time limit and I would ask the Senate to support the motion as it stands.

        —If ever there were evidence of a need for a time limit on answers to questions without notice, it was the performance of Senator Collins yesterday and today. This is a very useful reform. It was a reform that the Government resisted with all the vigour it could muster during its last term. I must say that the sort of grudging acknowledgment by the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner) that some form of discipline can be useful is overdue; nevertheless it is recognised and appreciated.

        In the previous session of Parliament, Ministers demonstrated that they were unable to impose self-discipline and provide sensible answers that concentrated on answering the question. Instead, Ministers were making long statements that should have been made after Question Time in the form of ministerial statements. It was really an abuse of Question Time. Ministers, particularly Senator Collins and Senator Cook, were giving us answers that went for many, many minutes. As I said a moment ago, Ministers often failed to even answer the question during such extended periods.

        It became apparent to those of us on this side of the chamber—and, I have to say, to the Australian Democrats—that it was necessary for the Senate to impose some discipline upon Ministers. You will remember, Madam Deputy President, that we carried out a number of experiments to determine the appropriate time for a Minister to adequately answer a question without encouraging that Minister to speak in excess of what was necessary. We had an experience with a four-minute time limit on answers, which is the time limit contained in Senator Faulkner's motion. We also tried three minutes and—Senator Kemp might remind me—I think we had a go at two minutes.

        At the end of the last session, I thought the consensus was that about three minutes is the right length of time. It is an adequate amount of time for a Minister properly to answer a question without encouraging him or her to speak for an unnecessarily long time. It is therefore disappointing that the Government, being dissatisfied with that experiment that worked reasonably well—after we tried three separate periods of time—feels it has to come in here tonight and have another go at extending the period for answering questions to four minutes.

        What we are really trying to do, apart from cutting out the unnecessary expressions of Ministers, is get more questions asked and answered during the time allowed for Question Time. Unfortunately, the record of this Government has been poor compared with that of previous governments. It has taken less questions and therefore answered less questions. The opportunity presented to this chamber to require accountability during Question Time—which some might say is the principal opportunity presented to an Opposition in the Parliament to require accountability—has been unduly limited.

        In addition to the constraint on the time in which a Minister can answer a question, we suggest that a minimum number of questions should be asked and answered. So far, regrettably, that has been rejected not only by the Government—which is not surprising because it objects to answering any questions—but also, surprisingly, by the Australian Democrats. I say `surprisingly' because I cannot understand any argument by which the Australian Democrats would wish to limit their opportunity to ask a reasonable number of questions and to get answers. In fact, because of their very small numbers in this chamber, they have limited opportunity to do so in any event.

        If the Government were required to answer a reasonable number of questions, the Australian Democrats would have the opportunity to ask more and, therefore, presumably, better fulfil their responsibility to the electors who put them here.

        I would hope that the Australian Democrats will realise not only that three minutes is an adequate time in which a Minister can answer a question, but also that by constraining Ministers to three minutes they hopefully will again have more opportunity to ask questions themselves. If we add the minutes allowed for asking questions to the four minutes that the Government proposes for answers, plus the two minutes for supplementary questions and answers, we are up to a maximum of seven minutes per question. In an hour—the Australian Democrats can work this out by simple arithmetic calculation—very few questions might be answered if the Ministers decide to take their full time. On the precedent of today, it looks as though these Ministers will take every second that they are allowed to answer questions. I ask Senator Kemp how many questions that would bring us down to.

Therefore, it is appropriate that the Senate, where the Government does not have the majority, should start to take the lead and respond to the public wishes to try to improve the performance of Ministers at Question Time.

        Generally Senator Button, as then Leader of the Government in the Senate, was asked the first question. He would spend the first five minutes bucketing the questioner, the next five minutes bucketing the Opposition and probably another five minutes answering the question. Some 15 or 20 minutes were taken up before the answer to the first question was finished. We would then hopefully get a few shorter answers to other questions. But then as soon as Senator Collins was asked a question, time got away again.

        Having had enough of this, I went around to the Clerk's office and got some advice on how to stop this abuse of Question Time. The first suggestion was to have one minute for the original question, two minutes for the answer, one minute for a supplementary question and one minute for the subsequent answer. We must remember that that proposal got off the ground with the help of the Democrats. They at least saw the need to give it a trial.

        As Senator Bourne has just pointed out, we averaged 31 questions while that trial occurred. It was rather fast and furious, but I thought that questions were being answered to the best ability of the Government Ministers at the time without the usual bucketing of the questioner and the Opposition before the questions were answered. I thought it worked fairly well.

        But then we tried having one minute for the original question, four minutes for the answer, one minute for the supplementary question and one minute for the supplementary answer. We also tried having one minute for the original question, three minutes for the answer, one minute for the supplementary question and one minute for the supplementary answer. I believe that most of those trials were fairly successful. As Senator Bourne has said, there was no difference in the number of questions asked as between a time limit of four minutes or a time limit of three minutes for answers. She reckoned the number was the same. I think she said 23 questions were asked within those time limits, if I am correct.

        The reason for that result—there being no difference in the number of questions asked with a three-minute or four-minute answer limit—is that it stopped the Ministers abusing the available time. It stopped them using the first 20 minutes of Question Time to answer one question, so that both those trials virtually had the same effect.

        I cannot understand the Democrats not supporting the three-minute answer limit, because it gives people a chance to ask a question. One minute for the original question, three minutes for the answer, one minute for a supplementary question and one minute for the answer adds up to six minutes. So our proposal should allow for at least 10 new questions an hour. Under this proposal, eight or nine questions per hour could be asked. Therefore, our proposal would mean a chance for senators to ask an extra question.

I cannot really see why the Democrats would turn down the opportunity of being able to ask an extra question of the Government. As I said before, the Democrats helped us before. We would not have got the proposal up without their help. I forget who I dealt with at the time; it was probably Senator Coulter, the defrocked leader of the Democrats. Certainly the Democrats helped us with the experiment. It worked in stopping the abuse of Question Time. I cannot see why they would want to give up the chance of asking an extra question.

        —I rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Hill. In the 12 months that I have been in this chamber I have seen a variety of timings for Question Time. When I first came into the Senate, there was unlimited Question Time. We then went to having one-minute questions and two-minute answers that Senator Panizza talked about. I could see that some Ministers were struggling under that time constraint, because it was quite obvious that their staff were well used to preparing five- and six-minute answers and that Ministers were trying to get them through in two or three. We could see the difficulty that that was presenting to some Ministers.

        We then came to a reasonable conclusion of three minutes and one minute. I fail to see Senator Bourne's logic when she says we have the same number of questions whether it is a three minute limit or a four minute limit; therefore, we should go for the four-minute limit. Surely if three minutes is the average, the most sensible thing to do would be to have three minute answers to questions. This would mean that Ministers would then be confined to answering questions in three minutes instead of spending four minutes plus one minute to answer supplementary questions which are sometimes dorothy dixers from their own back bench. This sometimes limits the answers the Ministers give to Opposition backbenchers or shadow Ministers.

        I was told when I entered the Senate that the opportunity for asking questions, particularly from the back bench, was somewhat limited. I came in at a time when lengthy answers were being given by Ministers in response to questions. I think that because of the workings of the Senate up until Christmas time last year there was scarcely a senator on the Opposition side who complained about the number of questions that they had the opportunity of asking. This was because of the time constraints that were placed on Ministers answering questions.

        I fail to see why the Democrats would want to do anything else but get the opportunity to ask more questions than they would have had the opportunity to ask when there were no time constraints or even when there were four-minute time constraints. This also applies to Independent senators.

        The more chances we get to ask questions the more opportunities there are for senators on this side of the chamber, as well as government backbenchers, to ask questions of interest. I think if senators get the opportunity to ask more questions then they are able to raise many issues which are brought to them by their constituents and which they wish to raise in order to get direct answers.

        I believe Senator Hill's amendment is a very reasonable one. Of all the proposals we tried last year—we tried the whole gamut of no time limits and two, three and four-minute answers to questions—it seems that the three minute time limit was the most satisfactory both for Ministers to answer questions and also for Opposition, Democrat and Independent senators to ask a greater number of questions.

        I cannot for the life of me see the logic in Senator Bourne's argument that because there was no difference in the number of questions asked, whether the time limit was three or four minutes, she would go for the higher time limit. This means that there is then the possibility that fewer questions would be asked than there would be if a three-minute time limit were applied to the answers of Ministers. I hope the Democrats will see their way clear to support this amendment so that all senators may be able to meet their obligations in the Senate and have far more opportunities to ask questions on matters they feel are important.

       This reform seeks to ensure that the sessional order that was in place at the end of the last Parliament remains in place for calendar year 1993. I really believe that most honourable senators would agree that this limit on speeches at the second reading stage worked to the benefit of all honourable senators and the chamber as a whole. I believe that anyone who cannot deliver a speech on the second reading in 20 minutes should not be a member of parliament. Most of the effective speeches that I have heard in this chamber—and none of them have come from the Opposition side—have been a great deal more limited than 20 minutes in duration.

        This sessional order took effect on 25 November last year and I do not think there was one complaint from the Opposition after it came into being. I stress with this motion—as I have done with a range of other motions that we have been debating—that, with the exception of one or two or perhaps three honourable senators on the other side of the chamber, everyone in the chamber agrees that this motion is a necessary reform. Although a whole range of honourable senators on the other side of the chamber will be dragging their feet to vote against this motion, they will all hope like hell that it gets up, because there are one or two or three of their colleagues whose contributions they want to have constrained by a sessional order limiting speeches on the second reading to 20 minutes.

        This time limit worked well at the end of the last Parliament, and every honourable senator knows that it worked well. It worked in the best interests of honourable senators themselves and the whole chamber. Let us be clear: it saved absolutely oodles of time in the Government's legislative program. The situation is that interminable, boring, convoluted, irrelevant speeches on the second reading came ad nauseam from the other side of the chamber about every possible red herring and bearing very little relevance to a matter before the chamber and they were used as a filibuster in a deliberate ploy by Opposition senators to ensure that the processes of this chamber bogged down. We all know it. Those opposite all know it. Most of them want this to get up. Look at the smile on Senator Calvert's face. He just hopes like hell that this gets up because he no more wants to listen to Senator Bishop or Senator O'Chee for 30 minutes on a speech on the second reading than I do or Senator Loosley does. None of us does.

This is a reform that worked. It is a reform that most Opposition senators support. It is a reform that they all want to see a majority of senators vote for and I believe that, because of its merits, it is a reform that will be adopted by this Senate as it deserves to be.

        I want to put to the Senate today that many people, as Senator Faulkner has demonstrated with the figures that have been produced for him, speak for 20 minutes or less, but there are occasions on which people need to speak for up to 30 minutes. That would be when the Government jams legislation through this chamber or, for its own purposes, debates Bills cognately, when shadow Ministers or backbenchers find themselves trying to discuss three or four Bills in half an hour—what the Government now wants to make 20 minutes.

        I would like to see us at least consider the possibility that when two or more Bills are being debated cognately we have a 30-minute time limit rather than the 20-minute time limit. I would ask the Democrats to consider that as a possibility—as a compromise for what I think is a stupid decision to have the time limit reduced to 20 minutes. If we were to do that, at least issues could be debated properly here.

He may think it is a waste of time and it shows his attitude towards the role of parliament and the opportunity for representatives of the people to debate Bills and debate issues. We do not think it is a waste of time, but I do believe it is important that we have time to debate Bills in a very full way, especially when we have two or more being debated together. I move:

        —I support Senator Patterson's amendment because it is a fall-back position. I am certainly opposed to reducing time limits for speeches in second reading debates from 30 minutes. Only a short time ago the time limit was an hour, and I go along with that being a bit over the top. Senator Faulkner spent 15 minutes illustrating why we should speak for 20 minutes. In his own words, he should have been able to do that in three or four minutes but he had to extend it to 15 minutes to point out to the chamber why we should speak for 20 minutes. If that is an indication of why we should have 30-minute speeches—to accommodate people such as Senator Faulkner who cannot get their point across—then I think we ought to take that into consideration.

        This particular chamber should have time to examine very thoroughly and make our point on legislation that needs review. To reduce our time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes would be to erode this chamber's necessary rights. I was going to make the point that Senator Patterson did, that an average of 76 per cent of speakers could make their point in 20 minutes. If 76 per cent require only 20 minutes, then the majority is speaking in 20 minutes or less. I think Senator Faulkner would agree that I am not someone who gets up here and speaks on every Bill on every occasion.

        I am totally opposed to this reduction because it is an evasion of our rights, a cutting down of what is meaningful in this Senate, and that is, being able to get up and debate a case thoroughly. I know that when we get into cognate debates towards the end of the session, we jam up to eight or nine Bills together, but surely to goodness we can appeal to the Democrats for a bit of commonsense on this. They did display some commonsense on an amendment about four or five minutes ago. I do not know what the Democrats are up to. This certainly would not have happened in Senator Chipp's time or Senator Haines's time, and I am not sure that the previous leader of the Democrats, Senator Coulter, would have let it happen.

I implore the Democrats to think very seriously about it. I suggest this particularly to Senator Bourne, who gave us an argument a short time ago in relation to the reduction from four minutes to three minutes for the answering of questions during Question Time. She said that we really end up with the same number of questions being answered even if we reduce the time from four minutes to three minutes. The argument she used—and clearly the Senate agreed with her—was that most of the Ministers would answer in three minutes anyway.

        So I plead with the Democrats to allow the flexibility for senators to use 30 minutes on the occasions they do; to, of course, exert natural pressure on our colleagues to make concise contributions; but to recognise that there are many occasions when senators do need that full 30 minutes. None of us like getting up here and wind-bagging for 30 minutes, except for a few notable exceptions, but they are the exceptions. I implore the Democrats to apply the same logic to this debate—that by limiting contributions from 30 minutes down to 20 minutes we will not actually shorten the time the Senate devotes to second reading stages of Bills. Therefore, by keeping it at 30 minutes we are not constraining senators.

        We should not be constrained. We are very much the only legislative chamber in this Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The other place, of course, is not a legislative chamber; it is merely a rubber stamp for the Executive. This is the only chamber where one can properly deliberate upon legislation. For the Democrats to agree with the Government to restrict our time for speaking on second readings is, of course, in contravention of the fundamental reason for this chamber and for us being here. It is, therefore, against the very principles of democracy for which we should stand. I urge the Democrats—indeed, I urge all senators—to oppose this restriction, restraint and constraint upon senators' contributions to second reading debates.

          In August last year the assistance of my office was sought by Tasmanian car rental companies to oppose a proposal by the Federal Airports Corporation to impose on them a particularly severe contract and set of charges. The contract was and is designed to get money out of hire car operators who meet customers at airports after having arranged a contract with them either through a travel agent, by mail or over the telephone. It is not business which is in any way won or touted at the airport.

          Of course, having become a public corporation and being directed by the Labor Party that it should raise its own revenue, the FAC is understandably on the lookout for every little device that it can dream up to make a dollar.

          To meet this corporatisation philosophy and profit seeking goals, the FAC proposal was to impose a three tier structure of charges, with tier one being a staffed desk, tier two an identifying sign and car space and tier three the right to meet customers outside the terminal and no designated car space. For this privilege the operators would have to pay $6,000. That was the first proposal the FAC came up with. Understandably, the car rental operators rejected that proposal outright; understandably, they felt that they were seen as a threat by the major car rental companies which were wanting protection.

          In October a new four tier proposal was put up and that was no better. It still attempted to impose a massive fee increase on small car operators. I said at the time, `It particularly penalises the small businesses who meet only their pre-booked customers at the terminal'. It certainly did. The proposed 11 per cent turnover fee was outrageous compared with the five per cent to be imposed on larger operators. This was at a time when we were still talking about level playing fields. That particular concoction would also mean for the smaller operators a considerable increase in record keeping, audit fees and accountant fees. It was a proposal that the operators were never going to be able to afford.

          These are people who are engaged in private business. They are seldom able to come together on any issue, because if they are not in competition with each other, they are seeking different markets and have little in common in terms of a professional association. But the FAC succeeded in uniting them. To that extent, forceful and sincere language was used in that letter. The upshot is that the letter does not seem to have evoked any meaningful response from the FAC, despite it being fairly clear that the negotiations had reached a stage of mutual stand-offishness—I can only call it that.

          However, the FAC decided that the new contracts, signed or not, were to operate from 1 April. I just wonder what sort of authority the FAC thinks it has to do that. Magnanimously, the operators were given 45 days by the FAC to agree to the proposal. It seems to me that the options these particular people had were a bit like being asked, `Do you want to be throttled, strangled or hung?'. None of the options presented to them were able to be accepted by the operators if they wanted to remain in business.

          To make it worse, the restrictions that we have seen so far have only really been applied to the Tasmanian car rental operators. Why is it that Tasmania is being singled out? Senator Sherry would know. It is because Tasmania is an easy target. It is because it is only Tasmania where these smaller operators have a significant percentage of customers who they meet at airline terminals. Why? People who travel to Tasmania have to cross the water. A lot of them do not bring their cars with them on the aeroplane. They like to hire cars.

They cannot afford to pay that sort of money just to meet somebody—just to stand on the carpet for five minutes—with whom they have already done business, with whom they have already made an arrangement and with whom they have a contract which they wish to fulfil by showing the person where the car is.

          I apologise for monopolising the time, but it is important that I raise tonight another matter that is also Tasmanian-oriented. As senators, we are here to represent concerns in our own States. I draw the attention of the Senate to recent activities of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission. Constituents of mine living and farming organically around the Lorinna water catchment were horrified to learn that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission had gone ahead and sprayed the herbicide Atrazine in the Lorinna area, after much pleading and after the residents had pointed out how residual Atrazine is.

          As of today four residents of this sparsely populated area have been arrested so far, fighting to protect their right to uncontaminated water. For five years, the residents have been fighting to protect their water catchment—firstly from logging, which resulted in significant siltation of the water supply, and now from being sprayed with a very persistent herbicide. This herbicide, Atrazine, in its various forms is recommended by some manufacturers to be applied at the suggested minimum rate of 55 litres per hectare and up to 110 litres per hectare.

If Atrazine is applied at a rate of 6.5 litres per hectare, it will persist in the soil for 18 months. Higher rates of application will persist a great deal longer, perhaps several years.

In that particularly peaceful setting of Tasmania, this is something which has until now been readily available. I call on the Tasmanian health authorities to provide a written guarantee to these people that the chemical will not turn up in the local water supply. Further, I call on them to provide a guarantee that the State Government will compensate these people if they are denied `Level A' organic producer accreditation from the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia. If that certification is not available due to the actions of the forestry commission, I believe that the State Government of Tasmania is liable for having caused that certification to be unavailable to those people. Until now, they have certainly been able to attain that accreditation.

         The Tasmanian Forestry Commission—or indeed any person the Minister looks favourably upon—can be exempted from this Act. That effectively makes the Act hardly worth the paper it is printed upon. The situation can only be described as a disgrace. The legislation to protect Tasmania's environment must be amended to do what it is supposed to do—protect the environment. As it is, the people of Tasmania are faced with legislation in the shape in which it might have been in the 1940s. What is accepted as best environmental management practice in most of the developed world just does not exist here.

          Many of the people of Lorinna have chosen to make the valley their home due to its cleanliness and proximity to pristine world heritage areas. But the Forestry Commission, by spraying herbicide in the local water catchment, has put at risk a valuable and potentially growing export market. The export market for Tasmanian organic food is set to boom. Rainwater from Tasmania is already sold overseas because of the demand for a pure product. That is an image which has rested easily upon Tasmania until now.

          The food grown organically and exported will undoubtedly grow in volume in successive years partly, I must say, because on 3 May this year the Commonwealth Government commissioned the advertising agency Mojo to develop a clean food export strategy, at a cost of some $5 million. Quite rightly, the Commonwealth Government believes that it is worth investing that sort of money. Yet that sort of investment is jeopardised by the activities that have gone on under the auspices of the Tasmanian Government. Clean green Minister Crean quite rightly identifies with this push. I dare say that he should be offended by actions which compromise that clean green push. In Australia, in 1990, the Australian domestic organic market was worth some $28.7 million. In that year, in the United Kingdom, sales of organic produce were estimated to be worth $217 million—representing two per cent of total expenditure by British citizens in food shops. The West German health food cooperative Neuform sold $750 million worth of organic health food in 1985. The potential has been recognised by Minister Crean.

          This market is particularly sensitive. Any food that has lost its organic accreditation status due to contamination by chemicals will not be sold on the sorts of markets that I have been describing. The market is an informed market. It is a market which seeks the certification, the signal, that the food has been properly accredited, and it is a market which is prepared to pay for that accreditation. Consumers of organic food usually are quite happy to pay 10 or 20 per cent more, with premium quality produce perhaps even commanding 40 per cent more, than conventionally produced foods. Things like organically produced chickens will command perhaps even 80 or 100 per cent above other retail prices.

The organic food producers of Lorinna are well aware of the fact that so many modern consumers feel very strongly about the food they eat and are prepared to pay considerably more for what they see as necessary for their wellbeing.
