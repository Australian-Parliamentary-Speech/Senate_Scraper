This week we all know where he is, although the minister did not seem to want to mention it. We all know that both Senator Ray and Senator Cook are in Malaysia. Our relations with Malaysia could have been helped in other ways, rather than by sending ministers there after the event. But that is by the way.

        The important issue is on what basis the government can, at its whim, decide ministers are going to go off on various conferences or for other reasons not attend question time. We have always accepted that, in relation to CHOGMs, or meetings of the forum in the Pacific, or longstanding, regular commitments in exceptional circumstances, it is legitimate. But this government is now going far beyond the normal, legitimate, accepted practice of the past. We at least ought to be given the courtesy of reasons as to why this is going to occur.

        Mr Deputy President, you might have picked up that Senator Cook is not going to come back until after the Senate has risen. Apparently, he will not be here for the whole fortnight. Why is it necessary for the minister to be away from the parliament for the whole fortnight—a junior minister at that? It might well be that Senator Gareth Evans feels that he can pick up the trade portfolio again, but that is not a legitimate justification either.

He does not see the responsibility to the parliament in the way that it was traditionally seen. It is just another example of his general attitude to the process, which he sees as more of a nuisance than as part of constructive democracy. On some occasion, can we get some general guidelines as to the basis upon which the government is going to decide which ministers will attend when—which conferences are of such note that ministers need not attend before the parliament? This is now getting to the ridiculous stage.

        These are not discretionary bilateral visits. It may have escaped Senator Hill's notice that the Uruguay Round is reaching its final stages and will not be completed until 15 December. Senator Cook, after a brief stop in Malaysia, will be going on to Geneva where he will be spending, in effect, the whole of that time in the last stages of the negotiations in his capacity—Senator Hill may have overlooked this—as chairman of the Cairns Group. Ministers from all over the world will be attending those negotiations in Geneva.

        Senator Ray is involved in the annual Langkawi defence industry exhibition and sales promotion exercise which is taking place in Malaysia. The dates for it are specified without regard to the timing of our Senate sittings. As far back as I can remember it has been regarded as appropriate by ministers to attend and to lead Australian defence industry delegations on these occasions.

How does the minister explain to Australian business why it should suffer as a result of the gratuitous indulgences of the Prime Minister? How could the minister also have got it so wrong when he advised the Senate on 25 November this year that, in his opinion, the relationship was `unlikely to be blown off course by the cross-winds of this kind'? Why did he not immediately, after the offensive remarks by Mr Keating, seek to minimise the damage rather than talk down the likely consequences?

I hope very much that the Malaysian cabinet may be prepared to accept a cooling-off period—a pause for reflection—before taking any further punitive or retaliatory measures of the kind that have been foreshadowed. I will certainly be making every effort that I can, including direct contact with my counterpart, if possible, to see what might be achievable in this respect.

         Our basic message remains very simple: no offence was intended and, if it was taken, we regret that. We value our relationship with Malaysia. We will do everything we reasonably can to keep it warm and productive, with the visits of Senator Cook and Senator Ray being current demonstrations of our commitment in that respect. But if a good relationship is to continue, it must be wanted and worked for by both sides.

         It may be helpful to reflect on the circumstances that have surrounded each stage of the development of this problem. When each side understands how the other perceives a problem, there is usually a better chance of resolving it. In the first place, it would be helpful if the Malaysian side were to acknowledge the circumstances in which Mr Keating's original remarks were made. He had been asked on numerous previous occasions about his attitude to Dr Mahathir's non-appearance in Seattle and on each occasion replied in neutral terms.

         However, on 21 November the question was put in the form of a request for comment on a reported statement in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          New York Times
         </emphasis>
         that morning by Dr Mahathir that, `Perhaps you have to thumb your nose at people before they notice you'. To the extent that Mr Keating's reply emerged more sharply on this occasion than it had in earlier replies, this was an understandable reaction in the circumstances. I note that that was certainly the reaction of the opposition spokesmen Mr Peacock and Mr Fischer, and I do not think that their change of heart subsequently does them much credit.

         In the second place, I think it would be helpful for Australians to understand the cultural context in which Mr Keating's remark was reported in Malaysia. The Malay word for `recalcitrant' is `kurang ajar' and to call someone kurang ajar in Malay, I discovered just a few days ago, is extremely insulting, much more so than the use of the English word would indicate. It means in Malay that one is ill-educated; it reflects seriously on one's background and family, implying that one's parents did not bring one up properly. I understand that Mr Keating's comment had all the more resonance in Malaysia, or at least in the Malay language press, because it was made just a few days after a particularly acrimonious exchange involving the use and subsequent withdrawal of this expression between a Malaysian minister and a member of the opposition Democratic Action Party.

         A third circumstance that should be taken into account by each country in evaluating the actions of the other is the very different way in which Australian and Malaysian political cultures operate in response to issues of this kind. In Malaysia when some real or perceived international slight is reported, then—other things being equal—the media and just about all other interest groups tend to reflexively line up in defence of the person or institution in question. In Australia, by contrast, the media and other key interest groups are very much more likely to line up against the person or institution in question, assuming that if a criticism is made there must be some case to answer. In these circumstances, the two different kinds of national reactions tend to feed off each other, with every report generating another round, respectively, of indignation and self-laceration.

         A fourth circumstance that perhaps needs to be appreciated by the Malaysian side is that we in Australia cannot help but feel a little wounded by the strength of a number of the reported comments and reactions coming from Malaysia. Not only were there the actions taken by the information minister, and a number of statements made suggesting that commercial relationships with Australia were at risk—

        Even taking into account the questions of translation to which I have referred, this goes much further than any Australian statement. Mr Keating's letter last week made the point very clearly that his remarks had not been calculated to offend: if he was less than fulsomely conciliatory or apologetic than Dr Mahathir would have preferred him to be, then perhaps some of the background atmosphere against which the letter was written will help explain why.

         Finally, the important thing at this stage is that no action be taken which will make the present situation worse than it is. With a relationship as fundamentally strong as Australia's and Malaysia's, there is no inherent reason why it need go off the rails. If we can have a cooling off period—and if we each make a real effort to understand why the other side has acted and reacted as it has—then there is no reason why our relationship cannot flourish in the future as it has in the past.

They have agreed to prepare a proposal to launch low orbiting satellites on an equatorial course from the very north of Australia near Darwin. The two-stage rockets are very inexpensive and very small. The satellite would be around 250 kilograms and would be used for remote monitoring and sensing work on a commercial basis only.

         I notice that in this morning's media, the chief of the Australian Space Council and also the director of the Northern Territory Economic Development Organisation, Professor Watt, talked about a $6 million to $10 million program for building this site, which would be within a 30-kilometre radius of Darwin. The rockets would take off eastwards in an equatorial orbit over the sea. Again, I want to emphasise that all appropriate measures will be considered, including an environmental impact statement.

         I am pleased that the efforts of the Australian Space Office over the last few months, in consultation with the Australian company KITComm, have enabled us to get to this stage. When the actual development takes place is a matter for further discussion. Again, I emphasise that no Australian federal government money is required for this investment. However, we will continue to provide all advice that is appropriate. Again, this is another significant step forward in getting Australia a modest but reliable space program.

         Our reaction, however, is as I have described it: we do not accept that the Prime Minister's original remarks were as have been described. Indeed, it will be recalled, I hope, by those from the other side who can bring a little honesty to bear in this debate that the initial reactions of Mr Peacock and Mr Fischer, both of whom publicly commented at the time, were very understanding of Mr Keating's remark and said as much at the time because they well knew the context, as I have described it today and as has been described before, in which Mr Keating made his remark.

I believe and the government believes that the response that has been given by Mr Keating, in which he has made it absolutely clear that no offence was intended and that, if offence was taken, it is regretted, is an appropriate response under the circumstances and ought to be accepted by the Malaysian government in the spirit in which that response has been given.

There was music, dancing, poetry and Aboriginal dance theatre. The Bankstown Girls High School was there. It reflected the range and diversity of talent in families across Australia. The International Year of the Family will provide a unique opportunity for Australians to celebrate the diversity and vibrancy of Australian families.

At one point on the page he said that it would mean that the Commonwealth would collect more taxes and the states would lose taxes; then 200 words later, he advocated that there should be changes to the arrangements for income tax collected on behalf of the states by the Commonwealth—exactly the same issue within 200 words. Pardon me, the memory lapse is getting worse. The fevered leadership speculation, I am afraid, is going to his judgment. There may be some other explanation for his irrationality, but it seems to me that is an extraordinary error of judgment.

How can the people of Australia be expected to take the Prime Minister's rhetoric on reconciliation seriously when he makes this sort of statement which urges division and confrontation—a statement which has been described by respected Aboriginal leader Charles Perkins as sounding like an incitement to physical conflict and `the worst thing he has heard a politician say'?

         The point that the Prime Minister is making is simply this: the Native Title Bill itself has been the product of an extraordinarily protracted consultative process and represents the closest thing to consensus we are ever likely to achieve on a piece of legislation as sensitive as this, as difficult as this, as far reaching as this in this country. It does attempt to strike a balance between the principles, on the one hand, of justice for Aboriginal people and, on the other hand, recognition of the reality of land management issues and the economic interests and needs of this country.

         It is a process of consultation which has produced, as I say, a consensus piece of legislation, to the extent that consensus is ever achievable in a piece of legislation of this kind. Under those circumstances, Mr Keating is simply making the point, in his usual graphic and effective way, that it is very much in the interests of the nation and very much in the interests of the Aboriginal people themselves, whose leadership he was addressing and whose leadership is absolutely committed to this legislation, to ensure that by any appropriate means it is passed.

         The federal government will pay $500 million over the next 10 years to purchase treatment for entitled veterans and war widows which will guarantee their health care into the next century. They will continue to have access to Hollywood for its full range of excellent treatment services without having to obtain authority first from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

         The Beecroft Peninsula has been used by the navy since at least 1896. It has also been used regularly by the Royal Australian Navy under lease from the New South Wales government since 1944 and it has now been acquired by the Commonwealth. A claim made to the federal minister for aboriginal affairs in December 1989 over the whole of the peninsula, excluding the village of Currarong, was not supported because the Commonwealth-owned lands on the peninsula are held under freehold title. Any further land claims made over the area will obviously need to be fully considered by a court or a tribunal.

One of the people who asked a question was an accountant who said that he had done a lot of accountancy work for child care and that he had examined the cost of child care. He had found figures of $40 to $60, but the average was $44, sometimes $30 and sometimes $13. He wanted to know how I could say 88c. My view is that, if he were examining the costs in a child-care centre and could get a variation of from $13 to $60 on his own figures, there was quite clearly some room for discussion about what exactly was being included in the figures.

Staffing arrangements are a matter of the state, not of these accreditations. It has always been understood that way. The number of staff per child is a matter of state regulations and those regulations are set by the states; they are not proposed to be changed by the accreditation, which does not address staffing. The private child-care sector and the opposition must appreciate that the staffing arrangements are not included in these figures to any large extent. The relief staff for the accreditation process is incorporated but the staffing arrangement Senator Boswell is talking to is a matter for states and properly does not belong in the accreditation figuring.

         —There have been a number of major articles in the last two days referring to, unfortunately, the continuing problems that piracy is causing the shipping industry, particularly now with the adoption of far more advanced forms of attack on merchant shipping which involve both automatic weapons and explosives. These attacks not only involve a threat to the safety of the ship's crew but also a serious threat to the risk of collision or pollution if the ship is then left disabled with no crew in control. This is a major international problem requiring cooperation between nations to coordinate efforts in regions where there is a relatively high level of pirate activity.

         Australia strongly supports action that is currently being taken by the United Nations International Maritime Organisation to deal with the problem. Since the early 1980s the IMO has received over 400 reports of piracy and armed robbery against ships, with almost half of that number occurring in the last three years. So, clearly, this is a problem which is escalating. The IMO believes that the actual total is considerably higher than this.

         Unfortunately for Australia, our major trading routes coincide with some of the main danger areas in the world for piracy. Five Australian ships have been attacked by pirates in these areas. In January this year the IMO convened a special working group on piracy in the South-East Asian region, comprising experts from seven member countries including Australia. This group travelled to the Malacca-Singapore straits area in March this year and received full cooperation from these coastal states. This resulted in action by local authorities, which has seen a substantial improvement in shipping security in this region in the last few months.

         The report of the IMO working group has been widely distributed. It recommended a comprehensive range of procedures and measures that can be taken by ships and crews to protect themselves from piracy. These include: development by ships of an action plan to combat piracy, including heightened surveillance, better lighting on board the ships, securing and regularly inspecting the key access doors of the ships, and detection equipment, such as the provision of an additional stern radar to warn of approaching small craft.

         In September this year, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority issued a marine notice for Australian shipping that was based on these recommendations. The main thrust of the anti-piracy measures taken so far by the international community has been in the form of advice to shipowners on measures that can be taken when transiting the high risk areas and recommendations to coastal states in the areas of known pirate activity.

         In addition, Australian naval vessels are provided daily with information concerning the location of Australian vessels and they are able to offer humanitarian assistance to any vessel in distress, including a ship which is under attack. This applies both on the high seas and in another country's territorial waters, with the limitation that Australian vessels may not pursue or capture the offenders. Australia will continue to cooperate with countries in the region and with the wider international community in efforts to combat this serious threat to our international trading fleet.

Is the government also aware that the delays caused by the minister's politically based directive are threatening the ability of Landcare groups to undertake their projects because of the seasonal nature of these projects? Why has Minister Kelly seen fit to politicise $7 million in Landcare funding at the expense of the environment?

         —The Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council received a report a few months ago on the role of intellectual property in innovation. This was a response from particularly the industries concerned that we get the maximum advantage from the development of science R&amp;D in Australia by protecting it internationally as well as nationally in the intellectual property area. As a result of those recommendations to PMSEC, the government established an IDC and has responded. Two weeks ago I was able to announce that the government has endorsed the need to raise the profile of intellectual property and will undertake programs increasing the awareness and understanding of intellectual property issues throughout the business sector and higher education research institutions.

         The PMSEC report estimated that, in world markets, intellectual property supports $600 billion worth of industrial products and processes annually. What must be emphasised in the Australian context is that, as our manufacturing exports grow, our international competitiveness will be underpinned by our ability to obtain protection for intellectual property.

On behalf of the government, I would certainly like to place on record our appreciation of the efforts of the working group that reported to PMSEC, upon which the government has taken these decisions to enhance the intellectual property system in Australia.

         It is premature to be making any pessimistic evaluations at this stage about where this process is going, although a number of pessimistic scenarios have been around since this became an issue some time ago. In the event that non-compliance seems inevitable with the IAEA processes, the next step would be to refer the matter to the security council of the UN. But there are many steps to go through before it gets to that stage, and there are a great many steps to contemplate before one would have to deal with the possibility of the security council in turn recommending some more decisive military action. I simply do not want to speculate about that at this stage. I do not think any government in the world would want to at this stage.

I intentionally did not ask this question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs because I did not want any of the flim-flam and delusions that pass for assessments that come out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The specific question is: has any planning been done by the Department of Defence against the contingencies if the worst case arises and North Korea does not cooperate with the United States and the United Nations? This is a matter in which Australia has a vital interest, because we would inevitably be involved in it in some way or another. We have certainly shown an interest in supporting the United Nations in the past in guaranteeing some sort of actions in the Korean peninsula. For those reasons, I am a little disappointed that the foreign minister prated in on this. I ask Senator Faulkner whether he will take it up with the Department of Defence and find out whether it has looked at the situation at all.

He also said that there was a need to avoid the potential to damage our commercial relationship with Malaysia. That commercial damage has already occurred. It is no good pretending otherwise.

         Senator Gareth Evans made some remarks to try to excuse the Prime Minister but I think Senator Evans's response has probably added to the problem because he pointed out that the Prime Minister, in making this gratuitous insult, did not know what the word `recalcitrant' meant to the Malaysians. Senator Evans pointed out that it meant ill-educated and reflected on the family and background. Having learnt that, surely it is up to the Prime Minister to do something about it.

         Negotiations are at the stage where the company is expecting a phone call or communication from Malaysia to give the go-ahead. Things have gone quiet. The manager said, `They have gone very quiet'. This order, worth $30 million, was the largest order this company had ever had. It has had some success in placing vehicles into Asia. Its last big order was 40 vehicles into Japan. This contract into Malaysia to provide civilian and army ambulances would have been the icing on the cake for this local Tamworth company which just this week celebrated 30 years in business. So it is a real kick in the guts, a real kick in the head, to this company, and it is a real disincentive for people in Australian industries to do something.

         Unlike what the minister said on 25 November—that the relationship was unlikely to be blown off course by cross-winds of this kind—it would seem that it has been blown off course. When I note that in my own state of Tasmania 300 university students from Malaysia are likely to be largely affected, and when we see the damage that this will do to education not only in Tasmania but right around Australia, we see that it is a very serious matter.

I can quote actual instances of the sale of engineering services to Malaysia being put at risk by the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

         All I can say under those circumstances is that we will do our best to try to resolve the issue. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a considered, deliberate and careful effort to do so last week with his letter, making clear that it was not a calculated intention to offend; and he made it further clear over the weekend that, if it had that effect, then he regretted it. So the language has been used which one hopes will prove to have some effect, particularly if, as I said today, we can go through some cooling off process and some slightly more systematic attempt on each side to understand what the other has, in fact, been saying in the context in which it has been said.

        Away they went, and they have been fiercely critical ever since. The only thing that has moved on in this situation is the political breeze as it is perceived by members of the opposition. They think there is an opportunity to make some political capital out of this and have been doing so with totally hypocritical indignation ever since. If it was understandable for those remarks to be made in the opinion and judgment of opposition spokesmen, some of whom, certainly in the case of Mr Peacock, are amply experienced in this matter, then it should remain understandable in the context in which those remarks were made. What we have to try to do, however, is to ensure in a non-partisan, cool atmosphere that this issue is resolved as quickly as we can. I hope that we would have support rather than criticism from the opposition in that endeavour.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Christopher Evans this day, relating to the High Court's forthcoming decision on State business franchise fees.

       <para>
        Earlier today Senator McMullan, in responding to a question from Senator Chris Evans in reference to tomorrow's expected High Court decision in the so-called Capital Distributors case, attempted amongst other things to point to what he saw as an inconsistency in remarks that had been made in the last day or so by my colleague in the other place Mr Peter Reith in his statements about the matter.

         Several points need to be made in relation to the situation that the Commonwealth may find itself in tomorrow if, as seems likely and as is expected, the High Court finds that the states can no longer collect more than $3 billion in franchise fees. If that is the outcome of tomorrow's case, then that will obviously play very much into the hands of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, as we know, is the most centralist prime minister that this nation has ever had. He is a prime minister who has no regard whatsoever for the rights of the states, either those rights that the states have been given under the Constitution or otherwise through convention.

         What concerns me, therefore, is that in the hearings before the High Court earlier this year the Commonwealth Solicitor-General informed the court on 20 April this year that if the states' powers to impose business franchise fees were overturned, then the Commonwealth would impose new taxes in their place. In other words, we would have a reduction in taxes collected by the states because of the High Court decision against the collection any longer of franchise fees. But, `Not to worry, states', says the Solicitor-General to the High Court, `because the Commonwealth will impose new taxes in their place'. That is a fairly extraordinary proposition to put, in my view. It is certainly highly inappropriate for a Solicitor-General to put to the High court because it runs the very serious risk of influencing the High Court's decision. The High Court's decision should be based on its own neutral analysis of the laws and actions and powers of the states under the Constitution.

         What has not been answered in this place, to my knowledge, is whether the Solicitor-General was instructed by the government to make that commitment for new taxes so as to influence the High Court's decision against them, as indeed has been claimed by the states through at least two of the state premiers.

         I would like to know, and I think the Australian public has a right to know, when cabinet made this decision about new taxes because that is what we are talking about. We are talking about the Commonwealth imposing new taxes. Australians have the right to know—the parliament and the taxpayers need to know—how many Australians will have to pay more tax under the Commonwealth's proposals. On the face of it, it looks as though the Commonwealth government would be simply adding yet a further episode to its ongoing saga of expansion of the Commonwealth's indirect tax base, including, in particular, sales tax and excise—the very prospect against which it has railed for so long.

         What Mr Reith has said in recent days, which I would have thought no right-minded federalist who believes in the separation of powers between the Commonwealth and the states and the rights of the states could possibly disagree with, is the proposition that, as any new consumption tax imposed by the Commonwealth will enhance the power of the Commonwealth, any new system must contain a quid pro quo. In other words, in some way the Commonwealth must make room for the states in some aspects of revenue collection just to maintain the status quo. But to say that if the states lose a revenue base a la the High Court decision tomorrow, if that in fact happens, we simply compensate by increasing Commonwealth taxes seems to add to the already enormous increase in centralism and the centralising of power under this government.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator West this day, relating to the extension of the F3 Freeway linking Sydney and Newcastle.

       <para>
        Last week I joined with Senator Collins in the opening of the latest stage of the F3 freeway which completes the link into Newcastle. It was a great occasion and it has achieved a lot but, in his response today, Senator Collins was very misleading in claiming that this road is finished. Certainly, the completion of the latest link—19 kilometres of road linking into the centre of Newcastle—has done and will continue to do a great deal for the trade and commerce of the city, particularly as it knocks 15 minutes off the travelling time between Sydney and Newcastle.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I would like to point out to the Senate that this road is by no means finished. As a matter of fact, quite an incredible gap now exists in the national highway system just north of Newcastle. At the end of the F3 there is an eight kilometre gap through to the Pacific Highway and to the New England Highway. The government's plan is that this road link will not be completed for 10 to 20 years. In the meantime, an enormous traffic snarl will occur, particularly at Christmas time. I invite Senator Collins to come up a few days before Christmas and see what happens at the end of the F3.

         1. On 22 November 1993 following a recommendation by the Selection of Bills Committee contained in its Report No. 10 of 1993, the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill 1993 (the Bill) was referred to this Committee by the Senate. The Committee undertook enquires into the Bill including a public hearing and received a number of submissions and revised submissions from interested parties advocating amendments to the Bill. The Committee was to table its report to the Senate by Monday, 6 December 1993.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         2. Details of the framework embodied in the proposed legislation were forwarded to state and territory governments, industry and gas users for comment. The process of discussions on the scheme were expedited because of the deadline for introducing the legislation into the Parliament. The Second Reading Speech indicates the Government wants the scheme established by the Bill in place before the end of this financial year to assist the sale of the Moomba-Wilton Pipeline. The Bill is said to provide certainty for potential buyers of that pipeline by clearly setting out the regulatory environment that will apply to that and future interstate gas pipelines.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         3. At and following the public hearing on 26 November, the Department and the Association continued negotiations in an attempt to resolve outstanding differences about the regulatory scheme. While substantial progress has occurred, areas of dispute remain. On 3 December 1993, the Minister for Resources, the Hon. Michael Lee MP, wrote to the Committee to advise that the Bill will be dropped down the order of business and will be brought forward for debate early in the next session of Parliament. The Minister's letter outlines the current state of negotiations between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Australian Gas Association and reports more work is needed to resolve outstanding issues.

         4. The Committee therefore has resolved to seek an extension of time to report on the second sitting day of the first session of Parliament in 1994. This extension will enable the Committee to facilitate negotiations between the parties and report the outcome to the Senate.

         Since the Standing Committee hearings on 26 November connected with the above bill, the Department and the Australian Gas Association (AGA) have been in close consultation with the objective of resolving outstanding issues. As I understand it, there remains one key matter of difference to address; that is the issue of the interstate pipelines that will be covered by the bill, and defining these in an effective way that achieves certainty and avoids circumvention on the intention of the legislation. More work is needed to ensure that "delivery points" are not used as an artifice to circumvent the third party access and antimonopoly provisions of the Bill. I have therefore agreed that Departmental discussion with industry will continue and I will consider the need for any amendments arising from these discussions.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On the other matters raised by the Association during the Committee's hearings, I advise the Committee that I am prepared to introduce an amendment that will enable the interstate carrier to refuse the provision of haulage services to another person if the proposed arrangements do not comply with minimum "objective" standards. The standard will be based on national or industry standards and will be determined following consultation between the Department, the Trade Practices Commission and the AGA.

         On the question of a statement to the Parliament on the issues raised by the Association, I have noted the Association's request and will be mindful of this when framing a statement following finalisation of all the amendments to the bill decided as appropriate.

         I rise to speak on the seventh annual report of the Affirmative Action Agency, which covers the period June 1992 to May 1993. As honourable senators will recall, unlike the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who has the task of enforcing anti-discrimination legislation which prohibits discriminatory behaviour, the Director of the Affirmative Action Agency has the job of removing discrimination from the workplace by requiring employers to take positive action to ensure that their employment practices do not discriminate against women. Organisations covered by the Affirmative Action Act are required to develop and implement an affirmative action program and to report on the program annually to the Affirmative Action Agency.

          The annual report of the Affirmative Action Agency, which has been tabled in the Senate today, covers a significant period in the history of the agency. The last year has seen the completion of the first major review of the effectiveness of the affirmative action legislation, although much of the work of the review was completed in 1991-92. The final report,
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Quality and Commitment: The Next Steps
          </emphasis>
          was published in January 1993.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The report has found that, while a high rate of compliance with the act has been achieved over the last five years, a great deal still has to be done to achieve equality of opportunity for women in the workplace. We only have to look at how few women have reached the top echelons of both business and government organisations to see evidence of this.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           The last year has also been significant for the agency because of a number of structural and policy changes to the agency's function. Not only has the agency become a statutory authority but also its director has been given the power to vary reporting requirements for those organisations with an excellent record on affirmative action. In addition, from January of this year the federal government has adopted a policy of contract compliance whereby employers who fail to comply with the Affirmative Action Act are no longer eligible for government contracts for goods or services and specified forms of industry assistance.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Finally, changes to the affirmative action legislation late last year also extended the role of the agency. From 1994 onwards, voluntary bodies with 100 or more paid employees will have to lodge affirmative action reports with the agency. As a result, around 147 non-government schools, 143 community organisations, and some 44 group training companies will be reporting to the agency for the first time in 1994.

          While the coalition did not oppose the extended coverage of the act at the time it went through the Senate, we were aware of concerns expressed by some voluntary bodies regarding the expense involved in the reporting requirements and, further, that failure to comply with the legislation could jeopardise government assistance. Given the invaluable role many voluntary organisations have in our community, I would like to see next year's annual report address in some detail the impact the reporting requirements are having on these bodies.

        <para>
         In taking note of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit of the national highway, I want to point out to the Senate that I believe the government has acted very inefficiently in regard to part of this project. The inefficiency relates to a problem concerning the construction of the F3 freeway north of Newcastle. I made some remarks about this earlier today after the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) was asked a question in this place by Senator West. The minister in his answer lauded the construction of the last section of the freeway into Newcastle. He referred to the world-class standard of that road. He somewhat unfairly interjected on my comment, saying that I did not say what I said when I saw him at the freeway opening.

          I said precisely what I was going to say when I spoke to the minister at the F3 freeway. I told him then that I would compliment all authorities—state, local and federal—in the Senate on their efforts in getting that section of the F3 freeway into Newcastle completed in such quick time. I said that I would also compliment all levels of government on the standard of the road and on the fact that, at last, the centre of Sydney is linked to the centre of Newcastle, and expand on what that will mean for the local economy. I really feel that I have done what I said I would do.

          I also said to the minister that this road is not finished. One of the most disturbing things I saw on the plaque on the side of the road was the bit at the bottom that says, `This marks the completion of the Newcastle-Sydney freeway'. The Newcastle-Sydney freeway is a concept that is about 20 years out of date. Certainly the intention originally was to link the two cities. Indeed, the freeway came through the centre of Newcastle on the original plan.

          About 15 years ago, it was realised that there needed to be many more roads to the north. North of Newcastle a booming north coast was developing. Further north of that was one of the fastest growing areas in Australia, which is Brisbane and the environment around it. Sydney also needed an excellent link road between those two cities. The original concept of the expressway was completely out of date. People should have been talking about the freeway into northern New South Wales, which certainly was not, and still is not, finished.

While the Federal and State governments deserve applause for the funding and construction of the road, they should also remember that the job is not really finished. A 60 km per hour zone and a roundabout at Ourimbah hardly suggests freeway conditions and petering out of the freeway into a two lane road at its Northern end could be dangerous. These problems should be resolved quickly.

          The minister announced at the opening of the road that feasibility studies and environmental impact studies were being done on a link road from Sugarloaf to the Branxton section of the New England Highway. That road is very necessary to take heavy trucks, and it would do enormous things for the city of Cessnock and the town of Kurri Kurri, which have been suffering under the current traffic arrangements for the past eight years. It should have been well advanced by this stage.

I suggest that it be given a higher priority before it is done. It certainly should be done. On the minister's planning, the job is probably 10 to 20 years away from completion.

We urgently need to overcome this problem. It is not only a matter of taking Sydney traffic to the north. As the minister is well aware from the letters to him and his response to the people of Beresfield, there are many other traffic snarl problems in this area. Into that traffic snarl, this road feeds Sydney traffic on a one-lane system.

          The government had the bright idea of completing the northbound section of the freeway and making Lenaghans Drive, a two-laned road, a one-way southbound section. If it were out in the middle of nowhere, that would be a sensible idea. But, in effect, this part of the road is in a fairly rapidly developing area of western Newcastle. There are a whole lot of plans to put in even further developments there. I wonder how the locals who go up and down those roads will cope. If this one-way road system proceeds, a person who wants to visit a neighbour who is in the wrong direction by one kilometre will have to travel eight kilometres up the road and come down another six or seven kilometres on the other side of it.

          The answer is fairly obvious. When the Roads and Traffic Authority does the monitoring of traffic on this road, it will become extremely apparent that a much higher priority must be given to the proper completion of the F3 Freeway, which means linking it to the New England Highway and the Pacific Highway. This currently huge gap in the national highway system in one of the busiest areas of Australia will then finally be removed.

          —I want to say a few words on the Auditor-General's report No. 15 of 1993-94, which is an efficiency report that has been undertaken under the provisions of the Audit Act. It is an important report because it is an audit into the government's national highway program. The national highway links Australia's major cities. It is a large program which provides for the construction and maintenance of the national highway. It is fully funded by the Commonwealth government and is administered by the Department of Transport and Communications, or DOTAC, by way of special purpose payments under section 96 of the constitution.

          The budget for this program is large. In the last financial year, 1992-93, the budget for the national highway was $810 million. As I understand from the report, the proposals for a new national highway program to be introduced during 1994 are currently being considered. Because of that, the report by the Auditor-General has particular relevance at this time.

          The Auditor-General reviewed the economy, the efficiency and the cost effectiveness of the management of the program's funding as administered by the Department of Transport and Communications. In his report, the Auditor-General has identified the scope for DOTAC to considerably improve its management of the program. As the Auditor-General said in his summary of the key points:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO considers that the Government intention evidenced in various statements requires DOTAC to actively manage and maximise benefits nationally. This is also consistent with the general requirements for special purpose payments. DOTAC considers—
        </para>
        <para>
         this is in response to the Auditor-General's comments and findings—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         that it has given effect to the Government's intentions, and has exercised an appropriate form of program management in the context of the policy framework of the current program.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General says that there is a divergence of views between his office and DOTAC in respect of DOTAC's role in managing the national highway program. The Auditor-General states that this:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . highlights an apparent ambiguity that should be formally resolved before the introduction of the new program in 1994 or if the current program is extended.
        </para>
        <para>
         I hope in his response to this report the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) will inform the Senate of the government's views on this ambiguity and what is being done to resolve it. The Auditor-General continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO established some network management criteria and found opportunities for DOTAC to achieve potential savings and improvements in program oversight. The ANAO considers the audit findings are relevant to both the existing program and new program.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General believes that economies can be found out of the budget for the national highway program. He believes that there are ways to `drive the roads dollar further'. There has been notable evidence over recent years to support that view. The Auditor-General goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report of July 1992 identified a maintenance repair option that could result in average annual savings of up to 15%.
        </para>
        <para>
         On my calculations, 15 per cent adds up to around $60 million per year. That is, by any person's definition, a lot of money if it can be used more efficiently through improved arrangements. The Auditor-General stated in the report that as well as those improvements:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Economies could be achieved by negotiating reductions in the administration expenses of State Road Authorities.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report specifically mentions two economies that can be achieved. They are project management and contract administration costs which have the potential cost saving of up to $21 million and a further potential saving of up to $8 million through general administrative costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          They are some of the ways taxpayers could get better value for their dollars spent on roads under the national highways program. There are other aspects that were commented on in the audit report. The audit report states that management requires improvement. For example, the report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         DOTAC should ensure monthly payments match the States' actual expenditure and take account of surplus cash from the previous year. ANAO found that in 1992-93 the Commonwealth lost a potential $4.1m in interest on ALTD fund payments surplus to the States' requirements, of which $2m was on payments for the National Highway.
        </para>
        <para>
         Those matters are of serious concern. They are points with which DOTAC does not agree in all instances. Indeed DOTAC contests many of the findings of the audit report in relation to the current program. For that reason, that places further importance on the need for the government to give a considered response to the audit report. If there are differences of view, then they ought to be resolved. I hope the minister will respond to this report. I did not get the feeling from the minister's body language that we will get much of a response at the moment. I hope that there will be a formal response to some of these matters because I presume we are close to looking at the 1994 program. This is another useful report from the Auditor-General and one which requires a response from the government and certainly warrants careful consideration by this chamber.

The fundamental situation is, and I have no intention of changing it, that the Commonwealth provides the money for these projects.

          I point out to Senator Short that we have a group of 30 officers in the department who are responsible at the Commonwealth end for administering the national highway system. The Victorian state government administers an equal length of road—that is, 18,500 kilometres; a useful benchmark—with a group of 1,500 bureaucrats, not 30. If people want to go down this track, it is perfectly possible that the Commonwealth could set up a much larger bureaucracy with its own in-house engineers. We could set up our own pavement testing systems. Senator Short will acknowledge that that is mentioned in the Auditor-General's report. But we choose not to do that. The best results that can be achieved for taxpayers in Australia, and we can demonstrate this, is by not duplicating what state government authorities already efficiently provide.

          We provided every cent of the $225 million in funding for the F3 freeway project but the project was managed by the New South Wales department of works. It managed the project very efficiently. In past years there have been fixed allocations to the states and there has been the provision that where projects come in under budget the money is retained by the state and rolled over into other road projects. As Senator Short well knows, there is never any shortage of road projects on which we can effectively spend taxpayers' dollars.

          I think that has provided a very efficient in-house efficiency measure on state government road authorities—that is, in order to stretch the Commonwealth dollar for the states' own benefit as far as possible, they have been able to bring projects in efficiently under budget, retain that money and spend it on additional road projects. I can give a dozen examples off the top of my head of where that has happened in all states and territories of Australia. The Northern Territory is very efficient at spending the Commonwealth dollar as, I might add, is Western Australia. We do it with great alacrity. We probably have a better record for spending it quicker than anybody in the country and getting value for money on it.

          I do not think it is efficient for the Commonwealth to increase dramatically the level of bureaucracy that we have, which we keep deliberately small, by duplicating the control and management functions that are already efficiently provided by state government road authorities; they do it very well and they have been doing it for a long time. We do not want to set up a separate system of road maintenance and checking.

          The Commonwealth has insisted—and this is where we have given the lead—that state governments implement procedures such as pavement testing systems to test the efficiency with which road maintenance is carried out. It has been largely at the insistence of the Commonwealth government, as part of the conditions for these grants, that state authorities have moved to do this. So the Commonwealth has a very good track record of keeping the efficiency with which the state government authorities construct the roads at a very high level.

          In terms of getting value for money—having seen it in my own electorate in the Northern Territory and in projects that I have personally been involved with on the road side of it—by and large, I think the state authorities do a very effective job of competently administering these road projects, and that is how it is set up. I feel, with the greatest respect to the Auditor-General, that to go to the extent that is required in terms of the inputs into the dollar of setting up a duplicate bureaucracy at Commonwealth level with our own engineers and so on testing the maintenance on the roads when state government authorities do it, we think, in a very efficient fashion would be very inefficient and provide a poor return for the taxpayer.

          I will give one example of the kind of thing I am talking about which can produce off-the-top-of-the-head figures of $20 million, which Senator Short quoted. A fixed percentage fee is provided with contracts from the Commonwealth to cover all the unattributed costs that go into road projects—and they are significant—such as pre-planning procedures; all these things have to happen and they have to be paid for.

          As Senator Short has correctly said, that figure is set at four per cent. It has been set at four per cent for 20 years. We are currently reviewing it. Where the Auditor-General got his $20 million from is very simple. The Auditor-General has simply recommended that that four per cent figure be reduced to three per cent. Arithmetically, we cannot argue with that—if we use three per cent instead of four per cent, we save $20 million. Whether we can or not is another question.

          We are negotiating that with the states at the moment. Senator Short has quite properly said that we are setting up a new arrangement for funding from next year on with us being responsible for the national highway system and state governments being responsible for roads outside of that with untied grants from the Commonwealth. We are now reviewing that figure. I confidently expect the states will say that the real cost of doing all of that is eight per cent instead of four per cent. I might be out a percentage point or two but I expect them to at least double it because of additional demands.

          When plucking figures out of the air, it is just as easy to say that it should be eight per cent instead of four per cent as it is to say that it should be three per cent instead of four per cent and save $20 million. All I am saying is that those assumptions have to be tested a little more scrupulously than simply saying instead of four per cent it should be three, and we save $20 million if it is three. The states would contest that it has to be double what it is now, I have no doubt, but we will arrive at a figure which I think reasonably reflects the real costs of these unattributed costs for projects which are there. They have to be paid for by somebody, and we pay for them.

          I conclude by commenting very briefly on the matters that Senator Tierney raised. They do not relate to the report, nevertheless, he raised them and they should be responded to. We acknowledge the need to complete the rest of the roadworks. I apologise to Senator Panizza for mishearing his interjection at question time today; he made the correct comment that every time we provide these roadworks they help. Certainly, they create other problems. The obvious one is that at any particular point in time a bottleneck will occur at the end of the particular section just finished—at a cost of $225 million—and the next bit.

          As Senator Tierney has acknowledged, the amount of work that we do unquestionably benefits the area. As I said during question time today, the important contribution that this new freeway extension from Sydney will make to Newcastle is that the connecting road between the city of Newcastle and the F3 freeway—and it is a magnificent piece of road, if honourable senators ever get a chance to look at it, from a scenic as well as an engineering point of view—has been brought forward two full years in order to coincide with the opening of the freeway so Newcastle can get the maximum benefit from this faster link to Sydney.

          What was said at the opening of that road—and I think it is true—was that it is quite extraordinary when one thinks that the first road connection that existed, a dirt road, between Sydney and Newcastle was only completed 63 years ago. When one has a look at what is there now in some of what is without question the most difficult terrain in which to build roads in Australia—just in that short 19 kilometre section there are 23 major bridges and a whole stack of road cuts and so on that have to be put in as well—it is a pretty significant enterprise.

          The Commonwealth is well aware that the work has to continue. We are not going to unnecessarily spend taxpayers' dollars on ploughing money into what are acknowledged as being temporary links. We are conducting a major environmental impact study into the permanent link between the F3 and the New England Highway. That is considering at least five major options for the routing of that road, and that is not an easy thing to do. It involves, for example, compulsory acquisition of land. It is not a simple task to determine where to put something as big as that. That will take at least 12 months. At the completion of that EIS we will have a firm decision on the preferred route for the permanent link and work will then commence on constructing that link.

         Under the new proceedings for the processing of appropriation bills by the Senate, there is now the possibility of having supplementary meetings of estimates committees. Estimates Committee D had a supplementary meeting about four weeks ago and dealt with a variety of topics. Two of those issues are dealt with in this report. The first issue was a contract involving the disability reform program. The opposition has foreshadowed a minority report on this matter, and no doubt Senator Patterson will comment on the opposition's position on that.

          The other issue is the Centenary House lease. The committee report deals in a very objective and reasonable way with the evidence that has been accumulated on this matter. I believe it has gone as far as it can in seeking to get to the bottom of some of the issues that have been raised. There are obviously still some questions unanswered, especially to do with the knowledge of the Auditor-General and his office of the escalator clause in the lease and such things as his understanding of arrangements between him and the Department of Finance on continuing funding of the audit office, given the new accommodation it was proposing to move into.

We have suggested that, if need be, a third person, acceptable to the Auditor-General and the Minister for Finance, be appointed as well. That is not an essential part of the suggestion. At least both of those persons should conduct an independent inquiry.

          As pointed out in the majority report, the matter of the Centenary House lease between the Commonwealth, on behalf of the Australian National Audit Office, and John Curtin House Ltd, which is owned by the Australian Labor Party, was the subject of intensive examination by the committee. The majority report says:

         The ostensible cause of concern in this matter has been whether the terms of the lease are "commercially sound". Underlying this are allegations and imputations of, in effect, impropriety: that the lease was negotiated at other than arm's length in order to provide advantage to the lessor—
        </para>
        <para>
         which is in fact the Australian Labor Party. That is the reason why we put out a minority report. For instance, the term `ostensible cause of concern' was used, when the concern that we had was that Centenary House relates to the misuse of taxpayers' money, involving a lease agreement entered into by the Australian Property Group on behalf of the Australian National Audit Office. It is a classic example of the saying that if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, one can be excused for assuming it is a duck.

          The background to this situation is that the Australian National Audit Office sought to combine all its facilities under one roof. It contacted the Australian Property Group to act on its behalf to find it one space instead of being under many roofs, as it had been previously. The Australian Property Group then entered into negotiations with Lend Lease. It called for expressions of interest from the various groups which would be interested in building a property for the Australian National Audit Office.

For some reason, that refusal to consent was withdrawn within a couple of days. No satisfactory answers were given to the committee by Australian Estate Management as to why that refusal was withdrawn.

          The Australian Property Group was also requested by Australian Estate Management to market the York Park building. Under the way the government operates, the Australian Property Group has a monopoly on government buildings and the letting of premises within the Australian Capital Territory. What came through in the committee's hearings was that for some reason the Australian Property Group did not market the York Park building. The question one must ask is why it did not do that.

          The Australian Property Group knew in October 1990 that the so-called Lend Lease building was the new ALP headquarters, but it did not tell the Australian National Audit Office about that connection until March 1991. In fact, in all communications between the Australian Property Group and the Australian National Audit Office the term used was `the Lend Lease site' or `the joint venturers'. Why did the Australian Property Group do that? One must ask why the Australian National Audit Office was not advised immediately that the owner was the Australian Labor Party. Why was it hiding that information?

          At the time of occupancy of Centenary House, the rental per square metre was estimated to be in the order of $40 per square metre higher than the average market rate within the Australian Capital Territory. As far as I can gather, this was the most extraordinary deal that anyone has ever seen.

The letter did not mention a nine per cent escalation factor, which the Australian National Audit Office found out when the details of the lease became public in June 1992.

          The Auditor-General himself has said that he probably deserves a little bit of criticism because he should have checked, but has pointed out that he relied on the operations of the Australian Property Group as the organisation he had to go to to work out a decent lease. Everyone is aware of the fact that the Australian Property Group has incredible bargaining power because it is able to offer a government tenant, which means security of rental. Normally, when that occurs it puts a value on the property which is substantially higher than when one takes the risk of a non-government tenant.

          There were three major players in this exercise, apart from Lend Lease, which was acting on behalf of the ALP. They were: the Australian National Audit Office, as the eventual tenant; the Australian Property Group, which was required to act as any other real estate would do—to act on behalf of its client and get the client premises at the lowest possible rental; that is its job—and the Australian Valuation Office, which was called in and which would normally, I expect, be called in to give an opinion as to the valuation of the rental per square metre. I would not have expected the Valuation Office to be called in to go into all the details of the contract. That is the area of expertise of the Australian Property Group, yet the AVO was called in to give a much broader opinion.

I became aware that all major political parties in this country lease property to the Commonwealth. That was a fact that I was not aware of until I joined this committee. The National Party has rented property to the Commonwealth; the Liberal Party has rented property to the Commonwealth; and, of course, now the Labor Party is the owner of a building which is rented to the Commonwealth.

          —And negligence perhaps. These are matters that Senator Campbell may find answers to with which he is not entirely happy. People listening to Senator Parer on this broadcast today might believe that somehow the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, was not aware of the ALP's involvement in the ownership of the property until very late in the piece. It might also be suggested that the Australian National Audit Office played something less than an active role in the selection of the building and the negotiations leading to the agreement. Of course, both those propositions are clearly wrong.

          I preface my remarks by making a few comments about my support for an independent, credible auditor's office, and for ensuring that there is a proper functioning office that can keep public accountability on government expenditure that, equally, has high credibility in its dealings with other government agencies. My investigations suggest to me that had some of the answers given to us on that committee by the Auditor-General's office been given by a government agency, there may well have been a political outcry and a very damning report before this parliament.

          To suggest that files were not adequately kept and that officers were unavailable in normal circumstances in any other agency would lead people to the conclusion that entirely the best practice was not followed—however, not the best practice followed by the Labor Party, by the Valuation Office, or by the Property Group but in terms of the operations of the audit office. Mr Taylor specifically canvassed the issue of ALP ownership at a meeting of senior staff on 12 April and recommended—it is indicated in correspondence—that the office wished to proceed because the ownership had no bearing on the operations of the audit office and the use of that tenanted space. Mr Taylor admitted that he had addressed senior staff on this matter in the

          We need to appreciate that in the negotiations at all relevant times the audit office was involved and consulted. In my judgment, after examining the evidence, it agreed to the terms and conditions of the lease. The 15-year duration of the lease was entirely appropriate to the circumstances on the evidence presented to the estimates committee. It was a specified building to meet the particular requirements of the particular tenant. The developer required the longer term lease to ensure ongoing commitment and to finance the construction. The ALP's involvement in the presentation of various planning documents obviously postdated the arrangements that were entered into, suggesting to me that the audit office clearly had an understanding of what was involved in the lease and in the terms and ownership of that particular property.

          There was further documentation on the escalations clause in the files that the committee received. The auditor indicated to us that he was not aware that on 13 August 1991 Mr Dominic Collins had written to Mr John Barwood of the Australian National Audit Office, Medibank House in Phillip, indicating the various options that were available to the audit office, and seeking its agreement before entering any commitment. He outlined the following options:

         This clearly indicates the level of discussion that had taken place between officers of the ANAO and the Property Group. What was clear to me in the documentation that was presented is that the audit office was involved through its senior officers. The evidence clearly indicated that the Property Group and the Valuation Office were not prepared to deal with officers unless they were in a senior position within the audit office and clearly had the authority to act for the audit office.

          So I have no doubt in my mind as to the sequence of events that occurred. Firstly, there was the request and the drive for the establishment of new premises essentially coming from within the audit office. The specifications were required to be laid down and there was an expression of interest from 14 different groups seeking to provide a building, including, as I recall, the Liberal Party. Of the 14 options pursued, the Lend Lease-ALP proposition was the one selected. After it was clearly identified publicly that the ALP was involved, the audit office decided to continue with the development.

          Those essential facts are clear. What I am concerned about and where there needs to be further inquiry is the relationship between the Department of Finance and the audit office. There is some tension in that relationship. In terms of the discussion surrounding the resource agreement—which goes beyond the rental of any one building; it goes to the entire financial operation of the audit office—it is not entirely clear to what extent the audit office understood its obligations and the Department of Finance understood its obligations. There appears to be some discrepancy there. This discrepancy may arise essentially because different agencies were involved in the preparation and the negotiation of the lease arrangements. One government agency was responsible for the resource agreement and another agency responsible for the leasing arrangement. The only agency that seemed to have a grip on both levels of activity was the audit office. The Property Group was not party to negotiation on the resource agreement, and the Department of Finance was not party to the negotiations on the lease. I repeat: it appears that the audit office was the only agency that was party to both.

          So we have a problem which relates to the question of responsibility. The honourable senator opposite indicated a moment ago that there was concern about the responsibility of officers concerned to undertake fair and proper authority. As I understand the relevant spending of public moneys provision, finance regulation 44A, it requires that, in accordance with that regulation, it is the responsibility of the officer responsible for spending public moneys to ensure that any proposal is in accordance with Commonwealth policies and will make an effective and efficient use of the public moneys.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Further, finance regulation 44B, amongst other things, permits a person to enter into a commitment requiring the payment of public moneys only if the proposal to spend has been approved by a person with authority to do so, the commitment is consistent with any terms in the approval, the person entering the commitment is satisfied that the expenditure represents value for money, and sufficient funds to cover the expenditure have been or will be appropriated. These issues need to be addressed in any future inquiry. They do strike me as somewhat odd. If we apply the same standards to the audit office that the auditor applies to other government agencies, perhaps we will come up with some further questions and get some interesting answers.

          There are some basic questions here about political propriety—not the political propriety of the Labor Party or of any particular agency but about an opposition that is effectively bereft of ideas and that finds it necessary to go into these sorts of issues because essentially it has nowhere else to go. It is a major problem in its arrangements. It tells one more about the Liberal Party's thinking than it does about the operations of this government. There is no evidence to suggest any impropriety on behalf of officers of the Department of Finance, of the Valuation Office, of the Property Group or of the Australian National audit office. There is no basis for any claims that are being made about any impropriety involving this government. There is a normal commercial arrangement which responds to the very location that the audit office sought for the property at Centenary House, being the central business district of government in Australia.

          What an inquiry perhaps would indicate is ways in which we can get improvements in the administration of government agencies such as the audit office in terms of its leasing arrangements. However, in my judgment, given the evidence we have seen before this committee, an inquiry will not demonstrate that the allegations Senator Parer has been making have any substance whatsoever.

          Essentially, this is an issue that goes to the provision of very high standard accommodation—to the specification provided for by the audit office. Of course, ownership of the building does not mean control of the actual activities of any particular tenant—any more than a government agency that rents space from either the National Party or Liberal Party has to fear interference from those political parties. The contrary proposition is founded on basic assumptions which are fundamentally flawed. When this matter is looked at properly and rationally with an objective examination of the evidence, it will be seen that there is no basis whatsoever to the claims of impropriety that are being made.

          The reality is that the Australian National Audit Office has entered into an unconscionable contract with the Australian Labor Party. It has been locked into a 15-year lease, which is one of the longest leases for a commercial building in any Australian capital city. It has been locked into a nine per cent per annum rental increase, starting from September this year, which will lead to an annual gross rental of $1,297 a square metre by the end of the lease. This nine per cent increase is a minimum because, on top of that, if rental rates actually do increase there is provision for a market review so that it can go above nine per cent.

          At this juncture, it is important to refer to some of the evidence provided by Mr Coleman from the Australian Valuation Office. At the supplementary hearings on 9 November I asked Mr Coleman—I should not use the emotive term `cross-examined'—some questions regarding press coverage on 25 September where Mr Coleman was reported in a range of newspapers across the country as saying that he thought the rent that the Auditor-General was paying was below the market. There were headlines across the country saying that the Auditor-General was paying below market. This was astounding to me because I know that the rent is a high one.

          The Australian Valuation Office spent ages trying to convince the Senate estimates committee that the rent was below market when of course it is not. In the evidence Mr Coleman gave on 9 November, he agreed with me that the statement that the rent was below market was actually false—that, indeed, the rent was certainly not below market; it was, in Mr Coleman's terms, fair market.

          Mr Coleman presented two pieces of comparable rental evidence to our Senate estimates committee to prove that the rent was fair market. One of those examples was the White Industries building in Civic, referred to as building No. 4, where the rent was $347 a square metre. I remind honourable senators, and anyone else who is listening in, that the net starting rental that the Auditor-General is now paying at the ALP building is $367.50 a square metre, and all of the running costs of the building add another $40 to $45 a square metre on top of that. So, starting now, the audit office is paying to the Australian Labor Party roughly $420 a square metre and, as I said, it is fixed to escalate by nine per cent every year.

          —This is a new graph. We have brought it up to date. In the evidence given to the estimates committee the Australian Valuation Office said that it based its advice, which was that the escalations should be no higher than nine per cent, on the fact that rents had escalated in Canberra over the previous 15 years at an average of nine per cent. It is simply not fair to say that, because there has been an average increase of nine per cent in Canberra over the last 15 years, there should be a minimum guaranteed nine per cent compounding increase over the next 15 years.

          In Canberra over the past 15 years, there have been some years when there was no growth at all, other years when there has been 13 or 14 per cent growth and other years of bubbling along. The fact is that in the contract signed with the Australian National Audit Office the Australian Labor Party has been guaranteed that, no matter what happens—if hell freezes over, if Mount Kosciusko falls over, if Lake Burley Griffin empties out or if the whole of the country comes to a standstill—it will receive a compounding nine per cent increase in rental every year.

          I put it to Senator Carr, who has now left the chamber, that if he had a real estate agent go out and find him a home unit in Canberra to rent and that agent entered into an agreement to escalate Senator Carr's townhouse rental by nine per cent every year for the next 15 years, Senator Carr would be in court suing that real estate agent as quick he could because, again, that would be an unconscionable contract.

          The other issue that needs to be addressed is whether the rent is a fair market rental. I return to the fact that Mr Coleman, the head of the Australian Valuation Office, who was giving evidence at the committee hearing on 9 November, referred to this White Industries building which had a rent of $347 a square metre. That rent, we are informed by the industry—and I am quite happy to be corrected if I am wrong—is a gross rent which would mean that the net rent is more like $300 a square metre compared with the $367 a square metre which the Australian taxpayer has to pay for the ALP's building.

          Similarly, Mr Coleman gave evidence of DAAS's building in Alinga Street where a recently reviewed rental was $351 a square metre. Again, if one deducts the outgoings from what is a gross rent, that rental comes down to $305 a square metre. So the Australian National Audit Office is paying some $67 to $70 a square metre—for thousands of square metres of office space—above the market rental. Mr Coleman came before our committee and said that the Australian National Audit Office was paying a fair market rent. I put this to Mr Coleman on 9 November:

I put to the Senate that, if any commercial operation went out and got advice from a valuer which was as bad as the advice that the Australian Valuation Office gave to the Auditor-General or the Australian Property Group, in terms of the starting rental, which is far too high, the escalation factor of 10 per cent during construction, which has proved to be between two and three times as high as it should have been, and the nine per cent rental increases for the next 15 years, we would sue that valuer for negligence.

          The Australian Property Group was supposed to be acting on behalf of the Australian National Audit Office—its client. When it goes into bat for a client who is paying its fees quite handsomely, it should be acting in the interests of its client. It should be going in and doing the best deal it possibly can for its client and it should be rewarded by the payment of a fee. Had the Australian National Audit Office gone to a private property consultancy, then that is exactly what would have happened. But the Australian Property Group seemed to be like a broker between the two of them. It actually negotiated a deal that really had nothing in it that was of any assistance whatsoever to the Auditor-General. In fact, the Auditor-General himself has said that, if he could renegotiate the deal, he would get out of it straight away. He does not want to be locked into a nine per cent guaranteed rental increase for the next 15 years.

Senator Carr and Senator Murphy choose to have the Senate believe that the Auditor-General was in some way not up to the mark in not knowing that he had a lease with a nine per cent rental increase. The facts revealed in the estimates committee—and Senator McMullan was there and admitted it—were that the Australian Property Group never, in any correspondence, advised the Australian National Audit Office of the specific detail of the term of the lease or the rental increase. It did not really know about it until after it was signed and it was all put to bed. That is why, all of a sudden, this has become a big issue. The Australian taxpayers have realised that they have been locked into a deal by the Australian Property Group to pay the Australian Labor Party millions and millions of dollars for the next 15 years. My view and the view of the opposition is that this deal should be investigated and renegotiated because the Auditor-General cannot operate under this lease.

          I want to turn to the Australian Property Group. It could have negotiated, in the interests of the Auditor-General, if the Auditor-General's office required security of tenure over a 15-year period, a quite normal arrangement, which would have been a 10-year lease, which is still an extremely long lease. Anyone who says that the ALP or Lend Lease could not finance the project on a 10-year lease with a high starting rental is kidding himself and trying to kid the Senate. A 10-year lease to a government tenant with a fixed starting rent and fixed escalators is a tremendous deal for anyone to finance. As I have said in the estimates committee a couple of times, when I have been boring everyone and myself, one would have developers and financiers queuing up at the door, running from Canberra right down the Hume Highway. Hundreds of developers and financiers would be clambering on top of each other to finance the deal. So it is absolute rubbish to say that one has to have a 15-year contract to get a financier interested in that deal. People would love to have done that deal on a 10-year lease. The Auditor-General could have been given a five-year option to renew the lease at the end of that 10-year term. That would be a quite sensible and normal commercial negotiation.

          To the contrary, these minimum escalation clauses work very much against the interests of the tenant for whom the Australian Property Group was negotiating. There needs to be a thorough investigation into how the Australian Property Group negotiated, on behalf of its client, the correspondence that was carried out between the Australian Property Group and the Australian National Audit Office. There is absolutely no doubt from the evidence we were given on 9 November that the Australian National Audit Office was not kept informed of absolutely essential elements of the negotiation, such as the escalation clauses.

          The proof of the pudding is in what the Australian National Audit Office has told the world at large: we cannot live with a nine per cent rental increase. If the Australian National Audit Office had been told by the Australian Property Group prior to entering the commitment that it was going to have a nine per cent minimum guaranteed rental increase, the Australian National Audit Office could not have possibly agreed to it. The Department of Finance would not have let it agree to it. The fact of the matter is that there was an enormous breakdown in communications. My view is that the Australian Property Group was negligent and failed in its duty to its client. Again, in a private negotiation between a private sector company and a property consultancy, if that property consultancy went and entered into some sort of agreement on behalf of a client that locked it into a 15-year lease with nine per cent increases, the private sector client would sue that agency for negligence and that agency would most likely have to pay significant damages.

The Australian Labor Party is the only winner out of this deal. It has a guaranteed income. It will ensure that, regardless of the political fortunes of the Australian Labor Party; no matter how bad Mr Keating gets; no matter how many Thai teak tables he has; no matter how many ministers, such as Mrs Kelly, make a joke of his government; no matter how many failures or political disasters strike the Australian Labor Party; and no matter how many seats we rout them by at the next federal election, the Australian Labor Party is assured of at least a 15-year future.

If the Auditor-General has to suffer a nine per cent decrease in the amount of money that he can resource into his primary role of conducting investigations—it is being sucked away by a great big vacuum cleaner called the Australian Labor Party's property fund; and it is going up year after year at nine per cent—his ability to assess independently the operations of the government will be limited.

They do not like the operations of their government—the mismanagement and the maladministration—being brought under the scrutiny of the Australian National Audit Office. They do not like the operations of their government being brought to the attention of Senate committees. They are intent on screwing down the financial resources and the manpower resources of Senate committees. They have absolute contempt for Senate committees and they also have contempt for the Australian National Audit Office. If Australia is going to be a vigorous democracy with a government that is accountable to the people through the parliament, we need a strong and independent auditor and we need a strong Senate committee system.

The minority report raises a question about the propriety, competence and professionalism of the Australian Property Group and the Australian Valuation Office. The minority report says that the advice given to the ANAO by both of those bodies was either less than it should have been or completely wrong. In regard to the terms of the lease, the minority report says that the lease does not conform with the standard lease arrangement used by the Commonwealth. The opposition knows full well that there is no standard lease with respect to Commonwealth property. The Commonwealth leases many properties around Australia and those leases vary significantly.

          The ANAO sought accommodation whereby it could bring all of its operations under one roof. It sought accommodation in what is known as the Parliamentary Triangle, within the Barton area. We should look at what property was available and what options were available. Senator Parer mentioned the York Park building. He said the Australian Property Group did not market and did not present this building as an option to the ANAO, when it fact it was presented. One of the reasons the ANAO chose not to take York Park as an option is that it was not certain that it would be built. In fact, at that time it had not even been approved by cabinet. Today it is still not completed.

It is quite clear from the evidence presented to the committee that the Auditor-General made that decision. In a letter to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) he indicated that what was known as section 22, Barton, at that time was the choice that the ANAO had made; and, indeed, it had sought the assistance of the APG and the Department of Finance to enter into an agreement for that property.

A letter dated 16 November sent to the secretary of the committee from the Department of Finance refutes that claim. It has with it a range of correspondence which, in my view, supports the position of the Department of Finance. Over and above that, the Auditor-General has picked up on leasing arrangements in some other reports. We ought to be aware of what is common practice with all government enterprises in relation to the financing of arrangements through the Department of Finance. I am no expert in this area, but if one reads some of the correspondence, one sees that it raises very serious questions as to who knew what.

          With respect to rents paid, Senator Campbell tabled a graph that he has tabled about six times elsewhere. It seems to change on most occasions; I think he said it was a new graph today. When one looks at accommodation costs, both nationally and within Canberra, and commercial rental accommodation costs in the eastern seaboard versus Western Australia and here, one could go to Sydney and Melbourne and have vacancy rates of 20 per cent or maybe higher. The vacancy rate in Canberra is less than five per cent. It does not matter what one buys in the Barton area and in the Parliamentary Triangle—which is where the ANAO wanted to be. If one bought a car in the Parliamentary Triangle one would probably have to pay more for it. Since I have been in this place I cannot even begin to think about purchasing property or, indeed, renting accommodation in the Barton area, and certainly not within the Parliamentary Triangle. It is important to note that assessments of rental comparisons within the Barton area over the last 10 years which were presented to the committee showed that the actual rental growth over that period has been substantially higher than nine per cent.

It is adjusted only by that factor and only for that particular review year. The escalator remains at nine per cent until the next review.

          Finally, it is a pity that the Liberal Party has chosen to politicise this issue rather than to deal with the facts.

I reiterate that what Senator Parer and Senator Campbell chose not to mention was that the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats do the same. I do not know what those arrangements are. In the case of this particular arrangement, a representative acted on behalf of the ALP during the negotiations with the Australian Property Group.

          The financial statements of John Curtin House state that the building cost no more than $22 million to build.

I said to the Australian Democrats, `Democrats, will you please agree with the opposition that we won't give the government its appropriations bills until such time as it tables the lease documentation in the parliament?'. The Democrats agreed to that and at half past one in the morning we got the documents, but guess what? All the salient parts—all the figures—were whited out.

          It was not until later that I really recognised the significance of all this. I thought the government had been using executive power to enter into these lease agreements, but I found out subsequently that it had been relying on the Lands Acquisition Act. That is why the Attorney-General's Department signs the leases and is involved in giving advice at the last minute.

Not only did it not happen, but when the department was forced to give us the documentation, it deliberately whited out all the particulars, which the act on which it relied said must be included.

When we forced the Labor Party to put the documentation on the table it whited out all the particulars. Administrative oversight? Pardon my cynicism, but I do not think so.

          At the end of day we find that no proper outside valuations were made, that it was a cosy in-house deal. The consensus afterwards is that it is a non-commercial lease and that the Auditor-General has been duped into becoming the meat in the sandwich. This is because the agreement is between the Commonwealth and the Labor Party. It was not signed by an agency of the government; it was signed by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) who is exercising delegated authority under the Lands Acquisition Act. Those are the facts. The Commonwealth has entered into an agreement which benefits the Labor Party and all propriety was cast asunder and it was not properly disclosed.

Senator Parer says that this lease should be negotiated so that it is in accordance with the principles of the Department of Finance. He and I have said these things over a period of months. Yet at every turn the Labor Party resists because at stake is its $50 million mortgage. If this lease is broken, where is the cash flow going to come from to meet the mortgage repayments. The taxpayer is being held to ransom so that the Labor Party can circumvent the laws that require disclosure of how much tomato sauce was bought to use at a sausage sizzle, as we on this side of the chamber have to do. The Labor Party bypasses those laws and takes the money straight from the taxpayers' pocket. It is a pipeline to the Mint; $86 million straight into the Labor Party coffers to buy its way into office.

That is what is being called upon with this agreement. What we are calling for in this debate is that there be some decency and the agreement be renegotiated so that there can be at least some acknowledgment by the Labor Party of the uncommercial, unfair advantage it is giving itself by way of funding out of the taxpayers' purse.

        <para>
         I will explain this. This program was to be publicised. The working committee of the ministerial council had a process of looking at, by selective tender, companies that might do this. At first, four or five advertising companies were chosen and they took the typical advertising approach. The working committee of the ministerial council said that it would like to see an alternative to that mainstream advertising approach. Two further names came up. One was also an advertising company and one was a company that used a technique called network marketing. Since only one name came up it would be possible to assume that that company would have an unfair advantage during the final selection process for a contractor to market the DRP if the committee was looking at an alternative marketing approach. The only company nominated was this company.

          We asked questions about how the company was chosen. We asked about the method used by the Office of Government Information and Advertising to choose an alternative to the mainstream advertising approach. What it did was insert three key words in a database of 1,500 potential contractors and it selected the name of the company. Then we asked it what it did about vetting this company and whether it had determined whether the company had the capacity to undertake a contract worth $4.9 million. I chased around various estimates committees to find out what happened because nobody seemed to know. The committee that was organising and supervising this contract said that it thought OGIA had done it. What we found out was that it obtained two oral references about the selected company. One of the references was from a government department in New South Wales. It obtained these oral references to see whether the company could undertake this contract.

          One concern we have is that no checks of the financial capabilities of this company were undertaken prior to the contract being awarded. Normally, certain procedures are undertaken to ensure that a company is able to carry out a contract of this size. If the company's last annual return to the Australian Securities Commission had been obtained—and that is very easy to do—prior to the letting of the contract and it had been checked, it would have revealed that the company was trading at a loss, that its liabilities exceeded its assets, and it was probably balance sheet insolvent. This is a company to which the government intended to let a contract worth $4.9 million of taxpayers' money.

          A contract was let to this company and this year the company went into liquidation. There were 229 unspecified creditors; some may be associated with other work that the company was doing but some were related to the contract. OGIA has estimated that this work is to the tune of $114,000. When we asked questions about these matters it was also contended that the Commonwealth had no financial responsibility to these unsecured creditors, although it appeared to many of the creditors that the company was working on behalf of the Commonwealth.

          In some cases the company used a letterhead with a logo at the top which was also being used by the department, but with a different address. Also, some of the company's officers were working out of Commonwealth offices. Therefore, the creditors considered the company was operating under the umbrella of the Commonwealth. They thought that they were actually negotiating with someone who was doing a job on behalf of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth says that it has no financial responsibility for these companies that are out of pocket.

          Another matter that is of great concern is that some of those people have disabilities. People with disabilities were contracted by the company to undertake programs to promote the disability reform package. The irony of all this is that this company—a company which was contracted to promote the disability reform package, to talk about what the government is doing for people with disabilities—has employed people with disabilities whom it has not paid.

          This contract was being supervised—and I use that word loosely because of what happened—in some way by three departments that were represented on the management committee. This committee was responsible for managing the contract. The committee was also attended by someone from OGIA who was chairing that committee but seemed, from what was said in estimates, not to be responsible in terms of the contract itself. So it appeared that the three departments were responsible for managing the contract with OGIA chairing and coordinating it.

          In May-June 1992, a number of meetings were held—I think some eight meetings in five weeks, but I will not be held to that exact figure—and there were discussions as to whether the contract should be terminated. Two of the departments said that the contract should be terminated. One department said, `No. We should go on'. If you were in business and had let a contract for $4.95 million, and if along the way you had some grave concerns about the contract and went to the managing director or your shareholders afterwards and had said, `Look, I'm awfully sorry, two out of three decided that we should not go ahead, but we could not reach a consensus so we went on with it', you would not have a job and the shareholders would have you for breakfast. In this case, the taxpayers ought to have questions answered for them.

I do not know what the government was going to do between February 1993 and June 1993 when the contract ended, because it only had $62,000 left to pay out of the $4.95 million.

          Also, an officer from OGIA gave evidence that the network facilitators, the people employed by Corporate Impacts, employed to carry out this contract worked 13,000 fewer head hours than the 55,000 head hours stipulated in the contract. In the face of this nearly all of the contract is paid out; only $62,000 is left of $4.95 million. So one would have assumed that those head hours that were in the contract would have been fulfilled.

          A further concern that we raised in the minority report was that form 507 lodged with the Australian Securities Commission by the liquidator of Corporate Impacts indicates that 16 of the network facilitators who were employed by Corporate Impacts to implement its network marketing approach to the DRP contract, which was endorsed by the working committee of the ministerial council, are owed entitlements by Corporate Impacts.

          Another concern is that an officer from OGIA gave evidence that one of the directors may have mischarged the Commonwealth for travel costs entailed in the execution of the DRP contract. It was also revealed that to date an undisclosed number of deliverables with an undisclosed value have not been provided to the Commonwealth by Corporate Impacts. It was also revealed in these estimates hearings that in spite of the concerns expressed about the financial viability of Corporate Impacts by the management committee, from November 1992 onwards a further contract of $29,500 was awarded by the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories to Corporate Impacts in April 1993. That was a matter of weeks prior to its application for voluntary liquidation in May 1993.

          An issue of grave concern is that an officer of OGIA has questioned the objectivity of the liquidator appointed to Corporate Impacts. The Commonwealth's concerns about the execution of its contract are of such gravity that it is currently considering legal action. Evidence was provided in another estimates committee that a company contracted by the Commonwealth to evaluate this contract was threatened by Corporate Impacts with legal action resulting in delay of the evaluation report. I have seen the draft report and I must admit that from that evaluation it does not seem that the problem was all Corporate Impacts' way. The evaluation says that there had been a recommendation that a director or coordinator be appointed to liaise with Corporate Impacts and the three departments. That apparently was never done. Had that happened, some of these problems may have been ironed out—I doubt that all of them would have been ironed out, but who is responsible?  I kept asking the minister:  where does the buck stop?

          Some of the officers told their respective ministers that they had concerns about the contract and how it was progressing, but nothing seemed to be done. Senator McMullan had some responsibility and nothing seemed to be done on his part. So the situation is just dragging on. I admit that it was an unusual contract; it went across a number of departments with OGIA chairing it, and that meant that some issues could slip between the stools. But people went to their ministers and said, `We have grave concerns' and yet nothing was done about it.

During the estimates hearings an officer from OGIA described this contract as having `always been a troublesome, difficult relationship—more and more troublesome as it has gone on'. So we not only have to consider the cost of the contract; we have also to consider almost a quarter of a million dollars expended in staff time and administrative costs.

          The overall concern for me is that the aim of this project was to publicise the government's changes in disability reform when, really, the people who have lost out in this are people with disabilities. They have not been served well. In terms of the outcome of this contract, the evaluation is not as favourable as it might have been if it had not had all the problems that have been associated with it.

          —in reply—I want to close the debate by making some brief references to the contributions of opposition senators on the Centenary House lease issue. I certainly will not extend this debate beyond 6.30 p.m., so that we can get on with the industrial relations bills, and so I will not have the opportunity to deal in detail with everything that was said by those opposite.

          The one thing that I think I should make clear is the role of the Department of Finance in relation to the lease and the resource agreement with the Australian National Audit Office. I suppose the thing that saddens me about the arguments of those opposite on this whole issue is that they only let into their heads the evidence that they wanted to hear. They ignored a whole lot of other evidence that was put before the committee and they misrepresented a whole lot of the evidence—even the evidence that they let themselves hear.

          In particular I want to refer to the Department of Finance issue. Once again we had opposition senators saying, as they have been saying over and over for some months, that the Department of Finance has said that this particular lease should only have a one per cent escalator clause in it. Of course, the fact is that the Department of Finance has had no involvement at all with this lease. There is nothing to show that the Department of Finance has made any judgment at all about this lease and the appropriate escalator clause in it. It has not said that this lease should have one per cent compared to the nine per cent that was negotiated and was recommended as appropriate by those from whom the audit office took advice.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The Department of Finance's one per cent applies because that is the standard escalator that is used all around the country. As the finance department said in its evidence, if it were to have had anything different from the standard one per cent, it would have had to look at the lease in more detail and had an actual case put to it. The one per cent applies because the Department of Finance did not investigate the matter any further. The one per cent is based on overall rental arrangements all around the country—not just Canberra and certainly not just the Barton area, which is accepted as being one of the highest.

          It is sad, but also annoying, that the evidence about the Department of Finance's involvement keeps being ignored by the opposition. The Auditor-General himself said to the committee that he was not aware of a number of things, although I think he was talking personally rather than in relation to all people in his office, because obviously there were people in the audit office dealing with the matter with the Australian Property Group, the Australian Valuation Office and, in relation to the resource agreement, the Department of Finance. Of course, the resource agreement was to do with the overall issue of the resources for the audit office. There seems to have been some misunderstanding, at least on the part of the Auditor-General, as to what was being signed when there were agreements with Finance about that resource agreement.

         Debate on the establishment of a specialist industrial relations court has been around for some 25 years. The last occasion was during the debate on the Industrial Relations Bill 1987, which was aborted by the Hawke-Labor government. By the time the Industrial Relations Bill was reintroduced in 1988, the High Court had determined that the industrial division of the Federal Court did have the authority to make determinations on industrial relations matters. Therefore, the government did not proceed in this direction. I refer honourable members on the other side of the chamber to what the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, had to say at that time.

         Nothing has changed since 1988. The opposition has not been able to find any valid reasons that this court should be established and the minister has not even attempted to justify the need for it. On that basis, there is no justification for the establishment of this specialist industrial relations court which will make already complicated legal systems even more complex. One could well also mention the additional costs of putting another court in place and how much it would cost taxpayers. The Law Council of Australia spelt it out clearly to the Senate committee. It said:

         The second matter I wish to address is the boycott provisions at part 6 of the bill. The opposition totally rejects the changes to the boycott provisions, as does every employer organisation in the country, and we will be moving to delete part 6 of the bill. In cases such as Mudginberri, Dollar Sweets, Columbus Shipping Line, the live sheep export dispute and the boycotting of our mining industry, the main protection for industry has been the secondary boycott provisions of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. They have worked and worked extremely successfully. Under this bill, they have been diluted to such an extent that they will be useless both as a threat against taking illegal or irresponsible action and as an option for obtaining speedy resolution to disputes.

         The new 72-hour rule is just a licence to damage business going about its legal activity. The situation was best expressed to the committee by two comments, the first by Dr Blain, an adviser from the Western Australian government. He said:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . we very much support the thrust of what you are saying, that is, we very much support the retention of the existing provisions for 45D and 45E. I think an important part of the rationale for our support is what we would call the threat effect. I think this is what you were alluding to, perhaps in different words. The fact that it has not been used on a large number of occasions is not the major point. The major point is that it is there to be used if the situation requires.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second comment, by Mr Barry Watchorn of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, relates to the 72-hour rule. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . you are looking at a regime in which there is a theoretical 72 hour window of opportunity, albeit that the commission can cut short, where boycott action can bite on an employer. There are cases in which 72 hours can be extremely damaging, certainly for those involved in organising exhibitions. And dare I say it, in such extravaganzas as the current Madonna series of concerts, 72 hours could be too long for any of that.
       </para>

        The fact that political boycotts will now legally return without any protection in the Trade Practices Act is unfortunate and will mean that industry in this country will be very severely damaged and could well move offshore.

         The third area I wish to deal with is reform of the industrial relations system in Australia. This bill will go down in history as an opportunity lost. This bill is an unmitigated disaster. Let us look at the intent and the result. To do so, we should recall what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised in his speech of 21 April. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. It is a model under which compulsory arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases will be there only as a safety net. This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later in the same speech the Prime Minister said:

        We want it to be close to 100 per cent of employees under federal awards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question now becomes: will the legislation fulfil the Prime Minister's statement? If the evidence given to the Senate committee in most of the submissions and from a vast majority of witnesses is any guide, the answer is a categorical no. For example, Mr Vernon Winley, assistant director of the Business Council of Australia, told the committee:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our view is that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill misses the opportunity to introduce real reform into the industrial relations system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, during the committee hearings Mr Bryan Noakes of ACCI was asked whether this delivers what the Prime Minister promised. The answer was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No, it does not, not in the least.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister's vision for industrial relations reform pivoted on a massive expansion of workplace or enterprise agreements, on productivity improvements and resultant increases in employment opportunities.

In the case of this legislation, the inclusion by annexure of ILO and United Nations conventions has reached new heights and, as far as we can ascertain, for the first time we have witnessed the use of ILO recommendations which carry no legislative weight and which, in some instances, are contrary to the provisions contained in the relevant convention.

The Keating government is hiding behind the skirts of international government by using the foreign affairs power in a manner which was never intended. By this means, legislation has been enacted which has profound effects on federal and state jurisdictions without proper debate in the federal parliament or between the federal and state governments.

         The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in his second reading speech indicated that no legislative package could ever hope to satisfy the competing views of all groups with an interest in industrial relations. What is encouraging, he said, is that he had found throughout his consultations a measure of consensus on the need for reform of the kind that we are proposing, although there is obviously discord on the detail of how it should be achieved. For its part, the government believes that the proposals strike the right balance between enhancing flexibility and ensuring an adequate safety net of employee protection. The right balance has been something that Labor governments have been seeking to achieve since 1983, when this government came to office.

         The basic principles of Labor's industrial relations policy assume partnership. They assume a notion that all aspects of the work force—be it business, be it unions, be it workers or be it government—can work together. They assume that through enterprise bargaining the government is able to initiate policy frameworks that devolve that partnership approach to the enterprise level and achieve workplace flexibility and productivity growth without sacrificing the basic rights and conditions of Australian workers.

         The new stream of enterprise bargaining will allow even greater flexibility and open new ways for both the lightly unionised and the heavily unionised workplaces to enact change. It is a partnership which is recognised in this bill. It recognises that industrial relations legislation must be based on striking the balance and delivering fairness. At the current time the arguments concerning this package revolve around the appropriate mix of flexibility and protection. Some employer organisations argued before the Senate standing committee, as Senator Crane has indicated, that the maintenance of a compulsory award system reduces flexibility. This was not the view supported by the committee.

         Let us look at some of the aims of the bill as distinct from some of the hysteria that we have heard. The industrial relations system we have before us has three basic goals. It aims to promote productivity in workplaces and ensure efficiency in industry and, therefore, economic growth and prosperity for the community as a whole. It aims to ensure the quality of working life for workers arising from a cooperative relationship between workers and their employers. It aims to ensure the recognition that workers do not have equal bargaining power with their employers to prevent exploitation.

          In the present economic climate it has to be appreciated that high unemployment is a weapon used by some employers to force down wages and conditions. Leaving workers and their employers to deal directly with each other without any support from state safety nets would be forcing workers back into the worst excesses of the industrial revolution. We would be left with the unequal relationship of master and servant. Those who support the deregulation of the labour market seem only interested in one aspect of flexibility, and that is flexibility downwards for wages and conditions for working people. This is the sort of bargaining position that has been epitomised by the champion of the New Right in Victoria, Mr Peter Boyle, whose infamous statement `make them fear the sack' rings very loud in the ears of many workers throughout this country. It has become the way of industrial relations for many in Victoria. It is the sort of approach that the coalition, as we have just heard, supports.

         This legislation accepts awards as setting the minimum wages and conditions for the great majority of workers in this country. This is fair and appropriate.

Of course, recently in Victoria special legislation has had to be introduced to try to provide the basic minimum award entitlement to an $8 increase that the arbitration commission recently granted because acts instituted by the Victorian state government clearly are not capable of being able to cope with such situations.

         The only people with anything to fear from such a process are those employers who want to disadvantage their workers. When Senator Crane indicated that `we fear those forces at work', it is quite clear that those opposite fear the working people of this country and their capacity to organise and to defend themselves. They fear the capacity of a Labor government to introduce fair and reasonable legislation to provide the necessary framework for decency in industrial relations.

         A secretive system, which is the one that those opposite support, is one that divides workers from each other. As we have seen in Victoria, such a system merely enables employers to force their workers to accept reduced working conditions without having to suffer the consequences of adverse publicity and public condemnation. It is not for the Liberal Party of the 1990s the Deakin model; it is not for the Liberal Party of the 1990s the Higgins model that talked about some decency and fairness in the approach to social relations in this country. The opposition has given all that away. Its approach is to go right back to the freedom of contract notions which led to the great strikes of the 19th century.

         The main purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the spread of enterprise bargaining within the federal system of industrial relations; create a limited right to strike by modifying the operation of statutory and common law sanctions on industrial action, and thus comply with our treaty obligations regarding ILO conventions; and guarantee certain minimum standards of employment to all Australian workers. At the same time, the legislation will result in the strengthening of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The legislation will increase the ability of the IRC to ensure that awards are relevant, that equal pay is made real and available to all and that all Australians are protected against unfair dismissals.

         One of the most significant changes that this legislation will bring to Australian workers is the legal right to withdraw their labour.

         Currently there exist myriad restraints on strike activity, including sanction provisions, compliance measures and penalties. These constraints have been a source of industrial contention. At the same time, the constraints have been the subject of much international criticism. Of course, they come from the master-servant relationship, to which Senator Carr referred, which is the basis in law for many of those sanctions.

Concerns were again raised over the lack of protection of trade unions and their members against common law action and over the scope of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.

I know that members of the coalition are upset about ILO obligations, but they are obligations simply because they relate to fundamental rights throughout the world that have been acknowledged as being essential in democratic societies.

I strongly support that. I strongly support those moves because I believe that such an outcome is essential in the modern industrial relations milieu that we are trying to create.

I was the clerk of a chapel—`clerk' meaning secretary, in case anybody gets that position confused with those held by the clerks in this place; and `chapel' referring to a union organisation in a printing factory. I wrote a letter to the employer because the tradesmen were seeking a wage increase of #2. The employer panicked. He went to his employers' association, which was aware of the penal provisions of the Arbitration Act of the fifties. Immediately, I became the head of the match, as they say, and, under the arbitration rules at that time, the innocent, straightforward letter that I had written became a letter of demand. Of course, a move was made to go to the Industrial Relations Commission. This was enterprise bargaining 40 years ago.

As a teenager, I was threatened with the penal clauses. I was defended, of course, by my union. But I had few rights because the law, as has always been the case, favoured the employer. This legislation brings fairness to the situation and makes possible proper enterprise negotiations.

In determining safety net increases in wages and conditions through test cases, for example, public interest considerations will continue to be particularly important.

         The other area that I particularly commend this legislation for is the position of women workers and their gains under this legislation. I particularly welcome the legislation because it supports those who are most vulnerable in workplace bargaining—that is, women workers in traditionally female dominated industries. Historically, women have been located in the weakest and less unionised sectors of the labour force. Despite this, however, Australian workers have achieved one of the smallest gender wages gaps in the world. Because of our award system, historically, rises won by fitters eventually flowed to child-care workers and shop assistants.

         This legislation proposes reforms which will maintain and strengthen the award system. This can only be considered advantageous to women workers. At the same time, this legislation supports the other factor which has aided women's relative position in the work force—that is, unionism. I make no apology for it because the facts are very clear: workers in weak bargaining positions, such as women, need the presence of a union, particularly during enterprise bargaining. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill seeks to assure employees that their conditions will be protected by the no disadvantage clause, which is the key to that in this legislation, and by the fact that unions have a right to be involved in enterprise agreements. If I have time I will refer to some of the letters I have received from some of the more fringe elements of employers' organisations who cannot stand having an equal relationship with their employees. Their letters indicate that they want to stand over people who are in a weakened position.

         This is an important part of the government's attempt to extend enterprise agreements because unionism protects women more than it protects men. Gross exploitation of workers occurs in non-unionised female areas. In Australia unionised men earn 8.5 per cent more than non-unionised men but unionised women earn 25 per cent more than non-unionised women. Of course, the state Liberal governments have given us tremendous examples of that. If people from South Australia, particularly women, are listening to this broadcast tonight, I say to them: make sure that you do not make a mistake when you come to elect a state government because in every case the Liberal Party in power in state governments has given advantage to the employer.

Ninety-three per cent of unions have superannuation, whereas only 75 per cent of non-unionists do. It was a similar case with annual leave loading where the figures were 89 per cent and 68 per cent. With sick leave the figures were 90 per cent and 67 per cent and with long service leave the figures were 85 per cent and 52 per cent.

         —I rise to speak on the Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993 and particularly on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. This bill aims to set rules for the relationship between employers and employees, principally for the 30 per cent of the private sector which is unionised. How should we judge this bill? Should it be judged on the intricacies of the industrial relations world, which very few people understand, or should it be judged on the impact it will have on the lives of most Australians? I believe it should be judged on the latter. It is in that context that I want to address my remarks tonight. This bill needs to be looked at in the context of how the Australian economy works and the need for high economic growth within this nation.

         For many years, Australia has experienced poor economic growth relative to the rest of the world. We have been slipping backwards for a long time—over and above the recession we had to have of recent years. We need sustained high economic growth, if only to look at what we need to do for the disadvantaged—the one million unemployed, the half million or so underemployed. What sort of future are we offering our children? We need sustained high economic growth.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Sure, we are currently experiencing growth at the rate of about three per cent. We need economic growth at the rate of five per cent or higher. The three per cent is being achieved because there is a lot of spare capacity in the Australian economy. When that is used up, our growth will tend to stall. The key to understanding long-term sustained economic growth is investment. We need to understand where investment comes from, who makes the decisions. Without investment, there will be no long-term sustained growth. Take this one single fact: the past two years have seen the lowest level of investment in plant and equipment in this economy since World War II—less than six per cent. Instead of being less than six per cent, it should be up to a level of eight or 10 per cent.

         We need most businesses—after all, there are more than 800,000 businesses in Australia—to look to expand, and they have to do that via investment. That is where new jobs come from. We need lots of people who want to invest and start up new businesses. Again, that is where new jobs come from. What do those people with existing businesses or those looking to form new businesses do? They look outwardly at the world from within this Australian economy and they ask the question: `Can I make a reasonable return on this investment? Can I make a quid on this investment?' What are the risks involved in making investments? Why is it that the rate of investment is so low in this country right now?

         The fundamental question before us tonight is: what does this industrial relations bill do to encourage investment in Australia? Does it help anybody? Does it encourage anybody to invest? The answers to these questions are clear and unequivocal. If we look at the evidence that has been put before various committees going back many years—the evidence that has been encouraged by this government, the evidence contained in key reports this government has commissioned—we see there is no question that one of the key things that needs to be done in this economy is to free up the labour market for more flexibility. Without that, businesses will not expand and wealth will not be created.

         If enacted, this bill will, firstly, add further impediments to business. It will discourage investment because it produces further hurdles against employers and employees getting together and making businesses work more productively. Secondly, it will strengthen the award system when we should be getting away from that and towards true enterprise agreements. Thirdly, it waters down the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Fourthly, it introduces much greater complexity to an already unwieldy system that not many people understand. Fifthly, it discourages investment by creating greater uncertainty in the business world.

         Unfortunately, the government has given higher priority to the union movement than it has to the welfare of the economy and to the Australian people, because this bill basically supports the union movement. I do not want my comments to be interpreted as being anti-union. I do not blame the unions for what they have proposed to the government. Managers also need to lift their game. Last week, the Chairman of the Industry Commission, Bill Scales, called for labour market reform. He was reported in a newspaper article as saying that:

        I am against—and the coalition is against—monopoly power. We are in favour of freedom of choice. If passed, this bill will ensure a faster track to extinction of the traditional union movement. If union officials were smart—and I know that a fair few of them are smart—they would be asking the government to truly free up the system. They would be working to sell their services by persuasion—not by legislation, not by compulsion.

         How will businesses react to this legislation if enacted? Large businesses which are largely unionised will carry on as usual. A high proportion of their work force is unionised and they do have the management skills to negotiate and arrange enterprise agreements—sure, perhaps with some difficulty—in spite of what is being proposed. But the bill does nothing to encourage them and their employees to get together to work for greater productivity, hence greater wealth in this country, hence greater incomes and more jobs.

         The evidence is quite clear that medium and small businesses will do nothing. Those wanting to formalise the agreements they now have will have the choice, in most states, of being able to do a true enterprise agreement through state legislation, except if they are respondents to federal awards. If that is the case, they will probably do nothing. They will not bother with this legislation.

         The need to free up the labour market has been identified by many reports and many advisers over many years. For example, there has been the Garnaut report, commissioned by this government in 1988; the Helen Hughes report; Manufacturing Council reports; the remarks of virtually every employer organisation and business investment organisation in Australia; and the remarks made by Bill Scales from the Industry Commission which I mentioned earlier. After all, it is those organisations which do the investment. They have to persuade investors, financiers, to put the money with them.

        That is a very important statement, and one that I agree with. It continues:

        Where will we get those from? Let us look at that particular issue. I now turn to the issue of fair treatment procedures which is found on page 24 of this document. It states:

        A fair industrial relations system must have fast, effective and inexpensive grievance procedures. Those who remain within the award stream will continue to have access to existing grievance procedures.

       <para>
        Earlier in the document it says that where one cannot reach agreement with one's employer the award will cease. On the one hand this policy allows for the continuation of the Industrial Relations Commission and yet on the other hand it says that once an employee cannot reach agreement with his or her employer the award ceases to exist.

How can those opposite have a fair system of enterprise bargaining when they say to workers that they must negotiate an enterprise agreement but at the same time say that they have no capacity to negotiate? I want those opposite to tell me what is fair about that system. This is the process that we should be looking into.

         On the basis of the opposition's policy there is no capacity—as there is in Victoria, to a lesser extent in New South Wales and also in Western Australia—for workers to negotiate anything. In respect of 45D and 45E, the opposition says that it will strengthen the legislation where necessary. The opposition, on the one hand, purports to say that workers will have a system that is fair and equitable and workers will have a capacity to sit down with their employers and negotiate arrangements for the future of their employment and, on the other hand, it purports to say that we will strengthen the very stick that employers need to beat the workers around the head. That is what the opposition's policy says.

         So those opposite should not come in here with some pantomime about taking the interests of Australia's working men and women to heart. The opposition is interested in reducing the standards of employment in this country. Yet, the opening paragraph of this document talks about a high productivity, high wage policy.

         I listened with interest to what Senator Gibson had to say on the matter of higher productivity and higher wages, and I partly agree with him. He said we need to increase productivity. That is a very important aspect of a workplace, no matter what the workplace is. Senator Gibson knows this because he came from an industry that was very much in need of establishing itself in a competitive way. He was the former Director of Australian Newsprint Mills and he knows the number of employees who lost their jobs because of improved productivity. I say to Senator Gibson that increased productivity does not necessarily spell more employment.

         —The legislation before the chamber at the moment seeks to deal with industrial relations and not the kind of rubbish or diatribe that flows from some people on the other side. Enterprise bargaining does a number of things. For the first time in the history of industrial relations in this country it will provide the opportunity for non-union shops to have enterprise agreements registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. Opposition members and a number of employer groups have claimed that allowing a union which is a respondent to an award, and through which an enterprise agreement may be sought to be made, to turn up to the Industrial Relations Commission and put an argument with respect to the particular agreement—whether for or against it—is a real problem and, in fact, will stop employers from seeking to register agreements. I think that is just nothing short of a load of rubbish.

         Quite frankly, as a former secretary of a union, I know the difficulty that unions have in dealing with the day-to-day complaints that they receive from employees with regard to unscrupulous employers who are respondents to awards, who do have agreements in place and who are taking workers down. I am quite sure that unions will not seek to turn up every time an agreement is put before the commission. There is one very good reason why they will not necessarily need to do that—that is, this industrial relations legislation contains within it a process that provides for the no disadvantage test, and the commission can only register agreements that meet the requirements of the no disadvantage test. So there will be no necessity for unions to turn up on a daily, monthly or any other basis, because they will have access to such agreements after they are registered anyway. So this fear, which is being fuelled by the opposition, is quite unfounded.

         We have heard from the other side that this bill will create further unemployment and a lack of investment, but the fact of the matter is that it adds to the security of employment of workers. It provides a balance to make sure that workers are not unfairly dismissed or unfairly treated. One important aspect—and we have all heard over a long period about the savings of individual people in this country—is that if the industrial relations policy of the opposition were now being implemented as legislation, we would lose the award superannuation that has been granted to workers. That is a very important aspect of personal savings.

         I am quite amazed at the continual statements that somehow this legislation, both current and proposed, has some capacity to affect investment. Senator Gibson is nodding his head. Those opposite say, `There will be less investment if we have this legislation'. I have yet to hear any statement from that side as to why that would be the case. There is one reason that investment occurs in any business, and that is a provision that the business has some capacity to sell whatever it produces. If it is a restaurant selling coffee, it has to have customers. That is the one fundamental thing that this country needs. Do honourable senators know why? Because we had almost 32 years of conservative government that rode on the sheep's back and did nothing else; it did nothing about manufacturing. But for the past 10 years this government has been dealing with the real issue that will affect investment in this country; it has been redeveloping the manufacturing industry of this country.

That industry has redefined itself and is redesigning itself to meet the challenges of the future, and it will do so successfully. That is where employment will ultimately come from.

It is a payback to the ACTU for running a scare campaign at the last election—at the expense of its own members and without their permission—on behalf of its political arm, the ALP. Like the mafia, the ACTU has come back to collect, with interest. It was also an election that was a win for the ACTU-ALP, but a mighty loss for Australia.

         Honourable senators might recall that a few years ago, to cope with falling membership in what is called the post-industrial age, the ACTU plugged for the move to mega-unions, which the Labor government funded at great expense to the Australian taxpayer. Notwithstanding the fact that it now uses the ILO to support what it is doing, there was no support from the ILO for mega-unions. But this is what the ACTU wanted, and when the ACTU says to the Labor Party, `Jump', the Labor Party says, `How high?'.

         This was clearly a resounding failure and the strategy was abandoned. So now we are going to small unions and this bill puts in place a legalistic mechanism which will enable unions to involve themselves and force union membership on the 70 per cent of employees in the private sector who do not want union involvement and who do not want to be union members. It is just another form of roping in. Those people on the other side who know a bit about it—and they are getting fewer because their ranks are being filled with academics—know that that is exactly correct.

         The effect of this bill will be threefold. First, it will be a disincentive to enterprise based agreements. Secondly, there will not be any non-union enterprise based agreements. The employers are not that stupid. They are not going to put in an enterprise based agreement, have some union official come in who has no relationship with the enterprise, and run the risk of being attacked, whether the next day, week or month, in an attempt to force those people to join the union. Thirdly, and more importantly, it will be a disincentive, particularly for those in the small business sector, to employ people on a full-time basis.

I do not know just how to explain this to Senator Murphy because I have not yet adapted to what I was advised when I first came into this place—that when talking to people from the other side who have no idea about management or about business decisions and investments, one should talk to them as if they are 12-year-old children.

         We in the opposition are not and have never been opposed to trade unions. It is the right of individuals to freely and voluntarily join any organisation to pursue their common interests. We are not opposed to that. What we do object to is the compulsion and coercion of individuals to pay fees and become members of an organisation to which they do not wish to belong. I will give an example of this. In May this year on a construction site at Coolum a 62-year-old contractor, Reg Gordge, refused to join the Builders Labourers Federation in Queensland. A newspaper article stated that Mr Gordge

        It turned out that a BLF official was checking the workers at the 24-unit Pandanus Coolum project to see that they were members. The article continued:

        He said that he could see no sense in paying $136 in union membership fees when he was working for only three days on the site. The BLF—and this is mafia stuff—works on the basis that once it comes on site and says, `We declare this a construction site', the employer will pay to get it out of the place. On all the examples I have been given of this union, once the employer pays—because it works on the basis that the employer will pay to get rid of it—it is not interested in the names; all it is interested in is the money. That is mafia stuff. That is not the sort of thing we want to see in this country, but it is the sort of thing we have and the sort of thing that this bill enhances.

         The practice of compulsion and coercion which existed hundreds of years ago of forcing people to join churches is viewed historically as having been a denial of human rights. That practice, which is frowned upon, is no different from compulsory unionism. Organisations, whether they be churches or trade unions, must earn their members. Membership in both is reported to be falling. No-one would suggest that to alleviate the decline in church membership legislation should be introduced to make it compulsory. This, however, is what this legislation attempts to do in respect of trade union membership.

         If we have a free society, every Australian should and must be free to join, not join or resign from any organisation without fear of intimidation or the retribution of losing his or her job. But this bill fosters that fear. Proposed section 170DF, in fact, is discriminatory, as it proposes that an employer cannot terminate an employee's employment for a number of reasons, including union activity outside working hours or, with permission, inside working hours, or seeking office, or acting or having acted in the capacity of a representative of the employees. This bill, however, does not prohibit employers from dismissing employees for refusing to join a union. There are two sides to this coin. Those who believe in freedom, which we on this side do and which those on the other side obviously do not, must accept that there is another side to that coin. We all know what goes on when this happens.

The union demanded that Hamersley break the WA industrial laws and dismiss Beales, but the company refused. The MEWU closed down Hamersley for two weeks, at great cost to the economy of Australia. At the height of the dispute, 11 iron ore carriers were anchored offshore—a merchant navy anchored off the West Australian coast. After Hamersley obtained an injunction against the union, the strike ended, Beales came out of hiding—what a dreadful thing it is to have to say that in this country—and returned to work.

        Another concern about this bill will be the effect on the enterprise agreement freely entered into by Metway Bank and its staff association. This has been one of the success stories of enterprise bargaining. It has been of great benefit to the employees and to Metway without interference by outside parties. The only disadvantage suffered was to Metway itself when the Goss Labor government in Queensland decided to exact retribution by taking $18 million which rightfully belonged to Metway.

         The bill is aimed at giving unions the extra muscle to force as many as possible of the 70 per cent of private sector employees to join. It seeks to prop up unions, whether wanted or not, and this will mean that, inevitably, unemployment will increase because people will not invest when they know they are going to be subject to the bully-boy tactics of the more militant unions. Not all unions fit that category. I am the first to admit that; there are good unions. However, a piece of legislation that supports those extreme, radical unions is a recipe for failure. What causes the problem is interference of third parties in the operation of organisations. It lifts costs and jobs go to compensate.

I would hope that the minister, in his reply to the second reading debate, spells out how the government believes this legislation will address our chronically high and unacceptable level of unemployment which honourable senators will remember was brought about by Mr Keating's recession that we had to have.

The fact that during the formulation process a government and ACTU agreement took place has actually obscured the reality that there are major provisions the union movement would rather do without. The concept of an agreement which was not modified in any way is a concept which is only perpetuated by ignorant reporting of the facts as they occur.

         The retention of awards has been criticised, too, because they are described as being too restrictive. In this legislation the new process of reviewing awards every three years should simplify those awards and turn them into a genuine safety net. The new enterprise flexibility agreements stream will prevent unions from obstructing an enterprise deal which overrides excessively prescriptive award provisions. I would suggest that that is another example of this bill's reduction of union power, in complete contradiction to the claims by some who have chosen to comment on this and communicate with us that this bill somehow extends union power. Nothing could be further from the truth. I repeat an observation I made earlier in my contribution here that this bill, for the first time, legitimises non-union enterprise bargaining.

         Some employer groups have claimed that the non-union agreements stream containing enterprise flexibility agreements will not be used because the unions can have too great a role in that process. The Democrats' response to that suggestion is that precedent suggests that the Industrial Relations Commission would grant a right to be heard to a union which is party to an award to be varied by enterprise bargaining agreement even if it were not in this bill. The commission has an extremely limited discretion to refuse approval of an enterprise flexibility agreement. Unless an objecting union can show that the agreement fails the tests in this bill, the union would have very little chance of convincing the commission to reject it.

         That opinion—that statement—which is based on the precedents which have been established through the history of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, is backed up by the situation we observe in Tasmania with the recent court finding in the Delta Hydraulics case. Union participation before the enterprise commissioner of Tasmania had previously been denied, but the court found that this was without foundation and contrary to justice, if you like. The concept that a union which had been party to the making of an award in the past should be denied the opportunity to be heard is not sustainable. Even if we did not have that provision in this bill, as I said earlier, precedent suggests that the Industrial Relations Commission would be loath to consider such an agreement without at least hearing from the union. I emphasise the word `hearing' because that process has been portrayed as the opportunity for unions to have a veto over such an agreement. Again, that is not the case. There is no provision for veto; there is the opportunity for that union to present its case.

         The protection against unfair dismissal has been attacked as giving unions a veto over such sackings. We do not agree with that description of the provision; in fact, we think it is completely untrue. All the bill requires is for unions to be consulted where more than 15 employees are to be made redundant at the same time. Of the several dozen faxes and communications received in the last few days, the vast majority are from employers of six, eight or 10 employees who are unduly concerned about such a provision. They have been misled. These people who have gone about their business making, constructing, producing and contributing to Australia's wealth have been misled by communications directed to them by people who do not have a real interest in this bill and who just want to obstruct the progress of legislation. The people who have been contributing to Australia's wealth have been misled by the suggestion that somehow or other this particular provision will impinge on their freedom to negotiate and to work with their employees.

         The provision covers the situation where more than 15 employees are to be made redundant at the one time—and only in certain circumstances, anyway—and it makes provision for the unions to be consulted. Yet we have some incredibly draconian interpretations of that provision. The thrust of the termination provisions is to provide for procedural fairness and a proper look at alternatives for dismissal—in other words, good management and a touch of humanity. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you would be aware that the Australian Medical Association has highlighted the gross insensitivity with which some people are sacked in this country and the serious health problems that unemployment brings. It takes a bizarre imagination to cast employers in the role of victims of these provisions when the aim of the provisions is to help people who are about to lose their livelihoods.

         The secondary boycott provisions have been attacked as rendering employers vulnerable to unreasonable industrial action. In principle, the scheme proposed in the bill better balances the rights of employers with those of employees.

Other boycotts will remain illegal and subject to the full force of the law.

         The right to strike and lockout during negotiations for single business certified agreements has been attacked as a recipe for industrial disputation which could send businesses to the wall.

         Another factor to be considered against the criticism of those rights to strike, to lock out or to engage in limited industrial action is that a bargaining period can be terminated by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission if one side refuses to negotiate. We raised with the government whether termination could occur on other grounds, but the fact is that any such provision would weaken the move towards bargaining and away from arbitration. Arbitration would be seen as a shelter from such a situation. Nevertheless, any return to widespread and damaging disputation would now warrant a more intrusive commission role in enterprise bargaining because the commission now has much more authority through the provisions in this bill than previously.

         We remain concerned that groups with low bargaining power will miss out under enterprise bargaining. For example, work forces where women are in the majority are less likely to achieve pay rises through enterprise bargaining. But Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that no overall fall in women's pay relative to men has occurred through that process. The award review process and the minimum entitlements provisions will provide some protection for those groups, who could also include young people, old people, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, and so on. Parliament needs to monitor the impact of enterprise bargaining on such vulnerable groups and to be able to take corrective action if undesirable trends emerge.

         For months we had a running saga in our newspapers about the progress of the government's negotiations on industrial reform. We have seen the Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, promising to bring about genuine reform in the labour market. He was going to do what none of his predecessors could achieve, namely, facilitate workplace bargaining and enterprise deals for non-unionists into the industrial relations structure. In a speech given by the minister in mid-October to mark the occasion of enterprise bargaining week, he said that the government's industrial reform package `would entrench enterprise bargaining as the very hallmark of Australia's industrial relations system'.

         We all saw the minister being rolled by the ACTU. Any prospect of real reform disintegrated as a result of that. What we have not seen is extensive coverage on the impact of this proposed legislation on women. A week after the bill was finally tabled in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Industrial Relations made a very telling remark, namely, that the government would be making amendments to the bill to protect women from discrimination in the workplace. He was speaking at a conference in Sydney, a forum on the glass ceiling. He said that night—I think it was something like 4 November—that he would be introducing a range of amendments to the proposed legislation during the next sitting of parliament designed to ensure fairness and equity for women in the workplace.

         That seemed very odd to me. We actually issued a press release on it. Here was the minister who had done all this so-called consulting and suddenly light had dawned on him that really he had not addressed the issue of women. It was somewhat ironic because, a week before tabling the bill, he issued a joint press release with Senator Crowley assuring women's groups that the government's industrial relations package would be fair and equitable to women. Yet he had to come in after the bill had been tabled and say that with the amendments he would address some of the concerns that women's groups had raised with him.

One has to laugh when the Labor government touts itself as the great protector of women. What it should be saying is that women are a mere afterthought in Labor's scheme of things. So while the government and much of the media have been prepared largely to ignore the effect of this proposed legislation on women, I am certainly not.

         There is another compelling reason why the position of women in relation to this bill warrants special consideration and comment. Women experience quite different employment status and occupational segregation and remuneration from men. Currently, around 3.2 million Australian workers, or 42 per cent of the total Australian labor force, are women. Of these 3.2 million women, around 75 per cent are employed on a part-time basis. In comparison, only 25 per cent of the 4.4 million Australian men in the labour force are part-time workers.

         Apart from the predominance of women in part-time employment, women's employment is concentrated in particular occupations and industries. Well over half of Australia's working women are employed in the community services and wholesale and retail trade sectors. Women also dominate in finance and business services as well as in recreation, personal and other service sectors. Historically, these sectors have been less than industrially powerful than some of the male dominated sectors such as the mining, manufacturing and construction industries.

         It is also true that women generally fall into the lower status occupations that tend to be less industrially powerful and receive wages below the national average. So in general women tend to occupy lower status and lower paid jobs in relatively industrially weak sectors of the labour force. Unfortunately, little is going to change under the proposals contained in this bill.

         This is simply a disaster for working women in this country. Traditionally, women have not been well looked after or represented by the trade union movement. Not surprisingly, fewer women have been and are currently members of trade unions than men. It is notable that union membership has been and still is lower amongst part-time workers, most of whom are women.

         Women are also under-represented in the trade union structure. There are currently only eight women on the 38 strong ACTU executive. Recent surveys also confirm that Australia's biggest unions are themselves performing poorly as employers in putting women into influential positions. Only last week a conference on affirmative action for women in trade unions was told that an

        By entrenching the role of unions in the new industrial relations environment, there is a very real concern that women will be disadvantaged. If unions effectively have a monopoly on the negotiations preceding enterprise agreements the best interests of women are likely not to be served.

         Women need uninhibited access to enterprise bargaining if they are going to enjoy the benefits that it can deliver. I believe that there are tremendous gains for women in true enterprise bargaining but, in order to achieve these gains, women need to be at the negotiating table when the deal is being struck. They need to be informed about the process and able to engage freely in the negotiations.

         I would like to make a comment on the role that the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women has played in doing just that. It has produced a booklet called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Snakes and Ladders
         </emphasis>
         which very clearly outlines to women the role that they can play in enterprise bargaining; that is, what they can do, how they can negotiate wages and how they can negotiate terms and conditions. It goes through these roles in a very clear, precise way. This is a positive step that the federation has taken to inform women.

         I would recommend that any woman who is concerned about the issue of enterprise bargaining should read that booklet. It is a positive action that is being taken. It is the sort of thing that should be being done to encourage women to take responsibility, to be part of that negotiating process and to be there. It is often the case that men have the positions in unions. They are the ones dominating the decision making with the outcomes of those arrangements suiting men and not the needs of women who want to pick up children from school and who want to be involved in situations such as caring for older relatives or whatever else they might want to negotiate.

         With the multiple roles that Australian women play—as carers, as workers, as mothers and as individuals—they need the upmost flexibility in their working arrangements. Genuine enterprise bargaining can deliver this flexibility in that it can allow women to negotiate more flexible working hours; it can reduce the stress involved in juggling a family and a job; and it can allow women to maintain a career with less interruption. But this will not happen while an out of touch, male dominated union sector and a male dominated hierarchy clings tenaciously to its pivotal negotiating role.

         I am impressed by the commission's prompt response to my speech on 18 November 1993. Its monitoring of parliamentary speeches is quite exemplary—unless, of course, some politician happened to refer my speech to it. But I doubt that because the commission says that it is not interested in political tactics. I appreciate the information contained in the letter from the CJC and I thank the commission for its gratuitous advice.

         My interest in this matter arises from approaches made to me by constituents. I also have an interest in ensuring that elected members of local governments are able to govern and manage their councils as they have been democratically elected to do. As one who has had continuing concerns over the excesses of previous and current state governments, I am a long-term supporter of a criminal justice type of organisation, but I do understand the delicacy and sensitivity of the role of the CJC. In conclusion, I wish the CJC well in its continuing role and in its difficult task of identifying the genuine from the politically motivated.

         What Mr Keating seemingly does not understand is that doing business in Asia is not just a matter of fronting up at the door, knocking, producing one's bag of wares and saying, `I'd like you to buy some of my mobile phones, trinkets or whatever it might be'. In Asia an immense amount of store is placed on good faith and personal relationships and, most importantly, an immense amount of store is placed on etiquette. Maybe Mr Keating does not understand this, but etiquette is the basis of all relationships in South-East Asia.

         As one of the few Asian Australians involved in politics, let me say that one cannot stress too much the importance of etiquette. If one reads the

          Analects
         </emphasis>
         , one will see that half of what Confucius wrote—and I know Confucius is not directly relevant to Malaysia—was about etiquette; that is, what was good etiquette and bad etiquette, how one should learn etiquette and how one should apply etiquette. If Mr Keating does not have an understanding of etiquette, then all of the nonsense that we have heard from him about Australia becoming part of Asia is just nonsense.

         We have to understand that if we want to be part of the region, if we want to be good neighbours, then we have to conduct ourselves as good neighbours. Everything that Mr Keating has done since making that comment in Seattle has only compounded the problem. He has tried to excuse it on the basis that it was part of the rough and tumble of politics. He has tried to excuse it on the basis that Dr Mahathir had not personally complained. Of course Dr Mahathir has not personally complained because that is merely an admission of the fact that Mr Keating's comments caused him to lose face.

         Finally, we heard his grudging comment: `I didn't mean to cause any offence but I'm not going to go any further than that and Malaysia has to cop it or I'm going to take some action'. That just shows Mr Keating to be the sort of recalcitrant that he was accusing Dr Mahathir of being.

         In conclusion, there is a very simple way out of this problem. I spoke recently to perhaps one of the most influential Malaysian born Australian businessmen. He said that the simple solution is for Mr Keating to have one of our senior government ministers, such as Senator Cook, Senator Evans or Senator Ray, apologise for any offence suffered by Dr Mahathir. Mr Keating does not even have to do it himself and that will be sufficient. But every day we dither, we make the situation worse. The problem is that we do not just make the situation worse for the government; we make the situation worse for the companies, the people and the jobs that are dependent on them.

        (1) The Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) conclusion was based on advice from the Northern Territory that the presence of the giant termite species Mastotermes darwiniensis in northern Australia required the use of organochlorine insecticides. The Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries in a submission to the National Registration Authority's Inquiry into Organochlorines reiterated the unsuitability of alternative chemical and non-chemical treatments in the Northern Territory for the protection of buildings under construction.

        (4) The NHMRC Report Cyclodiene insecticide use in Australia states on page 201 "A complete ban on the cyclodiens would therefore result in an increased use of alternative chemicals, some of which have much greater acute toxicity and hence are less safe in immediate use."  As the only chemical alternative approved as a possible replacement for organochlorines for under slab and retreatment of existing buildings is chlorpyriphos then the interpretation has been that chlorpyriphos was the chemical referred to.

        It should be noted that of the AIDS research funding, approximately 42% is spent on virological and immunological research. This research has potential to provide valuable information of relevance to a number of diseases—not just AIDS. A further 33% is spent on clinical and epidemiological research relating to AIDS, while approximately 25% is being expended on social and behavioural research, focusing primarily on the preventive nature of the disease.

        Perhaps more important than funding by specific disease state is that this Government has greatly increased the funding of medical research. Since the Government came into office it has increased support for health and medical research by over 100 per cent in real terms from $30 million in 1982-83 to $119 million in 1993-94.

The Australian Government supports the observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights, and has made representations to the Greek Government when there is evidence to suggest that allegations of abuse of human rights may have some basis in fact.

        (7) The Department's Post Program Monitoring (PPM) system is used to monitor labour market program outcomes. PPM data are derived from responses to survey questionnaires which are returned, on average, about three months after assistance ceased. The data distinguish between unsubsidised and subsidised employment. Subsidised employment refers to cases where the employer receives a wage subsidy from the Government for employing a disadvantaged jobseeker (eg under the JOBSTART program).

        However, PPM data on employment outcomes for the Relocation Assistance component of the Scheme for 1991-92 indicate that approximately 84% of those who ceased assistance under the program were in unsubsidised employment at the time of the survey. In 1992-93, approximately 83% of those who ceased assistance were in unsubsidised employment. In addition, PPM data indicate that a number of other people who ceased assistance under the program were in subsidised employment (respectively 5.7% of all jobseekers who ceased assistance in 1991-92 and 10.4% in 1992-93).

        (1) The Sri Lankan conflict, for most of 1993, has been characterised by occasional skirmishes, most of which have occurred in the east of the island or on the lagoons surrounding Jaffna. The Sri Lankan Government has been pursuing a strategy of driving the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) out of the east in preparation for the holding of local council elections. However, on 26 July 1993 the LTTE overran the Sri Lankan Army base at Janakpura, killing approximately 60 service personnel and 17 civilians and capturing a large quantity of weapons. Subsequently, in late September the Sri Lankan Government forces launched a five day operation, codenamed "Yal Devi", to the northwest of the Government base at Elephant Pass, resulting in the reported deaths of 130 LTTE and 118 Government troops. The LTTE responded by launching a large-scale attack on Government army and naval bases near Pooneryn to the west of Elephant Pass on 11 November. At the time of writing, Government losses were estimated at over 300 with a further 450 unaccounted for, while LTTE losses have been put at about 450.

        (2) Details of civilian casualties from the latest battle are not yet known but very few, if any, civilians were believed to be in the  vicinity of the bases when the attack took place. The Sri Lankan Air Force subsequently undertook a series of bombing raids on LTTE targets in the Jaffna area. Inaccurate bombing during these raids is reported to have resulted in an as yet unconfirmed number of civilian deaths and injuries.

        Excluding the battle at Pooneryn, total civilian casualties in the north during 1993 are estimated at approximately 250, comprising 120 killed during Government shelling and bombing, and 130 killed or missing while attempting to cross the Jaffna lagoon. No information is available on casualties which might have been occasioned by LTTE operations in the area, although LTTE attacks on Sinhalese and Muslim villagers have lessened following adverse local and international reaction to their terror campaign in 1992 during which hundreds of civilians were killed. Further civilian casualties can be expected from continued LTTE activities.

        (3) Apart from providing support during major military operations, Government forces resort infrequently to the use of artillery or aerial bombardments. Attempts are made to hit designated targets from the air, but it is apparent that some Government forces lack the expertise and equipment to achieve their objective precisely.  It is the usual practice of the Sri Lankan forces to undertake an aerial leaflet drop prior to the launching of a major operation. The leaflets advise civilians to take cover in designated places. However, the latest inaccurate sorties by the Sri Lankan Air Force in the Jaffna area indicate that designated civilian sanctuaries do not necessarily provide guaranteed safety to civilians.

        (4) The Australian High Commission in Colombo has made frequent representations to the Government of Sri Lanka, urging it to exercise restraint in its activities against the LTTE and to resume negotiations on a settlement of the communal problems in Sri Lanka. This activity includes representations to senior officers of the Armed Forces, senior Ministers, Parliamentarians and senior bureaucrats. The High Commission also participates in periodic group consultations with key military and civilian decision-makers. Direct contact with the LTTE is more difficult because it is in armed conflict with the Government and because of the geographic isolation of the LTTE leadership. The LTTE would be aware though of the Australian Government's statements deploring the continued violence in Sri Lanka and calling for both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to strive for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. The Australian Government also maintains an open and constructive dialogue with a number of groups in Australia of Sri Lankan origin, including a number of Tamil organisations.

        (5) I raised the prospect of Australia seeking to facilitate a role for the Commonwealth in promoting a negotiated settlement to the conflict with senior Sri Lankan Government officials during my visit to Sri Lanka in August 1990. Subsequent to my visit then Prime Minister Hawke wrote to the Sri Lankan President, the late Ranasinghe Premadasa, reiterating Australia's willingness to assist. While welcoming Australia's offer, the Sri Lankan President indicated a preference to continue attempts at direct negotiations between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. A number of subsequent similar offers of assistance have been received by the Sri Lankan Government from international groups, church-based organisations and individuals. The Sri Lankan Government's response has continued to be that the  conflict is a matter for internal resolution.

        The Sri Lankan Government has stated publicly that it is willing to engage the LTTE in negotiations and has on a number of occasions invited the LTTE to participate in a Joint Parliamentary Committee which has been examining ways and means of resolving the conflict. However, little or no progress towards peace has been achieved since the series of meetings between the Government and the LTTE, which were held in Colombo in 1990, were abandoned by the LTTE. Since then LTTE actions, such as reneging on agreements to exchange its prisoners for supplies, have not assisted calls for dialogue to resolve the conflict. Despite the assassination of President Premadasa in Colombo on 1 May 1993, which the Sri Lankan Government attributes most firmly to the LTTE, President Wijetunga renewed the Government's offer to negotiate with the LTTE.

        Against the background of the Sri Lankan Government's view that the conflict is an internal matter, there seems little that the United Nations, the Commonwealth or the Australian Government can contribute, apart from continuing to urge both sides to resume negotiations and to avoid further tragic loss of life, particularly among the civilian population. But the Government stands ready to help facilitate any steps towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict.

Other studies have shown no difference between the two types of insulin.

        (1)-(5) Training and Development activity within the Department of Defence, which is covered by the Training and Guarantee Act 1990, is largely being devolved to eight programs, ie, Forces Executive, Navy, Army, Air Force, Strategy and Intelligence, Acquisition and Logistics, Budget and Management, and Science and Technology. Only where it is important to achieve a high level of consistency of outcomes, policy integrity and/or equity are these activities managed centrally. As I noted in my response to a similar question from Senator Short on 28 May 1992, to produce the information required to respond to the honourable senator's question would require very significant resources.

        The ADF has different conditions of service policies for Members With Family (MWF) and Members Without Family (MWOF). The policies recognise the particular requirements of members who have responsibility for dependants; that is, the need to maintain a household. A dependant may be a spouse, child, parent, guardian or housekeeper (for a child or invalid spouse) who normally resides with the member. There is also scope for a person, other than those mentioned, to be classified as family.

        The Government's target is to achieve 50 per cent representation of women on government boards, councils and committees by the year 2000. Performance against this target is measured on a global basis however every effort is made to ensure reasonable representation of both women and men on individual boards, councils and committees. Appointments to government boards, councils and committees continue to be based on merit.
