In terms of the reason for the absence of Senator Evans and Senator Cook, there are preliminary meetings of ministers that precede the APEC meeting, hence the difference in timetable of departure between Senator Evans and Senator Cook and, in turn, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). These matters are somewhat exacerbated because both ministers are in the Senate; that is the way the responsibilities turned out. It would not be quite so obvious if one minister were in the House of Representatives and one minister were in the Senate.

        Senator Evans is always conscious of trying to be here in the chamber. He spends a lot of time programming parliamentary sittings and his own trips to make sure that he can be in this parliament. If those opposite compare his track record with those of previous Labor and Liberal foreign ministers, they will find that his attendance in the chamber is far better than that of any of his predecessors.

The attitude of this government is that it is very important that our debt reduction program continue. It has been frustrated and substantially affected by the actions of Senator Alston and his colleagues in this chamber, who have absolutely no policy in this regard. They can only bleat on that they would meet any debt reduction strategy through unspecified reductions in expenditure. They will not highlight which areas of expenditure they will reduce because that is far too much hard work. This government made very clear and the Prime Minister made very clear prior to the election our attitude to taxation and the mix of taxation. That was endorsed by the electorate, much to the chagrin of those opposite.

We are playing an effective role in promoting ship safety and proper crewing practices. However, Australia, as a relatively small ship owning nation largely dependent on overseas shipping services, is not well placed to pursue unilateral action.

         The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is playing a major role in implementing the government's response to the report. Last year AMSA increased its port state control inspections to cover 34 per cent of all foreign ships visiting Australian ports, well ahead of the accepted international inspection target of 25 per cent. Over 70 per cent of ships inspected were found to have had some kind of deficiency, more than half of those involving lifesaving and firefighting equipment vital to the safety of the crews on board those ships. On a number of recent occasions, AMSA has used its detention powers under the Navigation Act to prevent unsafe vessels from leaving port until identified deficiencies were rectified.

         In relation to the coastal shipping trade, I have asked the Department of Transport and Communications to review procedures under the ministerial guidelines for issuing coastal trading permits to foreign vessels. This will determine whether applicants should be required to supply more comprehensive information on the condition of the ship. When this review is completed, I will be consulting with interested parties in the industry on any proposed changes.

         At the international level, Australia is actively supporting efforts to improve the effectiveness of the International Maritime Organisation. At the IMO meeting in London last month AMSA, as Australia's representative, was re-elected, with an increased vote, as a member of the IMO council. This reflects the recognition of Australia's higher profile in the international maritime community. While substandard ships are in the minority, Australia must continue the high level of ship inspection and support for international action to rid the world of this threat to the well-being of ships' crews and to our environment.

         Women have made it clear to us that one of their main concerns is violence against them and their children in the community. It is also clear that violence exists on a totally unacceptable and, indeed, horrific scale against women throughout Australia, as any number of demonstrations and data reveal.

         Part of that stop violence against women campaign consists of this community education program where, as I said, non-violent men have joined women in opposing violence against women.

         As Kieren Perkins said, `We all have a responsibility to stop pretending that this kind of thing does not happen, to stop making excuses for violent men and to start speaking our minds'. As Darren Mercer added, `I appeal to them and to other sportsmen and sportswomen at the launch to use their influence as role models to say to young people it isn't manly or tough to rape or bash women'. I think that is a very important slogan. The sportsmen and sportswomen do have a considerable amount to offer the community. They are models to our young people. I believe the peer pressure that they will offer by saying to violent men in the community that it is totally unacceptable will make this campaign a great step forward in terms of community education and changing attitudes.

They include the assistance that the Office of the Status of Women is providing to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for the development of its gender awareness programs.

I think we are debating here not the quantum overall but the nature of the purchases—whether we should purchase A or B. The Prime Minister has expressed an opinion on what he believes is appropriate for the cabinet room. It does not really involve, in the overall quantum of art acquisition in this building, increased expenditure; it is whether it goes in one particular area or another.

         The Australian deployment was originally anticipated to be for a period of 35 weeks and was not intended to be open ended. We have subsequently agreed to six-monthly rotations of the contingent because of the delays in the organisation of the referendum. In response to a request from the UN, the Australian contingent with Minurso is currently being rotated for a further six-month deployment but we have advised the UN that this will be the last rotation, and it ends in May 1994.

         The history of disinformation on this matter is recent. On 4 November this year, the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, Kerry Chikarovski, put out a press statement making a somewhat astounding claim that the Commonwealth had cut funding to adult ESL programs in New South Wales by some 20 per cent. She also claimed that that would necessitate a reduction of jobs in the area of some 84 positions. The New South Wales Teachers Federation, ignited by this press statement, issued a press release protesting and signalling industrial action.

         The truth, of course, is different. If the minister, Kerry Chikarovski, and the journalists who ran her press release had bothered to check, they would have seen that her claims were wrong. Rather than decrease, Commonwealth expenditure on adult ESL programs for New South Wales residents has substantially increased as a result of 1992-93 budget decisions. ESL funding in New South Wales over the 1992-94 triennium is: 1992, $37.3 million, with $34.5 million coming from my department and $2.8 million coming from DEET; 1993, $43.1 million, with $25.7 million from my department and $17.4 million from DEET; and 1994, $42.1 million, with $20.1 million from Immigration and $22 million from DEET. Of these state figures, Commonwealth funding to the New South Wales Adult Migrant English Service over the 1992-94 triennium is expected to be: in 1992, $31 million; in 1993, $35.6 million; and in 1994, $31 million.

Does the Prime Minister believe that $100,000 worth of art work in the cabinet room will provide the necessary inspiration to deal with the massive unemployment crisis facing this country?

         Certainly in 1991 my department had issued a report pointing out the need for there to be an Australian marketing industry council. It had been recognised for some time within the industry that we were not achieving what we ought to be able to achieve as far as the marketing industry in Australia is concerned. Of course, as we become internationally more competitive, one area in which we have to lift our game is marketing. We have good design, good science and good management in Australia, but we are not yet to the stage of being internationally competitive on marketing.

         The marketing industry includes a broad range of industry groups. At the meeting I attended recently they were all represented. It was the first time they had come together.

I ask, firstly, will the Australian government seek full details from the Vietnamese government as to the reasons for and the specific conditions of Professor Hoat's solitary confinement?

         The National Road Transport Commission was established by this government in 1991 to develop  proposals for uniform systems of heavy vehicle regulation and registration charges for consideration by Australian governments. A national charging regime has been proposed for implementation in July 1995. The NRTC is now focusing on the development of a comprehensive set of regulations to be progressively incorporated into umbrella legislation. This approach has been adopted so that specific segments of regulation can be applied as they are agreed to. This will give the industry more rapid access to the savings and the greater efficiencies being made available by these new standards.

The crucial thing is that, on the public record so far, the Leader of the Opposition, to his credit, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have categorically stated their position in opposition to the effect of clause 7 of the Western Australian legislation.

It was only at that point, of course, that Senator Kemp and Senator Hill rose to their feet to object to the answer that Senator Collins was giving. They know that Senator Collins is in order, and I ask you to rule accordingly.

That bill passed through the House of Representatives in October and is expected to be introduced into the Senate on 22 November this year.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray), to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill this day, relating to the former fine arts adviser in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mrs Betteridge.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mrs Betteridge has been treated appallingly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Senate should continue to pursue this matter to ensure that she ultimately receives the apology that she deserves. What happened in relation to the Thai mahogany table was that Mrs Betteridge was directed to the Prime Minister's friend Mr Kenny in search of this table. When this became a political embarrassment to the Prime Minister, he decided that the staff member of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet concerned, Mrs Betteridge, should be the one that took the rap. That is appalling.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Prime Minister went on the John Laws program to dob her in. Through that program, he firstly wanted to make clear to the Australian people that it was Mrs Betteridge who found the table and that he had nothing to do with it. He was specifically asked by John Laws:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Who found one?
       </para>

        This is referring to the table. The Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well, it was found by, I think in the first instance, the person you mentioned, Ms Betteridge.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was no mention of the Prime Minister's involvement at all. The interview continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        JL: She found the table to begin with?

       <para font-size="-=2">
        PM: Yes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second half of the exercise involved the Prime Minister's embarrassment when he was forced to return the table because it was outside the guidelines of the Australiana Fund. Rather than face up to that responsibility himself, it was again Mrs Betteridge who took the blame. John Laws specifically asked:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Why did she then disapprove of it?
       </para>
       <para>
        Again this is referring to the purchase of this table. The Prime Minister said:

        Look, I think this is the revenge of the `hyphenated names'.

       <para>
        The evidence before us now demonstrates that the Prime Minister was deliberately misleading the Australian people in those answers, at a cost to Mrs Betteridge. He had no concern as to her position in this matter whatsoever. I remind honourable senators, to put the matter in context, that the Prime Minister, being unhappy with Mrs Betteridge and wanting to demonstrate that she should take the rap, telephoned her and, to use his words, expressed his disquiet about the serious inaccuracies and reflections on his role in this matter, after which Mrs Betteridge felt that she had no alternative but to accept voluntarily retirement from the department.

        This was the Prime Minister directing Mrs Betteridge to go to Mr Kenny. I move to her next minute, dated 14 December 1992, in which she said:

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray), to a question without notice asked by Senator Kemp this day, relating to lithographs purchased as part of the Parliament House art collection.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        My question to Senator Robert Ray went to the core of what I think is widespread concern in the community about the behaviour of Mr Keating and the way he operates as the Prime Minister of this country. He seems to regard himself, as some of the cartoonists have so aptly described him, as a Sun King acting in a totally imperial way. Clearly, Mr Keating has become a bit worried about some of the criticisms which have been made in the press about his concentration on artwork and the very significant expenditures which have been involved. In a doorstop interview Mr Keating complained that other people in his position—the John Curtins, Ben Chifleys and Robert Menzies—were not subjected to this sort of critique.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The point I would make is that the John Curtins, Ben Chifleys, Robert Menzies and Malcolm Frasers simply did not involve themselves in the type of activities that Mr Keating is involving himself in. I cannot believe that Ben Chifley or John Curtin would have been remotely worried about the artwork on the cabinet wall, or would have been the slightest bit concerned about the quality of the dining table at the Lodge, or would have spent hours looking at the quality of lights for the dining room—all at great cost to the taxpayer, I might say.

         There is a very great concern in the community—amongst not only people on our side of the parliament but also Labor supporters—that we have a man who sees his role as Prime Minister in rather an imperial way, and as meaning that he can act in an arbitrary way without proper processes. We have seen this in relation to the staffing at the Lodge where four or five members of the Prime Minister's staff have been moved on or dismissed since he came there and, as far as I can see—particularly in the three recent cases which were brought before the estimates committee—all without the reasonable due process that one would expect.

They would not be worried about Gould prints in the cabinet room, nor would they be worried about whether or not the butler is wearing striped pants when he serves dinner at the Lodge. I do not believe that any Prime Minister in this country would be remotely worried about those things, but not so Mr Keating.

         When I asked this question of Senator Ray, I must admit I was a bit concerned, because Senator Robert Ray is well known as a man who does not speak to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister does not speak to Senator Ray. Therefore, it is probably a bit unfair to press Senator Ray for the Prime Minister's opinion on some issue. But I asked Senator Ray what I thought was a reasonable question: rather than spending an additional $100,000 on Gould prints for Mr Keating's cabinet room, would it not have been better to think how this money could have been better spent? If $100,000 is available to indulge the artistic taste of Mr Keating, maybe $100,000 is available to help with emergency relief for families who find themselves without food, who are homeless and so forth.

         It is a question which I believe only the modern Labor Party would have difficulty in answering. If we were to ask any traditional Labor person—and, indeed, any person on this side—where $100,000 would be better spent in this current climate, none of them would have any difficulty whatsoever in answering. But Senator Ray had a major problem in trying to justify the actions of the Prime Minister.

         —I rise to speak on the motion, moved by Senator Kemp, that Senator Ray's answer to his question be noted. I think both the question and the five minutes we have heard just now from Senator Kemp indicate just how bereft the opposition is. Today in question time, when one would have thought there would be questions on such major issues as the future of trade in our region with the APEC conference about to take place, economic development in Australia and Mabo—when we have all of that—we had one question right at the end on Mabo and several questions attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

         What I am particularly amazed about is Senator Kemp's complaint about the cost of the paintings for the cabinet room. I just want to point out that these paintings are not, of course, for Mr Keating's personal use; they belong to the parliament, to the public. If we are going to be really upset about $100,000 being spent there, how about those opposite standing up and explaining the waste of the $93,000 that Senator Bishop has spent travelling all around Australia campaigning for the leadership of the Liberal Party. She is able to do that under the entitlements which have been made available to all federal members of parliament. But do not tell me she is going around to every one of those Liberal Party meetings talking about her parliamentary duties; she is purely talking about her desire to become leader of the Liberal Party. I have to say to Senator Kemp that that $93,000 could certainly be better spent.

         In the last three days the opposition leader announced that all previous statements he has made about Mabo and all discussion papers were—to paraphrase Ronald Ziegler of the President Nixon era—`no longer operative' and that the opposition is now going to start anew. This is despite the fact that during the middle of the year Dr Hewson travelled all around Australia to Aboriginal communities telling them that he supported native title in all its various forms, that he would look after them and that he was understanding.

So he had to junk everything that he had previously said.

         That is why we are not getting any debate on Mabo here today. That is why we are not getting any debate or discussion from the opposition on economic issues.

This was not likely from this mob. The opposition was back attacking the Prime Minister at a personal level. That is typical of the opposition.

        For the information of Senator Collins, I point out that I did read the draft legislation on Mabo that Mr Keating—or someone from Mr Keating's office, or somewhere like that—caused to fall off the back of a truck. Senator Collins invited me to wait until the legislation was presented to parliament, but I will take it that the legislation that was dropped off the back of a truck is somewhere near what is going to come.

         Without turning this into a prolonged debate, I simply refer Senator Panizza to the operation of, for example, the Northern Territory land rights act, which has operated under this kind of regime for 17 years and has done so very successfully and without any complaints from legal counsel. Those procedures provide flexibility to acknowledge the kind of evidence that has been taken, the circumstances in which it has been taken and the land rights. Of course, it was oversighted by very distinguished judges of the Federal Court. One of the judges, the first in fact, is now a distinguished member of the High Court—the Hon. Justice John Toohey.

         I personally attended many hours of hearings of land claims before the Land Commissioner. The commission routinely sat away from a court situation. In fact, I can remember on a number of land rights commission hearings in Kakadu National Park actually standing in the physical vicinity of sacred sites, in the middle of flood plains in Kakadu. I recall one hearing at South Alligator River.

         The important thing—and this is what I am saying to Senator Panizza—is that this is nothing radical, unique or new. These opportunities already exist in the court system. Although that additional flexibility is provided for, the fundamental fairness on which the rule of law operates in Australia and on which courts operate in Australia continues to operate under that system. So Senator Panizza has nothing to fear from that process.

         I reiterate, because it is relevant, that Senator Panizza, coming from Western Australia, would do far better directing his attention to prevailing upon his Western Australian colleagues to remove from the parliament the totally obnoxious piece of legislation on native title they have introduced. The central clause in that legislation is clause 7, which purports to provide a blanket extinguishment of native title, despite the fact that the High Court has ruled that it is now part of the common law of this country.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I add that that legislation has been assailed by a number of people among whom—I would have thought Senator Panizza would have paid some attention to this—are three distinguished former members of the coalition's front bench. Peter Durack, a former federal Attorney-General, has comprehensively attacked these proposals, as have Fred Chaney and Ian Viner QC, both former ministers for aboriginal affairs.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Mr Viner described the Western Australian legislation as being discriminatory and racially based. But more importantly and correctly, Ian Viner said that the bill will utterly fail to provide the certainty which everybody in Australia is demanding because it does breach the Racial Discrimination Act. There will be legal challenges to it and in the view of this government, and I think most legal commentators in Australia, the legislation will fail.

         So not only is the legislation utterly obnoxious and fundamentally unfair, as opposed to the bottom line of the Commonwealth legislation which is fundamentally fair—that is the difference between the two—but also it is going to fail utterly to provide the certainty required, as Ian Viner QC accurately said, because it will be subjected to legal challenge which ultimately, in my view, the view of Ian Viner and the view of this government, will be successful.

         What we saw from Senator Collins was the typical abuse of question time by ministers who sit on the other side of the chamber. Senator Collins could quite easily have given the answer during question time. Instead he chose to show his own set of biases and attack the Western Australian Premier and the Western Australian legislation. That was completely wrong in terms of the procedures of this parliament and that was eventually brought to Senator Collins's notice.

         All that Senator Collins did today was to waste the time of this chamber. He would not give a full and proper answer to the question asked by Senator Panizza, which forced Senator Panizza to move that the Senate take note of the answer. As soon as question time was over and the proceedings were no longer being broadcast, Senator Collins came back into the chamber and answered the question. I think that reflects very badly on the way most ministers in this place behave.

         The annual report, as is usually the case with EPAC, is a useful document. It summarises the role of EPAC over the last year in terms of the forum it provides for the discussion and consideration of various matters of economic policy and economic planning in Australia. It plays a very useful role in that respect.

          The report details the work in which the council has been involved in the last year. During that time it has undertaken and participated in some very important work on issues of national importance, including the FitzGerald national savings review, the Hilmer competition policy review, the Treasury retirement incomes modelling task force and the Dr Michael Keating employment opportunities task force. As well, the council has been asked by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to act as a sounding board for the ideas being developed by the employment opportunities task force.

          What the report understandably fails to point out is that whilst the issues of competition, national savings and employment creation—the matters that it has been dealing with over the last year—are imperative to our nation's success, the present government has done nothing to act upon these reports and nothing substantively to resolve and tackle these national issues. We had a classic example of the lack of resolve by the government in terms of necessary reforms in the last 24 hours.

          According to today's press reports, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was rolled yesterday on the issue of postal reform. The budget increased the deficit and, therefore, Australia's national debt rather than reducing it. This is despite all the fine rhetoric of the government in terms of its economic aspirations. Far from moving towards the reduction of deficits and the reduction of the national debt, the government's policies have moved in quite the opposite direction.

          Despite Mr Keating's pledge on election night to get  people back to work, Australia is still choking with an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. The government is very deeply divided over a wide range of major policy issues, the most important of which is economic policy. In the last few days we have seen a major split within the government between its two major economic ministers on the future direction of tax and expenditure policies in this country.

That was a similar commitment to the one made by the Prime Minister late last year when he was blatantly attempting to buy votes prior to the last election.

          In the last couple of days we have had major conflicting statements by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) over future tax rises. It is only a week ago that the Minister for Finance said that the deficit strategy may involve some revenue increases, though the government would be very cautious about introducing any substantial tax increases. He made it quite clear that it was a prospect in the government's mind to increase taxes, yet the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said on the other hand that the government was opposed to future tax increases and that these would not occur.

        It is particularly relevant at this time to be looking at this report since the government is saying, `Well, the recession is over and we are coming out of the worst of it.' It is relevant to actually look at what has happened as a consequence of this government's mismanagement of the economy. I recommend this report to anybody who is interested in seeing the consequences of economic mismanagement. It is a very well prepared report, there is a wide range of information available and it is easily identified by the casually interested reader.

         I draw attention to page 45 in the chapter dealing with the causes of bankruptcy. On that page there is a list of the major causes of bankruptcy for business bankrupts. Of the 11 causes listed—including lack of capital, lack of business ability, failure to keep proper books and so on—the one factor which stands out as having a much greater influence than any other on bankruptcy is economic conditions.

         In my state of South Australia bankruptcy has a particular effect on young South Australians. An age profile on page 50 gives an indication of the ages of people in business or not in business who have gone bankrupt. We see that this financial disaster affects the younger portion of the population far more than any other. The figures for the 25 to 34 age group—business people obviously—are very serious.

         —Like Senator Vanstone, I was particularly interested in the statistics on page 45 of this report damning as they are of the effects of the government's economic policy. The report says that 35.6 per cent of business bankruptcies are identified not by the bankrupts but by the official receivers and registered trustees as being caused by economic conditions and a further 15.7 per cent of bankruptcies have economic conditions as a contributing factor. So the government is definitely damned by the economic statistics that are contained in this report.

         The interesting thing about all of these entities is that they are corporations; therefore, they cannot be trustees of a person's estate either in bankruptcy or under part 10 of the act. These people are holding themselves out as consultants either to the bankrupts themselves or to the creditors. They are saying, `Let us come in and we will rearrange the debtors affairs, spare him from bankruptcy and benefit the creditors.'

Groups of people like these have been in practice in this field for some time. This report quite correctly says that a frequent consequence of their actions is that the debtors eventually end up bankrupt and with higher debts and greater hardship than before.

         The other aspect I want to draw to the attention of the Senate relates to the operation of section 305 of the act. Section 305 is very important because the official receiver requires trustees, upon lodgment of their annual accounts, to pay a percentage of the total realisations. That goes into a fund which is then made available to trustees and official receivers to fund speculative actions under section 305.

         It is interesting that the average amount paid out is in the vicinity of $108,000. However, one per cent of the annual realisations of $18 million is about $180,000. So it would appear on first reading—and I may be totally wrong—that substantially more is going into the fund than is being used or made available to trustees to meet the costs of an action. That concerns me because these moneys are utilised to fund investigations into highly dubious estates—for example, the estate of Mr Skase, the estate of Dr Edelsten which, from recollection, was subject to a section 305 application, and numerous others. In fact, I prepared many of them myself. At this point I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        If one read this report one would never realise that this was the worst year ever in the history of the Civil Aviation Authority or any of its predecessors. I will just touch lightly on some of the significant `achievements' of this authority during the last year. We saw, first of all, the collapse of a major contract—the TAAATS contract. We saw an independent review into that contract which found against the CAA. In effect, it found considerable maladministration and incompetence; so much so that the government directed the CAA to start again from scratch with a clean sheet of paper and run the whole exercise properly, and that is still in train.

         We saw the resignation of the chief executive officer, Mr Baldwin, who mismanaged the whole process so badly that he had to go. He and his henchman, Dr Edwards, departed to the country that they came from. But apparently along the way they each left with a six figure sum as compensation for their mismanagement. One can look in vain in this report to find any entry in the balance sheets for the notional `compensation' paid to them for the non-completion of their appointments.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Then we had the resignation of the chairman of the CAA. He was allowed to resign without any censure for the mismanagement of his part in the TAAATS contract. We have seen the disaffection of the aviation industry reach greater heights than we have ever seen before. We have seen disaffection within the parliament with the Civil Aviation Authority.

A marathon effort was put in by Senator Ian MacDonald, but in the part I saw at least one very misleading statement was given by a senior CAA officer to the Senate committee. I will deal with that in due course later this week and put the facts before the parliament.

         We see a continuation of the gross abuse of power by the Civil Aviation Authority in a regulatory field. I spoke about this repeatedly when amendments to the Civil Aviation Act were before us. I was always assured by Senator Collins that the officers of the CAA would never abuse the great powers that the parliament has given it—literally powers to kick in someone's door without a warrant, seize documents, harass people and summarily remove licences from them. But we have seen gross abuse of powers time and time again over the last 12 months. This gross abuse of power has a major effect on people in the industry. It also has a bad effect on the reputation of the CAA. There are a lot of decent people in the CAA. A lot of them do not do what they should do—that is, firmly exercise authority—because they do not want to be lumped in with the few abusive characters who are in the regulatory authority.

         We have seen people taken to court when in many cases all that is required is a fatherly talk to them to put them right on where they are going wrong.

I think the cost of legal action that the CAA is involved in—I was pleased to see that Senator Macdonald asked for a figure on that last night—would be astronomical.

I have heard of a case in Queensland where the CAA tried to sue someone for dropping oranges on someone else's house, and it lost that case. The summary withdrawal of licences and the denial of people's livelihood is endless. Then we had the great debacle of the airspace mismanagement on 11 November. We had senior officials of the CAA going on television, ridiculing their critics and saying that the CAA would go ahead. Now they have backed down. There are advertisements in the paper every day.

         I inquired into safety aspects at the original hearings of the Senate estimates committee, particularly because of my interest in the crash of the aircraft at Young in June this year. As a result of those original inquiries, certain information was given to me. Subsequent to that inquiry, it was suggested to me by many independent observers that the answers that I had been given were not quite factual.

Should that turn out to be the case, the Senate will hear a lot more about it. I did ask some questions.

I was given answers and I accept them as they stand at this particular time, but it has been suggested to me that there may need to be follow-up questioning on some of those matters; the suggestion being, again, that perhaps I have not been given—can I say in the politest words—the full story.

Information is to come to me on just how many inquiries into safety there have been over the years. It was suggested to me by Senator Collins that this proves how conscious the CAA is of safety matters. Of course, there is another interpretation—and this is the concern that is raised with me by people in the know and in the industry—that while there have been many inquiries into air safety nothing is ever really done to implement the recommendations of those particular inquiries. We will be looking at that a fraction further when I get the results of the information from the Senate estimates committee.

If he had attended the estimates committee meeting last night, he would have been in possession of a minute from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation—sent to me at my request—providing clarification of these statements that have been given to the estimates committee which were allegedly grossly incorrect, appallingly wrong and so on.

          For example, Senator MacGibbon carried on at length during the matters of public interest debate in the last sitting week. He talked about the appalling new procedures that the CAA had introduced with briefing for pilots. He made an assertion—totally without foundation, as I subsequently discovered—that there are now only two operators to cover the whole of Australia in terms of pilots getting briefings over the new computerised system. I am not a pilot and I am not an engineer. I am, as I described myself last night, a professional passenger and nothing else, but because I am used to Senator MacGibbon's garbage, I immediately checked it out. There are, in fact, 16 operators, not two.

         I might add that I availed myself of the codes to access the system and put in a putative flight plan from Alice Springs to Darwin. It took me five seconds to access the system—we timed it. In less than five minutes I had a full hard copy print-out of every piece of information that I would have needed for that flight available on my fax machine.

         Further to that—Senator MacGibbon might be interested in this although he never is because 90 per cent of what he says turns out to be factual garbage—I then rang the 008 number which is also provided and had a very interesting talk with the CAA operator who looks after all of those computer banks. He was obviously a long-term CAA employee. When I told him about some of the allegations that Senator MacGibbon had raised, he laughed and said, `What utter rubbish'. The cold, hard facts are that in the so-called good old days, which Senator MacGibbon referred to, even with the briefing officers, the majority of pilots still got their briefs over the telephone. The huge advantage of this system is that one gets hard copy briefs on access by dialling a phone number.

         The operator said to me, `The one disadvantage of this automatic system, the one sad thing about it for me, is that in looking after this computer system I'm doing a job that was formerly done by 200 people. But the pilots are delighted with it. It gives them better information than they ever had before. It is instantly accessible whenever they want it at any time before the flight without the need to go anywhere to get it'.

        —by leave—I claim to have been misrepresented and seek to make a statement. We have had the usual ignorance from Senator Collins that passes for debate in this chamber. There are a number of issues that I wish to pick up in future. The first point that sticks in my craw is the allegation that there have been 20 years of criticism of the Civil Aviation Authority on my part. That is absolutely, totally untrue. I have only been in this parliament for 16 years. It is only since the Labor Party got in, and particularly since Senator Collins got in as the Minister for Transport and Communications and we have seen gross mismanagement and incompetence from the Department of Transport and Communications, that I have tried to make him accountable for what has gone on in the department. I do not resile from anything I have said about the Civil Aviation Authority in the last three years.

        I am genuinely horrified because, frankly, I thought my relationship with Senator MacGibbon was better than this. I have religiously pursued every complaint he has ever made to me about the CAA and I am the first one to kick the CAA in the tail if there is something wrong. Senator MacGibbon approached me and complained bitterly on one occasion about a Queensland pilot who was being prosecuted by the CAA for dangerous flying. On this occasion—as I always do—I found out the circumstances of the case where the CAA had outrageously prosecuted this bloke. He flew an aircraft across the tops of the heads of a number of people on horseback who were mustering cattle. They were the ones who made the complaint. The only issue between the CAA's version of events and this fellow's was that he claimed he had not been closer than 10 feet above the ground and the CAA claimed that he had flown within six feet of the ground.

        That was a classic case where I chased it up after Senator MacGibbon had complained about the outrageous behaviour of the CAA. If the CAA does not prosecute under those circumstances, it should give the game away. I point out one fundamental issue that has been ignored by Senator MacGibbon and, indeed, Senator Ian Macdonald, even though it was pointed out to him last night: the CAA does not conduct these prosecutions. All it does is give the available material to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the DPP makes the decision about whether or not the prosecution should proceed—not the Civil Aviation Authority.

         On 11 September 1990, when I was attending my first estimates committee hearing—it seems like a long time ago—I spent some time going through the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. At that time, while I was waiting for Senator Michael Baume who was doing his normal assiduous job of going through this program, I did some calculations to try to figure out where money, particularly in my home state of Western Australia, was going in relation to these grants.

          Firstly, I was interested to find out how these grants were determined and what sorts of criteria were used to find where the money should go; and, secondly, I was interested to find out where the grants had gone. I noticed that many of the suburbs that they related to were in what I knew were marginal Labor seats, so I got my calculator out and found that most of the money was going into marginal Labor seats. In that year leading up to September 1990, of just under $600,000 spent in Western Australia, something like 85 per cent went into marginal Labor seats. This concerned me at the time.

          that when I confronted Senator Richardson, who was the minister responsible immediately prior to the 1990 election, and asked him whether or not it was interesting to note that most of the money had gone into marginal Labor seats, he said:

         With this background it is interesting to see that the Auditor-General having done a significant study into the program which, I remind the Senate, has seen in the order of $60.3 million appropriated over the past five years, and a thorough analysis of how these grants are issued—the departmental advice on which the minister relies to make the decisions as to where the money goes, any follow-up to see if the money is spent correctly and whether or not the objectives of the program are met—the result of this audit report No. 9 for 1993-94 is an uncategorical disaster for the program and the way it is administered. Specifically, the responsibility for this disaster needs to be sheeted home particularly to the current minister, Ros Kelly, and one would imagine some blame would have to be put on the head of Senator Richardson as the minister responsible prior to Minister Kelly.

          Having only just flipped through the report, it is worth noting a few of the comments made by the Auditor-General and some of the statistics. The Senate should know that, firstly, when these applications for grants come in from community groups and other people, the department goes through a categorisation process as to how the applications for funding stack up. They are categorised as being category 1, category 2 or category 3.

          Under the period of review, the Auditor-General found that category 1 grants received only nine per cent of the funding and category 3 grants received 11 per cent of the funding. The importance of this is that category 1 grants are described as:
         </tab>

         in other words, the top rung of applications that clearly serve the interests of the program. Those in category 3 are described by the department as:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . lacking in relevant information, for which community need has not been adequately demonstrated and many other selection criteria not satisfied, including evidence of other funding sources—
        </para>
        <para>
         in other words, the absolute bottom of the pile. The interesting thing to note from this report, of course, is that these category 3 projects receive more funding than the category 1 projects. So on that criterion alone—and I am not saying it is the only criteria for judging whether a project is good or not—it is interesting to note that the minister has approved an enormous number of projects that are just badly documented and lacking any relevance to the selection criteria.

          The Auditor-General notes that the statement made to me by Senator Richardson on 11 September 1990 was indeed correct, that the final decisions are made by the minister with some reference to departmental advice. The only advice is a categorisation; they end up with a series of grants in front of them and they make a selection. Basically decisions are made by the minister and personal advisers within the minister's staff.

          It is interesting to note that the Auditor-General has also spent more time going into my original allegation. That came from the fact that I figured that in that particular year 85 per cent of the money in Western Australia had gone to marginal Labor seats, particularly the seats of Canning, Swan and Stirling, which it should be noted—and I did at that time—are well-established areas and suburbs of Perth which already have well-established sporting and cultural facilities. That is not to say they could not do with more, but the fact of the matter is that this program says the money should be going into new suburbs and areas of high unemployment to provide facilities where the need is greatest. Anyone who knows the seats of Canning, Swan or Stirling knows that most of the suburbs in those areas are well established with many good sporting facilities already.

          I turn quickly to the analysis that the Auditor-General has done on where the money went in relation to the political seats. It is worth noting that at the time of the study Labor held 53 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives. It may have gone up slightly since then, but for this argument that is irrelevant. During the period of this study the Labor Party held 53 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives and those seats received 73 per cent of the grants and 66 per cent by value. The report states:

          The Auditor-General also provides a very handy graph, which we do not need to incorporate because it is in the report if anyone is interested. It shows quite graphically the figures spent in the year 1992-93 divided between Labor and coalition seats. It is interesting that in my home state of Western Australia no money was spent in any coalition seats and that indeed the quantum of money spent in Western Australia was nearly as high as it was in Victoria. Clearly Western Australia was a problem for the government in the last election.

          As one would expect—I am sure that the minister would expect it—I would say that this whole program has become a political pork barrel; the money is shunted quite unashamedly into the seats where the marginal Labor members need to increase their popularity with the locals in the lead-up to the next election. The Auditor-General, of course, could not go so far as to say those sorts of things. On this subject the Auditor-General says:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         ANAO's analysis does not demonstrate one way or the other that projects are approved on party political grounds. It may be that Labor held seats are those where the need for facilities is greatest. If this were the case, proper documentation of the reasons for decisions would be able to satisfy any questions concerning the selection of approved grants.
        </para>

         I think the very fact that the Auditor-General should even raise this question shows that there is an enormous doubt.

          A one-sentence summary of what the Auditor-General report says about this is that the documentation is entirely lacking; the decision making process is not clear. It is quite clear that the minister makes the decisions and that there is very little way of auditing whether or not this program performs efficiently. But the reality of the matter is that most of the money ends up going into marginal Labor seats, so it is quite appropriate for the opposition to charge that the way in which this has been executed over the last few years amounts to a quite corrupt political pork barrel.

          One of the other bad things about it is that there is no actual assessment of whether the facilities that are funded actually meet the needs. There is no follow-up. In fact, the Auditor-General points out that no financial appraisal takes place even for projects where up to a quarter of a million dollars is being spent at a time. One case study that the Auditor-General cited shows that $100,000 was spent in one year and that supplementary funding of $250,000 was sought for the next year and that was approved.

          The case study that I refer to is on page 15 of the report. It was a joint project between two councils. As I said, $100,000 was given in 1991-92. A further quarter of a million dollars was given in 1992-93. Clearly, a member of parliament made a promise during the March 1993 election campaign. The report states:

          Finally, one of the other disturbing aspects raised by this report is the fact that many of the funds available under this program are not spent in the year that they are allocated. That is not unusual. In fact, I alluded to it back on 11 September 1990 in an estimates discussion. But one of the concerns is that, if there was clear evidence of using this program as a political pork barrel, which the Auditor-General has alluded to, if one were to be a smart political operator, as many of the people in the New South Wales Labor Right are regarded by the media and many others, and had a few million dollars—and in this case $2.7 million was rolled over between 1991-92 and the following year and then a further $9 million was rolled over the year after that leading into the election year—it would actually be quite advantageous, if one were going to pump 77 per cent of the funding into marginal Labor held seats, to roll as much money as possible into the last year so one could go around making a big fellow of oneself in the election year. This, unfortunately, is exactly what has happened.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In addition to this rolling over of funds, we have also seen an additional $18.75 million on projects earmarked under the One Nation program pumped into this program as well. I remind the Senate that this program has no follow-up or evaluation as to whether or not the funds have been spent in a way that actually achieves the goals of the program. I think the goals of the program are worthy. I think to develop sporting and cultural facilities at a community level is something that money should be put into.

          I know that a large number of community organisations are desperate for funds. They have chook raffles and fetes and do an enormous amount to raise money to create cultural and sporting facilities which communities need. There are many cases where that demonstrated need, I think, deserves some Commonwealth, state and local government assistance. But there needs to be cooperation and coordination between the three tiers of government. Again, the Auditor-General points out that in almost all of these cases there is no coordination or cooperation whatsoever. The left hand is not talking to the right hand. In fact, a case study in this report shows that three different Commonwealth grants were going into the one project and this department did not know about the other two. That seems quite alarming to me.

          The minister, in her initial response to the Auditor-General's criticisms, has said that the Commonwealth government does not want to get involved in these consultations or further evaluation because it will make administration time and costs higher and it will slow down the program.

We expect to see a full explanation from the minister about what she proposes to do to overcome the glaring inadequacies and what I claim has become a corrupt, political pork barrel in this program.

          I think the graphs clearly demonstrate the concerns that Senator Campbell raised at his first Senate estimates committee hearing, as he says—that is, that this program is nothing but a political pork barrel by the Labor Party. In fact, the Auditor-General's report is a damming report on that particular aspect. As Senator Campbell has mentioned, it raises a number of very grave concerns about the purposes of this program and the political implications.

          When the Auditor-General is game and courageous enough to write these sorts of reports, it is no wonder that the ANAO is being starved for funds by the current government, and made to use most of its funds to pay a huge and inflated rent to the Australian Labor Party for its premises without having sufficient funds to adequately cover all of its requirements and the roles that it is asked to perform. As I say, having seen this report, it is no wonder that the Labor Party is trying to starve the ANAO at its source.

          My colleague has mentioned the political bias and the report by the Auditor-General in response to that. As Senator Campbell said, the report states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         ANAO's analysis does not demonstrate one way or the other that projects are approved on party political grounds.

At the present time documentation is simply not available to answer such questions.

        <para>
         It is pretty obvious that the Labor Party is not interested in having proper documentation, because it would expose even more vividly the political pork-barrelling that goes on with these grants. It is interesting also to quote from the report in relation to the role of the department—the independent Public Service. The report says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Department does not believe that it has a significant role in the decision making process. Departmental officers also argued that the categorisation process was not material to the decision making process which takes place in the Minister's office. It pointed to the fact that the Minister made decisions that did not always accord with the categories allocated by the Department. The categories, therefore, had no bearing on the final outcome.
        </para>
        <para>
         The department is saying that, in spite of its recommendation and suggestions, the minister is not interested. One can only wonder—and one does not have to wonder very much—what is the minister's criterion in making grants. They are made for political purposes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The report goes on to mention that the application form is poorly designed and the applicant is not required to state what is expected to be achieved by the project and who is going to benefit or by when. This makes it difficult for the Auditor-General to monitor outcomes.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The report also goes on to say that the states believe that greater overall benefit could be achieved from available Commonwealth funds if projects were selected in consultation with the states and local authorities. If the Commonwealth government were interested in making fair and equitable grants with these funds, local governments would certainly be in the best position to advise and assist.

          Local authorities know their areas and they understand such things as which sporting or cultural facilities and recreational programs do need assistance and which are the most used. They are on the ground—they understand these things; they know the histories—but they are not even consulted. It is all done from the minister's office way down here in Canberra—not with any interest in what is right, I would suggest, but in the interest of how many votes the Labor Party could get from an appropriate and timely presentation of a cheque in a marginal electorate.

         The uncertainty surrounding the objectives of the program is further complicated when an additional $18.75m was allocated to the program from funds originally earmarked for the `One Nation' program.
        </para>
        <para>
         We all know that the One Nation program—and this is being confirmed more and more as time goes on and as we look back in history—was simply one big buy by the Labor Party to get votes for an election which it knew was going to be difficult and which most of the Labor Party people themselves thought they were going to lose. The One Nation program, as history has shown, is simply a big vote buying exercise by the Labor Party. The report says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         According to the Treasurer's press release at the time, the major thrust of the re-allocation of the `One Nation' funds was to quickly spend additional funds and deliver rapid job growth.
        </para>
        <para>
         That seems odd and unusual for a community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. So the objectives are unclear. I suggest there is not much doubt about the clarity of the Labor Party's objective in this program, which is to buy votes in marginal electorates. If any further confirmation is required from this report, I suggest that honourable senators look at this further quotation from the report:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         Of course, the ministers would not be interested. The department would want them to do it fairly and squarely but the minister is only interested in the vote buying aspect. The report goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Minister has advised that she always has regard to departmental advice but does not always follow that advice.

         The ANAO, as is its way, sends a draft report to the department and to the minister for comment. The response by the secretary to the department can only be described as equivocal and it really does not buy into the subject at all. The responses from the minister are quite interesting, though. The minister says that she believes that `the audit had gone well outside its own guidelines'. There we are: shoot the messenger—if you do not like the message then criticise the messenger. The minister is saying, `They weren't supposed to be looking into these things'. I can understand that the minister would be concerned that the audit office had looked into these claims of political bias. And so it goes. It is a report which goes to the whole question of fairness and of this government's propriety in its dealings.

          By way of conclusion I will refer to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program operations that are set out in diagram form on page 8, which makes for interesting reading. The applications are received, acknowledged and categorised by the department—although the minister takes no notice. They are then sent to the minister's office. Grants are selected by the minister; the department is advised; and submissions are prepared by the department for formal approval by the minister.

          When the applications are successful, the minister advises the applicants.

It is not the minister and not the Labor Party local member; the department wears the odium of advising unsuccessful applicants.

The One Nation funding was designed strategically to provide this country, for the first time in its history, with a standard gauge rail link, under a single interstate rail operator, from Brisbane to Perth, linking all of the major capital cities of Australia—Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and across to Perth. In addition, it was also designed to provide the strategic links necessary with the port infrastructure to connect with that rail line.

           —Senator Collins can sit down while I am making my point of order. We are currently discussing government documents. Senator Campbell has spoken and I have spoken. The minister was speaking in relation to the One Nation statement, which was not directly in line but it was at least mentioned by me and I assume he has the right to respond to that. But tabling something in relation to a matter and speaking on a matter that has absolutely nothing to do with the question before the chair is, I think, most inappropriate and should not be allowed on the basis that it is completely irrelevant to the question before the chair. Even in the honourable senator's own words, it relates to a matter that has been dealt with at some previous time this afternoon.

         The Commonwealth Bank of Australia annual report is a very comprehensive document. I do not want to address the detail in it at this stage, but I will make a few points about the ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank was one of the first government business enterprises to be partially privatised. That was done in 1990 or 1991 when the government agreed to privatise the bank to the tune of 30 per cent. The government has subsequently moved a step towards further privatisation with an additional 19 per cent to be sold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank has proved to be, I think, a resounding success. For the first 30 per cent privatised, almost 200,000 ordinary Australians decided to invest in the bank. Most of them have made a very handsome return on their shares. The shares have almost doubled in value since their listing in 1991. That listing, along with the likes of GIO and Woolworths, has encouraged many more Australians to take up direct share ownership than had formerly been the case.

          The coalition welcomes such a development. It was and remains a major plank of coalition policy to privatise most, if not all, of the enterprises still owned by the government, of which there are many. Privatisation has a range of benefits. In particular, the more that Australians take a direct interest in the shares of their workplaces and national companies, the better. It brings Australians closer to understanding firms and the workings of business and it gives them a very important stake and, therefore, incentive in their future.

          It has a considerable related advantage in removing the `them' and `us' attitude for the categorisation of people that some trade unions in particular, but also members of the Labor Party, have insisted on promoting for very many years. That is absolute nonsense and it is quite contrary to the egalitarian nature of our nation. The privatisation of government owned enterprises is very important in that respect, even aside from the generally enormous improvements in efficiency and competition that the privatisation process brings.

          One can only hope that this government will move further to exit its 51 per cent remaining interest in the Commonwealth Bank. Unfortunately, there is a major ideological hang-up within the Labor Party on this matter, although one can hold out some hope for gradual education in that process.

          I remember two or three years ago when privatisation to the tune of 30 per cent was mooted and introduced. There was never going to be any further privatisation under this government, so the government said, and that was enshrined in legislation. We see that, basically, financial expediency and the inability of the government to rein in its own expenditure and to get its budget in order were the prime motivators for the additional 19 per cent privatisation that has occurred in recent months. Nevertheless, the point is that there has been that further privatisation.

          We are now down to 51 per cent government ownership and I would urge the government to consider going further and indeed exiting completely from its ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. There is no justification at all for the Australian taxpayer to continue to hold an interest in this bank or, for that matter, in most other government business enterprises. Government owned enterprises should be privatised so that all Australians can decide for themselves whether they wish to invest in these companies. Australians can build their own investment nest eggs and, in the process, add to national savings and individual financial independence.

          Privatisation and contracting out are examples of, as I said, this government's failure to grasp economic reform. The government has been stifled on this issue as it has with such other key areas as industrial relations, tax reform and other micro-economic reforms. The government must surely take notice of the success of privatisation, not just from the fiscal point of view but also, as I have intimated, from the point of view of the national significance of the other reforms that are necessary—industrial relations reform and reform to encourage savings and investment in this country—if we are to develop the increasingly efficient and internationally competitive nation. We must achieve this if we are ever to have any hope of generating sufficient economic growth in this country to start tackling our horrendous and tragic level of unemployment and if we ever going to start the process of rebuilding living standards in this country.

          I welcome the Commonwealth Bank annual report. I believe that it sets a shining example to us all to look at that further task that is very important for us in rebuilding confidence in our economy, in involving each and every Australian in the economy and providing incentives for them to do so, and in that way improving not just their own situation but, more importantly, or at least as importantly—because the two cannot be separated—the wellbeing of the nation as a whole.

        In the 1993 Budget, the Government announced a major program of reform of AQIS to reduce its cost to Australian industry while retaining the integrity of Australia's inspection functions. The Government wants to make it clear that AQIS fulfils an essential role in protecting Australia against the importation of exotic pests and diseases and inspecting food for safety and overseas country requirements.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, to improve the efficiency of service delivery to industry and to cap and reduce inspection costs, AQIS will be restructured over the next three to four years with a projected decline of 650 Commonwealth and 100 State AQIS personnel via retrenchments on a voluntary basis wherever possible. To place this in perspective AQIS currently employs around 2,000 Commonwealth and 600 State permanent staff.

With the exception of the meat industry, implementation of the new three tiered charge regime across the industries AQIS services will be on or after 1 July 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Introduction of the three tiered charging regime is essential if charges are to be acceptable and equitable across all users whether their inspection services are based on quality assurance methods or traditional end point inspection.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The three tiers of the new charge structure comprise:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        first tier, a fixed annual charge per premises at which activity is conducted,
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        second tier, a throughput or volume charge on relevant products,
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        third tier, a charge per inspector per unit of time, or a charge per inspection.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The third tier inspection charge aims to recover the variable costs of AQIS field inspection activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first and second tier charges between them aim to recover the balance of AQIS chargeable costs which tend by their nature to be fixed in the short to medium term.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The three tiered charging regime allows for the separation and identification of AQIS field and other costs. It contrasts sharply with present AQIS charges the bulk of which are set on an average, per inspector per unit of time basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The objectives of the three tiered approach to the pricing of AQIS services are efficiency, equity, consistency, transparency and simplicity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To meet the efficiency objective, economic theory suggests that the marginal cost of additional inspection resources equates with the price industry pays to deploy them as it will with third tier charges.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For equity, the three tiered cost recovery regime provides a fairer allocation of the costs to be recovered from firms participating in the industry particularly when quality assurance methods become more widespread.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AQIS costs will be measured and applied consistently across industries with the application of the three tiered regime which is based on common principles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a public monopoly providing regulatory services, AQIS needs to be able to justify its pricing policies to its clients. It also needs to make its costs and recoveries visible to them. Taken together these imply transparency and simplicity to which the three tiered charging regime contributes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However due to the shortness of time made available by the Senate for the drafting and introduction of Budget bills and to ensure that the Government's reform plans for the domestic and export meat industries and their associated charging structures are introduced progressively from 1 January 1994 as planned, the Government is currently introducing two Bills for passage of both the House and the Senate in the Budget sittings relating solely to the domestic and export meat industry charging arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I stated initially the purpose of the Bill before us is to provide for a first tier, per premises charge to be levied on domestic meat establishments. The second Bill whose introduction will follow immediately, makes consequential changes to the name and coverage of the collection act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other changes to domestic and export meat charges including an export meat premises charge to be made on 1 January 1994, can be made by amending the relevant subordinate legislation of other Acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second tier, throughput charge for export and domestic meat is not proposed for introduction until 1 July 1994 so its imposition has been included in the full package of AQIS charging legislation due to be introduced late in these Budget sittings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Turning now to the financial impact of the three tiered charge regime and the other changes proposed on the meat industry, the estimated revenues I will discuss are all expressed in today's dollars and using accrual accounting concepts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1994-95 the first full year of the three tiered charging system, AQIS revenue from the domestic and export meat industry is expected to be around $78.2 million which will include a maximum of $13.2 million in premises charges. This compares with meat inspection revenue of $80.6 million in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. Revenue is expected to fall in subsequent years reaching $70.5 million in 1996-97.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the premises charges are introduced on 1 January 1994, the annual cost of meat inspection staff is expected to fall from a base rate of $69,169 to $65,164. The base rate is expected to fall further to $59,164 on 1 July 1994. This will honour the Government's dual pledges not to increase the costs of inspection staff and to reduce the total costs of inspection services by AQIS to the meat industry by $10 million over the next four years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Revenue from first tier premises charges on domestic meat establishments is estimated by AQIS to total $1.1 million in 1993-94 and $2.2 million in 1994-95 the first full year of its operation. As previously explained, the revenue collected from the premises charge will be offset by a reduction in the revenue from the third tier inspection charge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senators this Bill and the foreshadowed amendment Bill are part of major and worthwhile reforms to AQIS and the charging regime for its services. The reform of AQIS charging regimes will be completed when the full package of legislation is introduced late in the Budget sittings.

        The Bill will give effect to the measures announced in the Treasurer's Press Release of 31 May 1993. These measures concern amendments to certain formulas in the tax law which enable the tax payable by a life assurance company to be determined.
       </para>

        The formulas provide for the calculation of the amount of specific deductions to be allowed to a life assurance company and the apportionment of those and other deductions against the differently taxed classes of income of a life assurance company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The formulas are based on income derived by a life assurance company. One amount of income presently included in the formulas arises as a result of a life  assurance company agreeing to pay the tax liability of a superannuation fund.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is a facility instituted for the ease of administration of superannuation funds. It operates by a life assurance company agreeing to include in its assessable income an amount which otherwise would be taxable income of a superannuation fund.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The inclusion of these transferred amounts in the formulas has an adverse effect on the tax payable by a life assurance company. This was never intended to be the case and will now be corrected by an amendment to exclude these transferred amounts from the formulas.

        Because the inclusion of these other amounts increases allowable deductions they should also be taken into account in apportioning those deductions to the differently taxed classes of income.

In fact, subsequent to the 1982 convention being finalised and Australia signing it, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in this chamber in December of that year, responding to a question in the Senate, said that the government had taken the view that the overall benefits of the 1982 convention outweighed its disadvantages and that Australia continued to hope the convention would come to be universally supported and to provide an agreed framework for all aspects of the use of the seas.

Very briefly, the bill brings Australia into  line with international law enshrined in the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. As Senator Vanstone said, the bill amends a number of other pieces of legislation, specifically the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. It substitutes the 1958 Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Conventions with references to the relevant provisions in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention.

When we get to the committee stage of the bill, while I will not be  moving amendments, I would like to seek assurances from the minister in relation to several of those matters. One of the matters that I want to raise is in relation to the fact that the processes leading to these international conventions are often very long and drawn out and, by the very nature of that process, some of the wording and concepts tend to become out of date by the time one gets around to legislating for them.

        Similar to some of the thinking that has gone into the control and protection of Antarctica, we are taking the view that the deep oceans are part of the common heritage of all humankind and that the exploitation of manganese and other nodules in the deep seabed should not become the exclusive prerogative of those nations which, simply by reason of their wealth and technology, are capable of exploiting them. I understand that that is still a matter which needs to be properly worked out. Certainly the Australian Democrats would like to see the recognition of common ownership of that deep seabed progressed in the further consideration of this international convention.

        There is wording in the items listed in schedule 2 that is of considerable concern to the Democrats and many people in the conservation movement. I refer particularly to articles 61 to 72. For example, article 61 talks about the states exploiting their exclusive economic zone—the 200-mile economic exclusion zone—in the ocean in such a way that it can produce `the maximum sustainable yield'. That terminology was certainly around in fishing circles perhaps 10 or 15 years ago when this convention was first being formulated.

        —The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 primarily amends the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 to bring it up to date from 1982 with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Its primary purpose is to redefine the economic exclusion zone. This in itself is not a problem for the Greens.

        The bill includes a new inserted schedule to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act which is a reproduction of parts II, V and VI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This does represent a problem. Australia has not ratified the law of the sea convention. Hence, there is no compulsion for Australia to include text from the convention in this piece of legislation. However, most countries, including Australia, would accept that a large part of the United Nations convention—I will call it UNCLOS for brevity—is now considered to be customary international law. Article 62 of the UNCLOS, on page 24 of this bill, states:

       Article 61 refers to the best scientific evidence to ensure conservation and management measures. Article 62(2) says that countries that do not have the capacity to exploit their resources must allow other countries to come in and fish the waters to the optimum utilisation level. As Senator Coulter mentioned when he was discussing maximum sustainable yield, the use of the term `optimum utilisation' is an example of outdated phraseology. In the past it has set the basic framework for the overexploitation of coastal waters around the world.

        Overexploitation by non-resident countries, because of article 62 of UNCLOS, is a massive problem world-wide. Confrontation between intensive industrial fishing and subsistence coastal fishing affects 6.5 million people in India and 20 to 25 million people in South East Asia. Two-thirds of the fish caught off the west African coast go to Russia, Spain, France, Poland and Japan to make fishmeal for stock or fertiliser for crops. Meanwhile, the population of west Africa suffers a protein deficiency because it does not have the capacity to exploit its own fish resources, nor the political strength—because of the principles defined in article 62(2)—to stop overexploitation by other nations.

This would have similar goals to those of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and it would establish a national zoning plan for Australia's marine environment.This bill is supported, providing those strong cautions are made and providing that the minister is able to provide the assurances that have been requested.

         The continuing importance of doing that is clearly a view which is shared by the international community. I draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 78 of chapter 17 of agenda 21, which was adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which was known colloquially as the Earth Summit, in Brazil in 1992, which states:

        Following on from that, agenda 21 calls upon states to `implement strategies for the sustainable use of marine living resources'. Agenda 21 therefore confirms that in the eyes of the international community, despite the slightly anachronistic language, the principles in the relevant articles of the law of the sea convention remain relevant.

         That view on the international plane is also reflected in Australia's legislation. I think Senator Coulter would agree that that is really the important part. The Fisheries Management Act is the primary Australian legislation governing the use of marine living resources. One of the objectives under that act which must be pursued by the minister and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is consistency with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.

I assert again for the benefit of the Senate that the Australian government's view is that not only can those principles of ecologically sustainable development be implemented in Australia in our fisheries reserves but that they should be.

         —I rise to speak on the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1993—a bill which seeks to extend the operations of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 for a further three years until 28 December 1996. Currently, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has the power to establish quota schemes to control the export of meat and live sheep from Australia. Such quota schemes are necessary when countries impose meat quotas or other restrictions on Australia. For example, over the past three years United States `blackmail' has forced Australia to agree to restrict its exports of meat to the US or risk the imposition of quotas under the US meat import law, commonly known as MIL.

         As a result of this so-called voluntary restraint agreement, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has imposed quotas on beef, mutton and goat meat to the United States. The US meat import law, enacted in 1964, contains a formula which determines the permitted level of imports, known as the trigger level, for each calendar year. The formula allows imports to grow in line with the overall increase in beef production. However, import controls are imposed if the US Secretary of Agriculture estimates that imports will reach trigger level. As the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) pointed out in the other place:

        If we were not to comply with this voluntary restriction, Australia could lose about 10 per cent, or about $110 million worth, of exports to the United States.

        Given that our beef trade to the United States is worth over $1.1 billion a year, the federal government hopes to have the meat import law eliminated as part of the Uruguay Round of the GATT trade talks. Such a move could mean good news for meat exporters and producers. It promises greater predicability of market access as well as a boost to investor confidence in the beef industry.

         My colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) from southern Queensland recently noted the value adding efforts of the beef industry. Mr Scott said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The beef industry has largely gone down the line of producing more feedlot beef. That creates a lot more stability in the meat industry, with beef of consistent quality coming onto the market. That is very important.

         But all that costs money, and to invest in the beef industry today requires substantial capital. If people are to invest in the meat industry, particularly at any stage of the feedlot industry, they need stability and predicability in the markets. Only then will beef producers get on with the job of expanding our beef exports and our beef industry in Australia. So the GATT talks and the December deadline are extremely important to the meat industry.

        The United States is Australia's largest beef export market in quantity terms. However, it is worth noting the value of our beef, sheep meat and buffalo exports to the European Community. Although the EC only allows imports of 16,500 tonnes of sheep meat, 6,032 tonnes of beef and 2,250 tonnes of buffalo meat, the market is high priced and earns Australia about $150 million a year. These strict limits mean that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation must issue quotas. These are issued without charge. The AMLC also has the power to restrict the export of live sheep and it can allocate these quotas free or by auctions, sale by tender or private sale. To date, these powers have not been used. In fact, Australia voluntarily withdrew its exports of live sheep to Saudi Arabia two years ago following a series of rejections, supposedly for quarantine reasons.

         Finally, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 requires details of proposed quota allocation and management schemes to be published in the corporation's corporate plan, which must have ministerial approval, and to be available to all exporters. Also provided is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

         Overall, this legislation, described by one of my colleagues as `necessary evil', has the support of the federal coalition because it gives the Australian meat and livestock producer the best possible chance of export earnings without jeopardising export markets.

         The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1993 has been fairly described in the other place as a daylight saving bill because, like daylight saving, it extends the sunset of the legislation. The need to extend quotas is a comment on the state of play of free trade. The legislation is needed only because the United States and other countries impose quotas on how much meat we can export. That is always a worry to me as somebody who believes in fair trade.

         Australia has restrained its exports of meat to the US under a virtual blackmail arrangement to prevent the US authorities imposing quotas under the meat import law, the MIL.

         There is so much talk about this around the world at the moment.

Let us hope that something comes out of all of this, especially the GATT meeting to which I hope people will turn their attention. I am not full of confidence that a time frame in relation to GATT to give fair trade around the world will be put in place on 15 December. I am not as confident as some that there will be a successful outcome, especially in agriculture. We have to think about what the European Community, especially the French and the Germans, and the Americans are still talking about.

         This legislation is one of numerous measures around the world that countries are forced to take to accommodate trade restrictions and requirements from other countries. Beef exports to the United States are a significant market indicator for domestic prices. The United States is our biggest export market for beef and veal. Over the 1992-94 seasons we will have lost some 19 per cent in exports to the United States, due in large part to access restrictions placed on us by the United States authorities.

How those consumers in the European Community can afford to keep on paying the subsidies they pay to their farmers, heaven knows.

         Despite the fact that Australia stands on the sideline and is an innocent victim in the trade wars of countries like the United States, France and other European Community countries, we pay the penalty for their support systems in restricted access for our products. Access is the big thing in the GATT Round, but I believe it has been left too late in the round to make things happen. The internal subsidies and the external support systems might be reduced a bit as far as agriculture is concerned, but I do not know whether we will get the access that we really need.

         One industry I would like to make mention of that tends to be overlooked in the wash-out of these quotas is the goat meat industry. I would particularly like to mention the Desert Oak Abattoir at Broken Hill. This company is seeking export markets for its goat meat, which it gets from feral goatherds throughout New South Wales and elsewhere. If nothing else, this company is doing a jolly good service ridding Australia of one of our feral pests. However, in order to obtain access for its product into the United States, it has to buy a quota, and that quota must come from the beef industry quota.

         Something that is put up to me in a lot of saleyards that I go to around New South Wales and other states is the problem of people trying to get into a quota which is given to companies which might never do much towards producing beef—they are really just agents or traders within the meat industry. The AMLC should look at whether people who cannot fill the quotas in the meat industries in Australia should be able to transfer them without cost to people who can. I have had talks with the AMLC about this and I have been given good reasons why it should not happen; but maybe it is something that should happen.

         Getting back to goat meat, prices for the quotas for the goat meat people to buy start at about 45c a pound. I have heard that people who hold quotas which they cannot fill sell them at $1 a pound. Clearly, this is outside the capacity of the goat meat industry, and at that price it is pointless the industry even trying to source the market. The argument that this industry has raised with me and my colleagues, Bruce Scott and Michael Cobb from the other place, is that there ought to be separate access for goat meat because it is a different product. If it is wanted, surely we should be able to do something about it.

As I have said, it would also protect our environment and save Australian taxpayers a great deal of money in environmental restoration works. However, there seems to be little support for the goat meat industry's arguments. Given our restricted access with beef, it is understandable that any beef quota would not be given away without a cost.

         It is a great disappointment to our trading relationship with the US that every year for the last three years, the US has used its protectionist meat import law to limit Australian beef into the US. These US laws reduced US exports last year by up to 20 per cent. It is hoped that with any resolution of the GATT Uruguay Round, this protectionist measure by the US government will be removed quickly. We live in hope rather than expectation. Under the present US meat import law, Australian exporters are left with no option but to accept voluntary restraint agreements on their exports into the US.

The Australian beef industry is in a healthy state, despite the widespread drought devastating much of Queensland. Our national herd stands at 25 million. More beef is now produced from our present herd than 10 years ago when there were 10 million more head of cattle. Two-thirds of our slaughter of 1.8 million tonnes are exported, with a record 65 per cent of the nation's beef production exported last year. Export earnings at nearly $3 billion are up 60 per cent on four years ago. The efficiency of the beef industry has never been better which augurs well for investment in meat processing.

         A perfect example of this process is with beef processing. One major effort to meet this challenge for Australian farmers is with the farmers investment trust, which has just been launched. Its purpose is to provide an opportunity for farmers to invest in the processing, marketing and distribution of their product, both domestically and internationally, and to achieve commercial returns for these investments. The aim of the investment trust is to eventually establish a balance of investments across the spectrum of food and fibre industries. Up to 35 million units at $1 each have been offered, and oversubscription will be accepted. The trust has an allocation to subscribe for up to 30 per cent of the issued shares in Elders Australia, requiring $29,610,000, with any excess available for investment in other authorised investments.

         The trust has the stated objective of giving farmers greater influence over downstream processing, marketing and distribution of farm produce and to provide farmers with better information to enable them to improve their product and be more responsive to changing market requirements. However, the trust will not be in a position to involve itself in a possible bid for the Fosters stake in AMH until March. It is bad timing for the trust but good timing for Fosters which has offered its major partner in AMH, the US multinational ConAgra, its 45 per cent shareholding; that will take it up to 90 per cent.

         In February 1988 the Elders meat subsidiary, Australian Meat Holdings, took over Thomas Borthwick. This resulted in AMH controlling 86.5 per cent of the slaughtering capacity in north Queensland and 51 per cent in central Queensland. When challenged, the Federal Full Court held that the acquisition would put AMH in a position to dominate the north Queensland fat cattle market and found a breach of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. The court ordered a divesting of four smaller Borthwick abattoirs but, in effect, some were closed and Elders bought out the other consortium members of AMH and ended up controlling six per cent of the eight export abattoirs in the region.

         It must be acknowledged by all interested in the beef industry that since then ConAgra has done much to advance the company to its present healthy state. As ConAgra has said, it has invested in the company tens of millions of dollars in capital expenditure. The annual export sales of AMH have increased by $225 million since May 1991, and employee numbers have increased from 3,800 to 4,600.

It was on one of those operations over France in 1941 that his aircraft was shot down and he was captured by the occupying German forces. Justin ended up in the infamous Stalag Luft III prison camp.

         As was said by Senator Ray, Justin O'Byrne was born in Tasmania in 1912 and educated in Launceston. He clearly had a much harder life in his early years than I did—leaving Tasmania, as was said, when he was just 18 years of age, during the Great Depression; working through Queensland bullock driving and fencing for some 10 years; and then serving his nation by joining the RAAF as a pilot in 1940. He obviously showed great courage in that period. He was an original member of 452 Fighter Squadron and, as was also said, he was shot down over France in 1941.

As he noted in his final speech, he had spent half his lifetime in the Senate—a terrifying thought! Obviously, in such a long career in the Senate, there was ample opportunity for committee service.

         —I would like to associate the National Party in the Senate with the condolence motion moved by the acting leader of the government, Senator Robert Ray. Today I had the honour of representing the National Party at the state funeral for the Hon. Justin O'Byrne, held in Launceston. The Church of Apostles was overflowing with mourners paying their last respects to a man that they held in high regard. Many hundreds—I would not like to put a figure on it, but the church was overflowing—came to pay their respects to this remarkable man, who died at 81 after dedicating 40 years of his life in service to the Australian people, firstly as a RAAF fighter pilot during the Second World War and then as a long serving senator for Tasmania.

         Justin O'Byrne represented the people of Tasmania in the Senate for over 34 years, a great achievement and a near record. During his eight terms in parliament he received a first-hand view of the shifting fortunes of various governments as they rose and fell around him. He saw eight Prime Ministers come and go from Chifley in the late 1940s to Fraser in the early 1980s.

         Justin O'Byrne was educated at St Patrick's College in Launceston. He left Tasmania at the age of 18 to go north to Queensland in search of work. During the depression years he worked on the land in a variety of jobs: drover, fencer, bullock driver, tank sinker and station overseer. When I was in Launceston today one of the federal members of parliament down there provided me with a local article which described Justin O'Byrne as a `road' scholar, saying that he had learnt a lot on the road.

         Justin O'Byrne took flying lessons under the empire training scheme and subsequently served as a RAAF fighter pilot during World War II. He took part in the defence of London during the blitz before being shot down over France in 1941. Justin O'Byrne was detained as a prisoner of war in various German prison camps, being sent to the notorious Stalag Luft III camp for fighter pilots, where he spent the remainder of the war. He was a courageous and a defiant prisoner. He spent his incarceration planning escapes, digging tunnels and keeping morale up among his fellow prisoners. He helped plan two legendary escapes which I think became famous.

         Mr O'Byrne was able to put his traumatic POW experience behind him and not long after his repatriation to Australia he was elected as senator for Tasmania in 1946. Through his long career in the Senate, Mr O'Byrne served on many committees including defence, resources, war gratuity and public works.

One of the sad things I remember, having lunch with him on the day of the first caucus meeting in December 1972, was his getting a message from one of the scrutineers leading him to believe that he had been elected to cabinet, only to have that dashed an hour or two later when the preferences were fully distributed.

I remember, when I was a lad of about 17 or 18, meeting him at almost every polling booth I went to one day in the electorate of Bass, talking to him and following up a conversation as we went. We would both leave and we would both meet in the next place. What I remember is that, even at that stage and under those circumstances, by the time we got to the next booth he had a new story. Of course, in 1946 it was a winner takes all election. There were six Labor senators and no Liberals. Justin was a Labor senator during the period between 1947 and 1950.

         Some senators will have known Justin longer than I did, especially those from Justin's home state of Tasmania. My association with Justin, however, began after my election to the Senate in 1975. I recall that when I was waiting at a motel for transport to take me to Parliament House for my first day of sitting, a young lady who was staying at the same place remarked to me that it would be a sad day. Actually, I thought it was anything but a sad occasion because I had first stood for the Senate in 1970, then again in 1974 and, having been passed over by the Queensland Parliament for a casual vacancy in August and September 1975, I was beginning to wonder whether I should have opted for an academic career instead. So I was compelled to ask why the day would not be memorable.

         The young lady replied that the senator for whom she worked—she referred to him as her boss—was about to lose his job. She was, of course, referring to Justin and his position as President of the Senate. Later in the day, when Condor Laucke assumed the presidency of the Senate, Justin handled the situation with consummate grace and his congratulations to the new president were absolutely sincere.

         Over the years which followed our first meeting, a firm friendship developed between Justin and me, even though I was about 26 years his junior and he had already seen 28 years of service in the Senate before I entered the parliament. There are probably  countless warm stories which can be told about Justin, because he was such a fine raconteur, especially at the dinner table in the old Parliament House. Quite a few times I heard the story of how he was compelled to bail out over enemy held territory. His hands had been scalded by escaping engine oil and, if I remember correctly, because of damage to his aircraft, he had to turn it upside down to bail out. I used to be fascinated at how he described his surprise at how small his parachute appeared to be when he looked up. He also mentioned that after he bailed out he could see the white cliffs of Dover to the west but described how they disappeared from his view as he descended. I expect that he had wistful memories of those white cliffs during his three and a half years as a prisoner of war.

But in our midst here was a person who was actually serving in parliament before Labor's loss of government in 1949. With Justin's passing, very few members of that era still remain.

In 1972, however, he was again part of the governing party and his long and meritorious service was rewarded by his election to the presidency of the Senate in 1974.

         Although Justin retired from the Senate in 1981, it was not uncommon for him to return to Canberra. Whenever he did, it was ever so pleasing to meet him once again. On one occasion, when I was chairing a Senate select committee in Launceston, I was surprised and delighted to see Justin—he was by then retired—sitting with those who had come to give evidence or listen to the comments of their fellow residents. It is the only time in my experience as a member of any committee that a former president was present at a public hearing. I would have thought that, after 34 years in the Senate, any activity would be preferable to spending a morning at a Senate committee hearing. But it was a measure of Justin's commitment to his local community that he came along to hear what was being said about agricultural and veterinary chemicals.

I considered doing so, but decided against it, thinking I should not invade the privacy of his home. We all pass on eventually, but it never occurred to me that I would not see Justin again. I believe that I had an unreal and unconscious perception that Justin O'Byrne and death were incompatible. Sadly, because I saw and spoke to Justin earlier this year, it did not mean that there would be further opportunities to renew our friendship some time later.

But he practised this philosophy and, as a consequence, became a man of the people. He understood the philosophy and thoughts of the everyday person. His upbringing and training, his work before the 1930s and his wartime experiences prepared him for the role of being a friend of the people.

On the other hand, his strong religious training at the local Catholic St Patrick's College gave him a sense of justice for all.

Here he participated in a number of tunnel escapes for airmen. The famous wartime story,

         It is interesting to note that Justin always made very positive comments, even about Liberal prime ministers. This says a lot about the character of the man that we are discussing in this condolence motion today. For example, he described Menzies as being outstanding, capable and articulate while Gordon had a `lot of innate ability'.

         The highlight of Justin's long career, as mentioned by many other speakers here today, was his election to the high office of the President of the Senate in 1974. It is fitting that flags were flown at half mast over this building today. The election was unexpected as, when nominated, he did not have a majority of the votes to obtain the position. At the time, Senator Steele made the voting even, but a defection by one of the opposition senators gave it to him. This is again testimony to the fact that he was so well liked.

         The newspaper reports at the time again homed in on this third generation Irish Australian and his ability to inject humour into all situations. The reports comment on his ability to liven up a dull Senate debate with light-hearted doggerels. Many felt that his presidency might be flippant and in stark contrast to the dignified and stately Sir Magnus Cormack. However, the newspapers were wrong. Justin O'Byrne conducted his presidency with dignity. Although the Labor Party was in the minority while he was in the president's chair, there was not one dissent from his rulings or a vote of no confidence.

         Whatever side of the political fence Tasmanian politicians have been on, I think they have been able to contribute more than their fair share to the party organisation. Justin O'Byrne was a man first and a politician second. His cheerfulness, ready wit, positive outlook on life and regard for the everyday man will be sorely missed by both his family and friends. To his wife, Anne, always his right hand for most of his political career, his son Justin and his daughters Hilary and Helene, I extend for a second time my deepest sympathy.

I have been here for five. The thought that one might serve here for 27 years is beyond comprehension. But he then was nowhere near the end of his effective contribution as a senator.

I suppose all those who knew him were once or twice the butt of that humour—not that he was a person who embarrassed others with his humour.

I was always impressed by the fact that in his contributions there was always a core of the principle which underpinned the position that he was articulating. He tried to progress from that principle to the conclusion. I do not want to pretend that I always agreed with Justin O'Byrne.

We had some wonderful arguments, but I always respected the fact that he articulated his case from a position of principle, even when they were principles with which I did not agree.

As Senator Archer said, he was true to his ideals and to the Labor Party. He was probably the last of the true blue union type representatives that we have seen from the Labor Party. I always thought that he had a degree of detached objectivity about his approach to politics. He had an air about him that you often see in people who have had some pretty searing experiences in war; when they get into civilian life they probably find it difficult to see anything as being as serious as what they have been through in the past.

The ruling was quite correct according to the standing orders; I cannot remember what the point at error was. We were in government then and, characteristically, no-one on my side came to my help. Justin, who used to sit on the back bench on the other side of the chamber immediately recognised the difficulty I was in and he moved either that I be granted leave to speak or for the suspension of standing orders.

A ballot was taking place with six of us standing for three positions. At the end of the meeting, somebody said to Justin, `How's the ballot going?'. He said, `I've counted it twice and I've got two different results so I think I'll take the ballot papers home tonight and count them properly'. Some of my supporters did not think that that was a particularly good idea, so the ballot was counted and I won by one vote. That was the very unlikely start to a friendship back in 1973.

         The AMLC establishes quotas on the export of goods where restrictions are imposed, or are likely to be imposed, by an importing country or by Australia or, in the case of the export of live sheep or lambs, where the AMLC believes it is in the best interests of the industry to operate such quotas. At present, restrictions are being imposed on our exports of beef, mutton and goat meat to the United States and on the import of Australian beef, buffalo and sheep meat by the EC.

         The Democrats acknowledge these restrictions and recognise the vitally important role the operation of a quota scheme plays in ensuring our reluctant conformity to these restrictions. With over $1 billion worth of beef exported to the US each year and the threat of an import quota being imposed on us under the US meat import law—a quota which could cost our beef exporters around $100 million—the importance of upholding our undertakings under voluntary restraint agreements is obvious. The Australian Democrats recognise the important role quotas play, and we will be supporting the bill.

         I want to raise a couple of issues. Firstly, I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Boswell in his appeal to the government to allow time for the farmers investment trust to secure funds to enable it to purchase Elders shares in AMH. The Democrats have argued for, fought for and made the same appeal on many occasions for ownership of primary industry and other industries to be retained in Australian hands. We have made our regrets about the weakness of the Foreign Investment Review Board known on many occasions. It is our policy to support Australian ownership. So I support the appeal which Senator Boswell has made.

         Another issue is also very important for the Democrats. One of the powers contained in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Act, which I would like to spend a little time on, is the power of the AMLC to regulate the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia, if and when it is to recommence and if such regulation is required. Australia's live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia was suspended in 1991 to protect our industry's reputation and to uphold the government's animal welfare obligations. The Democrats welcomed the decision at that time.

         The policy position of the Democrats regarding the export of live sheep is well known to everyone in this chamber. We believe that such trade on the whole is inhuman. That is a strange word to use in relation to sheep, but I think honourable senators know what I mean. It shows a blatant disregard for the welfare of the animals involved. Some honourable senators may respond by arguing that the welfare of the sheep has to be protected for them to be saleable at their destination. Taking this view though sees the animal's welfare from a commercial perspective only and is certainly not the approach the Democrats would want to take.

         The specific issue I want to pick up is whether or not we need to be exporting as many live sheep as we are currently. The Democrats believe that the live sheep export trade is not only inhuman but we also question the economic value of the trade. In saying that, I acknowledge that often large numbers of live sheep are required by middle eastern countries for various Muslim festivals and that on these occasions we are able to charge a premium price for our sheep.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, the Democrats take the view—and I notice that this line was also run by the Labor member for Paterson (Mr Horne) in the other place—that we should be exploring the possibility of negotiating arrangements with the countries to which we presently export live sheep so that the slaughter of those sheep is undertaken in Australia in accordance with Muslim requirements. I understand that on some occasions this occurs in Australia through a process known as hal-al slaughtering. The slaughter is conducted under the supervision or the approval of a Muslim official, and there are quite a number of abattoirs in Australia currently certified by AQIS to conduct such slaughtering. Clearly, if an animal is to be slaughtered, then from an animal welfare perspective it is far more desirable to have that done in Australia as it avoids subjecting the animals to the lengthy and arduous trip to Saudi Arabia. The benefits of slaughtering the animals in Australia are obvious often in terms of the enormous boost it would also provide to our domestic meat industry.

         Our live sheep exports in the year ending June 1993 to countries such as Kuwait, Oman, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, were worth about $119 million. Despite the suspension of our trade with Saudi Arabia we are still exporting over five million live sheep per year. If the trade were to recommence with Saudi Arabia we could expect this figure to increase to somewhere over six million sheep a year being exported from this country.

         It seems to me that if we could encourage the development of a system whereby at least some of these sheep are slaughtered in Australia and carcasses exported, the benefits economically and in terms of jobs, particularly if our trade was to resume to Saudi Arabia, could be enormous. I urge the government and the AMLC to explore this further with the industry and with the nations involved in the live sheep trade.

Firstly, I will speak about the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia and the particular problems we have had with the cessation of that trade over the last year or 18 months. There was some criticism earlier in the debate that we should be doing more to bring about the resumption of that trade.

         The Australian government has been having close consultations with the live sheep industry and is actively trying to bring about the resumption of the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia on a satisfactory basis. It should be noted that the live sheep exports to the Middle East region in fact increased over the last year since the cessation of the trade with Saudi Arabia. In 1990-91 some 2.87 million head of sheep, valued at $43.7 million, were exported. In 1991-92 that number increased to just over four million head, valued at $78.9 million—a 40 per cent increase in numbers and an 80 per cent increase in value. The government is very much aware of the importance of the live sheep trade to Australian producers and is continuing to concentrate its efforts on the development and expansion of this trade.

         The second area of criticism from the opposition, which we hear fairly regularly and somewhat monotonously at times, relates to the alleged slow pace of waterfront reform. I do not want to go into the very detailed nature of the restructuring that has taken place on the waterfront, except to say that it has been very substantial. The number of people employed on the waterfront has dropped very considerably over the last decade and the government is continuing on the essential micro- and macro-economic reforms in the transport sector. Whilst in some areas the immediate cost reductions have not been evident, we have to remember that the cost of the changes to the waterfront is being amortised over a number of years and that the cost savings will become more and more apparent over the next year or two as that amortisation of the cost of restructuring is brought to an end.

         I want to refer briefly to the third matter that was raised. Senator Boswell quite rightly raised the critical issue of value adding. He referred to the fairly poor—not poor in the sense of making a criticism, but poor in the sense of the Australian effort—direct involvement of our primary producers in value adding, particularly in the export market. We have not had great success in this area. This has been a very strong theme of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean. I know that changes are occurring in the value adding area.

One of the critical problems that the National Farmers Federation has identified is the need for farmers to be more directly involved in that export sector.

Down the production scale, that export company commissions packing houses and growers to pack for it, to grow for it and then it exports on behalf of the growers, returning a dividend to the growers. It is a very successful organisation and it is certainly the type of organisation we hope to see develop more in Australia.

        —Tonight we have before us for debate a package of seven bills to give effect to the prudential arrangements for superannuation announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 21 October 1992 in his statement entitled `Strengthening super security—new prudential arrangements for superannuation'. These bills and, in particular, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill, are some of the most significant legislation to come before the parliament in the life of this government. They represent the most detailed and far-reaching attempt in the history of superannuation in Australia to impose a common regulatory framework in the superannuation industry. They reflect the constructive approach of the committee system in the Senate where bipartisanship and teamwork have been above politics in determining a system of laws and rules for the good administrative practice in the national interest.

        The measures will affect almost every superannuation fund in Australia, including approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. Superannuation funds take a number of forms, with the main categories being personal superannuation funds, industry based funds, individual enterprise schemes and government funded schemes. The need for increased supervision of the industry is highlighted by the volume of money under the control of the superannuation funds, the diverse range of funds operating, the Maxwell case in the UK and the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, which has removed the voluntary nature of superannuation funds for most employees. These issues underline the need for increased supervision.

        If the government forces employers to contribute to superannuation on behalf of their employees—and often employees have no choice as to the fund into which the contributions are directed—employees are entitled to expect measures to exist which protect those funds that are set aside for their benefit. Broadly based superannuation arrangements have now been with us for six years. While still in its infancy in many ways, the superannuation industry is a rapidly growing collection of professionals and financial institutions. Money under control of superannuation funds currently stands at $169 billion. Superannuation funds are estimated to increase to between $300 billion and $600 billion by the year 2000.

        I believe that superannuation in Australia is now on the threshold of adopting a regulatory regime and structure which is unique in the OECD world. To move to a single entity superannuation fund trust structure, involving codification of trustee responsibilities, is a development which overseas countries will observe with a great deal of interest. The Australian system of super fund regulation could well become the template for regulation in other countries. In this regard, it is worth noting that the Goode report in Britain has made a number of recommendations which are in keeping with certain SIS provisions.

        Having said that, I am very surprised to read that the government believes that the reviews of superannuation should cease. The assurance of a hands-off approach to allow the industry to settle down after the SIS bills, apart from some finetuning, is not, I would say, a welcome comment. There are many unanswered policy questions which must be answered. Dr Fitzgerald, for example, has called for a final report since the government has promised each time it has unveiled major changes in the last five years that it would be the last change. To close down the debate on super policy would be a dangerous course of action. The reviews which have taken place in recent years have played a significant role in getting the superannuation industry to where it is today.

        It cannot be forgotten that the superannuation industry is also becoming a great source of tax revenue. Last year, the 1992-93 year, the tax on superannuation funds reached $1.522 billion, an increase of 33.6 per cent on the previous year and a massive increase of 180 per cent on the 1990-91 year. Five years ago the tax just did not exist. The threefold layering of superannuation—at entry, in the fund and on exit—as practised in Australia, is a unique feature in this country. Other countries have only one or two superannuation taxes, not three.

        The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which I have the privilege of chairing, tabled its ninth report on the SIS legislation in the last week of sitting. The committee received nearly 100 written submissions. It convened public hearings on the bills in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. In addition, informal meetings were arranged between the committee members and officers of the ISC at which amendments to improve the legislation were discussed. I thank the government and the members of the ISC for their participation. I think the end result is that we have a much better regime. It just shows that cooperation between the parliament and the executive can contribute to a better overall result.

        While addressing many issues and making a number of recommendations, a number of these recommendations deal with areas of superannuation apart from the SIS bills, which I will not specifically refer to now. The committee has recommended amendments to the SIS bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill.

        The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill is the central plank of the new policy platform. It contains provisions which will radically alter the way the superannuation funds operate. It is designed to increase the level of prudential protection provided to the superannuation industry, strengthen the security of superannuation savings, and increase the protection and rights of superannuation fund members. Given the magnitude of the proposed change, it was not surprising that the committee received 97 submissions and agreed to take evidence from more than 60 witnesses, representing the interests of superannuation providers, regulators and consumers.

        Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the SIS legislation has been clause 64—formerly clause 63 of the SIS bill—which contained a blanket prohibition on superannuation funds acquiring assets from members or members' relatives. Of the submissions received by the committee, approximately one-half of them—particularly from the very small businesses—were concerned with the impact of this clause. The object of clause 64, which is designed to take effect from 27 May 1993, is to be an anti-avoidance measure to prevent superannuation fund members selling their assets to their superannuation fund in order to obtain certain cash benefits.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The majority of the written submissions addressing this clause focused on the following areas of concern: first, that the complete prohibition was too harsh as it discriminated against legitimate business transactions and small business activities; second, that it prevented people from funding their own superannuation and therefore particularly discriminated against the self-employed; third, that it failed to take into account the same types of investments held in different names; fourth, that it appears easy to avoid simply by interposing another entity between the superannuation fund and the member—we did ask the ISC to look at this to try to overcome this particular problem; and, finally, that it imposed a gaol sentence for breaches, which we believe is too severe.

        The majority report of the committee has recommended that the following types of assets be allowed to be acquired from members or members' relatives: freehold or leasehold property which reflects true market value that is used wholly and exclusively in the business of the member or member's relatives. During the committee stage I intend to move an amendment to modify this particular provision so that for excluded funds, that is, fewer than five members, there will be no more than 40 per cent interest and for others, that is, more than five members, 25 per cent interest will apply as a means of putting in place a further prudential control to make sure that it could not be exploited to the detriment of anybody involved. Assets able to be acquired also included listed securities, which means shares, units, bonds or debentures, rights or options, or any other security listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange.

        The committee further recommended that the sole purpose test be strengthened to ensure that any asset or assets included in the exemption provided under clause 64 acquired by the superannuation fund from a member or member's relative does not contravene the sole purpose test. Another major issue surrounding clause 64 is the penalty of two years gaol for a breach of the provision. When comparing the appropriateness of this penalty, one has to have regard to the severity and nature of the mischief that the provision is designed to prevent. In some circumstances, gaol may be appropriate but in other circumstances it is too harsh. The committee recommended that penalty points be introduced and that the time period be reduced to one year, and the final result of the opposition's amendment, which I foreshadow, will be to limit it to one year's gaol sentence because the crimes provisions provide that one year's gaol is equal to a 60 penalty points fine.

        The constitutional power over superannuation and state public sector superannuation schemes was a problem. The Commonwealth does not have a single and exclusive constitutional head of power over superannuation. In its first report the committee recommended that the government explore the possibility of obtaining a referral by the states of their power over superannuation. The issues arising from the SIS legislation indicate that this is now a central issue. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the government revisit the recommendations of its first report.

        The referral of superannuation powers from the states to the Commonwealth was further highlighted in the application of the SIS legislation to state and territory public sector superannuation schemes. Following representations by the states and territories concerning the perceived infringement by the Commonwealth on state rights as a consequence of certain SIS provisions, the committee has recommended that the government negotiate with the states and territories to have their super schemes exempted from the SIS legislation. Clearly, if there was a referral by the states and territories of their power over superannuation to the Commonwealth, such exemptions would not be necessary.

        The committee considered at length proposals to allow superannuation funds to have enhanced access to tax file numbers. I need not remind the Senate that TFNs and their use arouse a number of sensitivities about privacy. The committee heard compelling evidence about the need to use TFNs to allow the new eligible rollover funds to work efficiently. However, there was equally compelling evidence from the Privacy Commissioner on the need for caution in expanding the use of TFNs. The committee recommended—and I expect that the SIS bills will ultimately be amended accordingly—that superannuation funds be allowed to use TFNs for taxation and transfer of benefit purposes and that this provision take effect from the date that the bill receives royal assent.

        The role of actuaries and auditors under the SIS bills is a matter which has not been the subject of intense or widespread media scrutiny or comment. Yet, after the watchdog activities of members, auditors and actuaries will be the first line of defence in detecting any wrongdoing by fund operators. The committee has recommended increased auditor protection to correspond with the increased responsibilities of auditors. In addition, it has again recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of a register of suitably qualified superannuation auditors.

        One of the major focuses of the report was on the impact of the SIS legislation on public offer funds. These now account for $14 billion of super savings and are currently operated on a dual entity basis between the trustee and the fund manager. Arguably, the most significant change to the superannuation industry by the SIS legislation concerns the requirement that public offer funds cease to operate on this dual entity basis and move to a single responsible entity. This accords with the recommendations contained in two Australian Law Reform Commission reports. Obviously, such a single entity requirement represents a massive departure from the current operating structure, the magnitude of which is incalculable when one considers the membership and investments in public offer funds.

        Although the committee fully supports the single entity approach, it is concerned at the lack of accompanying transitional arrangements for such change, particularly in the area of who should be appointed as the single responsible entity and how any conflict between the two entities should be resolved when it arises. From the written submissions and the evidence, it became clear that the government will need to monitor the transition process closely to ensure that unnecessary confusion and uncertainty does not occur. The last thing that super needs is 200,000 disaffected retirees who have money in a public offer fund.

        The committee has maintained an interest in maximising the welfare of consumers under the new super regime. The committee recognised that if the new super system is to work it must have the support of the public. In order to get this support, consumers must have confidence in the integrity of every facet. Vigilance, by both government and the industry, is needed over the day-to-day operation of all super funds. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will be the vanguard of this initiative. The committee found that the tribunal should have a wide-ranging brief in all matters except medical evidence.

        In conclusion, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has been involved with this package of bills since its appointment in 1991. To this end, in its first report it set out the parameters and in subsequent reports `fine-tuned' its approach to superannuation. This report is the culmination of work on the regulation of superannuation. During the process it became increasingly apparent that specialist committees have an important role to play in complex legislation such as the package of bills currently before us. It is also apparent that the new system of referral of bills to committees allows public and competing views to be taken into account in the passage of legislation.

        The legislation is, as I have mentioned, a blueprint for other countries to set up superannuation regulation mechanisms. However, in closing I must issue a note of caution. The mere enactment of legislation to regulate superannuation funds does not guarantee security for members of funds. It is now the job of trustees, members and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, as regulator, to hold the superannuation system together. The ISC, as the committee has said time and time again, needs to be pro-active, alert and an effective regulator. I believe it has done this exceedingly well today and I wish it well in the future under its capable leadership. These bills give the ISC that power and it is now its responsibility to discharge its newly established statutory obligations.

They also arise out of a commitment the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) gave the Australian Democrats when we agreed to pass the superannuation guarantee charge if, and only if, appropriate prudential supervision legislation were passed by this parliament.

        Collectively, this package before the chamber marks one of the most important legislative packages this year. It provides a proper system of prudential supervision and a simple disputes resolution process for superannuation funds which already account for more than $169 billion in assets and a membership of 70 per cent of the Australian work force. I think it is fair that the Democrats can take some credit in that, after 10 years of regular change to superannuation—usually the old legislation by press release—the Democrats moved in early 1991 to establish the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. In its two years of operation, the committee has established a strong reputation for pro-active and imaginative dealings with the wide array of difficult issues in the superannuation industry.

It is one thing to compel people to put their money in; the other half of the equation of responsibility for us is to make sure that, because of appropriate prudential supervision, that money is there when people need to draw on it. The bill also expands the powers and the role of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, establishing a single pro-active industry regulator.

        Matters encompassed in this bill include the constitution, powers and types of superannuation funds; the roles and responsibilities of trustees, managers, custodians and employers; arrangements governing investments, assets and reserves of superannuation funds; the treatment of fund surpluses and unclaimed benefits; the obligations of auditors and actuaries; and provisions to protect fund members from losses incurred through fraud or theft. As we can see, it is extremely comprehensive. The bill replaces many provisions of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987 which are to be repealed.

        Regulations to be issued under part 19 of the SIS bill will require disclosure of fees, charges and commissions relating to superannuation.

        Notwithstanding the additional action yet to be taken, the position of consumers vis-a-vis the funds will improve dramatically under the legislation. However, I must make the observation that, with seven new bills and possibly 1,000 new regulations to add to the morass of law governing superannuation, the likelihood that consumers will be fully aware of their rights is becoming increasingly remote. Despite the efforts of consumer groups, unions and superannuants associations, there is still effectively no single body to which fund members can turn for advice.

        For these reasons, the Democrats have called on the government to support the establishment and funding of independent community based superannuation legal and information centres.

To ensure that the benefit of the service is extended to all states, consumer groups estimate a set-up cost of something like $666,000 for the service.

I will also move an amendment to clause 23 of the tribunal bill to expand the right to representation before the tribunal to include complainants with a limited ability to speak, read or write English or where the tribunal would consider it necessary in the interests of fairness.

        A further consumer issue of concern to the Democrats has been the stated intention of the government to exclude complaints over disability claims from the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The Senate committee has taken evidence of problems which consumers have had obtaining payouts on disability claims from some superannuation funds. Documented stories of claims taking many months to process and of trustees accepting the advice of the insurer without any proper consideration abound.

        The SIS bills contain a number of new rules governing the investments to be made or not made by superannuation funds. Part 8 provides a range of rules governing the level of in-house assets funds will be permitted to have. These rules should help to avoid a repeat of a Robert Maxwell style run-down of employee superannuation funds by an employer. Part 7 of the bill also prohibits lending of assets to members of superannuation funds and the buying of assets by the fund from members of the fund. This latter provision in clause 64 has probably become the most controversial aspect of the bill and most of the submissions to the Senate select committee dealt with this provision.

        On the one hand, the government has argued that clause 64 will close a significant tax avoidance provision whereby members transfer assets into superannuation at a concessional tax rate. The arrangements are used primarily by the self-employed who already account for about $2 billion of the $5 billion the government forgoes in superannuation taxation concessions. The government has argued that the provision will ensure that superannuation funds are preserved and used solely for the accumulation of retirement income.

There appeared to be an assumption that members of small funds were incapable of running their own investment funds without engaging in tax avoidance; in other words, tax avoidance was their primary motivation.

        Savings in the hands of trustees are governed by a rationale which is totally different from that contemplated by free market theory. Fundamentally, because of fiduciary duties made even clearer by these SIS bills, trustees are in the business of risk aversion rather than wealth maximisation. This is demonstrated in the holdings of superannuation funds, with 55 per cent basically in blue chip stock and almost 40 per cent in cash and interest bearing deposits. There is no nationalism—no national interest—about risk aversion. I think it is a worry that at a time when many dynamic small Australian businesses cannot get access to capital for love or money there is almost $26 billion in assets invested overseas.

         The Australian Democrats have called in the past—and we repeat the call—for the establishment of a national development fund, made up of just one per cent of the assets of superannuation funds, to provide venture capital for Australian firms. We have also called for restrictions on the amount that can be invested overseas. With such a massive pool, given a major boost by compulsory superannuation contributions, members of the Australian public have a right to expect that at least a small proportion of their funds will be invested in developing the nation's future. It is not true to say that people would automatically lose out, because the benefits of anything which adds to overall economic development are shared by all of us.

With the way penalties are going in our courts these days, it is quite possible that the auditor could get two years gaol under this legislation for a breach of the penalty but that a guy who shoots the auditor for doing it might finish up serving only the same amount of time.

        But, in spite of the number of bills that have gone through the parliament since the Labor government came into operation—there have been something like 80 pieces of legislation in 10 or so years that have dealt with superannuation—I do not think that the government has really come to terms with the fact that retirement income is a very important issue in our community.

        The government does not yet seem to have recognised that the quite rapid ageing of the population into the years of the next century will have a significant impact on a lot of people. There will be fewer taxpayers than at present; there will be more people beyond working age. There is, I think, an urgent need to deal with retirement income policy in a realistic fashion, particularly for women, who so far have been virtually ignored by Labor's policies. I am not suggesting for a minute that the government has not done anything at all, but it has not dealt with half the population.

        The figures indicate the considerable increase in the amount of money that has gone into superannuation funds—from $32.6 billion in 1983 to $140 billion in 1992. With the superannuation guarantee charge, that amount will rise significantly. So it is absolutely essential to deal with the management of the funds—to see that that is done properly, that there is little risk of funds failing and members' money being lost, and that there is a minimum risk of fraud, misappropriation or things of that nature.

        Previously, the legislation sought to regulate indirectly. This package of bills regulates more directly. But it is the other areas that I mentioned that still need to be pointed out. There are three in particular. The first I refer to is the fees and charges which are being charged by superannuation funds at the present time which erode the value of super. It certainly does so for those who are part-time workers, of whom women form a considerable section.

        The second is the inability of anybody who has been out of paid employment for more than two years to pay into a super fund. Again, significantly, it is women who fall into that category. I can see absolutely no rational explanation for why that should continue, why we cannot devise rules for superannuation which enable it to continue beyond a period of two years so that one could start paying in again in the future, why one cannot have a superannuation fund that remains intact when one changes employers. Every time someone changes an employer, what has been paid in becomes virtually worthless because the amount that that person receives back when that happens is so little, as I have mentioned previously when I have spoken on these issues. It can be done if one has the will to do it.

        Another aspect I want to mention is that superannuation is dealt with in Family Court proceedings following the breakdown of a marriage. Certainly superannuation is taken into account as property—but not as superannuation, not as retirement income. I do not think that the Labor Party recognises superannuation for its own value and importance. Indeed, some of the legislation that has been brought before us suggests that the government has looked at superannuation more as a means of revenue raising or as part of a wages package in the context of industrial bargaining—not as retirement income for its own intrinsic value. I think it is time we confronted the very unfair treatment for women in particular that occurs as a result.

        Women receive lower wages than men. Either they are still not getting equal pay for work of equal value, or they are not getting the opportunity to do work which pays the same wage rate as that received by men. Two-thirds of women earn average incomes below $21,000, while the average income for the same number of men is above $21,000. As I said, either women are not getting paid or they are not getting the opportunity to participate. As a consequence, they get a smaller benefit at retirement.

        Australian women constitute the majority of the aged population and they will continue to do so. That is clear. For that reason, they are being disadvantaged as they get to an age beyond which they are able to work and increase their own income. The traditional male patterns of work which seem to be still the basis of superannuation do not favour women and do not give them an opportunity to participate. Superannuation is based on people being virtually in one job for the full 40-odd years of their working life, in full-time employment, coming to retirement age and then moving into superannuation. A lot of women now are doing that, but they are a very small proportion of the total. With a bit of imagination, with a bit of will to include women in superannuation schemes, this could be changed. I believe it will be a long time before most women fall into the male work pattern, which is the basis of superannuation at the present time.

        I mentioned being out of the work force for more than two years. As I conceded, it is not just a female question, but frequently that is the case. Why can a superannuation scheme not be individual to a person so that during your working life your employer can pay into it what should be paid while you are employed; so that you can contribute to your own superannuation scheme from such savings as you may be able to contribute during your working life; so that you may be able to pay into your own superannuation scheme money that you come by, perhaps by way of an inheritance or a lucky day at the races. In many instances in a divorce settlement there are cases where a woman receives a certain amount of money and she may well be better advised to place that sum of money into her own personal superannuation scheme than to deal with it in any other way. That is not so in all cases, but in many instances that may in fact give her much better retirement income in the longer term.

        Superannuation in the context of the Family Court has been dealt with in other places and I will not go into it in detail tonight. I merely remind the Senate, and in particular the government, that in many instances the female partner in a divorce does not have superannuation. When we take into account the value of superannuation at the time of divorce as an item of property, it does not indicate its true value in the longer term. It does not ensure that the other party in fact has superannuation in the longer run. I think it is time for the government to deal with that aspect and I hope it will do so before too long.

        Extent to which superannuation taken into account. Superannuation entitlements were available to a significant number of respondents in the survey of Family Court cases. For example, in the sample of applications for approval of s 87 agreements, 45% of men and 15% of women were said to have these entitlements.(24) The Australian Institute of Family Studies survey, summarised in chapter 6, disclosed that, amongst younger couples, just over 50% of husbands and 8% of wives were members of superannuation schemes; and that amongst older couples just under 50% of husbands and 16-19% of wives were members of such schemes.(25) However, both studies demonstrated that superannuation is often ignored and, when not ignored, is not taken into account in any clear or consistent way. The Australian Institute of Family Studies research showed that in many cases, even amongst the older respondents, superannuation was not taken into account in property division. It was taken into account in only 46% of possible cases according to the older men and 39% of possible cases according to older women. Amongst younger couples, it was taken into account in only 38% of possible cases according to men and 20% of possible cases according to women.(26) Where superannuation had not been taken into account three quarters of the survey respondents claimed that they had not received advice that superannuation was relevant.(27) This is despite the fact that, where the value ascribed to the superannuation is added to the general pool of property, superannuation ranks as a significant asset. The absence of superannuation and life insurance policies in the pool of available property pushes the average share of property currently going to wives down by about 10% according to women and by about 5% according to men, when taking the older and younger groups together. The inclusion of superannuation would therefore have a significant effect on the overall shares.(28)

But in fact it was and, over the period I just mentioned, some $165 was paid to CANPLAN Multi-Industry Superannuation Plan 330, which was the superannuation fund that her employer paid into. Regrettably, an employer regards the levy virtually as a tax, which it is to the employer. The employer has no reason to take any interest or concern in what happens to the contribution that he or she is forced to make. Of course, the employee does not contribute at all.

It has nothing to do with providing for people when they get to the end of their working lives.

        This could be easily rectified if the government set up a personal superannuation scheme for those who have turned 18, so that moneys could be paid in by the employer and the employee, and other moneys could be paid in by other people or as it becomes available. People who are out of the work force because they are unemployed for more than two years, as at present, or women who are out of the work force for five years while they have children and look after them while they are young, would find the money still available and not gobbled up with administration charges and levies, which is what presently happens.

        If anything, we feel the legislation does not go far enough. We see massive amounts of unfunded liabilities in superannuation funds. One Victorian public sector superannuation fund has been reported in the business press to hold $16 billion in unfunded liabilities. This is more than the maximum that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) proposes to allow for the national debt.

We were reassured by government that the legislation would not cover the members in this case because the legislation covers fraud and clear mismanagement, but not commercial mishaps.

        What is an industry norm? In some respects, it is reflected in clauses in the legislation. Investment should be `adequately diverse' and ensure maximum returns without creating insupportable risks. This translates into conventional investment strategies used in banks, insurance agencies and other big storehouses of money; that is, to play the global market in what has been described as casino capitalism.

        It should be noted here that this is a new phenomenon, having its roots in two changes: the deregulation of the global financial market, such as the London financial city in 1980; and the development and proliferation of communication and computer technology, which allowed investors to speculate globally at speed. It is worth noting that we are not talking about the speed of an investor on a direct line, but the speed of one computer speaking directly to another computer. That is what we are looking at with this amount of money in Australian investment funds.

        We are not suggesting that people could necessarily direct where their investment could go because not everybody is an investment manager. But we do say that it is extremely important that if one believes—and in this chamber, most people express the belief—that the market process is the way choices should be made, then one of the very first principles of the market is that people act after being in receipt of full information. The Greens would add that profitability is not the only basis upon which people make choices as consumers. If one even pretends to be interested in the market as a mechanism, one cannot disagree that the ability to find out where one's compulsory funds are being spent is a very important principle.

        The issue of disclosure is central here. There is no way of knowing even whether a fund is ethical unless one knows the investment strategy and where one's money is going. We flagged putting forward an amendment to this measure to ensure that members and potential members of public issue entities and of funds people choose to belong to can not only ask for information but be entitled to receive information on where their portfolio is located. We have phrased our suggestion so that information is available on demand. It would not be a requirement that every fund provide that information for every member every year, which we realise would be impractical and very expensive, but on demand people would have the right to find out the portfolio of their prospective superannuation fund.

        The existing section says that the commissioner may set regulations requiring disclosure. I am very grateful that the government is now suggesting that in the near future—that is, by early next year—there will be regulations that actually specify the ability of prospective members of superannuation funds to access this information. At the moment, the legislation itself does not guarantee disclosure for public sector funds or non-public sector offer employer sponsored funds. These are the funds which are not voluntary, the funds employees must join as a condition of employment. There is no freedom to respond according to conscience. The government did not at the time of drafting deem it necessary to allow people to know where their money was going.

        Clause 64 of the superannuation supervisory bill was a problem for us, as it was for many others. The consistently strong criticism should be taken as an indication that there are real problems with this section. We recognise the need to stop rorts. It seems clear that when trustees or fund managers arrange things so that they can obtain use value for holding an asset they are obtaining an improper benefit. We think that a lot of senators who have problems with this clause would agree with this principle. The disagreement on the bill is not about motives.

        We feel that focusing on members rather than trustees appears to allow rorts to continue as long as they are not assets donated by or acquired from members.

If it is possible for clause 64—which we believe currently is a legislative mess—to be improved, the Greens WA would consider supporting appropriate amendments which would seek to do so.

        We support regulations which aim to supervise an industry which is capable of creating huge problems, due to its size and diversity and the nature of the current financially deregulated system in Australia. It was our concern that, in the bill's original form, there was a great opportunity to make sure that investment funds in Australia were not simply directed by the electronic financial market of the day into the concentrated hands of fewer and fewer large corporations. Consumers should have the ability to find out where their funds are going, especially in the case of compulsory funds. There has to be the basis for informed choice—whether it is for ethical reasons such as people not wishing to invest in the arms industry, not wishing to invest in destructive forest practices, or not wishing to invest perhaps in the tobacco industry. People at least have a choice and can make informed decisions on that basis.

        Fundamentally, this government has made some very significant changes to superannuation retirement incomes in this country. On election to office in 1983 we realised that the then superannuation regime was largely confined to higher income earners in the public sector, who were overwhelmingly male workers. It covered less than 40 per cent of the work force.

        We have an aging population. At the present time, one in 10 persons is over the age of 65; by the year 2020, one in five persons will be over the age of 65. We therefore identified a need to move to a largely self-funded superannuation retirement incomes policy over the next 30 years. In doing that we have enacted a range of provisions including such fundamental reforms as the superannuation guarantee charge. The fundamental reforms that the Labor government has made were driven significantly by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer. The two major social reforms that this government made over the last 10 years were in the area of Medicare and superannuation.

         So the issue of increased democratisation of superannuation is quite critical. It is highlighted by the fact that 50 per cent of trustees are members of the fund; that is, the work force of the fund. We want workers to know what is going on with their superannuation. These sorts of requirements have been specified in the regulations in the past and will be specified in the regulations arising from this legislation where they have not already been specified before.

        The basic reason for this amendment is that the opposition does not want to hold up the payments that are going to be made by trustees to beneficiaries where there is likely to be any element of dispute, otherwise this could result in a double jeopardy after the tribunal has been constituted. These issues could be brought before the tribunal after the act comes into fruition and thereby create a double jeopardy for the trustees and for the fund. Therefore, I have much pleasure in moving the amendment which is in conformity with a number of submissions and oral presentations made to the committee.

It is not in the interest of beneficiaries to have their payments held up for a further seven months. The government, by its action, has signalled to every trustee around Australia that there is a double jeopardy and that they would be foolish, if there is any element of doubt about the payment, to make a payment to a beneficiary before this bill comes into effect. There will be an immediate implication of withholding every payment that is due where there may be any element of doubt. A trustee just could not afford to take the risk either on account of himself or in the interests of the fund. It creates a double jeopardy situation.

         When the tribunal comes into effect we will have a whole line of issues. I will give honourable senators a typical example. A bona fide payment may be made to a widow. The de facto comes along after 1 July, lodges a complaint with the tribunal and the tribunal says, `Yes, you have a case. You might be entitled to 50 per cent' or whatever the portion might be. The money was paid out in good faith and in full knowledge of the facts as they then existed. Then the tribunal comes along. The Liberal Party had problems about the tribunal because of the possibility that it could undermine the financial standing of the fund. With the government's move tonight, I believe that it has the capacity to undermine the financial standing of small funds. It has the capacity to delay the payments made to genuine beneficiaries in good faith and create a double jeopardy position. I think it is a retrograde action.

         In respect of the other matters that Senator Harradine raised, I do not think it is reasonable that he could conclude that we would not get to the committee stage of this legislation tonight. The government certainly did not give him any indication that we would be proceeding with these bills through the committee stage tomorrow, as I am informed. The second point I want to make is that I know that the decision to negate the adjournment was taken very late—about five to 10 minutes prior to 10.30 p.m. Senator Harradine's office was rung and he was uncontactable. That was the procedure that was followed.

I am now told that a few minutes before putting the question that the Senate do now adjourn, the arrangement was made by the opposition. My office was not contacted and no message was left. My office has an answering machine for when my staff are not there and it is cleared regularly. I had five messages on that answering machine between 9.30 and 10.30, all of which were answered. It has been admitted to me that the call was made only two or three minutes before the normal time for the adjournment debate. That is not a proper way to run this place. It is not a proper way of ensuring that legislation gets the adequate attention of all the members of this Senate.

         As I said before, having regard to the list of speakers, it was appropriate to conclude that the second reading debate would not finish by half past 10. I am not in a position to obtain an expert opinion on this or any other amendment in respect of these particular measures. The reason is that there was an arrangement made between parties without regard to what I or, presumably, people in other than the major parties felt about the matter or the arrangements that they might have made.

         —I will be very brief because I understand what Senator Reid will probably be doing. I can tell Senator Harradine that the comments I made earlier stand. We attempted to contact him. Certainly, the arrangements were made just prior to 10.30 p.m. I have admitted that. I was involved in those arrangements. I was not involved in contacting his office, but I understand that attempts were made to contact him. As Senator Harradine rightly points out, the legislation is important. However, he will well realise the problems we can run into at this time of year if we do not adopt the procedure of negating the adjournment on occasions. On this occasion it was felt necessary that, in order to ensure that we have a smooth run of legislation, that should be the procedure followed.

        Lorna Howlett's book makes clear the contribution Helen Robinson has made to so many lives. Lorna draws on the many experiences that Helen has had including her nursing work with her husband, John, in Nauru and the inner suburbs of Sydney; the establishment of the Mayflower retirement homes; and her overseas trips. Her greatest achievement is the establishment of the Mayflower Retirement Village and hospice in Gerringong. It is a remarkable achievement and the fulfilment of one of Helen's dreams.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the biography, Lorna tells the story of Helen visiting a cold, bleak, abandoned, old Methodist church in Waterloo in Sydney at the age of 17 and making her promise to God to help the aged in our society. Helen can now look at the results of this vision that she and her husband John had inspired and know that her girlhood dream has been answered. Thankfully, the work that Helen has undertaken has not gone unnoticed. In 1979 she was awarded the New South Wales female citizen of the year and in 1984 she was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for her work in aged care. Helen Robinson's tenacity, dedication and vision is best summarised in the book by an extract from a letter of support for Helen's OAM nomination. The extract reads:

       <para font-size="-=2">

        Lorna Howlett's biography of Helen Robinson is a book that I can recommend to everyone. There are so many inspirational stories in this book. Stories such as the terrifying cyclone on Nauru and the heartbreaking tragedy of the Vietnamese boy, Duc, show why we can learn from the strength that Helen has shown throughout her life.

         Certainly, there are very few people who can claim to have achieved all they have dreamt of in life. According to the biographer, other than an interest in helping aged people, Helen has had three personal desires which in her very limited leisure time she allowed herself to dream about. These desires were to speak in the House of Commons, to open a shop and to take a course in speech and drama. It is to Helen's credit that she can say she achieved all three dreams. At the age of 81, she completed a course in speech and drama through a London school earlier this year. She did open a shop and she addressed a meeting in the British Houses of Parliament building. Although she did not actually speak in the parliament, tonight she is being spoken about in the Australian parliament.

        (1) The Government is aware of the Grameen Bank program in Bangladesh, and the significant impact it has had on the lives of its borrowers, both in terms of raising incomes and giving many people, especially women, opportunities for leadership roles they previously lacked. Beginning in a single village in 1976, the Bank now provides loans to over a million borrowers. Loan sizes are typically less than $100 and are provided for small enterprises in areas such as trading, shopkeeping and handicraft manufacture. A number of independent reviews have confirmed that the activities of the Bank have had a significant impact on the poor in those areas in which it has been active, with incomes of borrowers increasing by between 30% and 50% on average, with corresponding improvements in other indicators of welfare. Loan repayment rates exceed 95%.

Micro-enterprise development programs using other approaches are also gaining in popularity internationally. Currently, the Grameen Trust is promoting an ambitious proposal to expand GBA replication programs, and it has sought donor funding of US$ 100 million from bilateral donor agencies world-wide, including Australia.

        The potential for small-scale credit schemes to assist the poor has been recognised by the Government, and the  Australian aid program has been involved in such programs in a small way for several years. The Government is currently considering whether there is scope for increasing support for small-scale credit schemes through its aid program, both to alleviate poverty and to encourage private initiative. The request for support of the Grameen Trust, and other possible initiatives, will be considered in this context weighing other competing priorities for aid budget resources.

        As a key part of this process of assessing the potential of small scale credit schemes, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), is hosting a workshop on the topic of micro-enterprise development on 11 and 12 November this year. The workshop will bring together small-scale credit  and business development practitioners, non-government organisations and academics from Australia and developing countries to consider the role of micro-enterprise development in poverty programs and to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches to such development. The results of the workshop will provide an important input into the Government's consideration of what part support of small scale credit schemes will play in Australia's aid program in future.

This means that journeys from Australia to and from the operational area will be covered. Since 15 June 1993, my Department has been holding claims for pension which may have been affected by the outcome of the Hawkins case.
