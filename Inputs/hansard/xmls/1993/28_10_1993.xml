       The Petition of the undersigned shows: That the laws passed in December 1992 counting unrealised capital gains on shares held by pensioners as income for the purposes of the social security income test are unfair, illogical and discriminatory, and should be repealed as soon as is practicable.

       Your Petitioners ask that the Senate should: (1) note that the Liberal and National Parties now oppose the laws after voting for them in December; (2) condemn the government for persisting with the laws; and (3) take whatever steps are necessary to achieve the repeal of the laws mentioned above.

       Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations

       To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.

        Natural gas now accounts for around 17 percent of our primary energy demand, replacing more than 315,000 barrels of oil per day which we would otherwise have to import, worth $3.5 billion a year to our balance of payments.

        Against this background of prospective growth in gas demand the Government announced the National Gas Strategy in November 1991.

        It is the Government's objective to have the regulatory system for interstate gas pipelines in place before the end of 1993 to assist the sale of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline. Mr President, the Government announced in the 1993-94 Budget that it would proceed with the sale of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System this financial year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the most important outcomes of this bill will be that it provides a high degree of certainty for potential buyers of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline by setting out clearly the regulatory environment that will apply to this and future interstate gas pipelines.

        Importantly, however, the statutory requirements set out in this bill will apply to all interstate pipelines, and will thus provide certainty for gas carriers and in particular, for gas consumers, who have expressed concern, mirrored on a number of occasions by such agencies as the Industries Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, about the possibility of pipeline monopoly abuse in the gas transmission sector.

        This bill, therefore, places statutory requirements on interstate gas pipeline operators that are intrusive only to the extent of providing to existing agencies the minimum of information necessary to protect the community against the possibility of monopoly abuse.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of other countries have taken a different path on pipeline regulation. In the United States, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acts as an industry specific regulator and in the United Kingdom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Gas Supply stipulates terms and conditions specifically for gas trade.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We will avoid the worst aspects of pipeline regulation in those countries. The approach implemented through this legislation will avoid a prescriptive approach to regulation of pipeline operations, at the same time providing mechanisms that ensure access to all interstate gas pipelines. This includes the capacity for the Trade Practices Commission to arbitrate unresolved access disputes.

        "A key issue in this regard is where vertically integrated owners of essential facilities . . . refuse access to competitors . . . either as a result of anti-competitive intent or because of a routine inability to agree a mutually satisfactory price.

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "The trick is to design a few good rules, but still give parties the maximum chance to negotiate mutually agreeable arrangements. This is the crux of a light handed regulatory approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The approach which the Government is taking in this legislation provides a framework which leaves gas carriers and gas users free to negotiate commercial terms, while at the same time providing for surveillance of haulage charges and arbitration of access disputes by the Trade Practices Commission with appeal to the Court only on matters of law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This approach will assist the role of the Trade Practices Commission in relation to interstate gas trade. It is recognised that these roles of both the TPC and PSA may be replaced, in due course, by an umbrella body in the form of a general industry competition authority established following consideration of the Hilmer Report.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government considers that any delay in proceeding with the statutory requirements for interstate pipeline operations as set out in this bill on the grounds that the Hilmer Report has to be considered, and an approach agreed with the States, cannot be justified.

        State/Industry Attitudes

        Details of the framework embodied in this legislation have been forwarded to State and Territory Governments, industry and gas users for comment. Major gas users, represented by the Electricity Supply Association of Australia Limited and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, strongly support establishment of transparent mechanisms and a regulatory framework to ensure recognition of the needs of all gas users.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the other hand, gas industry associations, representing producers, distributors and transporters, have stated a clear preference to rely on the industry's voluntary Code of Practice for Access to Inter-State Natural Gas Transmission Pipelines as the basis for an industry self-regulatory system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I commend the industry for developing a Code of Practice and believe that this will be of considerable benefit in encouraging sound and effective industry practices.

        "While the Code is an important contribution to the development of open access regimes, it does not provide any legally enforceable rights; it provides for a "right to negotiate" rather than a "right to access"; does not give guidance on pricing principles; and has no binding resolution mechanism.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Trade Practices Commission also considers the industry's Code to be not adequate to properly address the competition issues arising from interstate gas transmission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, the Code in its present form is not supported by gas users. The Government is therefore of the view that the statutory requirements of this bill will act to complement the thrust of the industry's Code of Practice and bring the certainty that pipeline operators and users will require in future.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some States have suggested that the legislation should await the implementation of the Hilmer Report. To await full implementation of the Government's response to Hilmer's findings would unnecessarily delay the implementation of a national legislated right of access to interstate pipelines where a clear public interest existsâ€”concepts clearly endorsed by the Hilmer Report. It would also unnecessarily delay the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reforms and legislation that have been introduced today will facilitate a competition policy environment which is fully consistent with the objectives outlined in the Hilmer Report and will lay a sound framework for the efficient development and interstate delivery of Australia's gas reserves.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Office of the Supervising Scientist, which includes the Alligator Rivers  Region Research Institute, was established by the Commonwealth in 1978, following the Fox Inquiry into uranium mining. The purpose of the office is to provide assurance to the Australian people that the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory is not being adversely affected by uranium mining. The Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute has now carried out research on the impact of mining on the environment in the Region for fifteen years and uranium mining operations have been underway for thirteen years. In this time much background data has been accumulated and the operation of the Ranger mine has been relatively trouble-free.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the continuing public sensitivity to uranium mining issues, the need to ensure satisfactory rehabilitation of mine sites, the special significance of the Kakadu region and the Commonwealth's undertakings to the Northern Land Council and traditional Aboriginal owners, the Government believes that a continuing Commonwealth role is essential. Nonetheless, after fifteen years there is room for adjustment without jeopardising environmental protection.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has decided to streamline and refocus Commonwealth arrangements. The decision was made following discussions between senior officers from Commonwealth departments with the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Land Council and representatives of industry. I stress that following these changes there will be no diminution of environmental protection in the Region. This is of paramount importance to the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regulation of mining operations will continue to be with the Northern Territory Government and working arrangements are to be improved following consultations with the Northern Territory Government.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The essence of the changes is:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Implementation of some of these changes requires amendment of the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act and this is the purpose of the bill before you.

        The Government has been working for some time towards strengthening its environmental management capabilities by consolidating various related organisational components. With this in mind, in 1992 the Supervising Scientist's head office was moved from Sydney to be co-located with the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency in Canberra. Complete incorporation of the office into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency will lead to direct and indirect savings in the order of $650 000 per annum from 1994-95 onwards.
       </para>

        Because of the integration of the office into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, there will be no further need for the Supervising Scientist to have the powers of a Departmental Secretary under the Public Service Act 1922 and the relevant section is repealed by this bill. The Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region will continue to be a statutory position with similar duties, powers and functions, but will now be an office in the Commonwealth Public Service and subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act in relation to remuneration and other conditions of service. The Supervising Scientist will continue to manage the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly it is proposed to amend the Act to enable the Minister to draw on the considerable knowledge in the Office of the Supervising Scientist to advise the Government on environmental matters outside the Alligator Rivers Region. I stress that it is not the purpose of this proposal to promote uranium mining development, either in Australia or overseas, but to enhance the quality and scope of specialist environmental advice available to the Government.

        While the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute will continue to provide the research basis in relation to the impacts of uranium mining in the Region, it will also be empowered to undertake scientific research on environmental matters outside the Region on a fee-for-service basis. By undertaking contract research, the Institute could earn up to 30 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution to its research program. Thus the Institute will be able to contribute more efficiently to the national research effort by making its considerable expertise available to others, while at the same time strengthening its own capacity for research.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will also establish improved arrangements for consulting with key stakeholders and scientific and technical experts. The Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region will be replaced by two linked committees, the Consultative Committee and the Technical Committee.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Consultative Committee will comprise the Minister's appointees drawn from key stakeholders, including Aboriginal and environment groups and an independent chair. It will provide a formal forum for policy consultation on matters relating to the effects on the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of uranium mining in the Region, as well as commenting on, but not changing, recommendations to the Minister from the Technical Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Technical Committee will advise the Minister on the continuing nature and extent of research needed as a basis for maintaining a satisfactory level of protection in the Region and on the most appropriate organisations (including the Research Institute) to carry out the recommended research. The Technical Committee will have expert representation from the Research Institute, Northern Territory authorities, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Northern Land Council and the mining companies. The chairperson and members will be selected by the Minister.

        In summary, the bill before you will provide for a more up-to-date, focused and integrated approach to protecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region.

        The proposed amendments of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will enable the Australian Industrial Registry to act as registry for state industrial bodies, including state industrial relations tribunals, industrial courts and workers' compensation tribunals.  This measure complements steps which have already been taken in South Australia to co-locate the state and federal industrial registries. The proposed amendments will enable integration of the state and federal industrial registries to take place in any state where the federal minister and the appropriate state authority agree. In other words, the Commonwealth will not be able to impose integration on any state that does not want it.

The amendments also give the heads of the five parliamentary departments certain powers and functions in relation to the administration of maternity leave in their departments.

The amendments will enable the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory provisions to the Remuneration Tribunal. The tribunal will be required to conduct a hearing into the matter and, if it is satisfied that a provision is discriminatory, to take action to remove the discrimination. The process will be initiated by complaints to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will have a discretion not to act upon complaints which, in the opinion of the commissioner, are frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.

        In addition, the Remuneration Tribunal Act is to be amended to require the tribunal, when determining the remuneration of executives of government business enterprises, to take into account the superannuation entitlements of those executives. The Remuneration Tribunal Act is also to be amended to change the title of the "chairman" of the Remuneration Tribunal, adopting the gender neutral title "president".

        The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving workers' compensation benefits retires and becomes entitled to superannuation benefits. The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The scheme will only operate if Comcare or the relevant licensed authority seeks to recover an overpayment before the retired employee receives his or her first superannuation benefit payment. Other safeguards have been designed to minimise the scheme's impact on superannuation fund administrators and individual employees. In particular, I note that a determination that an amount of compensation has been overpaid and is to be recovered under the proposed scheme will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Since 1989 the department has been charging fees, on a partial cost-recovery basis, to applicants for trade skills assessment under the act. The fees were imposed administratively and the department was recently advised that there is no statutory authority for them. The collection of fees ceased pending the coming into effect of the necessary legislation.

        ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (SEA DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1993
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Government is committed to the protection of the Australian marine environment and has pursued the implementation of this policy on both the national and international fronts by participating in consultations aimed at producing agreed measures for the prevention and control of marine pollution.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this bill is to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 so as to enable Australia to ratify the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping, which is commonly referred to as the SPREP Dumping Protocol. This protocol is one of two protocols to the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, otherwise known as the SPREP Convention. Australia has already ratified the other Protocol concerning Co-operation in Combating Pollution Emergencies in the South Pacific Region.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The SPREP Convention  was ratified by Australia on 19 July 1989. It is a comprehensive, umbrella agreement for the protection, management and development of the marine and coastal environment of the South Pacific Region. It lists the sources of pollution which require control, such as pollution from ships, dumping, land-based sources, atmospheric discharges, among many others. The SPREP Dumping Protocol recognises the danger posed to the marine environment by pollution caused by the dumping of waste or other matter at sea, and places obligations on parties to prevent, reduce and control pollution in the Protocol Area by dumping.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The SPREP Dumping Protocol is essentially a regional agreement consistent with the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, also known as the London Convention 1972. Australia fulfils its international obligations under the London Convention 1972 through the Sea Dumping Act, which came into effect on 6 March 1984. As a great majority of the obligations under the SPREP Dumping Protocol are met by the provisions of the Sea Dumping Act, it is expedient that Australia join its Pacific Island neighbours in this regional agreement by amending the Sea Dumping Act. Also, the major overlap with the provisions of the existing Act means that the financial implications of ratifying the SPREP Dumping Protocol will be minimal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, there are some aspects of the SPREP Dumping Protocol which impose slightly different requirements from arrangements currently in place under the Sea Dumping Act. The major difference is that the SPREP Dumping Protocol covers a geographical area which is different from the definition of "Australian waters" in the Sea Dumping Act. However, there is no legal reason why Australia cannot choose to apply the additional requirements of the SPREP Dumping Protocol in waters to which the Sea Dumping Act applies. The practical effect of applying the SPREP Dumping Protocol to all Australian waters and the continental shelf is that it will be an offence to dump organophosphorous compounds in the Indian and Southern Oceans as well as the SPREP Convention area. Consequently, as Tasmania currently has the rollback provisions under section 9 of the Sea Dumping Act which allows it to administer the loading and dumping of wastes or other matter in its coastal waters, the Tasmanian Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1987  will need to be amended within 12 months to reflect the additional requirement of the SPREP Dumping Protocol. The necessary action is underway.

         The sale of CSL Limited is an important part of the Government's micro-economic reform program.

        CSL was established by the Australian Government in 1916 to help meet the pharmaceutical needs of an isolated nation then at war.

        The Government took a decision as part of the 1992-93 Federal Budget to sell all of its shares in CSL. After a detailed "scoping study" of the various sale options open to it, the Government announced in November 1992 that the sale would proceed on the basis of an initial public offering of the whole of the Government's 100% shareholding. The flotation will occur in the second half of this financial year, depending upon market conditions and sale preparations.

        preference for individuals and institutions over corporate shareholders.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This share allocation strategy aims to achieve a broad spread of shareholdings at the time of float which, combined with market based incentives, should ensure an independent CSL into the future.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Continued supply of plasma products post sale will be covered by a long term contract between CSL and the Commonwealth. Supply of these products is a key national interest issue.

        There is also a prohibition on CSL disposing of, encumbering or granting any interest in the plasma products facility at Broadmeadows without the Commonwealth's consent.

While there are two women members of the committee, Senator Lees of the Australian Democrats and me, the imbalance has just increasedâ€”unless the major parties take advantage of this opportunity to make sure that they have women represented amongst the  contingents they provide from their parties.

          There is a particular reason why this matter may be extremely useful to the committee: the committee has received a reference from the Senate regarding women, elections and parliament, with particular reference to, firstly, the reasons for the gender imbalance in the Australian parliament, secondly, strategies for increasing the number and effectiveness of women in political and electoral processes, and, thirdly, the effect of parliamentary procedures and practices on women's aspirations to and participation in the Australian parliament.

          I believe that the argument may be extended that to have more than two women out of 12 may not reflect the representation of women in parliament.

But the Greens, as a rule, take as an indication of the health of their organisation that 50 per cent of their candidates are men and 50 per cent are women. That is not contrived. It happens because we have a very healthy organisation which does reflect the broader community. That is what I wish to see in the parliament and on this committee as well. I therefore urge women members of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party, in particular, not to let this opportunity for better representation of women on the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters slip by without their taking advantage of it.

          â€”I see that Senator Kernot is in the chamber. I think it is time we brought this matter to a head. I have been trying to come to a conclusion with the Australian Democrats on the situation for quite some time regarding some support for this motion. This motion relates entirely to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and its accountability. I have been branded as a racist by some people over this motion, in a situation where they think that I am attacking ATSIC and the Aboriginal people, and attacking the funding that goes to them. I have never ever done anything along these lines. I have simply asked for accountability. I really started with the Auditor-General's report. Ever since, I have had messages of support from right around Australia, which I have referred to before.

          In relation to my dealings with the Democrats, Senator Kernot will know that I had agreed, at her request, to move an amendment, and that amendment was to restrict this inquiry to Western Australia. I had the amendment printed; I did not have it circulated; the amendment was at their request. I had promise of support on a Thursday about four weeks ago, if I remember rightly. By the next Tuesday that support was not quite so strong. Then it was suggested to me that we refer the matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs which I believe may have been a way to go.

          Unfortunately, there is no wayâ€”or no-one has told me if there is a wayâ€”of referring any matter from this Senate down to the House of Representatives. I spoke to the chairman or one of the members of that committee, whose name escapes me. He said he would be willing to take it on but, unfortunately, the minister there sets the terms of reference. I believe this is an important issue that should be addressed on its own, not buried with something else. It is about the accountability, and accountability alone, of ATSIC; also the Aboriginal Legal Service. So I said I was happy to keep this reference in Western Australia: the Aboriginal Legal Service and ATSIC funded bodiesâ€”especially ATSIC funded bodies.

          There is another ATSIC related corporation in Wyndham in Western Australia into which ATSIC poured a vast amount of money but still could not keep it afloat. If ATSIC wanted to pour money especially into that one in Wyndham, that was its decision. I am concerned about accountability. The money was poured in and the corporation was kept afloat, so the local traders presumed that its standing was on a pretty even keel. Unfortunately, because it was kept going by ATSIC, more and more credit was given to it by the local traders, who presumed they were on safe ground. To my knowledge, the corporation has not been put into liquidation officially, but the traders have been left high and dry for whatever they had supplied over the last couple of years.

          In a normal situation when a corporation gets into difficulties, there are very stringent laws. A corporation cannot trade after it becomes technically insolvent. In other words, if it owes more than it is worth, even though it is trading pretty well at that stage, it cannot continue trading. In this case in Wyndham in Western Australia, to my knowledge, the corporation has kept trading far beyond the time it ceased to be viable. So it has bought more and more people in. That is the situation, and it is time we got to the bottom of it. It is not only happening there; it is also happening in Victoria.

          The other part of my concern is the Aboriginal Legal Service, especially in Western Australia. Some people on our side of politics in Western Australia have been trying for the past two years to get an inquiry into the ALS. Mr Eric Charlton, the Western Australian transport minister, who is a member of National Party of Australia, has been trying to get an inquiry for two or three years, but one cannot find out what is going on with the ALS money.

I wonder whether anyone in this chamber can tell me that that is a legitimate way in which to spend ALS funds. If so, I would ask them to please speak up. It is time we got to the bottom of that sort of thing. It has been going on all the time, and we have been spending around $1.3 billion on ATSIC's budget.

I visited Warburton once on the same day as Senator Beahan. That community has been going reasonably well because it had been hauled out of a very bad situation by a manager who was appointed 10 years ago. He is very dedicated and he is doing a very good job.

There is quite a good one that I have visited in the Northern Territory at Docker River. That is run very well. But then there are the others, especially on the Strelley leases in Western Australia, where money has been wasted. On the Strelley leases, in the last two years $1.7 million has been paid in, yet the place has been abandoned and buildings have been wrecked and left to rack and ruin. I am looking at accountability to see what is going on in this situation. That is why I had asked the Democrats and the Green senators from Western Australia for support, but they refused flatly to support me.

It is certainly time they did that. As I said, I had support from the Democrats in the beginning, when I agreed that, in the short time there was, this would be restricted to Western Australia. We were not able to reach the matter by 10.30 on the Thursday night; after the weekend, by the next Tuesday, their approach was lukewarm. It has been sidelined to go down to the House of Representatives committee. I have looked into that, in depth, and I cannot see that an inquiry like that would be sufficient.

          I have also had it put to me that starting an inquiry now will interfere with the ATSIC elections coming up in December, and that I might have even worked with people towards that situation. That is something that I definitely did not do. I have had enough of seeing non-accountability for this budget and that is why I have progressed down this path. I reiterate that a lot of this $1.3 billion is being wasted. Everywhere I go I see declining health. Someone told me that he had been to a community where four young children had died because of the lack of health services, and that the doctors and nurses were overworked. Housing is going backwards. Also, $12 million of the budget was returned to the Commonwealth because it was unused. This is totally out of order. It is time that this matter was put to rest. I leave it at that.

          â€”by leaveâ€”I need to clarify a few of the things that Senator Panizza has said. It is true that this matter has been the subject of constant negotiation. The Australian Democrats have no desire to shield any statutory authority from public scrutiny and we have no desire to treat ATSIC any differently from any other organisation. However, I think there are a couple of other facts that we ought to take into account.

          When I persuaded Senator Panizza to confine the terms of reference to Western Australia, and to give specific focus to the Auditor-General's report, that was in the spirit of improving the scope of the inquiry and it was acceptable to Senator Panizza and to the Democrats. Subsequent to that, I discovered that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is required to look at all Auditor-General reports that deal with anything relating to Aboriginal affairs. Therefore, the matter that Senator Panizza has brought up as a term of reference is already to be investigated by the House of Representatives standing committee. I am not sure that insisting that finance and public administration persist with this inquiry is not duplicating something that already exists.

          The next thing I did was speak to the chair of that committee, Mr Garrie Gibson, and ask him whether there was any way in which he could take over the thrust of the terms of reference. He agreed that his committee would look at the details. He cannot take over the terms of reference word for word and the Senate cannot require that the House of Representatives committee do so. Because his committee is about to visit Western Australia, and because there are coalition members on that committee who can pursue Senator Panizza's questions, it seemed to me that we were being asked to agree to the expensive duplication of an inquiry. I do not think we should do that. My last suggestion to Senator Panizza was that we simply put down notice of a motionâ€”drawing attention to his terms of referenceâ€”and request that the House of Representatives committee consider the issues raised in that notice of motion.

We can achieve the same purpose by letting the House of Representatives standing committee continue with its inquiry and pursue this matter there.

But we also have to be realistic enough to know that we are in the first stages of an ATSIC election campaign. The election will be held in December. I do not think it is right for us to let any individuals seek to use the processes of the Senate to assist them as candidates in an election campaign.

I think it would be important under those circumstances to see what the House of Representatives committee does. Members of the House of Representatives actually have more time than we have. As honourable senators would know, last night they drew stumps quite early, did they not?

          â€”I acknowledge what Senator Woodley has said. Quite seriously, we should see whether they are going to give some priority to the matters that Senator Panizza has proposed. If they do not, let us come back to this matter so that it can be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I urge Senator Panizza, who moved the motion, not to press it today, to leave it on the table and see what happens. Then we will be able to revisit it. I make that appeal to Senator Panizza at this time. If members of the House of Representatives do not undertake the task properly, to the satisfaction of Senator Panizza, I am sure he will press the issue very strongly, and that will be a different circumstance.

          â€”by leaveâ€”Senator Panizza made it clear that he would have preferred to accept the option put by Senator Harradine and adjourn the debate. If we are advised that procedurally that is now impossible because the debate technically has been closed, so be it, and the matter will proceed to a vote. Nevertheless, I think it is important that Senator Panizza's preference is on the record, as it now is. In fact, it remains open to Senator Panizza to move a similar motion in due course, depending on how matters evolve pursuant to the contribution of Senator Harradine. If it is too late for us to adjourn the debate, we will not adjourn it, but Senator Panizza will remain seized of the matter, no doubt. Depending on what happens in the future, he may well bring the issue back to the Senate again.

        Following the Treasurer's statement entitled Strengthening Super Securityâ€”New Prudential Arrangements for Superannuation, seven Bills were introduced into Parliament on 27 May 1993. These were designed to strengthen substantially the framework of prudential supervision for the superannuation industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the terms of reference for the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was to report on this legislation and related matters.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fundamental objective of these Bills is to introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for the superannuation industry. Such a regime is required for three main reasons:

        The Superannuation Industry Supervision, (SIS) Bills as they are known, represent the most detailed and far reaching attempt in the history of superannuation in Australia to impose a common regulatory framework on the superannuation industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The importance of such an undertaking is highlighted by the sheer size and complexity of the superannuation industry. Currently, superannuation savings in Australia amount to $169 billion, which is equivalent to about one third of Australia's gross domestic product (GDP), and are growing at a rate which exceeds even rapid economic growth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The need for a comprehensive regulatory framework is further evidenced by the failure of a number of collective investment schemes, including a small number with a superannuation focus, in the past five years and problems in superannuation regulation in overseas countries which also have trustee administration of pension funds. These themes have been addressed repeatedly by the Select Committee on Superannuation during its two year inquiry.

        Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) Bill 1993
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The SIS Bill is the central plank of the new policy platform. It contains provisions which will radically alter the way that superannuation funds operate. Given the magnitude of the proposed change it was not surprising that the Committee received a large number of submissions, 97 in all, and agreed to take evidence from more than 60 witnesses representing the interests of superannuation providers, regulators and consumers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the SIS regime all superannuation savings will come under the control and supervision of the prime regulator, the ISC.  All superannuation funds will be managed by a single entity, the trustee body. The trustee body is required to make an irrevocable election to be regulated under the aegis of either the corporations or the pensions powers of the Constitution. All public offer superannuation funds, formerly regulated by the ASC, will also move to single entity status. Previously they were managed under a dual entity arrangement whereby control was shared by the trustee and the funds manager.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In taking note of the enormity of change in the public offer funds area, the Committee has expressed a concern that transitional arrangements may result in some uncertainty which has the potential to affect the fortunes of more than 200 000 unit holders of ADFs valued at least $14 billion. Accordingly, in the interests of promoting certainty and stability within the superannuation industry, the Committee has recommended that funds managers and trustees be accorded at least equal status during the transition process. This will be achieved by providing both trustees and fund managers with equal rights to request the other's termination of appointment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The most emotive and controversial aspect of the SIS legislation concerns clause 64, formerly clause 62, which prohibits superannuation funds from acquiring assets from members or members' relatives. In the course of its hearings, the Committee heard detailed accounts of abuse of the tax benefits afforded to superannuation funds. The Committee has noted arguments both for and against clause 64 and has recommended that clause 64 contain certain limited exemptions which will be accompanied by an increase in the powers of the sole purpose test. This will provide the Government with certain checks and balances to protect against the abuse of the concessional tax treatment afforded to superannuation funds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A further deterrent for potential clause 64 offenders is the custodial penalty that is attached to the offence. Although the Committee agrees that in some circumstances a gaol sentence will be appropriate, it is concerned that in other circumstances this could be too harsh. For this reason the Committee has recommended that the penalty for an offence under section 64(3) be amended to be a maximum of twelve months imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee has examined in detail the provisions concerning the role of auditors and actuaries. Taking into account the critical role auditors will play in determining whether there have been breaches of the SIS legislation, the Committee has recommended that the Government countenance having set terms of appointment for auditors of superannuation funds and that consideration be given to the development of a register of auditors. The Committee has stressed that superannuation fund audits should be conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another major issue arising from the SIS Bills concerned their application to State and Territory superannuation schemes. The States and Territories raised concerns regarding the imposition by the Commonwealth on their own superannuation schemes which are already the subject of legislation and are required to undergo audits by state Auditors-General. In light of these views the Prime Minister has written to the States and Territories recommending that State and Territory superannuation schemes be exempted from the SIS legislation. The Committee understands that the states will work towards harmonising their prudential arrangements so that they are consistent with the SIS provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee has also recommended that certain amendments of a technical nature be made in the following areas:

        Superannuation Industry (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the course of its on-going inquiry into superannuation the Committee identified a number of issues of particular interest to consumers where reform is required. These issues are of interest not only to consumers but also to those in the industry who seek to provide a high standard of service to their clients. Of paramount importance in this area, is the establishment, and effective operation, of the proposed Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee noted in its first report that the predominant view was that there was a need for the establishment of an independent dispute resolution bodyâ€”something that would provide an alternative to the court system. The Committee is pleased to be able to support this legislation that establishes such a body.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This body, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, will review decisions of trustees that have been the subject of a complaint, and have not been resolved by the trustees' internal dispute resolution mechanism.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Treasurer has indicated that the review of some decisions will be excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction. These `excluded complaints' will include cases involving disability issues. The Committee has recommended that cases involving disability issues should not be automatically excluded. Rather, so-called disability cases, where the complaint essentially involves a procedural matter and cases that involve questions of legal interpretation should fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It is envisaged that in procedural matters the Tribunal will use its power to remit matters with directions to the trustees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to achieve a structure that provides a true alternative to the court system, the legislation, as a rule, does not permit legal representation before the Tribunal, although there is a discretion to do so.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee received submissions concerned about this provision and gave the issue considerable examination. The Committee was concerned to ensure that there was an appropriate balance between the objective of a fair, economical, informal and quick dispute resolution mechanism, and the necessity that consumers have access to appropriate assistance and advice in the preparation of their matters before the Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For this reason the Committee was particularly attracted to the concept submitted by the Consumer Credit Legal Service of Victoria  and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre of New South Wales. They suggested that an independent consumer advisory service, whether legal or multi-disciplinary, be established.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The roles of such a superannuation advisory service would include helping consumers to understand how to go about making their complaints; helping them to determine whether or not they have a legitimate complaint; and helping them to prepare the documents, the arguments and the proofs relevant to their case. The service would also play a role in the `macro' picture. By obtaining statistics and complaint data and by negotiating complaints, the service would be in a position to negotiate with industry and government in relation to changes in practice and policy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although the ISC secretariat is required by the legislation to provide assistance to complainants the Committee believes that it is important that there be an advisory service that is independent of the ISC. The Committee foresees a community advisory service playing a vital role in providing complainants with assistance in preparing their matters for review.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee agreed that initially this service should be funded by way of grants by the Commonwealth. In the longer term the Committee believes that consideration should be given to having the superannuation industry assist with the funding of the service.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee convened public hearings on these bills in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. In addition, thanks to the cooperation of the Government, informal meetings were arranged between the committee members and officers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission at which amendments to improve the legislation were discussed.  Most of the amendments in the report have the in principle agreement of the ISC.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        By virtue of its length and attention to detail this report will assist Senators in understanding the parameters of the new superannuation regulatory regime. I believe that, between the efforts of the Government in developing this package and the work of the Committee in acting as a sounding board for the superannuation industry, which includes consumers and providers, to ensure that the proposed law is good law, we now have the right policy mix.

        I commend the report to the Senate and in so doing I thank Committee members, Senators Sue West, Bruce Childs, Christopher Evans, Alan Ferguson, Cheryl Kernot, and the secretariat staff, Richard Gilbert, Krista Gerrard, Glenn Hunter and Cath Drinkwater, for their work in developing a comprehensive report on such complex and far reaching legislation.

         â€”The package of eight bills before us will reshape the wool industry along the lines recommended by the Wool Industry Review Committee, known as the Garnaut committee. The aim is to reduce to two the number of bodies dealing with woolâ€”one for promotion, research and development and the other to pay off the debt and reduce the stockpile by selling a predetermined amount of wool. When the debt is less than the value of the stockpileâ€”hopefully by mid-1997â€”the latter body, called Wool International, will be privatised and owned by the very people who paid the debt taxes.

         A glance at the history of the wool industry reserve price scheme reveals that it operated for some 20 years before encountering a combination of difficulties in the early 1990s. These difficulties can be traced back to the 1980s, when prices for wool at auction increased dramatically, peaking at around 1,100c per kilogram. The reserve price, instead of being synchronised with the long-term price trend, was increased by about 60 per cent over two years to 870c a kilogram, where it remained for two seasons.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This increase effectively converted the reserve price scheme into a price setter and altered the price ratio of wool relative to other fibres. Instead of wool being around its historical price levelâ€”three times as dear as cottonâ€”it became six times as dear as cotton, causing trade to shift to other fibres. Unfortunately, this shift coincided with the start of the world recession and the break-up of the old Soviet Union.

         Figures show that in 1950-51 the total world production of fibres was around 10,332 million kilograms, with wool holding around 10 per cent of the market; man-made fibres, 16 per cent; and cotton, 74 per cent. By 1991-92, the total world fibre production was 39,151 million kilograms, with wool accounting for just 4.4 per cent; man-made fibres, 45.1 per cent; and cotton, 50.5 per cent. The floor price for wool meant that it was the most profitable farming enterprise with a guaranteed return and, as a result, many grain and beef farmers started running sheep.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Production rose rapidly, from 700 million kilograms in the late 1970s and early 1980s to 1,100 million kilograms in 1989-90, when 5.7 million bales were offered for auction. The Australian Wool Corporation bought almost three million bales, or 52 per cent of the clip, that year. In 1990-91, production was 1,066 million kilograms, with 5.4 million bales offered for auction, and the AWC bought almost two million bales, or 35 per cent of the clip. The federal government moved to lower the floor price to 700c in 1990 and by February 1991 had scrapped it altogether.

         For equity reasons, the government continued to assist growers who had to sell their wool for that season. The cost to the federal government was $300 million. By that time, not only had the Australian Wool Corporation spent the $1.8 billion of growers' money it had in reserve but it had also borrowed $2.9 billion. The stockpile reached 4.5 million bales.

         The federal government then formed the Australian Wool Realisation Commission to handle the disposal of the stockpile and to pay off the debt. It was determined that woolgrowers, although being required to pay off the debt, would cede ownership of the stockpile to the commission. The government established also a research and development corporation and the separate Wool Corporation to handle promotion and quality control. AWC stocks were frozen for the remainder of the 1990-91 season, with the exception of some long-term contracts and processed wool in stocks overseas. The government also gave the AWRC $22.5 million a year for two years to prevent it from having to hold a fire sale of its non-wool assets. A seven-year fixed repayment schedule was established. The schedule, which provided for annual payments ranging from $20 million in 1991-92 to $559 million in 1997-98, aimed to clear the outstanding debt.

         The system worked well for the first 12 months, putting the commission ahead of schedule. However, a significant decline in prices over the following 12 months led to renewed speculation about a fire sale. The federal government tried to overcome the problem by adding a year to the fixed disposal schedule and declaring that nothing had to be repaid this financial year. The debt is now $2.2 billion, the stockpile is 3.9 million bales, and production, estimated at 690 million kilograms, is still falling.

         In order to quash continued fire sale speculationâ€”and encourage the market to forward buyâ€”this legislation adopts the Garnaut committee's suggestion of a fixed disposal schedule, rather than a fixed debt reduction schedule. The legislation also provides for fewer statutory bodies by combining the AWC and the AWRDC into one body called the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, and abolishing the Wool Industry Council.

         AWRAP will be responsible for the allocation of research and development funds and generic promotion, while other functions will go to industry or government or be abandoned. The organisation will be encouraged to seek partnerships with commercial research and development ventures and to commercialise results as quickly as possible so that industry can obtain royalties, patents and other benefits to help fund further research. The $20 million given by the government this year for wool promotion runs out on 30 June. The minister has already said that the government will not provide further funds.

         The International Wool Textile Organisation said that it was prepared to put in $100 million for generic promotion, but has since reneged because the government and, indeed, the coalition are not prepared to introduce a wool export tax. Such a tax would end up being paid by growers rather than processors. However, if the wool industry is to get out of this mess it must sell its stockpile, and promotion is desperately needed to help with this task. The government should look again at funding promotion.

         The other major body to be set up under this legislation is Wool International, which will manage the sale of the stockpile and the payment of debt. Initially, it will be a statutory body. Legal advice is that, under company law, if the debt exceeds the current value of assets the directors are obliged to call in a liquidator. Eventually, Wool International will be corporatised and then privatised by issuing shares to the people who have paid the 4.5 per cent wool tax since July 1993. The target privatisation date, pending legislation, is July 1997.

         Wool International's immediate task is to develop risk management tools, such as futures markets, wool bonds and options, as well as introduce total quality management programs. Apparently the minister plans to establish Wool International as soon as legislation is passed to allow it to take over from the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. This will allow more time to develop forward selling and risk management tools and ensure that it is ready to start the fixed disposal of the stockpile from 1 July 1994.

         The Garnaut committee considered six options for dealing with the stockpile and found that the long-term demand for wool would improve if at least half the stockpile were sold off rather than destroyed. The rationale is that Australia will find new customers and new uses for wool and thereby increase wool's total share of the world apparel market.

The amendments included the creation of selection committees to nominate persons suitable for ministerial appointment to the boards of Wool International and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, with the Wool Council nominating one member for each selection committee. Previously the minister was to appoint all board members. The amendments also included the retention of provisions allowing the Commonwealth to contribute money for wool promotion. Originally these were to have been phased out. The amendments also include calling on AWRAP, which is wholly funded by grower levies, to consult with the Wool Council of Australia regarding its operations, and extending the deadline for AWRAP to divest its quality management functions by one year to 1 January 1996.

         Finally, I would like to reflect on the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs Committee, which last week heard views from various people in government and industry ranging from selling the stockpile for 150c a kilogram to wanting none of the stockpile sold unless it made 600c a kilogram. Economist Mr Henry Haszler told the committee that wool used in insulation batts had sold at $1.50 a kilogram and that such alternatives were, in his words, `worth considering' in relation to the stockpile. By contrast, Mr Gregory Walcott of the Balmoral branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation argued that the break-even price for growers was about 600c. His counterpart, Mr Allan Small, also expressed concern about the level of wool debt and advocated that the government and industry take on, in their words, `combined responsibility'. Perhaps Professor Ross Garnaut best summed up the situation when he told the committee:

         â€”The Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 and associated bills are to give effect to the popularly known Garnaut report. The Australian Democrats want to put on record their recognition of the amount of work that has gone into this and the dire situation that faces the wool industry unless quite radical measures are introduced as soon as possible. I refer to the Senate committee inquiry held last Friday and commend to honourable senators the report that came out of that committee as being very well worth reading. It gives a very good summary of the concerns raised at that inquiry. The report is worthwhile reading for anyone interested in primary industry and the wool industry in particular.

Already, conversations with the Wool Council and the coalition, with our support, have resulted in amendments which I believe improve the bill. Two further amendments which I will move at a later date will improve the legislation even further, and I seek the support of the Senate for those. Parliamentarians of all political persuasions are committed to getting the industry back on its feet, and certainly the Democrats are. The plight of the industry is well known. In the first speech I made in this parliament, I detailed some of my personal contacts and the agony I experienced listening to people's stories.

         The Garnaut report suggests a price improvement in the long term. Our real concerns are that as rural communities we are fighting to survive in the short term.

I am sure that I do not speak just for our woolgrowing community in that regard.

         Let me turn now to some of the specific issues. In terms of the fixed release schedule, we support its general thrust but we still have some questions, and these were underlined by the evidence given in that Senate committee inquiry. The question we still ask is whether it is good commercial practice to determine months and even years ahead how much of the stockpile we are prepared to sell. Professor Garnaut and others believe that it is necessary to regulate the market in order to give it certainty. Others raise the problem of applying mathematical formulas to markets which do not respond to fixed mathematical regulation in this way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a problem with the fixed release schedule. It does not take account of types of wool in the stockpile, and these ought to be in rough proportion to what the market requires. I am reassured by conversations I have had with representatives from the Wool Councilâ€”they have been most helpfulâ€”that they will take on board the concern about the types of wool, as part of the management of Wool International and its management of the stockpile. I note that there is a requirement for Wool International to report monthly to the minister.

         I believe that our amendment strengthens the purpose of the fixed release schedule. It also provides two safety mechanisms. The first is an upper market indicator of 800c, if the market overheats. We know that overheating in the market is not good for market stability and people begin to shift to other fibres because of it. Our proposal would enable Wool International to release more from the stockpile to dampen down the market if this happens. The second safety mechanism, a lower market indicator of 400câ€”we hope the market will never again reach this low figureâ€”will send a signal to the market that Australia will not permit a fire sale of its valuable asset.

         The present decline in production was another concern that was raised. We believe that the legislation needs to send a signal to growers to maintain and lift production. These signals must give confidence to the market, and to growers, so that production will continue. Last year, production was a little over 800 million kilograms. This year, estimated production is around 690 million kilograms or less. It is important that we have signals to secure production, and these must be part of the whole exercise equation.

         We have some concerns about Wool International. The legislation will give effect to the establishment of Wool International as a government instrumentality until the stockpile is under control, and then it will be privatised by issuing shares to growers and others in proportion to the amount of wool tax they pay. We have a concern that, if growers experience liquidity problems, they will sell the shares and that the very good thrust of this legislation, which places control and ownership in the hands of growers, will be lost.

         We believe that, if non-growers begin to purchase the shares in Wool International, control will pass from growers and will be concentrated in, perhaps, transnational agribusiness or in the hands of a few of the very large growers. It seems to us that Garnaut even suggests that this could be desirable. On page 6 of his report he states:

        The Reserve Price Scheme. . . discouraged the emergence of large, integrated multinational companies in the wool industry. The large integrated companies that play a major role in promotion, research and development in the cotton and synthetics industries, have no counterparts in wool.

       <para>
        Professor Garnaut then goes on to decry this. The Democrats do not accept Professor Garnaut's analysis of the desirability of having large integrated multinational companies in the wool industry. Indeed, we believe that the long-term best interests of the wool industry in Australia are assured by the present situation in which the majority of wool growers are family farmers and, therefore, part of the network of Australian small businesses. These concerns are expressed by this industry and other rural industries in Australia.

         Other issues are the buy-back provision for Wool International to cover any shortfall in a fixed schedule period and the provision in the legislation for Wool International to initiate an active futures trade. The Australian Democrats' amendments seek clarification and an assurance from the government that it will cover any trading losses that occur in the trade of wool stocks or futures until Wool International is privatised. It is unrealistic to expect woolgrowers to fund these risky activities as they are being imposed on Wool International by the government and not by the growers themselves.

         A parallel concern is that the 4.5 per cent wool tax has been accepted by growers as a necessary means of servicing the stockpile debt but not to fund risky Wool International activities. It is not too much to suggest that it may be more just to return surplus wool tax to growers than to allow Wool International to use the levy to play with the market. It is the belief of some that a viable futures market will happen when certainty is given to the market and the stockpile is reduced. In conclusion, I assure the Senate that the Democrats support all attempts to bring viability and profitability to the wool industry and to all rural industries. We support the thrust of this legislation. I call on all honourable senators to support our modest amendments.

Even though I agreed with most of what he had to say, because it is evidently the way we have to go following the Garnaut reportâ€”which I support, if not fullyâ€”I believe that he is attempting to go back to something we had in the past. What has been wrong with the situation we have had in the last five years, since that disaster of May 1988 when the decision was taken by the Wool Council to increase the reserve price from 690c to 870c? That was probably the most disastrous decision the wool industry in Australia has made. Unfortunately, it was supported by the minister at the time, Mr Kerin. I note that Mr Kerin spoke on the matter in the House of Representatives but he did not quietly back down or admit the mistake he had made.

         At present we have a stockpile of some four million bales and a debt of roughly $2 billion. What has been driving the price down in these last few months is that we have annual repayments to reduce the debt. That may have seemed in order when we last debated here, but I certainly questioned whether it would work. As we approach that repayment schedule, the pressure is on. The buyers know that we have to sell more assets. Assets can be sold only once. We can sell more wool that is growing on the sheep's backâ€”that keeps coming in, even if it gets less and lessâ€”but once the assets have been sold, they are gone for good.

         The Garnaut report recommends reducing the bodies to one called AWRAP for promotion, research and development, and another oneâ€”Wool Internationalâ€”to take over management of the stockpile. It has already been pointed out that, when the stockpile is removed, that will go private. The shares will be issued according to tax paid by growers between now and 1996 or 1997, or whatever it is. I believe that is a top idea because they are the ones who have to meet the payments and take care of the stockpile. It is fair that they will be issued the shares, because the ones who built up the stockpile between 1988 and 1990 were fringe woolgrowers who came in from the cattle industry and other industries to get on board something that had a fixed price, a bottom price. Now a lot of them have gone.

I am not one of those who believe that in two years time we will not be able to supply all the wool needed. Colleagues such as Mr Sinclair propose that; I normally do not disagree with what he has to say but this time I do. If we cannot supply it because of that fixed schedule of reduction, what a good problem to have. That is something we have to stick to. As I said, we cannot have a back door.

         We have a fixed schedule of reduction by the number of bales. It is 27,000 to 29,000 per month between July 1994 and December 1994, plus or minus five per cent. Of course, they can sell more than that after 1 January 1995, but Wool International has to buy back what is coming off the sheep's back. That has got a side benefit that I have not heard mentioned yet: it freshens up the stockpile. A lot of the stockpile is deteriorating; it has been in store a long time and the steel bands are rusting and staining. If Russia comes in and wants a million bales, it can be bought fresh off the sheep's back. It does help to freshen that up, because I believe that is a problem.

         There are a few things I would like to address quickly. Firstly, we will be helped by increasing our price if we can get the balance between what is going on in the market and the demand. Australia sold 890 million kilograms last year. We have been helped by the fact that Argentina has dropped production from 200 million kilograms to 90 million kilograms annually and South Africa has dropped from 100 to 65. We have been helped in all those areas, and I believe we should stick to this. Some of my colleagues believe we should have a minimum reduction schedule and not a fixed one. We cannot get away from that. I am on record as saying that, and I want to put it on record again.

         I wish to express the worries of the wool industry about the ever rising costs. We did get extra costs put on us in the last budget sitting which, unfortunately, we have to accept. Shearing costs have to be looked at. This year, shearing costs are generally 40 per cent of the clip. I have declared my interest; I am a woolgrower, but in my family I have very little to do with the industry. One thing I do is write out the cheque at the end of shearing. I see the cheques that come in; I bank them when the proceeds of the wool clip come in. I know that 40 per cent is eaten up by that alone, whereas in New Zealand the costs are 33 per cent less. In Australia it costs roughly $3 a head to shear a sheep on full contract; in New Zealand it costs 60 cents. That is for shearing only. The cost is double that. So it can be done in New Zealand for $1.20. There is a vast difference between the two, and we have to look at a way to get that down, but not by cutting shearers' rates. The one lot in Australia who earn their money are the shearers. There are other ways, such as addressing the costs of transport and so on.

         â€”I would like to start my abbreviated contribution to the consideration of this package of wool bills by declaring an interest in the wool industry and by congratulating and thanking John Anderson, on behalf of all growers, on the effort he put into explaining and listening to growers right around Australia. In attending 25 or more grower meetings, and in countless other industry consultations, John Anderson set a standard of commitment to the Australian wool industry for which all of usâ€”politics apartâ€”should be grateful. He will be one of our leading ministers when we win the next election.

         This thanks to John Anderson should also be given to him by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). If the minister had been prepared to explain Garnaut and foster the industry discussion that was necessary, it would have been very much appreciated. As for Garnaut's explanation to woolgrowers, Minister Crean was absent without leave. But I do congratulate the minister on his setting up of the review committee; its members, Ross Garnaut, Rod Price and Stephen Bennett; the general thrust of its reforms; and the speed of change that will flow from the recommendations.

         Every one of the 65,000 woolgrowers out there has the capacity to contribute more to reducing our foreign debt and creating the common wealth of the nation than any government senator. Whilst Australia no longer rides on the sheep's back, it was a much more prosperous country when we did. Having said that, and with the reservations about the wool package, which I will highlight, the time for political and industrial debate is over for the time being.

         These proposals have had over two months of intense industry and academic scrutiny. While there are various views as to how successful the stockpile reduction program will be, almost everybody agreesâ€”from the peak grower body, the Wool Council, downâ€”that the existing debt repayment schedule is not a goer. It is not sustainable, and has to be changed. The time to build up is now in the hands of the industry. At the same time, responsibility for how we descended into this awful crisis remains very much with this Labor government.

         During 1989-90, as highlighted by my colleague Senator Panizza, the reserve price scheme came under extreme pressure for all the reasons well debated over the last four years. I understand the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, was advised that there was no way the reserve price could be reduced from 870c to 700c clean, and the scheme survive. Further, the minister said that the price of 700c clean was immutable. This famous political promise will live forever in the minds of growers and the world wool trade where, until recent times, your word was your bond.

         The world wool trade, at the time, did not understand the concept of a political promise as the Australian Labor Party does. John Kerin, therefore, bears a very great responsibility for the debt, as does the government he served. After all, it is the debt and who will service it that is the problemâ€”not the existence of the stockpile, which remains an asset. Whilst I favour the quantity based disposal schedule, some argue that any quantity to be sold from the stockpile, in any period, should be a minimum amount only, and that flexibility should be provided to allow additional quantities to be quit if market circumstances permit. This is the concern if there is an immediate boom in prices. There could be an indicator price that is going through the roof and there still be 3.5 million bales in the stockpile.

         The opposite view is often taken, funnily enough, by the same peopleâ€”that is that if demand is relatively weak, a fixed quantity disposal will only depress prices further. If the price of wool recovers too quickly, then Wool International can be privatised. Further consider that at a modest current value of $500 a baleâ€”and there are nearly 4 million bales still in the stockpileâ€”the market indicator only has to move a small amount from the current disastrous 470c clean to get past the current $2.2 million debt. So to give the stockpile a real value is only an eye blink away.

         If the price is relatively weak, then the Garnaut proposals fall over. But I do not believe that the price will be weak because of the current fall in physical production. I do not believe that the downside risk is as great as the potential upside, and the most attractive option therefore is to go with Garnaut.

         Even if there were a real and properly argued alternative to Garnaut, it would not stand up because this government will not bail the costs of the stockpile indefinitely. Growers cannot afford the present rate of wool tax so it is impossible for them to contribute more, as is permitted under the existing legislationâ€”up to 15 per cent from the present 8 1/2 per cent that they are paying. I reiterate: the game is up for wool under the existing arrangements. This is the best alternative.

         I see two requirements for Garnautâ€”firstly, from the growers' point of view, an early increase in price so that the industry can survive; and, secondly, from the trade point of view, a stable and steady price. To a large extent, the interests of both growers and processors should converge. Garnaut offers this chance because he offers a type of Clayton's stockpileâ€”a stockpile you do not have when you do have a stockpile. It will allow market forces to be as close as they will be when the stockpile no longer exists. Those signals will be to both the growers and the trade. The amount of wool sold will depend, as always, on production and not on a fixed amount coming out of the stockpile. The `risk management tools' proposed by Garnaut will be an important part of reducing the effect of the release schedule's market influence.

         By allowing a fixed reduction which, as I have said, is fortuitously attached to a substantially reduced physical production, with the threat that the stockpile can be used to fill immediately gaps between supply and demandâ€”there is enough wool in the pile to fill an awful lot of gaps for a long timeâ€”there is little chance of a significant price increase. This will no longer be the case.

         The big change between the start-up scheme of a debt repayment schedule and a stockpile reduction arrangement is this: in 1991 the government said to growers, `You pay off the debt but you will give the ownership of the stockpile to the AWRC'. Professor Garnaut says that, on the balance of probabilities, there will be value in the stockpile if handled the way he proposes. I believe him. It is only fair, therefore, that traditional woolgrowersâ€”the only people still growing wool and therefore carrying the debt of those who have taken their profits in better times and have now left the industryâ€”should have the chance of equity in their stockpile.

         I turn now to some particular concerns about the proposals. Both the Garnaut report and the minister emphasised the need to make the wool industry `demand driven' rather than `supply driven'. However, it is extremely disappointing that a government which so vocally supports a demand driven wool industry has just ceased all government contributions to wool promotion, since this is a vital way the government can assist the industry. While the legislation has been amended in the House of Representatives to allow the Commonwealth to contribute funds for wool promotion, Minister Crean has made it perfectly clear that that will not be done. He says, `Rid me of responsibility for this troublesome beast. Rid me of any responsibility for wool'. This is despite Professor Garnaut having said on promotion:

         I cannot leave promotion without making a personal comment about the vast amount of moneyâ€”over $500 million since the 1980sâ€”spent to promote wool. I wonder how much more successful the promotion would have been if performance based private firms had been given the task. As a woolgrower, I do not feel that I have had value for money. In fact, I feel the opposite. Let us hope that the IWS and other commercial promotions that come out of the AWRAP will be more successful.

         I want to make some quick comments which are of great importance to the debate. An enormous amount of damage has been done to the wool industry and all export industries over the last few years by the sorts of economic circumstances in which the industry has operated. High levels of inflation relative to those of our competitors have pushed costs up at a time when growers have been least able to cope. The stripping out of the indirect taxes, as we proposed in Fightback, was of enormous attraction to growers. The cost savings which New Zealand has accomplishedâ€”as raised by Senator Panizzaâ€”through the implementation of a similar tax regime, has enabled growers there to be substantially more competitive, both in shearing costs, where about $100 million per year would be saved if that regime were implemented here, and in transport costs, which from farm gate to wharf are about two times less than in Australia.

They have gone because of our intolerable industrial relations record and work practices. The best thing he can do for value adding in this country is to clean out the industrial relations system.

This government has presided over some of the most appalling days of the wool industry's history. In the late 1980s, the floor price went from 460c to 870c a kilogram in just three years, at times when not only this government but industry members also participated in knocking the industry from its solid foundations. It does not matter how one looks at the situation, the government has a moral obligation and an economic responsibility to attend to the current crisis within the industry.

         It has not just been the actions of those involved in the industry that have led to its current circumstances. Probably the worst aspect of the gradual destabilisation of the wool industry has been the interest rate regime of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who jacked up interest rates in past years. That was devastating to many industries but in particular to the wool industry, and it caused many of the growers to leave the industry. It has also crippled financially a good many of them for many years to come.

Many countries buy our raw materials simply to give work to their own people. We run the risk of cutting off our markets if we deny them those raw materials.

         The essence of Garnaut and this legislation is to change the management of the stockpile. At present, the stockpile is poorly managed by the commission. Because it has an excess, buyers do not have to buy in bulk and they know that they can return for more at any time. Buyers are reluctant to hold their own stocks or buy well in advance. Last year only 20 million kilograms, or 100,000 bales, were sold. This represents only 1.15 per cent of the world's wool production.

         Professor Garnaut and his colleagues on the inquiry put forward and analysed six options for dealing with the stockpile, but chose out of those options to recommend selling wool according to a fixed quantity schedule. The Garnaut view is that long-term demand for wool will be better placed if half the stockpile is sold, rather than destroyedâ€”as some have suggestedâ€”since new customers and new uses for wool will be found.

         Although some growers, as well as wool brokers and exporters, have reservations about the recommendation for fixed stock disposal, it is the best available optionâ€”25,000 bales a month, commencing next month, until June next year, then 55,000 bales a month from next July to June 1997, disposal being based on the tender process. This will account for 190,000 bales or 38 million kilos of wool, but disposal will be no longer be guided by a fixed repayment schedule. The debt repayment schedule will be abolished and Wool International will establish a wool futures market and improve other means of transfer of wool ownership, such as loans, options and bonds.

         If the Garnaut report recommendations encourage people to invest in forward contracts and futures, and if speculators see that there is money to be made in wool and so invest, the stockpile will eventually dwindle. But there will be no investment if buyers worry that wool will be dumped onto the market just to meet the requirements of the debt repayments schedule. Given that woolgrowers throughout Australia know very little about the detail of what the Garnaut report contains or proposes, it is understandable from the meetings of growers that I have attended at Burra and Naracoorte, in South Australia, that they are concerned about the release system.

In both South Africa and Argentina, our other major competitors in the industry, it is down 35 and 45 per cent respectively. In Australia it is down 69 per cent. If that is the case, wool may be in greater demand than the fixed release from the stockpile will supply before the financial year is out, because the fixed release scheme is based on the fact that the current annual production around the world is down to the point where a fixed release scheme does have a chance of working.

It always hangs over their heads, and it psychologically depresses the market to know the size of this glut. The wool industry cannot afford to return to the old boom and bust era, where the price goes up if supply drops off and consequently no-one buys wool, so production falls and the price falls, ad infinitum.

We are certainly not doing much for the competitiveness of wool against other fibres by adding 5c a litre to the cost of fuel. And shearing currently takes about 40 per cent of growers' returns from wool.

         Does the government honestly believe that the industry can soak up these costs when it is assailed by drought, international depression and recession, and international competition? The government taxes wool producers when it hits the transport industry at three times the rate at which it taxes other industries. Given the disastrous manner in which this government and past Labor governments have dealt with the industry, I can only hope that this package of legislation at long last will assist the industry in a speedy recovery. Therefore, the legislation is worthy of our support.

We understand that the bills are designed to enact the outcome of the Garnaut report and it is my understanding that the Garnaut inquiry was designed to address some of the problems which are being experienced by the wool industry in Australia. The concerns that I express are not so much about what is in the report and, therefore, this series of bills, but what has been left out, either by the limitations of the terms of reference or by the fairly narrow, uncreative response to those terms of reference.

         There are two questions I would like to ask: firstly, is there a wish to create employment in the wool industry; and, secondly, is there a concern about the viability of the industry? Obviously, those have been addressed, but I wonder whether all of the possibilities for either employment or viability have been canvassed in this solution.

         One problem that has not been properly dealt with is the lack of recognition of the local market and value-added production, and regional based solutions to the wool stockpile. Like most people in this chamber, including Senator Chamarette, I have received briefings on the wool industry by the National Farmers Federation, by the Australian Wool Council and by government. I have been approached by a number of people who work in enterprises which use wool, an example being the Weavers Guild in Western Australia. Its members have told me that they find it very difficult to get hold of wool in the quantities they require. When they do get hold of it, it is extremely expensive. I cannot help but wonder why.

         I have been told that it is not viable to sell wool in those quantities. In regard to the potential for highly value-added enterprise, I have been told that the local market is a very small proportion of the total market for wool in Australia. I agree, but I do not agree that that means that we take away the emphasis from promoting what is possibly a viable local market, with the potential for value-added industry and employment creation, for assisting regions where wool is a major industry, and for developing an export industry where exports are a major concern.

         Export industries do not necessarily just develop as export industries. In Australia over the last couple of years, where people have decided to make highly value-added, high quality products from Australian wool, export markets have developed quite quickly. To me, the very narrow focus of selling the clip has overshadowed the fact that promotional funding for the local market means that one is jumping a step. The viability of the industry cannot develop bottom up; perhaps we are looking too much from the top down or looking too much for the big picture rather than looking at the potential for regional approaches which enable a greater spread of employment within the industry.

         The kinds of enterprises that I am talking about also mean employment potential for women and young people within regions. This report has not adequately addressed those kinds of employment opportunities in the wool industry. They are just as important in providing employment. In my opinion and from the figures that I have seen, the industry holds the potential for greater employment than is currently available just through wool growing and concentrating on wool only as an export commodity.

         It has been suggested that, while the stockpile is being privatised, there is no role for government in providing grants for new enterprises which are prepared to create employment in the wool industry. If the actual amount of wool on the local market is not very large, one would welcome the provision of wool grants by government to private industry to encourage new enterprises or enterprises which currently use wool to create employment and new products. The potential for government to encourage enterprise using wool grants, even if they are only temporary grants, is great. I have heard on national radio these kinds of solutions canvassed by women in the industry. It seems that the men are not listening because they feel that the greater picture is what they have to concentrate on and that the smaller picture is not worth looking at. I think that is a mistake. These other creative solutions have to be looked at more seriously and given more time.

         The rangelands that provide ecological support for the wool and cattle industries in Australia comprise approximately 55 per cent of the land mass of our continent. Due to inappropriate management practices on sheep and cattle stations, it is now estimated that more than half of those rangelands are substantially damagedâ€”much of it beyond repair. The destruction of the ecological systems in these areas should be viewed as asset stripping. Any management approach that advocates increasing stocking rates to improve profitability is a very short-term approach and is certainly not sustainable. Unfortunately, in recent times when prices have been high people have increased stocking. When prices are low people increase stocking. Eventually the land cannot take it any more.

        Industry, the environment and government work together. This is important. This is not just a farm issue, an industry issue, an environmental issue or an economic issue. It is the linking of those issues which seems to have been missed in this report and in these bills.

Initially, Wool International will be structured as a statutory body but along commercial lines to reflect its ultimate transformation, first, to a fully government-owned company and then later to a privatised company.

The grower funds, compulsorily levied to fund the stockpile, are to be used to fund Wool International, a trading and financial corporation which is essentially going to compete with the private sector.

        However, the concerns of the NFA include the manner of appointment to the board of the AWRAP, that the provisions for performance of industry functions, including quality assurance, are not accurate, and that fellmongered wool and wool exported on skins have not been included in the collection base for wool tax for promotion. I ask the minister to consider the issues I have raised in this important debate.

         â€”I will be very brief because I think the issues in the bills and the main points behind them have been well covered. I wish to make a few comments in fairly general terms. I do not oppose the legislation; I am part of the organisation that has agreed to accept it. However, I am not keen on it because I do not think the legislation was framed with a view to trying to resolve the problems of the farmers. It was framed to try to get the government off the hook, and it does that satisfactorily. If it takes the government off the hook, there is no alternative than to believe that it puts the industry back on that same hook.

         When I talk about the industry I mean the whole industry, from the people who grow the wool to the people who ultimately wear it. One of the problems we have suffered in Australia for many years is that the group who publicly consider themselves to be the industryâ€”the growing part of itâ€”are not doing justice to the people who look for the customers, do the manufacturing, get the product out, get the best price the market can stand, and so on. Greater consideration has to be given to the fact that we are all in this together. Whether they are fine producers, coarse producers or superfine producers, whether they are in knitwear or growing, whether they are scourers or weavers or shearers or breeders makes no difference. It is one industry from top to bottom, and the success or failure of any one of those sectors impinges on every other sector.

         I believe that this has been one of the great weaknesses. Not long after I came into this place, I spoke on a wool bill and referred to the work being done by the processors. I was invited to the headquarters of the Wool Corporation for lunch. I thought it was very nice of them, as I had spoken on the wool bill only once at that stage. But I was called to the Wool Corporation to get a smack across the knuckles for having dared to give some credit to the wool manufacturers. I was told that Australia did not want or need a wool manufacturing industry; that it was our job to grow the wool and other people's jobs to manufacture it; and that I would be much more help to the industry if I ceased giving support to the processors.

         All that did was encourage me to support the wool processors even more than I had in the past. I have supported them ever since and I will continue to do so while I am here and beyond. I believe that Australia has a tremendous potential. It is commonsense that we should improve our processing sector. We should give every encouragement possible to people who are prepared to add value to this great product. Not enough has been done in the past, and I cannot see that anything in this legislation will do anything to encourage greater on-processing than we have been able to get in the past. We have had these differences between the various sectors blown up in a way that tries to pass the responsibility or the blame from one to the other. Every time we do that, the whole of the wool process from start to finish suffers, and that achieves nothing for anybody.

I have been fortunate to see the processing industry in different parts of the world. I have seen it in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, North America, Taiwan, China, Japan, New Zealand and Australia.

         We do not have any God-given right to produce wool, but we do have an incentive to use it and to see that others use it. However, it has to be demand driven. There has not been nearly enough concentration on seeing that we get the marketing and processing of wool in better shape. Right now we must get more wool into use. There is no point in doing a silly thing like stacking it up in sheds and pretending that it is not there, as we have done in recent years. We have to get it out and get it in use.

I am concerned that the marketers of wool in Australia are not getting their wool close enough, early enough, to where the users are.

         â€”I rise today in the matters of public interest debate to bring to the attention of the Senate a very serious matter in relation to the impact on the Australian pulp and paper industry of imported uncoated wood-free white paper, generally referred to as A4 copy paper. My concern is that it would appear that this product is being imported in a climate which affords unfair advantage to overseas producers and which places an unfair burden on local producers.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The unfair advantage I refer to arises out of a combination of factors. The first of these is that major importing countries such as Indonesia and Brazil benefit in the form of reduced tariffs from their developing country status in the Australian market, when at the same time the tariff is being progressively reduced to only five per cent by 1996. Direct subsidies by overseas governments to the paper making industries to assist exports are coupled with high tariffs protecting their domestic markets from imports, including imports from Australia. They also have less stringent environmental and labour force protection requirements. These factors combine to aggravate deliberate, aggressive marketing strategies, in effect dumping white copy paper in Australia to the detriment of local producers already suffering from the Australian and worldwide economic recession.

         As members of this house are aware, I have long advocated the use of our natural resources in a manner which strives for ecological and economic sustainability and which maximises adding value to our raw resourcesâ€”in this case, quality paper coming from our forests. Although in terms of action there is still a long way to go, it is fair to say that the states, the federal government and the forest based industries have come a considerable way in Australia in recent times in recognising the imperatives and the advantages of an ecologically and economically sustainable approach in the development of a national forest industry.

         In addition to this, as encouraged by the federal government, the pulp and paper making companies have undergone extensive restructuring and rationalisation to become internationally competitive. In the case of APM this was effected by cooperation and negotiation with unions which accepted considerable job losses in the interests of the long-term viability of the industry. APPM unfortunately took a less cooperative path. It is untenable that these gainsâ€”largely at the expense of workers' jobs, but also through workplace reform management practices, multiskilling and improved health and safety resultsâ€”are now being eroded by unfair competition.

         It would appear that due to the combination of factors I have outlined this whole shift to more efficient production, more effective resource use and more environmentally friendly practices is being greatly jeopardised. Over the next few minutes I will expand on these factors one at a time. However, first I would like to bring it to the attention of the Senate that imports of white A4 copy paper have been the subject of a recent dumping inquiry.

         The preliminary finding by the Australian Customs Service was that the Australian industry had suffered material injury caused by dumped imports of A4 copy paper from Brazil, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, South Africa and the USA. Pending final recommendations from the Anti-Dumping Authority, provisional anti-dumping measures were due to be imposed from 16 September 1993. These provisional measures are in the form of penalties to import companies, and are likely to be sufficient to prevent further dumped imports except in the case of Indonesia.

         In the case of Indonesia, there is some concern that the information customs officers were able to collect was insufficient to make an accurate base calculation from which to assess the dumping margin. In addition, there has been considerable lobbying, such that the imposed penalty has been adjusted several times. It has been indicated by the Indonesian government that the penalties will be totally absorbed without changing the selling price. This will lead to a ridiculous situation whereby penalties imposed to overcome dumping actually increase the relative price advantage of one of the offenders. It has been put to me that there is a strong case for the Anti-Dumping Authority to undertake a fresh investigation with respect to Indonesia. I concur with that view.

         I return to the factors that I outlined earlier. I raise in the first instance the matter of developing country preferences. The purpose of this scheme is to provide a margin of preference to internationally classified developing countries in the Australian market. Amendments in February this year removed the developing country preferences for a number of Australian industriesâ€”for example, clothing, textiles and footwear, chemicals et ceteraâ€”in all but the least developed countries. Pulp and paper were not removed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is contended by those who argue that they should be removed, that the pulp and paper industries in countries that benefit from developing country preferencesâ€”in particular, Brazil and Indonesiaâ€”are far from developing industries and by world standards are large, technologically sophisticated, and heavily capital-intensive. They are, in fact, highly competitive by international standards. In 1992, Indonesia accounted for more than 60 per cent of the paper and board production of the South-East Asian region, including Australia. Given that Indonesia and Brazil currently hold a significant share of the Australian uncoated, wood-free paper marketâ€”in the case of A4 copy paper, over 70 per centâ€”I tend to agree that the matter of the pulp and paper industry and developing country preference needs to be urgently reviewed.

         I mentioned earlier that these overseas, large-scale operations enjoy considerable support from their governments in the form of subsidies, export incentives and tariff protection. As an illustration of the disparity on tariff alone, the tariff for A4 cut size copy paper from Indonesia to Australia is seven per cent. As it benefits from developing country preference, it has a 42 per cent cost advantage over other, non-privileged importers. In fact, Indonesia imposes an effective 45 per cent barrier on paper imports. Australia is the only country in the Asian region which has adopted a policy of zero tariffs. If Australian industry is to rise to the challenge that this policy imposes it cannot, at the same time, contend with dumped imports that undermine market share, and thus the ability to make necessary improvements or reinvest in local expansion.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is a serious concern. Not only does this have economic impacts, but I suggest it has grave environmental and social impacts, both within Australia and in the exporting countries. In conditions of unfair competition, as stated, 700 jobs are directly at risk. In addition, many times that number in indirectly related jobs, and jobs from future expansion of the industry, are at risk. In terms of our foreign debt, expansion in this industry is very desirable. In 1991-92, imports of printing and writing paper totalled in excess of 490,000 tonnes with a free on board value of $670 million. The free on board cost excludes freight and insurance costs.

         The continuing dumping of copying paper also has implications for our ability to increase the recycled content of our paper used in Australia. Of further concern is the environmentally damaging harvesting methods of countries such as Indonesia and Brazil. Critics have raised issues such as rainforest removal, social dislocation, loss of native flora and fauna, erosion and water pollution. These practices are coming under some pressure for change, but the less stringent environmental regulations currently afford further cost advantages. Similarly, exploitation of the indigenous work force means that wages are low and conditions are poor. By not acting to ensure paper products are not dumped in Australia, we are not only failing to protect our own economic, social and environmental interests, but failing to perform our international, environmental and social responsibilities as well.

         In conclusion, if we were to take the actions I have outlined, I believe they would remove any remaining excuses that forest based industries have for not investing in paper making facilities in Australia, rather than seeking to expand exporting of woodchips. Instead of unions, environmentalists and large sections of the community opposing a proposed enormous woodchip mill in north-west Tasmania, all of those forces could positively combine to urge the company concerned to invest in a paper mill using less natural resources while producing more jobs and wealth for Australians.

         Beecroft Peninsula defines the north-west side of Jervis Bay. It is an area of substantial beauty and ecological value. It is also of great importance to the Jerringa people who live nearby and who have retained strong links with the area. Beecroft is rich with the relics of their ancestors, and has many sites of continuing spiritual significance to them. But Beecroft is also a defence area. About 10 per cent of the peninsula is a gunnery range which is regularly bombarded during naval and air force exercises. The remainder is used from time to time for army exercises in which such things as amphibious landings are practised.

         Last week's fire was the result of a naval bombardment which went wrong. In fact, the star shell appears to have landed between three and four kilometres from the boundary of the impact zone. It is extraordinary that such a huge error was made. There is no official word on the damage that was done by this fire; although, we do know that new bushfire control tracks were hastily created to help put the fire out. We may never know the impact on the birds and animals in the area because a comprehensive fauna survey has never been conducted. It is likely that the burnt out area is a home for rare bird species, particularly the eastern bristlebird, which is the most endangered bird on the Australian mainland. There may also be endangered animals living there, but no-one knows for certain.

         This fire could have been much worse. Had it occurred in summer, it could have affected a far greater area, like the January 1991 fire which destroyed 12 square kilometres. Had the wind been blowing in a different direction, it would have swept through areas which are of great significance to the Jerringa people. I am not suggesting that this fire was in itself a major disaster but it could have been. Furthermore, it is not an isolated incident; unplanned fires caused by naval bombardment have become an annual event. I have already mentioned the huge fire of January 1991. In December last year, about two square kilometres were burnt out when a navy target flare set fire to bushland during a period of high fire danger.

         In May 1991, major environmental damage was caused by an army exercise called Operation Termite Spray. Army trucks removed sand from a beach; new tracks were bulldozed; trees were cut down; an Aboriginal midden at Honeymoon Bay was removed to make way for a shower/laundry complex; seagrass meadows were destroyed; and tracked vehicles were driven through wetlands of ecological significance. My colleague Senator Coulter had a lot to say about this at the time.

         Some local defence people have tried to excuse the accidental fires by claiming that the area's ecology is fire dependent anyway. I will respond by making two points. First, fire dependent areas will only retain their value where firing takes place under an ecologically based fire management plan; where fires are timed to cause maximum benefit and minimum damage; where the area to be burned and the rate of burning are controlled; and where firefighters are on hand before a fire is lit. Random unplanned fires which require an emergency response are not the way to manage such an area.

         Second, there are vegetation communities and endangered species on Beecroft which, if destroyed by fire, will not recover. There is a patch of remnant rainforest on the peninsula which is testimony to that fact. There used to be more rainforest on Beecroft Peninsula, but much has been lost through fire. I have a copy of a map of Beecroft which dates back to the 1960s and was produced by the Currarong Bowling and Recreation Club. There is a note on the map which laments:

        Last week's fire left local people asking whether history is repeating itself. Because of the frequencies of fires and damaging exercises, they are becoming convinced that Defence is deliberately degrading the area, with the aim of undermining the campaign to include Beecroft Peninsula in a Jervis Bay national park and marine reserve. I should make it clear that I have no reason to believe that the recent fires were deliberately lit, but I do ask whether the tempo of Defence activities on Beecroft has been raised to underline its control over the area.

         In my view, Defence's use of Beecroft Peninsula is becoming increasingly inappropriate. The local Aboriginal communities, including the Wreck Bay people on the south side of Jervis Bay, have bitter memories of being driven from Beecroft by navy bombardment. It is an affront to the reconciliation process to continue the same offensive activities in the 1990s. It is an affront to the unique ecology and beauty of the area to continue to use it for military target practice. It is even more offensive that not only is the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) stepping up these activities but he is also pushing for the proposed east coast armament complex to be located at Jervis Bay, with Beecroft Peninsula earmarked as the site for the armament wharf.

At present, there is a short list of four possible ECAC sitesâ€”Jervis Bay, Twofold Bay near Eden, Point Wilson north of Geelong and Port Curtis near Gladstone.

         It is no secret that Senator Ray intends to make Jervis Bay one of these sites. There are rumours doing the rounds that the other one will be Twofold Bay. If that is the minister's plan, then it is a transparent attempt to give cabinet no choice but to select Jervis Bay as the ECAC site. As the minister knows from the recent interdepartmental committee which examined the ECAC alternatives, Twofold Bay is out of the question unless the Harris-Daishowa woodchip mill closes down in the very near future. As much as the Democrats might welcome such a development, we cannot see it happening in the near future, and I am sure the minister shares that view. A choice between Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay seems to us to be no choice at all.

         Indeed, the minister's plan for two separate EISs on two sites is fundamentally flawed. Two independent studies will not allow the two sites to be compared and the best site identified. That can only be done by an integrated assessment. The Democrats favour an inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. We believe that the inquiry should be conducted by a three-member panel: a chairperson skilled at public consultation, one member with environmental expertise and another with a background in defence.

         In our view, the inquiry should take a long, hard look at the merits of Port Curtis, particularly given that it could be an excellent long-term home for the east coast fleet. We believe it should also consider Port Wilson, but only with the strict condition that an ECAC at that site should not obstruct the relocation of Melbourne's Coode Island chemical storage facility away from urban areas. It should examine Twofold Bay, although, as I have said before, the prospects of an ECAC at that site do not look good. It should also have the scope to examine other sites and other proposals such as the Australian Conservation Foundation's suggestion of a purpose-built armaments facility. But Jervis Bay should be struck off the short list. It is time to recognise the unique beauty, ecology and heritage of the area and to provide the protection which is long overdue. The minister is right to point out that past occupation by Defence has saved Jervis Bay fromâ€”

         â€”I rise to speak about air safety in Australia today because I have got some real concerns about it. The fact is that the assurance of safety has been degraded by the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority in recent years. I am not saying that there are no safety procedures left in aviation. I am saying that the procedures and the practices, which provided a cushion for air safety operations in Australia, have been greatly reduced by the activities of the CAA in recent years. That is a tragedy: the primary role of the CAAâ€”in fact the only reason that the CAA existsâ€”is to provide safe air navigation within Australia. The drift that we have seen simply cannot be tolerated any longer.

         Within the last week, we have seen reports of two very distressing accidents where a large number of lives have been lost. The first report relates to a Monarch Air Services flight flying into Young. The other report relates to two young Australians who lost their lives on a flight between Sydney and Forbes. Both of them relate to bad weather but, beyond that, there are great differences in the operations of the two flights. I will come to the Monarch flight at a future date.

         I want to deal today with the loss of the two young Australians on that flight to Forbes. I believe it is a reasonable proposition that, since they survived the crash, they might well have been alive today if they had been found promptly. I stress that I do not know their condition after the crashâ€”how badly injured they wereâ€”and it may well have been so bad that, even if they been picked up by a helicopter immediately afterwards, they would not have survived. But the general proposition is that, if someone survives an aviation accident, and if they can be found in time and get medical attention, there is a good possibility that they will survive. There is a tragic parallel here with the Stinson crash in the late 1930s on the Lamington Plateau. Again, you had bad weather and high ground. In the case of the Stinson, two did survive the crash but there was a very long delay in finding them. Surely we have learnt something, in nearly 60 years of aviation in this country.

         My question to the Civil Aviation Authority is this: why was a flight plan not put in for that flight? The answer to that question is quite simple. People do not fly on flight plans today because it is too impractical to file one. The majority of people flying in Australia today are private VFR operators, which is what this pilot was. It is very easy for an airline captain, or an air force pilot or a charter operator to file a plan. Further, they are obliged to do so by law. However, private pilots are actively discouraged by the Civil Aviation Authority in filing a flight plan. They are told it costs the system $150 to file a plan. I find that a nonsensical statement.

         The CAA must have looked at its bloated overheads, divided it by the number of operations that it can identify that it performs and come up with this figure. If it costs the CAA $150 to file a flight plan from me, it really ought to be shut down and put out of business. I reckon I could do it for no more than a dollar. But this is all part of the doctrine of affordable safety that Australian aviation is now suffering under.

         The great majority of pilots who fly in Australia fly in the category `private VFR'. Most of them spend their time flying in the circuit; they just do not have the money, with the huge cost of aviation today, to fly cross-country very frequently, and it is when they go cross-country that they get into trouble. They get into trouble because the CAA has changed all the air traffic control procedures, and has not had an effective education scheme to educate pilots about what the new procedures are. What the CAA is trying to do has my full support. I think that what it is trying to do is laudable, but the way it is going about it is absolutely horrendous. The way it has managed changes to the air traffic procedures in Australia is absolutely incompetent.

         In Australia we have told generations of pilots that first of all they should get the weather informationâ€”and it is self-evident why one should get weather information before one flies long distancesâ€”and, secondly, that they should file a flight plan so that someone knows where they have gone. There are lots of benefits from filing a flight plan. First of all, one sits down and works out whether one can actually get to where one wants to go with the winds there are, and whether one has enough fuel on board. That is a very effective discipline in itself. It guarantees to some degree that the flight can be operated safely. The second thing is that if someone files a flight plan, it is a discipline on him to follow the tracks that he has put on paper. If he does not file a flight plan and he is flying from here to Parkes or Dubbo, he really is under no compulsion to follow a straight line or a predictable course because there is no reason to do so.

         Before the CAA started these changes, in every airfield that had a manned tower, a pilot could walk in and get the weather, or could phone that tower and get the weather. A pilot could walk in and file a flight plan or could phone the tower there and lodge a plan. Most importantly, he could talk to a briefing officer. He could say, `I have not been into Rockhampton for 12 months. I want to fly from Archerfield to Rockhampton and I am going to go into Bundaberg for fuel. What do I need to know?'. In 30 seconds the briefing officer would say, `Your frequencies are so and so, call here and call there'. Not only would he be safe, but all other users of the airspace would be safe as well.

If I want to phone in I have difficulties, because the access is limited to one or two operators. If I try to do it by radio, I run into the problem that the CAA actively discourages people from filing a plan. I think that is totally unacceptable.

         Before the CAA messed all this up, we all had visual flight guides. A VFG was a simple book which, in plain language, dealt with every aspect of VFR flying in Australia. If a pilot could not talk to anyone, he could open the book up and be quite safe and be quite precise in what he was doing. The CAA got rid of the VFG. Somehow or other it just was not politically correct in the affordable safety, user pays doctrine that now governs the CAA. The authority issued instead RACOPS and the AIP.

         I would just point out that it is a very bland coverage of the issues. The heading of point I is `The Demographic Context' and the following headings are `The Population Policy and Programme Framework', `International Cooperation in Population'â€”that is a very topical issue at the momentâ€”and `Summary and Conclusions'. There is emphasis on maternal and child health, family planning service delivery and a related maternity benefits program. There is the role and relevance of the world population plan of action.

         Try as I would, however, I could not find very much reference to the role of women in the preparation of the report as far as the United Nations guidelines were concerned. They do appear at page 3, where it is stated that an appropriate global strategy and plan of action for population for the early part of the twenty-first century can only be formulated with active participation and thoughtful contributions from all concernedâ€”governments, communities, non-government organisations, scholars, individuals, men and, as we might have guessed, women. In all this documentation, that was the only reference that I could find to women.

        Population policies and programs of most countries and international agencies have been driven more by demographic goals than by quality of life goals. Population size and growth have often been blamed inappropriately as the exclusive or primary causes of problems such as global environmental degradation and poverty. Fertility control programs have prevailed as solutions when poverty and inequity are root causes that need to be addressed. Population policies and programs have typically targeted low income countries and groups, often reflecting racial and class biases.

         This is a very relevant issue for Australia to consider in the preparation of its national response, particularly as we have the opportunity to play a significant role in regard to increasing our funding as part of our aid program. Contrary to some of the media and, indeed, opposition speculation, I am assured by Minister Bilney that there is an absolute commitment. However, we believe that we should be open-minded and we should consider other issues, as is reflected in this report:

        Women's behaviour rather than men's has been the focus of attention. Women have been expected to carry most the responsibility and risks of birth control, but have been largely excluded from decision-making in personal relationships as well as in public policy. Sexuality and gender-based power inequities have been largely ignored, and sometimes even strengthened, by population and family planning programs.

          â€”We are talking about ministers and their contribution and their responsibilities. Senator Collins does have formal responsibilities for communications, even though we now know that David Beddall actually takes the submissions to cabinet and Senator Collins is anxious to say nothing in the area. But that does not excuse him for doing nothing in his own backyard. What has he done? Four years after the government promised that SBS would be extended to nine new regions, including Darwin, he was finally dragged screaming and yelling to the barrier and he came up with $5.3 million dollars to fund a new transmitter in Darwin. That is proceeding apace, to the delight of most of the local residents.

          What it means is that Darwin is now getting something that Alice Springs and other smaller towns in the Northern Territory are clearly not getting and would like to get. An action group which was established in Alice Springs some months ago has been campaigning for a transmitter and indeed for funds to be provided by the government. The amount of money that it is looking for is a miserable $50,000. The group has been fobbed off in all sorts of amazing ways by the minister, to the point where he claimed in this chamber at one stage:

         have written a letter to me, and that is as much as I know about it. I have not had a chance to talk to them yet, but I will talk to them. I think there has been a message from my office sent to themâ€”this only happened last weekâ€”to that effect.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is what he said back on 29 September. In fact, members of the group had contacted him some three weeks earlier. They had not heard one word from him. The message to which he referred was simply a press release which was faxed to them from Senator Collins, trumpeting his achievement in relation to Darwin. In other words, he was adding insult to injury. Not only would the minister not contact them but he had the cheek to claim that his office had been in touch with a message, which was really just to rub their noses in the dirt.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Since that time, the action group has tried to contact the minister's office on a number of occasions. On one notable occasion, after this matter had been raised in the Senate and Senator Collins had categorically ruled out any assistance to Alice Springs, his press secretary basically disowned his own minister by saying that Senator Collins really had not meant what he had said. He said, `You know Bob Collins. We are still having a look at it'. The fact of the matter is that they are not looking at it. They have decided against it. Their bottom line, I think, is clearly that they do not want to take any such initiative too far out from the next election. They want to wait until such time as they will get credit and it will be fresh in the minds of the local constituents. In other words, it was a classic political game playing exercise.

          To suggest that somehow this might open the floodgates, as has been suggested to the action group, is again absolute nonsense. Probably only one or two towns the size of Katherine would be next in the queue. I trust that the minister has seen the quotation which has been provided from Farmer Electronics, which I think pares back the costs to the bone. It comes in at just under $47,000, a very small asking fee, I would have thought. The extraordinary thing is that the minister has not even been prepared to offer to fund on a matching basis. The very least I would have thought he would have done, if he was interested in providing assistance, was to provide it on that sort of dollar-for-dollar basis. Therefore, I think the action group is entitled to be outraged.

          Some of the minister's comments were quite misleading, in any event. To suggest that they were proposing a low-powered transmitter facility which is just going to broadcast to the immediate local area with some sort of a signal completely understates the fact that what they have in mind is a total radiated power from the proposed transmission of 380 watts, as opposed to the present 250 watts from ABC and Imparja. We are not arguing over whether this is feasible, whether it is technically desirable or whether it is possible. The fact is that the Australian Broadcasting Authority granted the licence on 7 September last. So all the specifications have been approved. There is no technical problem. The South Australian and Northern Territory broadcast engineers have given it the all clear.

          We are talking here about a project that is all ready to go, except for the intransigence of the minister who has had no compunction about throwing $5.3 million at his local constituents, but obviously could not give a damn about the citizens of the other major town in the territory. That is why Eric Poole was absolutely right when he called on the minister to stop playing games with territorians and bring SBS to Alice Springs. There is absolutely no good reason why this should not occur; it should occur immediately. Unless the minister wants to have yet another fiasco on his hands, then he ought to get off them and do something in this area.

          Now let me deal with Mr Beddall. What Mr Beddall has done in this areaâ€”he has done very little and what he has done has taken him a long time to doâ€”is that he essentially has a different technology time track in three different areas. There are satellite licences which are currently dead in the water because no-one wants to touch them with a barge pole. Murdoch and Packer walked away from them months ago. There are people out there gold-digging and hoping that someone will desperately buy them out. Quite clearly, this process is going to drag on and on for months and months, and we will not have any satellite services up there in the foreseeable future. In any event, why would anyone in his right mind want to spend $500 million on something when he is likely to be trumped from Asia or likely to be encircled by cable and MDS?

We have had nothing since then except that we keep getting these sorts of leaks: `In a marked change of style the Keating government is considering quick closed bid one-day sales in individual cities to dispose of the remaining MDS pay licences'. Then at the very end it says that, of course, this has not actually gone past the minister.

          Clearly, there is an enormous level of frustration within the department if those people are proposing these sorts of revisions of the process. If they have got a concept in mind, why is it that Mr Beddall has not yet approved the redesigned sale process? Why has he not addressed the fundamental issues? Most importantly, of course, why has he not addressed the question of why there could conceivably be three different types of pay television delivered by three different technologies starting up at three different times?

          This was highlighted this week by a letter of absolute anguish from a local tourist channel operator in Cairns who wrote to Mr Beddall some weeks ago asking why it was that he was not going to be able to start up on MDS because there is no licence process in place. He was told the likelihood is that he will have to wait until at least the start of 1995 before he can get under way. Yet he finds that, not only is there a Canadian company called Paynet which has taken out cables licences, but now another crowd called Rowcom has taken out cable licences as well.

We are talking about delivering the same service simply by a different technology. Why should someone get a cable licence for $785, full stop, and the other have to pay $23,000 a year ad infinitum?

          Again, as Fred Brenchley quite rightly points out, the departmentâ€”presumably aided and abetted by the ministersâ€”is in the business of drawing this distinction between narrow cast and broadcast, which will again become the classic boundary dispute. We will have jurisdictional arguments time and again and all the flash lawyers will be needed to try to sort it out. Why do we need to have all these separate licences? They are supposed to be national licences, but as soon as one broadcasts a slightly different service in a geographic area one has to have a separate licence. So Rowcom finds that it needs 28 pay television licences, 10 for terrestrial rebroadcast, six for the broadcast of one local cable television service in each area and 12 to allow for the introduction of additional services as the system develops.

           Why does one need this plethora of pieces of paper? Why cannot we simply say, if it is a national licence, `If you are a fit and proper person or if'â€”according to the latest suitability testâ€”`you are a suitable operator, if you meet the minimum requirements, you can have your ticket'? But no, one can have a whole range of tickets if one pays a relatively small amount for each one and gets going with cable. Who knows? If Telecom really got stuck into it, presumably it could get cable on the road within the next 12 to 18 months at the very latestâ€”

          â€”Senator Collins must believe his own propaganda. It depends entirely on the resources that one devotes to it, the area that one wishes to cover, and how much money one wants to invest in it. These are all matters for negotiation. Senator Collins does not seem to appreciate that Paynet or Rowcom could lay their own cable, but they face all the problems of having to get environmental consent from local councils, whereas Telecom and Optus can do it immediately. The negotiations that will take place will obviously involve a timetable. If they wanted to pay up-front and get it done immediately it could be done in a relatively short space of time. Most importantly, it could be done well before the start of 1995, which is the earliest on the current timetable that one could get an MDS licence. As Fred Brenchley rightly says, why do we not talk about narrowcast licences? Telecom has been given one for a trial project, which is essentially broadcast in every respect, again special pleadingâ€”

         The facts areâ€”and I will be briefâ€”that whilst the Broadcasting Services Act provides for potentially different start-up dates for cable, MDS and satellite delivered pay TV services, it is totally inaccurate to say that those companies that have been allocated cable pay TV licences are `free to start a cable channel right away'. Cable delivered services are licensed under section 96 of the act. Whilst there are no timing constraints on the issue of these licences, there is a range of regulatory conditions that apply and a number of quite significant technological and commercial limitations, which include the dependency of a cable service on broadband capacity into homes, which is a labour intensive, time consuming and very expensive exercise; the cost for the roll-out of a hybrid coaxial optical fibre system; and the need for cable operators to obtain program rights, establish studios, subscriber management and retail infrastructure, and undertake marketing.

         It should be noted that licences for services using MDS and cable are issued subject to suitability requirements in a Trade Practices Commission report. The application fee for each licence is $785, with a maximum of $1,570 payable where more than one licence is involved. As Senator Alston said, cable operators will also either have to bear the cost of laying out the cable infrastructure themselves, which is very significant, or have to lease it from a telecommunications carrier, which would have to be struck at a rate that gives the person who lays the cable a commercial return on the layout of that cable.

Senator Haines said that, because of her campaign, it is now clear that the proposed wine tax increase will not pass the parliament. We all know that the Democrats backed off under pressure and gave in for a compromise package which will see the sales tax on wine creep up slowly, but creep up nevertheless. We all know there is no reason why the Democrats could not have chosen to vote with the opposition and defeat the increase in sales tax on wine completely.

        I have never heard such an outrageous claim in my life but it does prove one thing: when the Democrats stand alone, they can do nothing. They can do absolutely nothing on their own. If it were not for the fact that the coalition had made a decision that they were going to oppose wine taxes, the Democrats would not have been left with a leg to stand on. It would have been like their previous, much publicised fighting for the wine industry; they could have achieved absolutely nothing at all. It is only with the support of the coalition that they are ever able to do anything; they can do nothing on their own. In this situation we see them back off and back away from their original stanceâ€”the very thing that Janine Haines says they have never done and has accused the opposition of doing.

         Janine Haines also gives the Australian Labor Party a bit of a bucketingâ€”something that her federal colleagues in the Senate seem very reluctant to doâ€”saying that the Labor Party appears to be unable to accept the clear industry policy arguments on this issue. Perhaps if former Senator Haines was still leading the Democrats they might have shown a bit more backbone and the wine tax might have been defeated in its entirety. What I thought was most interesting was that the former leader says that winemakers and grape growers can deliver a message to the ALP, in her words, `to back off', by contributing to the Democrats' campaign to replace ALP members of parliament with Democrat MPs in the upcoming South Australian election.

         She does not make any mention of the Liberal Party of Australia because she really only wants to replace Labor Party members with Democrat members. This, perhaps, gives us some indication that Senator Haines has had a change of heart in many areas and now believes that the only alternative government is the Liberal Party, particularly the Liberal Party in South Australia. Honourable senators would have to ask whether Janine Haines wants the Labor Party out of office in South Australia so badly that she is prepared to tell Democrat supporters that they should be giving all their preferences to the Liberal Party.

         â€”Make her Governor! Where did the minister find that one? He would be the only one who would have thought of that. Concerning the letter that Janine Haines has written to the Winegrape Growers Council, let me come back to the fact that the former leader of the Democrats has been let down badly by her colleaguesâ€”or her former colleaguesâ€”when she says that they will always stand up for the wine industry. They backed off at the last minute. In no way did Senator Lees lead the fight against the 1993 tax hikes. When the budget was announced, within a couple of days the coalition announced, clearly and concisely, those parts of the budget that it intended to oppose. The Democrats thought about it for two or three weeks then decided what their position would be once they knew they had a base to stand on. That base for their opposition was provided by the strong stand that was taken by the coalition.

         So I hope that wine and grape growers in South Australia will take no heed of the letter from former Senator Haines when she asks them to donate to the Democrats' election campaign. As is the case in the Senate, the same thing happens in South Australia; the Democrats can do absolutely nothing for the people of South Australia. As soon as they realise that by directing their preferences in totality to the Liberal Party, there will be a change of government and South Australians will be better off.

         There is no necessary inconsistencyâ€”I hope Senator Coulter would agreeâ€”between the research and commercialisation of particular matters and the reflection of ethical values in the patent system governing that research and commercialisation. The TRIPs agreement does not distinguish between inventions of a product or a process, nor does it make a distinction in the type of technology used, whether it relates to life forms or not. The text does provide members with the flexibility to exclude from patentability inventions which might otherwise, I am told again, challenge public order or morality.

        There is a further provision that enables things to be ruled out if native title has been extinguished over the land or any part thereof.

         We are, of course, conscious of the possibility of frivolous and vexatious claims, and that is one of the reasons that these provisions are very much part of the outline as it has been anticipated. In the Bowen Basin we have a further issue, which has some people excited, about the fact that there is some overlapping of the claims that have been foreshadowed or made at the moment. Obviously, we have not yet got in place this system of registration, but it will need to be addressed in this way. But the overlapping of two claims is really no different from the sorts of disputes about the exact position of boundaries that occur between land-holders or claimants in other litigation context all along.

         To attempt to deny potential native titleholders the right to be involved in decisions about proposed uses of the land, to attempt to deny them, moreover, the right at the threshold, even to pursue claims in situations where it might well be thought that the case was unsustainable and the result likely to be negative, is, of course, to get us right back to where we were debating this a couple of days ago. What the opposition has made clear is that it wants different rules for white people in this country and for black people, and that simply is not a sustainable proposition.

Last week in a public lecture in Sydney the senior curator of the Royal Naval Museum at Portsmouth lauded the maritime museum for the exceptional, high-quality displays which it presents.

         It is a pity that when we are developing an important national heritage institution our national broadcasters should fail to take into account the positives. No institution should be exempt from criticism, including the maritime museum. It would be the first to say it is in the development stage and needs to improve. It is improving and it will continue to improve. But it is important that, if people want to criticise it, they get the facts right and look at the positives as well.

The answer that I gave yesterday to Senator Vanstone on the same question provided information that, effectively, the hulls concerned were bankrupt stock. That is, in fact, the case. At the time that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority conducted a worldwide search for suitable vessels and these two hulls, which were precisely in accordance with the requirements of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, were found, they were in the hands of liquidators. Extensive consultation was conducted between the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the departments that I have just mentioned.

In fact, AMSA was offered two partially built vessels by different overseas shipyards at extremely competitive prices. The hulls were at such a stage that only the early fit-out had commenced and AMSA was in the fortunate position of being able to commission the remaining fit-out to precisely its needs.

         AMSA became aware of these vessels. Prior to that, it had considered an extremely wide range of options for servicing the navigation aids network and concluded that the most cost-effective alternative to continuing with the 30-year-old ship that it had was to charter another vessel for the next three years. However, after this search, which I referred to yesterday, AMSA was unsuccessful in finding a suitable vessel for charter. But it was during the search for this vessel that it discovered the availability of these partially built vessels overseas that were then in the hands of liquidators.

         As I said, AMSA had consulted major ship builders in Australia to ascertain whether they could offer a competitive proposal. None of the Australian companies was able to make a competitive offer on either price or delivery date. The Australian Shipbuilders Association wrote to me in May this year. I provided a comprehensive response to it at that time, which gave a detailed explanation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's actions in this regard.

         AMSA has an obligation to provide the most cost-effective services to the Australian shipping industry that it can; that is part of its charter, which is no doubt fully supported on convenient occasions by the opposition. The difference in rough terms is that it will be able to take delivery of its vessel at a fully capitalised cost of something less than $19 million. Providing exactly the same vessel to the same requirements at a fully capitalised cost from an Australian shipbuilding yard would have cost somewhere between $25 million and $30 million, which is an extremely significant difference. I am not talking about price margins of five per cent, 10 per cent or even 20 per cent.

         The rationale of the ruling is that a clear majority is required to make an amendment or request to a bill when the bill is first considered, and therefore a clear majority should be required to insist on an amendment or request which has been disagreed to by the House of Representatives. If the majority which was required to make the amendment or request in the first instance is no longer in existence, clearly the amendment or request is lost. Much of the debate was not directed to this fundamental logical proposition.

         Much attention was given in the debate to the last phrase of section 23 of the Constitution: "when the votes are equal the question shall pass in the negative"; but insufficient attention was given to the first sentence of the section: "Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority of votes". The procedures of the Senate are designed, and should be interpreted, to ensure that positive decisions, such as amending or passing a bill, are made only by a majority.

         I circulated to party leaders and to independent senators on 18 October, 3 days before the ruling was given, the advice which I had received in anticipation of the situation which eventually arose and the ruling which I proposed to make in that situation. Senators therefore had the opportunity to consider the ruling in advance. There was nothing different about the situation which arose on 21 October which affected the logic of the ruling or which required any change to the ruling.

         It was stated during the debate that my ruling was predicated on both questions, that the requests be pressed and that the requests not be pressed, having been negatived in committee of the whole. On the contrary, the ruling was not predicated on both questions being negatived, but clearly indicated that the conclusion must be the same regardless of which question was put and negatived. The voting on either question indicated that there was no longer a majority in favour of the requests. As I indicated, I gave the ruling on the substantive question of the effect of the committee's votes before the vote had been taken on the second motion in committee, in response to invitations from Senator Evans and in response to canvassing of the issue by Senator Hill and other senators.

That result would not be changed if the question were put in the alternative form, that the requests be pressed. As I pointed out in my ruling, with equally divided votes the situation is quite different, and the effect of the Senate's vote cannot be held to depend on which motion is moved.

Over all the years that I have known the various members of the South Australian government, it has been my experience that they are effective advocates for their stateâ€”even when I disagree with them.

         â€”The advice to backbenchers is that they should give ministers more notice of their questions so that we can edit them, I suppose. I understand that the issues underlying Senator Beahan's question relate to a complaint by the Life Insurance Policy Exchange that some Australian insurance companies may be engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. My attention has been drawn to that complaint. It is a complaint which was directed, as would be appropriate, to the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, in his capacity as the minister responsible for the Trade Practices Commission. In accordance with the normal practice, Mr Gear's office has referred this matter in the standard manner to the Trade Practices Commission and it is being considered by the Trade Practices Commission. It is not a matter on which I think I can comment any further.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review

         of 26 October that the Treasurer had estimated that compensation costs arising from the Mabo decision would be around only $100 million. I am informed that this was a misrepresentation of what the Treasurer actually said, which was along the lines that the total compensation cost was difficult to estimate but was likely to be in the order of hundreds of millions rather than a billion. This was a general statement, heavily qualified, in accord with the views previously expressed by other ministers, including me, and was not drawing on any particular analysis prepared by the Treasury.

         As to the second matter, the question of how the compensation payments will be treated for the purposes of taxation is yet to be considered definitively by the government. Since it is likely to be some time before any compensation for extinguishment or impairment of native title is required to be paid, there will clearly be time for balanced consideration to be given by the government to all relevant issues.

Furthermore, there is a provision in the Outline of Proposed Legislation on Native Title released by the Government on 2 September 1993, at paragraph 21 (c), which makes it clear that where there are reservations or conditions for the benefit of any person, including any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person, in a grant then any rights and interests protected by that reservation or condition will continue.

        The Federal Court found recently in the Pareroultja case that native title is not extinguished by grants made to Aboriginal people under the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act. It would appear likely that, in general, grants made under laws for the special benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will not have extinguished native title. It is therefore quite possible that native title will continue to exist on at least some DOGIT land in Queensland.

I do not know how we can do that, but we should all attempt to make sure that this review does not produce uncertainty and we should give assurances to those older people that as far as possible things can remain predictable for them. We should all do this because a number of older people have expressed concern.

        I hope the government will consult with the Democrats, the Independents and the coalition about those terms of reference. I put on the public record that I have a number of concerns about the terms of reference. I think the objectives of review, which come under dot point two, should be expanded to add `and the treatment of capital gains on shares and managed investments'. Dot point one, dealing with the scope of the review, should be amended to replace the word `retaining' with `maximising' in the line `retaining incentives for self-provision'. Also dot point two should be expanded by adding at the end `in lieu of the decision not to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995'. I am not sure that the government will agree to that point.

        A further dot point should be added under the scope of the review and should read `the need to increase national savings'. The specialist reference group suggested in the draft terms of reference appears to me to be somewhat Public Service dominated. While the coalition recognises that there should be Public Service involvement with a specialist reference group, the involvement should be minimal. There is no mention in the draft terms of reference as to how the specialist group will be selected. I believe it ought to be selected independently of the minister. The government must have a resolution passed by the Senate within five sitting days which approves the terms of reference and the reporting date or, on the basis of the resolution which was agreed to some weeks ago, the Senate will set up its own independent inquiry.

        I particularly want to take note of this answer because of the scant and shabby disregard that Senator Collins had for the concerns that are raised in this matter. It is fair enough for David Hill to have personal views on the republic. It is fair enough for him to be a staunch advocate of the republic. My understanding is that, prior to his unloading himself to the

         We can all disagree, but it is an absolute fiction to pretend that the Managing Director of the ABC can somehow have a licence afforded to him to speak publicly as a private citizen. It is simply not on. It would be like Senator Gareth Evans getting up and saying that he privately agrees with the Liberal Party on an issueâ€”I know that he would never be caught doing thisâ€”and then saying, `How outrageous of anyone to quarrel because I was not contradicting party policy; I was speaking as a private citizen'.

         A matter of concern to me is that I wrote to Mr Hill on 29 Septemberâ€”that is four weeks ago. I complained to him about the conduct of one of his senior political journalists and the way in which she aired very one-sided views on the political process. I have not had the courtesy of a reply. In other words, Mr Hill is too busy to reply to that sort of issue, but he has plenty of time to get out there and make statements which are fundamentally wrong.

         Even Senator Gareth Evans would know that, when Mr Hill is quoted as saying that the minimalist position put in the Turnbull report was `mind-bogglingly simple', he has got it absolutely wrong. The Turnbull report is an options paper; it does not contain a simple proposition. Indeed, Turnbull himself has said that there is no such thing as a minimalist position. For Mr Hill to get out there and express his views is one thing; to express them wrongly and in a partisan fashion is another. But to pretend that somehow he is a private citizen when he takes sides in the most extreme fashion is totally unacceptable.

         â€”Mr Deputy President, could you give Senator Evans a valium to calm him down so we can proceed. There is a clear issue of ethics here. A major political issue now facing the country, raised by Mr Keating, is whether or not we should become a republic. Mr Keating has put this on the agenda. He has spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars in promoting this particular political agenda. There is no question that this is a political issue. It is a political issue because of the way Senator Schacht's colleagues and his Prime Minister have behaved. That is the first point.

         The second point is that there is clearly a problem when the person who is charged with running the national broadcasting service becomes involved directly in one of the major political debates of the day. If the comments that are published in the Melbourne

          Age

Nonetheless, the person who is running the national broadcasting service is adopting a highly partisan line in relation to a major political issue. Senator Schacht cannot see a question of ethics there and I believe that he cannot see a question of ethics there because he is always blind to ethics. Nothing would be further from his purview than ethics.

         I also point out that not only is Mr Hill adopting a highly partisan approach from his position of running the national broadcaster, but also he is indulging in a quite unfounded attack on Mr Hayden, the Governor-General. The irony of this position is that it was Mr Hill's national broadcasting service which sought out Mr Hayden, the Governor-General, to appear on the ABC's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         If Senator Evans were worried about the cultural cringe, if he were worried about Australia having the capacity to control its own destiny, he would not involve Australian domestic disputes in UN committees, and that is what he has done. He has overturned the whole philosophy of the Australia Act. If he really believed in Australia being an independent country, if he really believed that Australia was to control its own destiny, he would not have taken the actions he has taken. If the ABC's David Hill really was concerned about the cultural cringe, he would be concerned about Senator Evans's cultural cringing to the UN on every occasion. If David Hill was concerned about Australia controlling its own destiny, he would be very concerned about the fact that Senator Evans has overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act and he has opened up appeals to UN committees to deal with domestic human rights disputes.

Nothing will be sacrosanct; we will be able to say whatever we want about the head of state. Will this make us a more united country? The answer is no.

But under this government, of course, it seems that rules go out the door, depending on one's political preference or, rather, on one's political prejudice. Senator Schacht has always left the facts, reasonableness and commonsense outside the door when his prejudice has stepped in the way. That is what we are seeing in this chamber today: Senator Schacht getting up, as rabid as usual, to defend the indefensible.

         this morning that Mr Gude recently demanded that the Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Moira Rayner, supply him with the full and complete details of the confidential complaints being made against the Victorian government's new employment laws. Of course, this was her major crime. She first of all suggested, on the basis of a referral from the former Labor government, after a two-year inquiry, that the Fairlea prison should not be closed down because it was discriminatory against women. Some months later she went on to suggest that there were some problems in Victoria as a result of there being a 50 per cent increase in the number of job related complaints to her commission because of changes to the employment laws in that state. What we are seeing is a vindictive, vicious government in action, seeking now to remove her from her position. As I indicated, the human rights legislation of this parliament provides some protection for her. It will be interesting to see just how far the Victorian government is prepared to go in contravention of that legislation from this parliament.

         In Victoria we are seeing judges dismissed and injured workers denied legal representation. We are seeing the Law Reform Commission abolished. We are seeing a plethora of actions being taken by a government that is preoccupied with crushing dissent and crushing people who have a different point of view and who stand up for basic human rights. Despite the legal implications, the Victorian government is prepared to press ahead with it. One can only suggest that this is a matter that will come full circle. I trust that the Australian Labor government will take up these matters because they are fundamental issues that go to the question of civil liberties in this country.

They have shown their willingness to involve us ceaselessly and unthinkingly in UN human rights conventions, to trade off the independence of this country and to allow Australian disputes to go to UN committees quite contrary to the philosophy of the Australia Act.

          The National Drought Policy which was agreed by the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand in July 1992 was announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon Simon Crean, in August 1992. The policy sees drought as a normal feature of Australian agriculture which should be treated as such. The main focus is on farm management which takes into account the risks associated with drought and adheres to the principles of sustainable agriculture. The Drought Policy Statement is at Attachment A to this response.

          The National Drought Policy (NDP) encourages self reliant approaches to drought by treating it as one of the many risks for which managers of the farm business must prepare. The Policy seeks to address the past approach of reliance on Government assistance during drought periods by removing the emphasis on transaction based subsidies and drought declarations. The NDP seeks to improve farmers' management skills so that they can make appropriate business decisions in a deregulated economy. This will be achieved by providing farmers with property management planning training.

          In encouraging farmers to take a self reliant approach to managing the risks associated with drought, farmers are being encouraged, through property management planning training, to take the necessary steps to protect their basic resources including the land and their livestock. Farmers are being encouraged to develop management strategies which establish agricultural production levels in accordance with land capability and practices which ensure conservation of natural resources and ecosystems. Under these strategies, farmers are urged to undertake appropriate management actions, such as destocking in time of drought. Support may be available to farmers to assist them to recover following a period of exceptional circumstances, such as severe drought, as well as obtaining support through the period of downturn. Under the exceptional circumstance provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme, eligible farmers may be able to access up to 100 per cent interest subsidies on finance to make productivity improvements, including restocking and pasture replanting. Drought should not be reinstated within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA).

          The National Drought Policy confirms that drought will not be reinstated within the NDRA. The Drought Policy Review Task Force recommended against the reinstatement of drought within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements as this approach "would be anathema to a more equitable, efficient and environmentally responsible policy framework and in promoting a more self-reliant approach to the management of drought". This recommendation was endorsed by Commonwealth and State agricultural Ministers and forms the basis of the National Drought Policy.

          The comprehensive review of the Rural Adjustment Scheme undertaken in 1992, examined all aspects of the Scheme's operation. In particular its recommendations focused on the mechanisms for achieving structural adjustment in the rural sector. In considering these recommendations, the Government assessed their appropriateness within a rural policy framework for the development of a more forward looking and resilient rural sector. This process was instrumental in ensuring that Government involvement in providing support to the rural sector, particularly in time of severe downturn, is consistent with meeting overriding objectives of sustainability, productivity and profitability. Subsequent to the review of the Scheme that saw new arrangements for it put in place, a feedback process has been established whereby Authorities responsible for the administration of RAS in the States will be able to better tailor assistance according to actual effectiveness and emerging priorities.

          The Commonwealth and State Governments gave serious consideration to this recommendation in formulating the National Drought Policy. Although some States indicated a preference for financial incentives, the general consensus was that they should not be offered as such incentives tend to distort the decision making process in favour of particular activities which may or may not be suitable to the circumstances affecting individual farms. For this reason, Governments agreed not to provide financial incentives but instead decided to provide farmers with training and general incentives to improve productivity through changes to the Rural Adjustment Scheme. Subsidies available under the Scheme may support eligible farmers to undertake drought preparedness measures, such as improving fodder and water storage. Importantly, grants are available for farmers to improve the financial management of their enterprises by accessing training and obtaining professional advice through RAS. Training is also available through the Property Management Planning campaign. These latter measures are seen as being important tools for achieving a more self-reliant farming sector.

          Changes to the Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) Scheme, including the implementation of a new Farm Management Bond were implemented by amending the relevant legislation in December 1992. The adjustments to the IED Scheme were aimed at improving its operation and making it more attractive so as to encourage greater self-reliance during downturns. In particular, Farm Management Bonds are a more concessional tranche within the overall IED Scheme, expressly designed as a provision against hardship arising from natural events such as drought.

         The second and third parts of the report address the issues of curricula, teaching and teacher education. The report advocates the use of a national curriculum statement and profiles to achieve greater continuity between the different stages and levels of schooling from kindergarten to year 12. It stresses the need for language and literacy to be more substantial and a compulsory part of training for all teachers and the need for the upgrading of teachers of science and technology in our schools.

          This is a very progressive report which contributes in important ways to the national debate about the future directions of our schools. Unfortunately, it comes at a time when some state governments are cutting drastically and very severely the provision of resources available to schools. We are seeing quite dramatic reductions in the number of teachers that are available for the teaching of children in this country; the closing of hundreds of public schools; the withdrawal of curriculum support services; and, in the case of Victoria, severe restrictions on the legal rights of members, parents and teachers of school councils to go through the legal system to try to prevent the closure of community schools.

           Five to fifteen

          report advocates a greater national focusâ€”a focus which recognises the national role in determining the national education agenda. The Commonwealth's role in ensuring education equity, with an emphasise on equality of opportunity, is fundamental to this approach. It is on this basis that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has highlighted, in recent times, the great disparities that exist within the Commonwealth about the way in which resources are being allocated. While the report indicates that the primary focus of education administration in this country will always be the state, it is important that the Commonwealth take an increasing role to ensure and guarantee that basic educational rights for all children in this country are protected, and so that we do not see the undermining of the very valuable and high quality state education systems that are being provided.

We see in Victoria the report indicating that there are increasing resources going to the private sector at a time of massive reductions in the resources available to the public sector. This report by the Schools Council is a timely report. It is an important part of the national debate. I would hope that, at the national education minister's meeting that will occur in December, serious work will be done on establishing of a national agenda to ensure that these recommendations are acted upon.

         The National Audit Office probe into the relocation of the Civil Aviation Authority's Launceston based air traffic services centre has found that a lack of cooperation between the Tasmanian university and the Civil Aviation Authority contributed to the centre's demise in Launceston. I am concerned at that lack of cooperation between the two partiesâ€”each of which had their own agenda. The lack of determination by all parties to make the course succeed was largely the reason why Launceston has lost the course to the mainland.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Given that the establishment of the centre in Launceston in 1989 is now described as being experimental and did not rule out different arrangements in the futureâ€”which is, in fact, news to meâ€”it was vital that the university ensured that the course was well run, properly evaluated, and met the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority. Sadly, the report reveals that the university failed to do this and, therefore, probably never had any chance of retaining the courseâ€”especially when we recall that there was considerable angst in the Civil Aviation Authority, at some levels, at the course being located in Launceston in the first place.

          It is clear that the Civil Aviation Authority did little to really change this unsatisfactory situation. Once again, its poor administration has been highlighted. Over recent years, a number of instances of damning reports of the CAA's incompetence over a prolonged period have come before the Senate. A more determined approach on its part may have stopped the problem from developing.

          The report reveals that the program received limited modification after it was inherited from the Civil Aviation Authority. Thereafter, there were few attempts by the curriculum advisory committee, the Civil Aviation Authority or the university to ensure that an adequate evaluation program had been established for the ongoing review, revision and development of the course.

          The program appeared unable to adequately integrate job theory with job requirements. The management of the training program was poorly defined. There was open conflict of interests at the Launceston campus between academics and the coordinator and the teaching staff, and between the Civil Aviation Authority and university management. Trainees were placed in the field without adequate performance, assessment and evaluations.

          Most damning of all, in my view, is that the report discloses that there was evidence that the need for course refinement and revision of administrative processes was recognised, but requests to the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology, as it was then calledâ€”it is now a universityâ€”did not result in action being taken to ensure that the training program satisfied the Civil Aviation Authority's requirements. As a measure of the inadequacy of the course as it was allowed to develop, of the 160 students who commenced the first three courses only 70 were able to get jobs as air traffic controllers. All this incompetence cost the long suffering taxpayer almost $17 million.

          The report also highlights the fact that, while the Civil Aviation Authority is trying to sell its building, it does not own the land on which the building is situated. So its ability to sell to anybody very meaningfully is very much restricted. It is interesting to note that the ground is owned by the state of Tasmania and the University of Tasmania has made it very clear that it will take a dim view of it being sold to anybody else as it is on its campus.

          Inevitably, therefore, the taxpayer will not get much return from a building in which taxpayers' funds were substantially invested. Any dollars which the University of Tasmania pays to buying the building which is effectively on its land will be dollars which are also contributed by those same long suffering taxpayers. The taxpayers had better be warned that the federal government's intention, in closing down the course in Launceston, is to relocate it in two facilities on the mainland, which will mean that those same taxpayers will get some more big bills soon.

         TABLING STATEMENT BY COMMITTEE CHAIRPERSON, SENATOR MARGARET REYNOLDS
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the report tabled today, the Committee has examined two issues: the availability of unclassified video and computer games and the system for the classification of films and videos.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to video and computer games, the Committee's concerns are directed at the proliferation in Australia of games with unacceptable levels of violence or sexual activities as their themes. The Committee's concerns are shared by the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers, the meeting of Federal, State and Territory ministers with censorship responsibility. At their meeting in June 1993 the Ministers announced that they had agreed to bring video and computer games under the control of the national censorship system, and requested the Chief Censor and State and Territory officials to formulate a scheme for regulation to be presented at the Minister's next meeting, to be held on 4 and 5 November. The Committee has expedited its inquiry in order to bring down this interim report for the consideration of the Censorship Ministers at that meeting.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's recommendations envisage a scheme of regulation of the content of video and computer games with the classification set by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The Committee concluded that the absence of classification of such games, and reliance only on industry self-regulation, threatens to undermine the community's efforts to regulate the availability of graphically violent and sexual material in games to minors.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee will monitor the decisions of the meeting of Censorship Ministers, and will continue to take evidence in relation to video and computer games, and will be in a position to report to the Senate on progress.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's concern about the system of classification of films and videos was prompted by the decision in January 1993 of the Film and Literature Board of Review to release the film
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Salo
         </emphasis>
         with an `R' rating, overturning a decision of the Film Censorship Board to maintain a ban on the film's release of 17 years standing. The Committee's terms of reference include a requirement that it consider whether material which would be classified in the `R' and `X' categories should be permitted on pay TV. The Committee was able to use the consideration of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Salo
         </emphasis>
         by the classification authorities as a "window" into the operations of the system which has the potential to eventually permit `R' or `X' material onto pay TV.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's inquiry highlighted a number of systemic flaws in the classification system and its report has recommended the implementation of a number of important remedial measures, particularly in relation to the restructuring of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, which is the umbrella Commonwealth agency housing the Film Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review. The Committee recognises that the adjudication of community standards will always fall to certain individuals tasked with that role and that there will inevitably be differences of opinion about decisions which arise from such a system. The Committee was concerned, however, about the idiosyncratic nature of the current system, which gives little certainty to the community about what material will or will not be released. The Committee's recommendations are directed at ensuring that the classification system, as far as possible, meets prevailing community standards.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers is scheduled to discuss these issues at its forthcoming meeting in November, when it will examine in detail the proposals of the Law Refom Commission for greater uniformity in film and literature classification as contained in its September 1991 report
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Censorship Procedure
         </emphasis>
         . As with its recommendations in relation to the regulation of video and computer games, the Committee urges the Ministers to agree to the early implementation of the Committee's proposals for reforms in the film and video classification system.

          â€”I do not wish to delay the Senate, but I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Reynolds and the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies for what I see as a long haul that it has undertaken, so far quite nobly. It gives some hope to families who are struggling to raise children in this society who feel threatened on all sides by violence and pornography. Parents feel that it is very difficult these days, with the information explosion and new technologies, to protect their children as they would have been able to in the past. Wherever we go in this country, parents particularly, as well as others, talk of this problem and wonder how they as small people can make a difference.

          I think this committee which Senator Reynolds chairsâ€”once again, it put out a unanimous reportâ€”is making a difference. Its first reference related to the 0055 sex lines. I am very glad that it achieved something meaningful in that area. I have been very concerned about that and have brought many thousands of petitions to this place over that issue. I am glad that it has gone on and continued to look at ways in which this Parliament can help those parents protect their children until they reach maturity. I commend it for its work.

       At the outset we were received as old friends. There was no doubt about the American and Australian respect and affection for each other. We were able to strengthen ties between the two countries further. We certainly put forward in a very forceful way our views about the agricultural subsidy scheme, the export enhancement program, and its effect on Australian agriculture. It is true that not all Americans understand what is happening in regard to the damage to our industry and in terms of the price they pay as taxpayers of that nation. There are a couple of recommendations in the report which are very important and very sensible. One of them states:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Delegation recommends that the Australian Government commission a detailed study of the costs to American consumers, and to producers in related industries, of the current United States agricultural subsidies and import restrictions on agricultural produce.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The results of the study should be

       That is a practical way in which we will begin to turn around the unfortunate position we have in regard to our agricultural production and how it suffers because of the policies of the EEC and USA.

        We also looked at the way in which Austrade operated in America. We made a further recommendation which relates to looking at some of the old areas in which Austrade has operated for so many years. Those resources could be better utilised in other areas which have a very promising futureâ€”that is, the area of Seattle and on the west coast of America on the Pacific rim. These are a couple of very useful recommendations which should go into the record.

        He went further to talk about security which was also of concern to the delegation and our country. He clearly said that the US would continue to be involved in the Pacific as our allies and it would continue to provide its contribution to the security of that area, which is so important to us. He said that all areas of cooperation between our countries were  vital and that we must not only continue that but also enhance cooperation and make it stronger.

There the government made a formal response to the issue of local government councillors and the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislationâ€”an issue which I must acknowledge was raised by the Australian Democrats at the time. This response was instrumental in gaining the Australian Democrats' support for the superannuation guarantee charge legislation package last year.

         The government's response went on to state that local councillors who received a monthly payment for attending meetings would not be covered by the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act. These statements were made in a report issued June 1992, some 15 months ago or more. The government's apparent intention at the time to exclude these particular councillors is clearly set out in a letter that the former Minister for Local Government, the honourable David Simmons, wrote to local councils in July 1992. His letter stated:

        Honourable senators should note the distinction between that and allowances. Yet section 12(10) of the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act unequivocally states that a person who holds office as a member of a local government council is an employee of that council. Further, the definition of local government councillors' salaries or wages in section 11(1)(e) is so wide as to include mere allowances paid in respect of attending council meetings.

         What conclusion can then be drawn from the sharp contradiction between the legislation and the government's statement which has been made more than once on the public record. It is generally accepted that the government's failure to effect its promises on this particular issue is not a result of political dishonesty. Is it just pure indolence?

         It confers no credit on a government when an opposition has to be relied upon to repair legislatively the damage wrought by the government's inability to execute properly its own promises. It is fortunate that the opposition's spokesman on local government, Senator Macdonald, has proved to be equal to the task of remedying the government's carelessness. He has introduced a bill which effectively and succinctly removes those local government councillors who receive only limited allowances arising from the execution of their duties from the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation. Such a result is consonant with the reasonable and intelligent view that councillors whose substantive form of employment or work is not with a council of which they are members and whose payment reflects this reality, cannot then be considered, according to Senator Macdonald, as employees.

         The Income Tax Assessment Act articulates this view of their proper status by virtue of section 221A(1). This interpretation section specifically excludes payments by way of remuneration or allowances to a member of a local governing body from the meaning of `salary or wages' under the PAYE system. Therefore, to argue that to remove local government councillors of the type with which we are concerned from the ambit of the superannuation guarantee charge is discriminatory or confers some sectional interest is to misapprehend the nature of their employment as well as their remuneration.

         In conclusion, while this is just one problem caused by the superannuation guarantee charge, it is a problem which I believe is very easily remedied by this private member's bill introduced by my colleague Senator Macdonald. I believe that there are greater and more serious problems with compulsory superannuation, but their very gravity means that they are more intractable, at least in so far as it is within the opposition's power to effect a change in the short term. Further, it is a problem which the government has admitted and has promised to fix. The government should, on the basis of its own words, have no difficulty in accepting the amendments in Senator Macdonald's private member's bill.

         We cannot afford, in effect, to penalise those who seek to serve the community as local government representatives for no real remuneration. This clearly is what the present provisions do. I therefore commend the amendments in this private member's bill, organised by my colleague Senator Macdonald, which overcome this very unsatisfactory situation. I commend the private member's bill to all my colleagues in the Senate.

        That is relevant to local government councillors. It is a first step in looking at the typical sort of salary that the legislation would refer to.

        Those of us who read and took note of that commentâ€”this included Senator Cheryl Kernot and Senator Richard Alstonâ€”rightly assumed that that would be the way to get the technical defect addressed.

We therefore welcome that amendment.

         â€”I do not know whether to apologise or to spend time regaling the Senate with the wonderful time that I had there. One of the things that gave me the experience to comment on this particular situation is that the assumptions made in much of the decision making connected with this matter do not apply to that council at least. Even payments for attending meetings did not exist. The elected members of that council were not in receipt of such payments. In fact, no cash payments whatsoever were made. However, some benefits were derived. One was simply the replacement of petrol used in travelling on council business and another was the sharing of council meals during meetings. I would be struggling to evaluate those benefits. I hardly think that would qualify the elected members to be classified as employees.

The only reason I am raising it in this bill is that it specifically and very seriously affects local government, although perhaps not in Hobart City Council's case. As Senator Bell rightly said, some councillors in some states do not receive any `payment'â€”whether it be remuneration, allowances or reimbursements.

But in some instances elected representatives of local government do receive payments, usually a very small amount such as $3,000 or $4,000 and perhaps even $6,000 to $10,000. Of course, there are some, like the Brisbane City Council, whose elected representatives receives salaries equal to those received by federal parliamentarians. There are other councillors who receive various intermediate amounts.

         As my friends Senator Watson and Senator Bell have pointed out, the anomaly which came to light still has not been corrected in this legislation. This is in spite of the very clear intention of the government and in spite of assurances by Mr Simmons before the election, in a letter which we have tabled previously, and in a press release which I have only recently come across and which I might seek leave to incorporate later on.

         The matter was referred to the Taxation Office for a determination. That determination said: `No. It doesn't do what everyone thought it would do'. The effect of it, very briefly, is that those councillors who receive a payment and whose councils pay the superannuation guarantee charge on that payment are then prevented from claiming their own contributions to their own personal superannuation schemes as a tax deduction. For their contribution to society and for being good people and making a contribution in their own local community they are being penalised. I think that is terribly unfair.

Senator Watson, of course, as even Senator Robert Ray acknowledges, has seriously looked at this issue and understood itâ€”and many do not understand taxation or superannuation issues. We all know that if Senator Watson understands it and makes a contribution, we are going on the right track.

         It is a very technical matter. I will amend my own bill in the committee stage because, since introducing the bill, I have had a further look at it. I have had some advice and I have spoken to the local government peak bodies around Australia and they have made some suggestions to me. As a result of that, we have drafted some amendments, but the effect of the amendments will, together with the original bill that I have presented, try to fix the anomalous situation that has resulted.

        In the second reading of this Bill, I highlighted the anomaly that exists relating to the existing Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (SGAA), requiring the Superannuation Levy to be paid to elected Councillors and Aldermen who receive allowances. The result is that Councillors and Aldermen then do not comply with the definition of an "eligible person" in Section 82AAS(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act (ITAA) and cannot claim a tax deduction for any personal contribution.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Only an "eligible person" can claim deductions for private superannuation and you are not an "eligible person" if Lo% or more of your income comes from a source which provides to you employer funded superannuation support.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This consequently disallows Councillors and Aldermen from claiming in their income tax return, a deduction of up to $3000 plus 75% of any amount above, for their own personal superannuation contributions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore we have a situation where an Alderman could receive a Council allowance of $6000, have self-employed assessable income of $50000 and would not be entitled to claim any private superannuation contributions as a tax deduction, due to the Council paying the princely sum of $300p.a. in compulsory superannuation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is completely improper and ridiculous that many hard-working community conscious citizens are actually financially discriminated against by this Federal Labor Government, preventing them from claiming the tax deduction they would get if they weren't on their Local Council.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Local Government strives to be a partner in governing the community while the Federal Government appears to be working against this concept. The Government continues to impose rules and regulations on Local Government that make its task difficult and sometimes impossible to administer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In his press release dated 2nd July 1992, the then Minister for Local Government, the Hon. David Simmons said "The approach taken by the Government (regarding the SGAA relating to Councillors) is consistent with that taken in respect of Fringe Benefits Tax, which does not apply to elected members because they are not employees of councils.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Now we are already into the second financial year since this legislation took effect and Labor's attempt to overcome this anomaly, was to change the word "payments" to "remuneration" in the definition of salary and wages in the SGAA. This has only created more confusion and concern, leading to the Australian Taxation Office issuing a Draft Superannuation Guarantee Determination, SGD 93/D4.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this Determination the Taxation Commissioner has ignored the clear intention of the Parliament and deemed in the strictest technical sense that Local Government Councillors are in the employ of the Council and allowances paid to Councillors are salary or wages for the purposes of the SGAA.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This actually contravenes some State Local Government Acts which specifically provide that a Councillor cannot be in the employ of the council with disqualification as the penalty. Employees of Councils are also expressly excluded from standing for election to the council by which they are employed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clearly, the relationship between a Councillor and a Council bears little resemblance to that existing between an employer and its employee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The two tests at common law show why councillors should not be regarded as "employees".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no Master/Servant relationship and most Councillors are employed in another occupation or are involved in other activities. Council work is therefore not the predominant activity more an extracurricular activity, where they are giving up the free time to benefit the community in which they live.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has agreed Councillors are not employees and the former Minister for Local Government has also stated "As far as Local Government is concerned, the new superannuation contributions will apply only to Brisbane City councillors who are in receipt of salaries." At least, that was their stated intentâ€”but their legislative changes have not achieved this.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So the Labor Party has still not lived up to their promise to move amendments that overcome anomalies in the SGAA relating to Local Government members.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Council members who are not full-time in the job and whose main source of income comes from their own business activities should not lose their ability to deduct private superannuation contributions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given that none of these payments are "salary or wages" under ordinary concepts, and the fact that Councillors are not "employees" at common law, the neatest approach is to allow Councillors to elect whether they are caught by the SGAA without using such terms as "allowance" and "fee" which vary in usage from State to State.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore the SGAA should allow Councillors to elect whether they are caught by the SGAA to extinguish the present injustice denying Local Government Councillors the right to claim their personal superannuation contributions as a tax deduction. This then allows Councillors who wish not to be paid the SGC the opportunity to opt out.

(The only change from the present legislation being that an election must be made).

        2.

It is the duty of the Auditor-General's office to scrutinise government on behalf of parliament. We all know that in the last few years the power of the executive government has risen tremendously and that the Auditor-General, basically, was caught between two conflicting duties: firstly, to the executive government, which had the purse strings and had the control of the resources available to the Auditor-General; and, secondly, his acknowledged duty to provide reports on scrutiny of government departments and the activities of government generally to the parliament. It is therefore very fitting that the Auditor-General be made an officer of the parliament.

         The two main difficulties that that report identified were the resource constraints that I have mentionedâ€”and successive Auditors-General have seen fit to draw attention to thatâ€”and the fact that the Auditor-General really must, in particular, examine the unit that allocates resources, that is, the Department of Finance.

         The public accounts committee identified five major reasons underlying the Auditor-General's main problems. The first is parliamentary complacency. The second is the conflict between the two duties to the legislature and to the executive. As Senator Watson says, complacency of the legislature is something that this bill seeks to remedy and that is why the Democrats are supporting it. Another is the lack of a mechanism which, according to the public accounts committee, would allow parliament to assume responsibility for the office. Clearly, this is something that we are rectifying today. There is also a lack of awareness of the importance of the audit of government activities.

         I wonder whether that latter point has not gradually over the last few years become less apparent. It seems to me that the tabling of consecutive audit reports in this chamber at least has drawn attention to the work of the Auditor-General. The importance of the work of that office in keeping a tight check and scrutiny of government activities has, I think, been reinforced. I do not wish to detain the chamber. I repeat that the Democrats will, for all the reasons I have outlined,  support this bill.

       Last Friday, ministers or their representatives from the coalition states met here with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) on the proposed industrial relations legislation. At best, I believe it can be described as a fiasco or an exercise in futility. The points the ministers or their representatives put and the concerns they had were not given consideration. In fact, they went away, having been told that the legislation would proceed regardless of their states' views. I want to touch on the key points of concern that they raised with regard to this legislation.

        Firstly, the proposals will not bring the flexibility so urgently needed in the labour market. Regrettably, the proposals will allow enterprise agreements only when they relate to the equivalent of over-award paymentsâ€”and I emphasise that point. Secondly, the proposed system is extremely complicated and will not assist micro-economic reform or aid real change in the workplace. Thirdly, the bargaining position of unions has been greatly enhanced, and the totality of the measures has placed employers in a vulnerable position. This will not encourage employers to hire additional labour.

        Fourthly, the watering down of the current sanctions relating to secondary boycotts and their removal from the Trade Practices Act is not warranted. The 72-hour provisions are unacceptable and could lead to the businesses of employers being unnecessarily harmed. Fifthly, meaningful recognition has not been given to the needs of the large non-unionised section of the work force. Sixth, the complexity of the various layers of awards and agreements with seemingly different procedures applicable to each will create confusion and will be an unnecessary burden. Those are the key points from that meeting. To me, they are the crux of the requirements if we are to address proper flexible market labour reform in this nation.

        The first point I make is that Mr Brereton, the Minister for Industrial Relations, promised all state governments the opportunity for consultation. Mr Brereton used the words `detailed and meaningful' when referring to that consultation. This offer was made in April 1993. This consultation has never occurredâ€”and I emphasise thatâ€”and yet today, the industrial relations bill was brought into the other place. It is because of this lack of consultation that the states' views have not been taken into account and, as a result, the states have become very irritated. All this is from a government that consistently talks about the consultative approach, about negotiation, about coming to an agreement and about taking into consideration all the various points of view that are raised.

       As we work through this process we find there has been a total lack of any meaningful consultation as far as this legislation is concerned; in fact, it is just a ramrod exercise. But we find it extends a little further. Just last month, the Victorian, Western Australian and Tasmanian labour ministers met and issued a joint statement attacking Mr Brereton for `failing to consult with them on industrial relations reform'. When looking through these comments we find that it is not only the coalition states which are raising concern as to this particular legislation, it is also the Labor states.

        We know from that statement by Labor ministers a month or so ago that they have now had the opportunity to provide input into the legislation, but none of the conservative states have. So I say to the government, and to Mr Brereton in particular, `You will listen to your mates but you won't listen to all the other people with regard to this legislation and how it impacts on the states and what will come out of it'. I have no doubt that the way this legislation has been handled will not improve the position with regard to enterprise agreements; it will not improve the culture in the workplace; it will not encourage non-union work forces to go into enterprise agreementsâ€”the legislation will, in fact, make it totally unattractive for them to go into enterprise agreements.

        Minimum standards set by the federal government overriding state legislation is wrong. This issue should be solved between the federal and state governments cooperatively and harmoniously by negotiation, by discussion, by consultation, by give and take, and by all the things that are needed to get all parties working and pushing in the same direction. That will not come from this. Over the coming 12 to 18 months we will see this legislation being challenged consistently through the courts of this land.

As I have said before and I will say again, we in this country should be capable of putting together our own domestic law without going offshore to find out what we should do. I find it absolutely remarkable that those on the other side of this chamber and in the government in the other place have neither the brain power nor the will to address these problems without having to go somewhere else to get judgments to find out what to do; in other words, to get their marching orders.

That will be a real challenge for them, and I believe it is a challenge that they will not accept.

        The way in which the non-union sector will be treated is unacceptable. The fact that a union must be involved whether or not an employee is a member of a union is absolutely intolerable.

        All that these restrictions, barriers and red tape that have been put in the way will do is scare off not only employers but also employees. Something like 70 per cent of the employees in the work force do not want to be part of the union movement, and that is their right. Equallyâ€”and we have said this consistentlyâ€”it is their right to join a union if they wish. This means that proper and serious involvement in true enterprise bargaining will be very limited. This element, along with many others, is and will be very limiting and inflexible. The coalition states feel that flexibility is an absolute must in this area. Of course, the Commonwealth government, by trying to override them by using the external affairs power, will limit this flexibility.

        A further example of inflexibility is the requirement for the agreement of at least 51 per cent of employees. What happens if 49 per cent do not agree?

I think that is a reasonable proposition. I would like to hear the arguments against it. I believe that if part of the work force wishes to take that action, it should be able to. That would be a modern approach to industrial relationsâ€”not the sort of approach we are getting now.

Western Australia has the most soil conservation districts.

The federal government is once again saying, `If you don't do what we say, we will take your money away from you'. That is how this government operates.

Less than 30 per cent of workers in the private sector are trade union members. Even if their leaders support this package, it is unlikely that all their rank and file members do. The business sector, encompassing both large and small businesses, is implacably opposed to the changes in their present form. But has the government consulted with business and adopted proposals to allay its fears? Not on your nelly. But it did consult with, and listen to, the unions. At their behest, it made significant changes to its initial proposals.

        As this motion, which my colleague Senator Crane has moved, clearly highlights, the ministers for industrial relations in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory published a joint statement last week detailing their concerns about the federal government's industrial relations package and, like the employers, concerns about the lack of consultation in the development of the package. Among the points made in the statement, they have highlighted the fact that the ACTUâ€”the union movementâ€”is the only group that has been permitted to have any real say on the package. Thus the protection of trade union interests is the clear purpose of this industrial relations package.

        Australia's greatest need is to dramatically improve labour productivity. From 1982 to 1991, Australia's overall labour productivity grew by less than nine per cent, which is less than one per cent per year. This is less than half the rate of increase in labour productivity of the G7 nationsâ€”the major industrial countriesâ€”for that period. No wonder our standard of living has fallen under this Labor government.

        Productivity improvement requires that an employer and his employees develop a shared vision for the business on which they are all dependent. It requires an end to the `us and them' mentality, which has bedevilled Australian industrial relations for a century and which is fostered by trade unions, because they know that that is the only way they can remain relevant. The introduction of genuine voluntary agreements through enterprise bargaining, without the unilateral right of uninvited third parties to be involved, is the best way of achieving this.

As with the business sector and employers earlier, last Friday's meeting between the federal Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the state industrial relations ministers was designed to give the appearance of consultation. But the reality of consultation was not there. It was all a facade. At their April meeting, all states offered to talk and work with the federal government to reach agreement for national uniformity, particularly with regard to minimum employment standards, in the development of this industrial relations package. But this government is having none of that. Instead, it has adopted threats and a big stick approach in ignoring legitimate concerns expressed by the states.

        I will go straight to the question of consultation, which is the crux of the issues raised by Senator Crane, who says that both the government and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) never consulted with the states or, indeed, with any of the employer representatives or organisations around this country. The Prime Minister announced on 2 December 1992 that the government would legislate to guarantee workers' rights to fair minimum wages, equal pay for work of equal value, and protection against unfair dismissal. This legislation was to be based on relevant International Labour Organisation conventions using the external affairs powers of the constitution. These issues were discussed at a meeting of state premiers in Perth later in December.

State ministers were given an assurance that they would have an opportunity to comment on the legislation before it was introduced into the parliament.

They allow Australian workplaces to implement cooperatively and constructively the changes needed to compete with the best companies in the world. The legislation provides employers with the flexibility they need to improve productivity and compete internationally while recognisingâ€”a very fundamental pointâ€”that employee protection is crucial to the success of enterprise bargaining. Nothing that Senator Crane or Senator Chapman said reflected that. They said that we have to free up the labour market and make real change. What does real change mean to those on the other side of the fence? It means cutting wages and making sure the boss has the upper hand and has the whip over his workers.

        The issue of sections 45D and 45E has been going on for a long time. It was clearly the majority view of the committee that inquired into it that it has been used as a big stick and as a punitive measure against workers pursuing their legitimate rights. It is now going to be put in its right placeâ€”that is, in the Industrial Relations Act. That is where it should be dealt with because it is clearly a much fairer way of dealing with the legitimate rights of workers to pursue the issues that are important to them, such as their working conditions. It also provides protection for workers who may well be in a situation where the Industrial Relations Commission is not able to settle the issue. The 72-hour issue is, quite frankly, a very fair proposal. If we looked at all of the disputes that have happened over the time of the Industrial Relations Act, we would find that in many instances, even in the case of actions under sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, they have been resolved outside 72 hours.

        â€”I would like to support Senator Crane's motion. Irrespective of the flowery words of people such as Senator Murphy, this government is seeking to entrench union power in the hands of a few union heaviesâ€”no more, no less. That is what it is all about. It is all about a pay-off for the most dishonest campaign run by the union movement for the last election. We all know what happened; we were there. We saw them go to the workplaces; we had people phone us up. Nurses came to see us and said, `Do you know the union came to see us and said, "If you vote Liberal you're going to lose your job"?'. That is totally dishonestâ€”the normal way the trade union movement operates in this place.

        One of the things that everyone is aware of is that 70 per cent of people in the private sector are not union members, and they do not want to be. In my lifetime I have worked in all areas of the economy. I have worked in non-union shops and I had my own business at one time where a number of employees were union members and they continued to be union members because they were in a trade where they required a union ticket if they wanted to go back to it. They had to go back to a closed shop. It was the ultimate lack of freedom.

        I should tell Senator Murphy what our policy does. It simply entrenches the right of individual Australians within this society to decide whether they want to be a union member or whether they want to resign. I would have thought that that was a basic freedom that a democratic country such as Australia desired. What is the government frightened of? Why are the unions frightened? Why is the government entrenching union power? If it was good enough, people would willingly join. There is nothing more coercive and more of an attack on the freedom of individuals in this country than a closed shop.

        I listened to the claims of honourable senators oppositeâ€”the union apparatchiksâ€”the other day. I do not want to name them because I might be wrong; it might have been Senator Burns. They were saying that union membership was not compulsory. What a joke! This is what the whole enterprise bargaining system is about. The so-called free enterprise bargaining of the non-unionised sector is saying, `Yes, you can apply for an enterprise agreement but we are going to get a union heavy there and if he doesn't like it, he will have the power of veto'.

        If Senator Murphy were genuine about doing the right thing by the 70 per cent of people who do not want to be members of unions, he would facilitate their ability to make an agreement with their own employer on the basis that the relationship between an employer and employee is important. They know that if they are successful and their business is successful their jobs will be secure, rather than the opposite, which would occur under the government. But they do not want that.

        In his speech Senator Murphy said that Queensland was not mentioned. I was delighted to hear him say that. Senator Burns will attest to the fact that about 80 or 90 per cent of the employees of the Metway Bank in Queensland decided they wanted to have an enterprise agreement with their management. What happened? The unions put on the greatest stunt we have seen in our lives. They demanded that there be union representation. They tried to get them pushed into the federal jurisdiction, as honourable senators opposite are probably aware. They tried every trick in the book. The members themselves hung out because they knew they could get a better deal. The Metway Bank then came under sustained attack by the monkeys in Queenslandâ€”the members of the Labor Partyâ€”at the request of the organ grinders in the trade union movement who said, `You've got to get Metway because it will not allow the unions to participate in this process'.

        The unions got the bank money-wise. They used a piece of legislation to take from the Metway Bank $18 million which rightfully belonged to it.

The man who is now the Prime Minister of this country pulled the levers, jacked up interest rates to stop imports coming into Australia, shot all the innocent bystanders and created unemployment.

This is the typical bullying that one expects from a closed shop union meeting.

It was interesting that only about a month ago his union decided to pull every coal miner in Australia out on strike. They went on strike because they did not like the price that BHP was getting for coal being exported to Turkey. Every coal miner in Australia went on strike. I was contacted by miners from the Hunter Valley and from the Bowen Basin, which is in my state.

It was nothing to do with them because they had not sold the coal to Turkey. The coal miners were pulled out against their will, production was down, our reputation as an overseas supplier suffered yet again and the union decided it would not have a four-day strike, it would have a three-day strike. I understand that the companies have withdrawn the section 45D and 45E process and have not proceeded with the damages, but it was there as a deterrent. That decision was made on 20 August.

I reiterate that, if this government is serious about tackling unemployment, creating real jobs, creating real full-time jobs and not giving incentives to people to go for the casual and part-time work, it must grasp the nettle, make its own decisions and not do things simply at the whim of a couple of union bosses who are not interested in their own workers and who are not interested in the unemployed.

        â€”The Acting Deputy President has made his ruling. Historically the trade unions have played a role in society because of the dictatorial attitudes of employers. They had to come into existence to protect the rights of employees, were given pretty poor wages and unsafe and unhealthy working conditions. So the unions had to come into existence to protect people in that area.

        I want to answer some criticisms that have been made by Senator Parer. He talked about compulsory unionism. It is true that in some awards there is preference to unionists at the point of engagement and at the point of dismissal, but certainly not during the period of employment. There is no law which says that someone should be in an union, but it is also true that there are certain agreements in some workplaces where people are expected to join the union and, indeed, give an undertaking to do so voluntarily when they join that organisation.

        I have had experience in these matters; no-one on the other side of the chamber has. I recall going to a metal workshop in Brisbane. I sought to convince people that it was in their interests to join a union. Those workers said that they did not want to join the union, that they had a good employer and that they were happy the way they were. So I left the workshop. There was no further action or no further request made to them. But six months later, when that employer behaved badly towards them, they rang the union office and asked to become members. I went out there and, on their behalf, took up the problems they had and I was able to solve them. Those people are members of that union today.

        Senator Parer also talked about job creation and unemployment reduction. These are quite different in this day and age because while many hundreds of thousands jobs have been created in recent years, they have not reduced the unemployment level for some time because of increased productivity, better management practices and better technology. So, creating jobs does not guarantee any reduction in unemployment. I have not heard anyone talking about labour costs being a problem. That is probably because labour costs in European countries and Japan, for instance, are much higher than they are in Australia. In fact, we are in a fairly competitive position.

       The penalties are in there. Do not tell me that is mollycoddling trade unions. During the years of the Menzies government and following years, there were always penalties in the Industrial Relations Act which made it illegal for workers to go on strike. That included safety issues where people's lives and health were at stake. The penalty was there. People were not entitled legally to go on strike even to protect their health or their lives. That has changed since the Labor government has come into power and there is now an opportunity to discuss the issues on merit and reach some conclusion.

         Mr President, this bill follows on from the changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which were passed by the Parliament during the Autumn Sittings earlier this year and more recently at the commencement of the current Budget Sittings. It gives effect to the remaining major changes to the Act that are necessary to implement the totality of the reform package flowing from the Commission's review of the operation of the Act.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments in this bill, together with those which have already received Assent, establish a leaner, tighter and more effective organisation, with devolved decision making going hand-in-hand with improved accountability. As a result ATSIC's ability to provide a vehicle for indigenous self determination becomes even more firmly established. As we have seen in the last few weeks that means ATSIC's evolution as an organisation able not only to manage Commonwealth programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities but also to negotiate on policy with an independent and forceful political voice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill provides, in essence, for:

        Honourable Senators will recall that when the second package of amendments was introduced at the commencement of the current Sittings, it was foreshadowed that a further bill encompassing these further reforms would be introduced during these Sittings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This third package of amendments, like those introduced earlier this year, flow from recommendations contained in the Commission's report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the operation of the Act. These amendments, which build on the reforms already agreed to by Parliament, will further enhance the representative nature of the organisation, strengthen the role of the Regional Councils as the linchpins of empowerment for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and reinforce the Commission's established commitment to high standards of scrutiny and accountability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reforms are based on the Government's commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self determination and our confidence in indigenous people managing their own  affairs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I turn now to the major provisions of the present bill and in doing so I draw to the Senate's attention that the bill is large and it is not possible to set out in great detail many of the changes. Those that are of a substantive nature I will deal with more fully.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Office of Evaluation and Audit
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill substantially widens the powers of the Office of Evaluation and Audit, increasing the ability of the Minister and the Commission to have examined the financial management of ATSIC funded organisations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It provides for an expansion in the functions of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include the evaluation and audit of the operations of Aboriginal Hostels Limited, the Commercial Development Corporation, and the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority as well as the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, the bill includes provision to enable the Minister and the Commission to direct the Office of Evaluation and Audit to investigate the operations of Regional Councils, in addition to the above bodies, and in certain cases, ATSIC and TSRA grant and loan recipients. Provision is also made for the Director of Evaluation and Audit to have greater powers to examine documents.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also includes a number of clauses relating to the Director of Evaluation and Audit amendments including provision for the period of appointment, remuneration and allowances, leave of absence, disclosure of interests, resignation, termination of appointment of the Director of Evaluation and Audit, aligning these with similar provisions for other full time statutory officer holders under the Principal Act. Provision is also made for an acting Director and for the Director to be immune from personal liability in an action or other proceeding for damages in relation to anything done in his/her official capacity. These provisions are largely administrative in nature and serve to correct an anomaly in the existing Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chief Executive Officer
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill amends the period of appointment of the Chief Executive Officer by setting a maximum period of appointment rather than a minimum. This is in accordance with standard appointment provisions in most legislation establishing statutory appointments. It also requires the CEO to report his/her interests to the Commission Chairperson rather than the full Board of the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Advisory Committees
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill includes amendments relating to membership of Advisory Committees and the members of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board. The amendments include provisions for the  disclosure of interests at meetings, resignations, and termination of the members of these bodies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments relating to Regional Council Administrators
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Provision is made in the bill to set the terms and conditions for an Administrator to hold office. This was omitted from the Principal Act and is largely an administrative matter. The provisions include full-time appointment consistent with the move to full time Regional Council Chairpersons, disclosure of interests, resignation, leave of absence, and suspension and termination of appointment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consistent with the Government's commitment to greater self determination and self management, provision has been made for the Commission rather than the Minister to appoint Administrators. Provision is also made for an acting Administrator and for the Commission to appoint a replacement Administrator if there is a vacancy in an office of the Administrator.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Commercial Development Corporation
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are a number of amendments relating to the CDC. These are largely technical in nature and tidy up the Principal Act to bring it more into line with current drafting procedures. The bill provides for at least one Director to be an ATSIC Commissioner, for the period of appointments not to exceed five years, and for the termination of appointment of  a Director of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Taxation
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill includes provision for exempting ATSIC from the payment of excise duty which would otherwise be payable by the Commission, or by any other person, on goods that are for use by the Commission. The current arrangement whereby ATSIC is required to pay excise duty is inconsistent with other Government agencies and it is only reasonable that the Act be amended to bring the organisation into line with other Commonwealth Departments and agencies.

        Aboriginal Hostels Limited
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to note that AHL is not a statutory organisation established under the Principal Act, but a company funded through ATSIC. The Government considers that it is essential that AHL be subject to the same level of scrutiny and accountability and to the same administrative review mechanisms as ATSIC. Provisions are included in the bill to this end.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable Senators will note that the bill before them includes provision for Division 2 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901 to apply to Aboriginal Hostels Limited and that certain decisions of an administrative character made at the Director level are made subject to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.

        Secrecy Provisions
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the interests of privacy and in recognition of the very sensitive personal information that may become available to certain office holders within ATSIC, the Government has agreed with the Commission's proposal that section 90 of the Principal Act be extended to apply to the Director of Evaluation and Audit, a member of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, a Regional Councillor, a member of an Advisory Committee established under section 96 and an Administrator. It will also extend the secrecy provisions to the Torres Strait Regional Authority when it commences on 1 July 1994.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regional Council Estimates Processes and Reporting Requirements
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill includes provisions to strengthen the annual reporting requirements of Regional Councils. As a result of the proposed amendments Regional Councils will be obliged to provide to the Commission an Annual Report dealing with the operations of the Regional Council during the year, the implementation during that year of the Regional Plan, details of grants made from Regional Council budgets during the year and any other matters relating to that year as the Commission determines in writing. The Annual Report and Regional Plan are required to be made available for inspection and purchase by residents of the Region.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, provision is made in the bill to require Regional Councils to have regard to their Regional Plans when preparing their Draft Budgets. This linkage is considered necessary because of the increased powers which Regional Councils will have over the disbursement of Commission funds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Delegations
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill makes provision for a number of changes to the power of delegation under the Principal Act. Some of the changes relate to administrative matters. I refer in particular to the proposal to enable the Commission to delegate to the Director of Evaluation and Audit its powers for the appointment of Consultants under Section 56 and also to enable the Chief Executive Officer power to sub-delegate functions or powers to a member of the staff of the Commission. However the more important aspect of the amendments relates to the enhanced responsibilities given to Regional Councils.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the key recommendations of the Commission in its report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was the need for greater empowerment of Regional Councils. The bill provides for the Commission to delegate to a Regional Council its powers to approve funds and issue guarantees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These powers are not unfettered. It is important that Honourable Senators note that these delegated powers will be subject to any written directions by the Commission and are accompanied by sanctions to protect the interests of the Government, ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Provision is also made to empower the Commission Chairperson to suspend delegations to Regional Councils in certain cases.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        General Funding Powers
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another of the key recommendations of the Commission was the need to simplify funding powers of the Commission. This bill spells out the new and simplified arrangements.  I must reiterate to Honourable Senators that it is neither the Commission's nor the Government's intention to in any way water down accountability requirements either to the Parliament or to  the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whom the Commission represents. Indeed the effect of the amendments is to enhance that accountability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are concerned, however, over the current complex and inflexible provisions and propose that they be amended to enable the Commission to more successfully fulfil the functions imposed upon it by the principal Act. As the Government has stated on a number of occasions, true self-determination is fundamental to the success of the Commission and it is in pursuit of this that these amendments are put before the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In essence the changes enable the Commission to make a grant of money or grant an interest in land or grant an interest in personal property or make a loan of money to any body corporate or unincorporated organisation. In certain cases this power extends to individuals. Regional Councils and the Torres Strait Regional Authority cannot be recipients. This provision is accompanied by a requirement that such grants, loans and guarantees may only be made for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For purposes of enhanced scrutiny the bill also requires the Commission to formulate decision making principles about the giving of grants, loans and guarantees. Funding must only be made in accordance with these decision making principles. The Chief Executive Officer must cause a notice of the making of decision making principles to be published in the Gazette. He must also ensure that copies of the decision making principles which are in force are given to each Regional Council and are available for inspection and purchase at each of the Commission's offices.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Corporate Plan
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the important technical amendments which the Commission has suggested is the need to remove the direct link between the Commission's Corporate Plan and the procedures for the engagement of Consultants. The bill proposes that this link be severed. Instead, the Commission will be required to set out the criteria and standard terms and conditions for the engagement of Consultants by way of written instrument and to notify the making of the instrument in the Gazette.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Staff and Consultants
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the second amending bill passed earlier in these sittings wards were created for the purposes of electing Regional Councillors. This present bill includes consequent provisions which prohibit a member of the staff of the Commission or a Consultant to the Commission standing for election, or being elected, as a member for a Regional Council Ward.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Draft Budgets
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides for simplification of the draft budget, and  the estimates processes involved, for both the Commission and Regional Councils. Consistent with the proposed streamlining of funding provisions, the bill reduces the number of elements required in the Commission's estimates of expenditure.

        As I have mentioned earlier, both the Commission and the Government wish to maintain and enhance the accountability requirements. Included in this bill are amendments which strengthen the responsibility of the Commission and Regional Councils. The bill provides for the Commission to remove Regional Councils from office in certain situations.  These include the Regional Council's failure to perform its functions, failure to comply with the Draft Budgets requirements, failure to meet the Annual Reporting requirement, or contravention of a delegation from the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provisions require that, before this power is invoked, the Commission must provide the Regional Council with a notice setting out the reasons for its proposed course of action and giving 28 days in which to show cause why the Regional Councillors should not be removed. It is hoped that any dispute in connection with these matters can be resolved within the 28 day period and that it will not be necessary to remove the Regional Councillors.

        Provision is also made for an appointment of an Administrator to administer the affairs of the Regional Council where the Regional Councillors have been removed from office. It is the intention of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to make Election Rules to provide for a by-election to be held within a period of twelve months from the date that a Regional Council is removed under the new section 123A.

        This is perhaps one of the most significant changes proposed in the bill. The Government is taking up the Commission's recommendation that the Torres Strait region be dealt with separately from other Regions and has included in the bill clauses establishing a Torres Strait Regional Authority. This Authority will supersede the Torres Strait Regional Council. This section of the bill is quite lengthy and I ask that Honourable Senators study it carefully as it is a significant demonstration of the Government's commitment to the empowerment of one of Australia's two distinct indigenous peoples.

        As foreshadowed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs when he introduced the ATSIC Amendment Bill No. 2 earlier in the current sittings this bill contains a further major reform in the establishment of an independent electoral review process.

        As far as the review of boundaries is concerned, the panel will call for submissions from interested persons and make draft boundary recommendations.

        Mr President, this final package of reforms gives effect to the remaining aspects of the major changes to the Act contained in the Commission's Review Report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the operation of the Act.

        Wool recession conditions, particularly among some of our biggest wool customers such as Russia and China, mean that the demand for wool during the last two or three years has not been as high as previous levels. However, medium- and long-term predictions for demand indicate that demand for the product will be reasonable. When we take into account that income growth in developing countries, especially in cold climate countries such as China, Turkey and Korea, will be considerable in the next decade, there is a great opportunity for the marketing and promotion of this great fibre.

        â€”This package of bills is a reflection of the increasing and continuing difficulties being experienced in the wool industry right across Australia and, to an extent, around the world. Wool has always enjoyed a special position in the hearts and minds of all Australians and for years the claim that Australia was riding to success on the back of our sheep industry was as popular as it was true.

        Australia is the largest wool producing country in the world and is also the largest exporter. Our production accounts for 30 per cent of the world production and just under 60 per cent of all exports of wool. Over the last 50 years, sheep numbers and wool production have fluctuated due to a range of factors. Prices have moved similarly, moving as low as 354c a kilo in 1970 and something like 690c a kilo in 1987-88. Let us not forget the floor price of 870c a kilo just prior to the big crash at the end of the 1980s.

        The 1980s will long be remembered as some of the most heady years in the history of wool. Demand was strong and the reserve price scheme was in operation and climbing and few stopped to think that it would ever collapse. Indeed, just prior to the series of events that ultimately saw the collapse and the removal of the reserve price scheme in 1990, ABARE was advising growers at its 1989 outlook conference:

       That was only three years ago. It was only three years ago that we debated what we thought then was the most difficult piece of legislation affecting the industry. I said in the Senate during the debate that the words spoken in this chamber would long be forgotten while the impact of what has been decided lives on. I said then that the stockpile was overhanging the market and that we must have a look to our consumers. These sentiments apply also to the legislation before us today. This package of eight bills may well be as momentous and as history making as the collapse of the reserve price scheme was in 1990.

I hope history also records that as legislators we had to do what we thought collectively was best at the time and that, like ABARE, we are not infallible. The Senate, quite appropriately in my view, referred this package of bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for review. It did that notwithstanding that the legislation was not opposed. By doing so, it reflected a concern both within and outside this place about aspects of the legislation.

        That opposition and concern was well highlighted in the hearings last Friday when representatives of growers, processors, marketers and exporters came and put their views to the committee. Those views could best be summarised as caution about the role of Wool International, the buyback provisions of Wool International and the fixed disposal schedule. Given that time is short, I will keep my remarks brief.

        The Wool International Bill establishes a fixed schedule for the disposal of the stockpile by Wool International. The Wool Council of Australia, representing growers, is very happy with this. It supports a fixed schedule because it sees real benefits in it. Professor Garnaut told our committee last Friday that he supported a fixed schedule and was opposed to a minimum schedule because it removed any possibility of an upside, which a fixed schedule provides. DPIE also supported a fixed schedule.

        Opposing such an arrangement was Dr Lionel Ward of the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers. He rejected the view that a fixed disposal schedule offered certainty of supply. He was supported by the International Wool Textile Organisation which suggested:

       In all of this, it is essential to remember that while Australia can produce wool better than anyone else, it matters little if we cannot sell it better than anyone else. As Sir William Gunn, the one-time chairman of the Australian Wool Board and the International Wool Secretariat, said in 1990:

       Dr Lionel Ward reiterated these sentiments last Friday in response to one of my questions, `Can you regulate the market?'. His reply was, `No, you cannot'. That is the crux of the matter and the crux of the dilemma. On all sides you have well-informed, well-intentioned people offering a view. Time alone will tell who is right. My concern is that growers should be aware that this legislation will not alone save the industry from further pain, that actions of the 1980s and the impact of other world events outside the control of Australia must have a consequential reaction and those consequences will be seen during the next few years as we try to get wool production and selling back to a more profitable level.

        Agricultural consultants take a pessimistic view of the proposed outcomes for wool as seen by the Garnaut report. They make the point that the supply-demand situation will remain for the foreseeable futureâ€”in the next year or twoâ€”which will not give the growers the price increase they need to stay in a sustainable position in the industry. They also worry that at the end of the period the wool industry will not have enough supplies to supply the consumer, which might mean that some people in the processing area will turn to synthetics.

        My recent trip to Europe, on which I spoke with various wool processors, brought home to me again and again that the industry must become more commercial in its approach by developing a more market driven response to consumer demands. We have to do a lot more with research; we have to do a lot more with promotion. With our research we must work to make sure that we can have a wool which can be sold to a consumer that is not prickly, that is washable and that can be tumbled dry. All those things that the researchers have done something about already have come through, but are they affordable for the end user?

        The Garnaut report, as Senator Troeth said a moment ago, is a report that has gone into the industry in depth. It also suggests a similar goal as far as those consumer demands and research and promotion are concerned. My concern is that the whole matter is a complex one and that, frankly, we cannot afford to get it wrong. Instability is a deathtrap for any product and any industryâ€”and wool is no exception.

        At the end of the day, the buck stops with the growers. Their representative, the Wool Council of Australia, has endorsed these bills as being the right formula for the industry. On that basis, it is not for us as politicians to ignore those wishes; indeed, it is imperative that we listen to them. It is their industry and their financial future at stake. I congratulate John Anderson, the shadow minister for primary industry, for the amount of work he did in listening to grower groups all over Australia and for the way in which he consulted with the industry.

So they have become the government amendments. They were amendments which were made and passed unanimously. That has been a very important aspect of this legislation. There is being given to the outside world a vision and a confirmation of unanimity of purpose; that there is agreement on the aspects of this legislation; that the government is wanting to portray certainty and stability to the industry, the buyers of this productâ€”and that is of vital importance.

        We certainly have heard people talking about the schedule. I personally favour very strongly a fixed schedule because it gives people an indication and certainty of what the supply coming out of that stockpile will be. We know that the markets are very sensitive to a number of factors, but I think one of the areasâ€”and we must never forget itâ€”is that supply sensitivity is of crucial importance in this industry. Prices can be hedged against in the futures markets. With supply sensitivity the manufacturing industry has to know what will be available so that it can do some forward planning, and this legislation will make that possible.

        On the price side, I have not seen any major price differentiations or fluctuations in the commodities, in the garments that we actually buy. It has not mattered that the price of wool has been at 900c a kilo or at 350c a kilo. It has not made any difference to the price the consumer is paying. Therefore, to me, the price side is not as important as the actual maintaining of very keen and very careful certainty in the supply side.

        I have heard people today talking about infrastructure and other aspects of government policies that might affect it. We also need to remind the states that some of the things they do have an impact upon the infrastructure and the industry. I know only too well what has happened in my own state as far as rail infrastructure goes; that has been absolutely withdrawn and decimated. There is no rail line between Burke and Nyngan; all of the wheatâ€”and there is not much wheatâ€”wool and cotton coming out of that area has to come by road. It is not a terribly economical way to transport those large, bulky commodities.

        I have also spoken recently of the huge price differential between the cost of fuel in country areas and the cost in city areas. This is being addressed by this government in the setting up of the Industry Commission inquiry. I again urge people who are concerned about fuel costs and the differentials to participate in that inquiry because it has been well recognised that that does have an effect on these commodities. There are a number of areas that need to be looked at, not just the government impost but also the problems that have been caused by others who are manipulating and playing with issues.

I hope that the Garnaut report will shed more light on this issue to enable us to address this problem so that the woolgrowers will have fewer overheads when getting their wool to the markets. I also urge the states not to destroy their infrastructure and their rail systems, so that life is not made more difficult for woolgrowers, all of whom have to transport their clips.

        In addressing this legislation, I want to look more at the future than the present, but in the 10 minutes available to me there are a couple of things about the present that I would like to comment on as well. Firstly, I believe it is tragic that, once again, we are back in here debating the future direction of the Australian wool industry, the greatest industry this nation has ever had. I have no doubt about the future of it. It will return, in due course, to its greatness in the Australian economy for its contribution as an export earner and also, very importantly at this time when we have such high levels of unemployment, to the pride of place it once held amongst the industries that provide direct employment and, as a flow-on, indirect employment. I have no doubt about that at all.

        I would like to make a couple of points about what Senator West said, particularly with regard to price. If price did not matter, if it was not important, why did the stockpile blow out as it did when the reserve price went to 870c? The simple fact is that, through the changes that were made to the wool legislation in 1987 and the flow-on from it, we priced ourselves out of the contemporary market in a very competitive textile world market scene. Price does matter. It is vital. If the competitorsâ€”to us that means the cotton industry, the synthetic industry and othersâ€”are given a price advantage in the marketplace, purchasers of wool, and, ultimately, consumers, will shift. The price on the garment will not change because it will be made out of something else and purchasers will not be buying wool.

        I certainly accept Senator West's proposition that what state governments do is important, but what federal governments do is also fairly important. The decision in the government budget with regard to putting up fuel excise and sales tax will impact very dramatically on the wool industry in the component of transport. That will flow directly back to the producers and make the recovery of the industry more difficult.

        In talking about the future, which I think is very important, I refer to the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which was held last Friday. I want to deal with two of the committee's recommendations. The first is the one urging the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to consult fully with the industry on the further development of Wool International. As we know, the bills on Wool International are skeleton bills. They have to have the nuts and bolts and detail put into them.

In the industry I include the processors and the exporters as well as the producers. I think it was Mr Lionel Ward, who gave evidence at the committee hearing last Friday on behalf of the processors, who said that if this opportunity for consultation had taken place some months ago, we would have been much better placed in terms of dealing with the problems from the processors' point of view. This was confirmed by Mr Booth, President of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters.

        Even with the welcome rises in price we have seen in this selling season, wool producers cannot go on losing $4 or $5 per head. As a wool producer, on my own figures last year, which fit with the figures from ABARE, I can tell the Senate that the losses are about $5 per sheep on the current market price. On 10,000 sheep, that means a loss of $50,000 a year. That just cannot go on and emphasises very strongly why we have to get this legislation right. The part that Wool International will play, coming out of the Garnaut report, must facilitate all the links which exist in the wool industry, because they all depend on one anotherâ€”right from the lamb, when the wool is grown, to the finished garment, when it is worn in Paris or elsewhere.

        My next point relates to the third recommendation in the report regarding the future of funding for wool promotion. I think it is absolutely vital and imperativeâ€”I cannot stress this enoughâ€”that the government reconsider its position on promotion. It is vitally important. When I look at the money that the government makes available in a whole host of areas in our economy, for the wool industry to be told that this is the last year in which the government will be providing funding for promotion, is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.

At the end of the day, I came down slightly in favour of the Garnaut report after what occurred in our hearings the other day. I certainly had a leaning towards a minimum schedule with a price penalty on top of any wool sold above the schedule. But, after considering the explanations that Professor Garnaut gave us and the various aspects of all the evidence and information that we received, I think that probably the best track for us to be on is the one that we are now going down, subject to these couple of points that I have raised.

        The present situation of the wool industry is desperate. There are 3.9 million bales with $2.9 billion in the stockpile. Last year, wool producers lost an average of $33,700, and 91 per cent of the growers made a loss in the industry. The dramatic fact is that on 30 June 1994, the wool industry will have to meet its debt of $600 million, with a $400 million debt repayment and $200 million in interest and storage and handling costs. That is a fact of life.

        If we continue to go down the course that we are now going down, the wool industry will have to find $600 million. The debt can be met only by either raising taxesâ€”the industry could not afford another half a per cent rise; it could not afford any extra taxâ€”or dumping the $600 million worth of wool on the market. I do not know how much wool one would have to dump on the market to raise $600 million, but the more wool is dumped, the flatter the price will go. I estimate that the price would be pushed downâ€”Senator Panizza might have an ideaâ€”to around the 350c mark, and that is totally unsustainable.

        The Australian Wool Realisation Commission has played a cautious game over the last 12 months, releasing only a limited amount of wool to hold the market price at a reasonable level. But even that has not worked, with the indicator going down to a record low of 381c. The AWRC has some formula whereby it releases wool onto the market when a certain moving average is reached. The effect of that is that as soon as the price rises, wool gets released and the price is pushed back again, so there is no increase in price. As soon as the market rises, wool is released from the stockpile and the back the price goes.

        The new body, Wool International, which is to be established as soon as this legislation is passed, will manage the stockpile and debt repayment.

At that time, Wool International will become a privatised company owned by the producers. There is great fear in the industry as to whether a commissioned company, such as the Wool International, will be able to do the things that Professor Garnaut wants it to do.

        Wool International will be set up as a futures market, and that is of great concern to the graziers. A futures market was set up before the floor price was implemented in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. I understand from talking to the people who used that futures market that most of them got their fingers badly burnt. It was a disaster. So there is a fear in the industry that a futures market may not achieve what Professor Garnaut would really want.

At that time, Mr Kerinâ€”and I believe this was the rock on which he perishedâ€”promised that the floor was rock solid, immutable, set in cement, and then he walked away from the industry. As I said, Mr Kerin never recovered from that position.

        The consequence of that action was that the government wiped out $1.8 billion of growers' funds, then borrowed another $2.9 billion dollars, and ended up with a stockpile of 4.5 million bales. The government at that time made a huge mistake and the graziers are still paying for it.

        I now turn to the issue of promotion, which was raised by Senator Crane. This industry indirectly and directly employs around 600,000 people. Last year the government gave $25 million for promotion; this year it was $20 million; and next year it will be nothing. That is a very short-sighted and uncaring attitude for the government to take when this industry has provided so much for Australia and can again provide so much. To drop promotional funding away to nothing when the industry cannot afford to raise a promotion levy is to walk away from one of the greatest industries this country has ever had.

I had been critical in this place of Professor Garnaut.

        â€”In essence, this package of bills we are debating tonight represents a fundamental restructure of the wool industry in two particular ways. Firstly, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill deals with the functions, powers, membership and related matters of the newly established Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, which really replaces, as other speakers have said, the four statutory wool industry organisations that currently have responsibility for marketing, promotion, research, development and industry policy. I place no greater significance on this than to say that it is just a good administrative move, and that, quite frankly, is all it is.

        What is of profound significance is the second bill, the Wool International Bill 1993. As has been widely publicised, this bill replaces the Wool Realisation Commission that manages the wool stockpile and the debt. The explanatory notes to this bill tell us that Wool International will market the stockpile and foster the development of risk management and marketing mechanisms.

        Wool International has been initially structured as a statutory authority, but along commercial lines to reflect its ultimate transformation to a privatised public company.

        Behind this legislation is an industry in crisis, in very grave danger of never coming out of that crisis until this legislation before the parliament and the recommendations of the Garnaut report workâ€”a simple word, but it is most necessary that it work. There is nothing tangible in the Garnaut report and in this legislation to assure the industryâ€”in particular, the farmersâ€”that there will be an immediate solution to the crisis, particularly as the Garnaut report does not take effect until July 1994.

        There is diverse opinion over the disposal of this massive stockpile of 3.9 million bales. The Garnaut solution, under the management of the new body, Wool International, is to release the bales according to a fixed disposal schedule. Garnaut argues convincingly that the rigid schedule will stop the speculation over amounts to be released from the stockpile, which has been affecting the price on the auction floor and, further, that the fixed schedule will assure a certain reduction in the stockpile over time. These are very vital market signals. It is believed that this course will smooth out the boom and bust cycle that has plagued the industry over the past years. It does so at a rate of 27,000 to 29,000 bales a month from July through to December next year and a release from January 1995 of some 132 million kilograms.

        The Garnaut committee believes that it will not be difficult to sell this amount of wool as last year sales amounted to 820 million kilograms. With this demand and production predicted to be only 690 million kilograms in the next year or two, it will leave about a 130 million-kilogram gap to be filled by the release of the stockpile. The movement away from the Wool Realisation Committee and its flexible release of the stockpile was due to the fact this system allowed for wool to be dumped on to a rising market, depressing wool prices simply to meet an arbitrary debt repayment scheme. This gave all the wrong signals to the buyer and seller.

        The Garnaut report is not without its critics. Its critics say that this method of selling the stockpile is also giving all the wrong signals to the market. They believe that the stockpile should be sold as it is now when the demand makes it a reasonable thing to do. I tend to agree with the critics when they say that this is treating the stockpile more as an asset than does the fixed schedule. The critics go on to say that the best policy would be to establish a base price under which wool would not be sold from the stockpile. It would provide more certainty to the industry than the present decision and would enable the stockpile to be managed as an asset.

       patches in the history of wool sales that have matched this volume of exports that we are currently experiencing. Should this variable fail, Garnaut fails, and we will be back in this parliament rewriting the legislation again. The point is that we cannot afford such an error. We cannot afford to be wrong again. Australia's greatest industry is at stake. It is definitely now dying. We have no second chance any more. Farmers' net profits are as follows: in 1991-92 they were minus $40,810; in 1992-93 they were minus $34,400; and it is forecast for 1993-94 that it will be minus $39,000. Even those farmers with a mixture of sheep and beef are forecast to lose at much as $27,500 and those with a mixture of sheep and cereal are forecast to lose $9,000.

        Confidence in the rural sector does not match the confidence being displayed in the business sector. A recent farm survey undertaken by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy stated that 35 per cent of farmers interviewed believed that they would be forced to leave the industry or they had serious doubts about their ability to survive. We should keep in mind this 35 per cent possible exodus because this is over and above those already forced or evicted from the land. It is a misconception to believe that the farmers enjoyed the 1980s boom period that those entrepreneurs, marketeers and agents and the mining sector enjoyed. Those prices never reached the farm gate because they were faced with high interest rates, agent fees and all sorts of overheads and costs. Those boom years never reached the farmer and his family. Today's prices are the lowest since the Great Depression. Australia has travelled three generations to reach a point where the Australian wool farmer is worse off than in the Great Depression.

But the blackest spot in the history of this government and its worst legacy will be the dismantling of the Australian wool industry.

It has created an infrastructure for rural communities and towns, it has formed the foundation of postwar increases in the standard of living and it has even stimulated art, poetry and legendary characters.

        Some honourable senators from the National Party might find these figures quite interesting. Since the government announced its support for the package on 8 September, the wool price has improved. Prior to 8 September the wool price had been on a progressive decline. In the week ending 29 July this year the wool price was 449c a kilogram clean. It then went down to 438c, 432c, 430c, 413c and then 412c per kilogram clean. Then, bingo, on 8 September the government announced that it would implement the Garnaut package and from then we have seen a progressive increase in the price of wool. In the week ending 10 September the price for wool was 423c per kilogram clean. The following week it was 430c, 433c, 434c, 444c, 451c and then 461c per kilogram clean. I understand that as of 7 o'clock this evening the price had reached 492c per kilogram clean. That is a very significant increase.

        It would not be fair to directly attribute the whole of that price rise to the government's announcement, but it certainly had some impact because it provided a positive undertaking to the market about the direction the government intended to take. That has had an effect on the price of wool. The price rise in wool over the last three months has been approximately 20 per cent. I acknowledge the positive impact that the wool industry and the opposition, to its credit, have played in adopting a generally bipartisan approach to the package when it was announced on 8 September.

        Basically the approach Senator Woodley is advocating in his amendments is that he wants a more interventionist approach to be taken to the wool market. That is the philosophy underlying his approach. He is seeking to have this legislation send signals to growers to secure production, but at the same time he is proposing a price band approach to the fixed schedule which will mask the signals that the market should be giving to the growers in any free market that is responding to legitimate supply and demand pressures.

        The first amendment that he is proposing is a price band. The government and opposition are supporting a very specific fixed schedule. That amendment has the effect of a fixed disposal schedule operating within a band of 400c to 800c per kilogram. That would be used to smooth out the so-called price extremes in the sale of the stockpile.

        This price band approach would run directly counter to the basic intention of this legislation and to the policy recommendations of Professor Garnaut. It does that in two ways. Firstly, the introduction of price bands would be a direct contradiction to the Garnaut report's intention to stimulate, as far as possible, real market conditions. That is quite critical.

        The price band would retain the scope for a government agency to exercise a market smoothing policy. I commend Senator Panizza for strongly supporting this fixed schedule rather than supporting some variant in the pricing band as is being proposed by the Australian Democrats. In a strong market a ceiling approach could dampen potential market demand for forward purchases and create speculation as the ceiling is approached. We believe that is highly undesirable.

        The second reason for opposing the first amendment is that the market culture and the change to wool ownership transfer and risk management would be significantly impeded by a price banding policy because it implies a floor price and a price ceiling mentality. When the stockpile has been eliminated the industry will have to live with market supply and demand shifts without price smoothing policies.

        The price bands proposed by the Democrats have the potential to master market signals to buyers and sellers.

That is a quite critical issue.

       I know there is a view that it is a bit of a waste to have a strong demand for wool reflected in a higher price for a while. I do not think it is, because I think that the balance sheets of our farming community are so weak that cash in there is cash in a good place.

       What Professor Garnaut was pointing out was that we have a fixed schedule and as supply decreases demand should increaseâ€”and that is already happeningâ€”but if we have a price banding mechanism then presumably there would be more wool released from the stockpile and that would deflate the price that the market is paying for that wool. That would take away from growers some of that priceâ€”it may not be the price that they would likeâ€”improvement resulting from an increasing demand for wool. We strongly oppose the first amendment moved by the Australian Democrats.

        The second amendment proposes to cover Wool International's so-called trading losses. None of the wool tax for debt management will be used for risky wool international commercial activities, as was alleged by Senator Woodley in his speech today. The debt management will simply not be used for that purpose. There is certainly some flexibility within the legislation for some overselling and underselling of the schedule, but it is very minor. Only particular contracts that may require that will be taken into account. It certainly is not going to occur in any significant way. That will be very closely scrutinised by the industry, by the minister and certainly by Wool International.

        The government has made specific arrangements for funding commercial activities by agreeing to allow the revenue stream from non-wool assets managed by Wool International to be used to develop new risk management tools such as futures. So there is provision for those non-wool assets. I would assume that the non-wool assets would include primarily property, warehouses and the like that Wool International may choose to sell. In any case, the risk management mechanisms are designed to reduce riskâ€”not increase risk. I think that is quite a critical factor in the farm business. So it is not inherently risky, as has been suggested by Senator Woodley.

        The government already covers by guarantee the entire debt associated with the wool stockpile, which currently amounts to $2.2 billion.

Once privatised, Wool International will operate as a full commercial company under the corporations law. The sooner the body accommodates activities in the commercial environment, the stronger it will be at the time of privatisation.

        When I commenced my speech, I referred to some comments by Senator McGauran. I want to say very briefly that there can be no absolute guarantee for the future of the wool industry. But this legislation provides much greater certainty for the markets in their assessment of the future supply of wool and, therefore, the likely demand and price for wool producers.

         Senator McGauran tabled a document which says that today's wool price is at a record low and is equivalent to prices during the depression. That is simply not correct. This was certainly true up until six months ago and it was certainly true in the last two years. But the price in the last three months is not far from the average price that was being received from 1975 through until 1987.

        I do not think anyone could have foreseen the collapse in demand, which was brought aboutâ€”this was not the only factor, but it was certainly an important factorâ€”by the collapse of the communist regime in the Soviet Union. One of the ironies of the position we are in today is that the collapse of the former centralist and planned economy of the Soviet Union has led to the end of centralised buying of wool in that country, and I think it will be a long time before it recovers. So in making a criticism of Mr Kerin, let us at least be a little balanced in acknowledging that there were other factors. From my conversations with Mr Kerin, I think he does acknowledge that he made some errors during that period.

Within the confines of the minister's very busy scheduleâ€”the minister deals with energy issues and other primary industry, resource and forestry matters; it is a very heavy set of commitmentsâ€”the government consulted as widely as it could, having regard to the necessary time frame which required a reasonably quick response.

         The second amendment clarifies the role of government until Wool International becomes privatised.

The Australian Democrats, through Senator Woodley, have chosen to presentâ€”both in his speech on the second reading and in his comments to the committeeâ€”what I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) described as an interventionist stance.

It concerns me that the Australian Labor Party has not participated more in this debate to express its various views and opinions. I appreciate that Senator West did take an interest in last Friday's committee. She was a bit hasty at the end of the day when she attempted to pre-empt the committee while we were trying to reach a conclusion.

         I will turn to the points that have been raised by Senator Woodley in his amendments. The whole concept of the Garnaut plan is to operate the industry as if there were, in fact, no stockpile. As long as people think they can buy from the stockpile if they run short or, in this case, if the price goes to 800c, the incentive to buy forward is reduced. People will only buy forward if they think the price may go up or that there will be a shortage. If we set the price between 400c and 800c and ensure there will be never be a shortage, what incentive is there for forward buying?

         This amendment would undo the very fabric of the plan. It would ensure that the stockpile still hung over the market and would doom growers to continuing low prices.

         Professor Garnaut told the Senate committee last week that no-one was really thinking that the price of wool next year would be the price that it was in 1987. He said that anyone who thought that this was a substantial possibility would be buying and stocking wool in order to make a fortune and that would be lifting the current price right now. Professor Garnaut said there was a bit of that going on, which is one of the reasons the market is currently strengthening. But if it was a dominant view, the market would be behaving differently from the way that it actually is.

         We also need to think about the future. We need growers to know the true market value of wool long before the stockpile is gone so that they can gear production up or down. It would be silly to put selling the stockpile above keeping woolgrowers on their farms. If we keep the prices depressed, growers will go out of farming and then, when the stockpile is sold, there will be a critical shortage of wool and the price will go high and we will not have any more wool to dampen the price. Therefore, it seems sensible that we have the price rise now, rather than some years down the track.

         With regard to the second issue raised by Senator Woodley, that of the government guarantee, the government is already guaranteeing the money owed on the stockpile and should not be forced to also guarantee private negotiations. The Australian Democrat amendment would give an unfair advantage over private companies. For those reasons the coalition will not be supporting the Australian Democrats' amendments.

         â€”I will not hold the Senate very long. I must clear up any misapprehension that I may have caused when I queried the fixed schedule reduction scheme. I stated quite clearly in my speech on the second reading that I believe that whatever we sell on the fixed reduction scheme, we stick to it. Who is to say whether Professor Garnaut and the government, in formulating this legislation, have hit on exactly the right sort of schedule? But I am prepared to accept the schedule that is contained in the legislation.

         The reduction scheme should remain fixed because, as I said this morning, if we leave a back door open, something will happen. If the door is there, if an escape route is there, someone will find an excuse to use it. We have had five schemes in the past where that escape door has been left open and something has happened. Let us not do it again.

         I would like to look briefly at the situation that Senator Woodley told us about. He is more or less advocating that the higher the price the more we can let on to the market, and the lower the price the less we can let on to the market. I am afraid that that is not going to work, for reasons that Senator Tambling and others have already canvassed.

         I have been quickly trying to show in equation form how the scheme would work. I used a comparison with the pressure-volume equation in hydraulics where the higher the pressure through the aperture the greater the volume delivered, and as the pressure comes down the volume delivered is less. Senator Woodley left world demand out of the equation. That will interfere with it.

         The other element of that equation is temperature. I relate temperature to world demand. If we do not take into account all those other considerations, including world demand, it will not work. It is a good attempt to please everyoneâ€”the buyers, the sellers and the brokers in the middleâ€”but it will not work. Let us back the Garnaut system and have a fixed schedule and stick to it. Otherwise, as Senator West said, we will be back here next year debating some more.

I know that he would like this legislation to be passed because it would give a very effective signal to the international markets that Senator Panizza quite rightly referred to. Secondly, this is government policy. It speaks for itself. It is our policy that we are implementing, and I commend those opposite for congratulating it. Frankly, we do not need to talk about it all night. It is our government policy. It is standing there clear and as a result of the Garnaut report.

         I thank Senator Panizza and Senator Tambling for their support, particularly Senator Panizza who I commended in the second reading debate. He is spot on. If we are to have a moving band of sale of the wool stockpile, when the price goes up presumably we will sell more from the stockpile and the price will drop. We do not want that to happen at the moment because whatever gains we can make in price increase should go to the grower, and that is what the growers require at this point.

         The other thing is, of course, that people out in the market would speculate. They would see that the wool stockpile could be released outside a fixed schedule and they would then wait till the price reached a certain level and speculate against the wool stockpile. The basic intention of this legislation is to let the market signals dictate the price, particularly the international market, not to let legislative signals dictate the market. That is the wrong approach. We have tried that once already with fairly calamitous results.

         The second matter that Senator Woodley referred to is the notion of a further underwriting of industry debt.

         â€”I do not want to prolong the debate, but I just want to say something about Senator Sherry's comment. The point I am trying to make is that the control of how much wool is released still remains with Wool International. If someone is trying to speculate in the market, it is within Wool International's control whether or not it releases wool beyond the fixed schedule amount, so it has control of the price beyond the 800c. I do not think people would be able to speculate because Wool International still has control of the amount of wool beyond the fixed schedule which comes on to the market.

         The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 derives from the  Treasurer's Banking Policy Statement of 18 June 1993, and relates to the Government's decision to liberalise foreign bank entry, announced by the Prime Minister in the One Nation Statement.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Banking Act 1959 has already been amended by the Banking Legislation Amendment Act 1992, which received the Royal Assent on 21 December 1992, to give effect to the Government's decision in One Nation to liberalise foreign bank entry. Those amendments enable foreign banks, whether they have been operating in Australia or not, to apply for a banking authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959; and permit foreign banks, which are authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as banks in the form of a branch.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of the current bill is to facilitate the transfer of certain assets and liabilities from foreign bank subsidiaries in Australia to new branches. These subsidiaries will have been in existence prior to 18 June 1993 and may be either authorised banks under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959, or money market corporations registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974 (or any subsidiaries of those bodies which are registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974). In a limited number of cases the transfer may be between a pre-existing subsidiary and a new authorised bank subsidiary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To be eligible to transfer assets and liabilities under the proposed legislation, foreign banks will have, from the commencement of the legislation, three years within which to apply for a banking authority, and up to six years to effect the transfer. The proposed legislation will minimise administrative procedures, and waive the payment of both Commonwealth and State transfer fees and charges. Without these changes foreign banks would be inhibited from responding to the Government's policy decision to encourage increased effective competition and efficiency in the Australian financial sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 will facilitate the establishment of branch operations in Australia by ensuring that foreign banks currently operating an authorised bank subsidiary or money market corporation are not disadvantaged compared to new foreign bank entrants when establishing branch banking operations in Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also makes a number of changes to the income tax law to ensure that the tax consequences that would normally arise on the transfer of business from foreign bank subsidiaries to branches are deferred, and that double taxation and double deductions do not arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To do this, the bill places the branch in the same position as the subsidiary would have been had its assets and liabilities not been transferred. This treatment will extend to all assets and liabilities transferred under this legislation, including debts owing to the subsidiary that are transferred to the branch and are subsequently  written off as bad. Also, any interest paid on borrowings transferred to the branch, which would have been exempt from interest withholding tax under section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 if paid by the subsidiary, will be exempt under the same provision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To further assist the smooth transition from subsidiary to branch banking, the subsidiaries of foreign banks will be able to transfer existing tax losses to branches of the banks. In this way, the ability to claim deductions for past tax losses will not be disturbed by the transition to branch banking.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government believes that these changes will bring competitive gains and efficiencies to the banking sector;  greater flexibility in the provision of finance;  and cost advantages to Australian clients. The measures contained in the bill should also further improve the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system.

         The purpose of this bill is to implement the EC/Australia Wine Agreement.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On 6 December 1992, I jointly announced with our wine industry that Australian and European Commission officials had negotiated the text of a bilateral wine agreement aimed at improving our bilateral wine trade. This announcement attracted wide media attention, rightly so, as the European Community is Australia's largest export market for wine. During 1992/93, Australian winemakers exported 44m litres worth $144m to the EC, or almost half of our total exports of $293m. This Agreement will guarantee our continued access to the EC market which will remain the key market as our wine industry strives to lift exports to $1 billion by the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation enables the Agreement to enter into force and our winemakers to enjoy its benefits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agreement provides for the mutual recognition of each Party's winemaking practices and standards; it affords mutual protection to each Party's geographical indications, that is, the names of our wine regions such as Coonawarra and Hunter Valley; it reduces the number of analyses the EC requires of Australian wines from 8 to 3; it allows Australian winemakers to market wines in the EC labelled with multi-varietal and multi-regional blends; and it allows the export of Australian sweet wines such as the justly famous De Bortoli "Noble One" to the European Communityâ€”previously not permitted. Importantly, it prevents either party from introducing additional certification requirements on imports of each other's wines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agreement recognises the importance of European geographical indications to the European Community. It also recognises the widespread use of EC names on Australian wines. The Agreement provides for the gradual phase-out of our use of EC geographical indications according to their commercial importance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are four tranches of EC names to be protected. A list of thousands of EC geographical names which are of no commercial significance to us will be protected immediately the Agreement enters into force. The second tranche is of little used names such as `Frascati' and `White Bordeaux'; these will be phased-out on the 31 December this year. A further group of names of some importance to us such as `Chianti` and `Madeira' must be phased-out by 31 December 1997. The last tranche includes names which are widely used by our winemakers, names like `Claret', `Chablis', `Burgundy' and `Champagne'. Phase-out periods for these names have yet to be determined but the Agreement provides that negotiations on phase-out dates for these names must be concluded by 31 December 1997.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have used European geographical names to denote a style of wine for more than a hundred years. Migrants often brought these names to Australia and used them to describe a familiar style of wine; the names have become generic. Names like `champagne` have been used to describe a dry sparkling wine. Once protection commences, both European and Australian geographical indications will only be used to indicate the true place of origin of the wine. Thus the name `champagne' will only be used to describe wine made in the `Champagne' region of France.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agreement provides for additional phase-out periods to clear stock from wholesalers and retailers. Australian wine made prior to the phase-out period for production labelled with the protected EC names may be marketed by wholesalers for up to three years and by retailers until stocks are exhausted.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australian winemakers have already begun using varietal and brand names to replace European geographical indications.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also provides for the protection of traditional wine expressions. Words such as "brut" or "reserve" are frequently used to indicate a certain quality or style of wine. Under the bill, traditional expressions may only be used to describe wine which originates in the country in which the expression has been traditionally and consistently used. The lists of both Australian and EC traditional expressions are still under negotiation by the two parties to the Agreement. The bill provides for protection to commence when the traditional expressions are entered  in a register. This will occur after negotiations on protection of traditional names are concluded.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agreement has the strong support of the peak wine industry body, the Winemakers' Federation of Australia. Wine industry representatives were fully involved in the negotiations on the Agreement from the outset. The Agreement has strong support throughout the European Community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill establishes a Geographical Indications Committee to determine the boundaries of Australian geographical indications. EC regulations require that where wine exported to the EC is labelled with a geographical indication, the boundaries of that region must be defined precisely.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Where does Coonawarra end and Riverland start? This question is just as relevant for Australian wine consumers. By defining the boundaries of our geographical indications, this bill will give greater certainty to enforcement of the Label Integrity Program provisions of the Act, which require winemakers to keep records to substantiate label claims of the vintage, variety or geographical indication of wine. The bill will give consumers the guarantee that when wine is labelled "Coonawarra", the grapes from which the wine was made came from within the defined boundaries of the Coonawarra region.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Geographical Indications Committee will comprise a Winemakers' Federation of Australia nominee, a nominee of the Wine Grape Growers' Council of Australia and an Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (AWBC) nominee. The Committee will publish proposed determinations and seek submissions from winemakers and grapegrowers and their organisations on the boundaries of Australian wine regions. There will be appeal rights to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill establishes a Registrar of geographical indications and traditional expressions who will be an employee of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The Registrar will list all geographical indications determined by the Committee, list the protected EC names and inform other countries of Australia's protected names.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Winemakers' Federation of Australia has applied to the National Food Authority to have the Australian Food Standards Code covering wine modernised and brought more closely into line with EC standards. The NFA application, even if accepted in its entirety, will not authorise all EC winemaking practices. There are some EC standards which the Australian wine industry does not want to adopt for wine made in Australia. The bill authorises the import of wine from the EC which conforms with the compositional requirements set down in the Agreement and allows these standards to be varied from time to time by agreement as EC winemaking practises change. The EC practices differ in minor ways and in ways which do not affect health, from the standards set by the National Food Authority for sale of Australian and imported wine. EC wine will still have to comply in all other respects with Australian standards, for example with regard to labelling with alcoholic content.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The EC/Australia Wine Agreement is the first of several agreements on wine we intend to conclude with our major wine trading partners. Work is already underway on developing a wine agreement with New Zealand. The bill therefore amends the objects of the Act to include implementing the EC/Australia Wine Agreement; enabling Australia to implement further international agreements relating to trade in wine; and defining Australian geographical indications for wine. It extends the powers and functions of the AWBC to cover administration of the EC/Australia Wine Agreement and the definition of Australian geographical indications.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill creates several new offences. The offences include the false or misleading use of geographical indications and traditional expressions for wine. However, winemakers will continue to be able to use their individual name and the individual name of their predecessor in business, in the course of trade, even where that name is the same as the name of a protected geographical indication.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also amends the Act to allow regulations to be made concerning blending rules for wine and the composition of export wine. These Regulations will not be activated until there has been further consultations with the wine industry, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the National Food Authority. The bill also allows the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to prescribe the grape varieties which may be used in making wine. This will prevent the use of hybrid grape varieties in export wine, which is a concern in some export markets.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will have no financial impact.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill and the Agreement it seeks to implement, presents challenges for our wine industry including the opportunity to consolidate our position in the world market. It represents a landmark commitment by our industry and a true sign that our industry has come of age internationally. It removes technical trade barriers to our wines on EC markets. More importantly, it provides the important basis for continued future access to this market!

         However, what we do not support is a broader issue pertinent to Australia's trade and indirectly to the aims of this billâ€”that is, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), strutting around the world stage at the Cyprus Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, when he was merely a stone's throw from the Arab world which is a significant export market for Australia that could be further developed. Australia's exports to the Arab nations are currently around the $3 billion mark, and to Israel we export a further $ 1/4 billion worth of goods. But has the Prime Minister, while in that region, bothered to visit any of these, our major customers, in that area? No, he certainly has not. Indeed, there has not been a ministerial visit to the Middle East since the March election. Even Senator Cook, the Minister for Trade, has ignored this very important region. I will say a little more about this matter later in my remarks.

         These steps will certainly help those Australian exporters who are making ground in the fragile export arena. But it is an indictment on this government that the Prime Minister ignored opportunities to arrange a bilateral visit to one or two Middle Eastern countries to improve our trade and export relationship when he was already visiting a nearby countryâ€”that is, Cyprusâ€”for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It is alarming because the Arab countries of the Middle East and Israel are major customers for our rural products. Given the parlous state that our primary producers currently find themselves in, this is simply not good enough from the leader of this country. In particular, these countries are targets for United States export enhancement program subsidies and subsidised product from the European Community on the very products which we sell to them. So our markets there are under severe threat. The Prime Minister should have ensured that he visited at least one or two of these countries en route to or from Cyprus.

This really is a hopeless performance under this Labor government.

Otherwise we will continue to be left behind. While in absolute terms the dollar value of our exports to those Asian countries might increase, our share of that trade will continue to fall as it has under a decade of Labor.

         The eligibility for the grants included in the bill is determined by the amount of eligible expenditure which a business has incurred in a grant year. One of the major aims of this bill is to limit eligibility for grants to companies, partnerships or individuals who are under insolvency administration by defining their expenditure as non-claimable. This would appear to be a response by the government to the Gregory Symons-Marshall Islands affair. The Australian Democrats welcome this move by the government to protect the scheme's integrity.

         The bill also seeks to exclude from eligibility claimants with certain convictions. Proposed section 11YA will make expenditure incurred by a person convicted of certain offences involving fraud and dishonesty which are punishable by at least two years imprisonment non-claimable for a period of five years after conviction or release from custody. This ineligibility applies to companies and partnerships which have either a director or partner who was convicted of the specified offences. Once again, the Australian Democrats support these provisions.

         The Australian Democrats particularly welcome the encouragement being given to businesses in the early stages of developing their export markets. The bill seeks to achieve this by proposing a new section 13A, which allows claims to be lodged on a half-yearly basis in the first three years of grant eligibility. This should reduce the delays between incurring expenditure and payment of the grant, which is of course crucial in assisting the cash flow and viability of smaller businesses. There are many other technical amendments throughout this bill to incorporate this proposed system of first-half payments.

There is, of course, the question as to whether this ceiling should in fact be lower to channel more resources to companies that are smaller, with a smaller turnover, but have the potential for growth.

         The provision giving exporters access to additional grants beyond the general eight-grant limit was inserted in the act last year. It applies when they have incurred eligible expenditure for new markets. Clause 20 of this bill proposes to amend section 15 to limit the categories of activity eligible for this extension of grants. In large measure, this provision was necessary because of drafting errors which occurred in the original bill.

         I wish to address the point that I foreshadowed as to whether this scheme really provides sufficient assistance to companies and individuals at the lower end of the scale, in the small business sector. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990 increased the minimum expenditure threshold from $10,000 to $30,000. Only two years prior to that it had been increased from $5,000 to $10,000. Furthermore, that amendment made the first $15,000 ineligible for a grant. At the time, the Australian Democrats opposed these amendments in the firm conviction that this cut out a lot of people at the lower end of the business scale who, as events have proved, do have extremely good potential for unlocking export markets.

I have received a number of complaints from companies that in the early stages of their export activities they cannot possibly finance their expenditure to the threshold levels which the government has introduced. Apart from this fact, which looks into the future of the scheme and its usefulness, I put on record that the Australian Democrats will support this legislation.

This legislation was set in response to that, so I am not saying that we are about to change it; I am simply saying that there was a report recommending a higher threshold. We adopted this as a compromise. I am advised that Austrade is reviewing it at the moment and that there will be an internal report to Austrade reasonably soon. As to what action flows from that, it will depend on the outcome of the review. I thank the Senate for its support of the bill.

        â€”The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 has the intention of bringing Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which Australia is entitled under international law, as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. Primarily, this bill amends the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. I note that the explanatory memorandum produced for the benefit of honourable senators and members also conveniently states:

      </para>
      <para>
       Having said that it amends the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 and a number of other acts, it might be worth drawing the attention of honourable senators to the range of acts that need to be amended in some way in order for this purpose to be achieved. There are quite a few of them: the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973, the Admiralty Act 1988, the Customs Act 1901, the Designs Act 1996, the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Migration Act 1958, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981, the National Museum of Australia Act 1980, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Pipeline Authority Act 1973, the Quarantine Act 1908, the Sea Installations Act 1987, and the Whale Protection Act 1980. So the outline on the first page of the explanatory memorandum perhaps does not give a fair enough indication of how much work is involved in making this sort of change, namely, to bring Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which we are entitled under international law, as reflected by this 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea.

        The background or purpose of the bill is this: in 1982 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, otherwise referred to as the 1982 convention, was adopted and signed by Australia. Australia has not yet ratified that convention. That 1982 convention needs 60 ratifications to come into force. At present, as we understand it, it has 56 such ratifications and therefore is quite likely to enter into force in the near future. Apart from the provisions relating to the mining of the deep seabed, it is generally accepted as reflective of international law. The government puts the view that, in relation to the maritime zones, the 1982 convention should in fact govern Australian practice.

        The Seas and Submerged Lands Act, which is the act which is primarily amended by this bill, currently refers to the 1958 Geneva conventions on the territorial sea and continental shelf. At the moment, consultations are taking place in an attempt to overcome some of the difficulties that have arisen under the 1982 convention in relation to the provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. As I understand it, the government has indicated that, if these consultations are successful, Australia will then be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the convention. According to the government, therefore, it is appropriate now for us to amend our domestic law to bring our practice in relation to maritime zones into conformity with those provided for in the 1982 convention.

        In 1979 Australia established a 200 nautical mile fishing zone. In 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed by Australia. In 1990 a 12 nautical mile territorial sea was established in place of the previous three nautical mile territorial sea. The current bill will replace the operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to those 1958 conventions and put in, as I said, references to the 1982 convention. The bill makes it clear that Australia seeks to assert the full rights to which it is entitled under international law in a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone.

        As indicated in the preamble of the bill, the rights that Australia has in such a zone include not just sovereign rights over both living and non-living resources but also jurisdiction as provided for in international law in relation to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research and the protection and preservation of the marine environment. The sovereign rights and the jurisdiction which a coastal state possesses in its exclusive economic zone in regard to these matters are set out in detail in the 1982 convention, the relevant parts of which form a schedule to this bill. According to the government, it will be for future legislation to deal expressly with matters such as pollution control in the exclusive economic zone.

        The bill also adopts the definition of the continental shelf in the 1982 convention. The 1958 convention defines the outer limit of a continental shelf in terms of a depth of 200 metres or beyond that to a depth capable of exploitation. Customary international law has recognised that the limit of the continental shelf is the edge of the continental margin and that it does not include the deep seabed. The 1982 convention contains in article 76 a precise definition of a continental shelf. This is a minimum 200 nautical miles regardless of the physical configuration of the shelf. Beyond that distance, where the configuration of the continental shelf allows, however, the limit may extend to a distance not exceeding 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath. This limit is calculated either by reference to the depth of sediments or the distance from the foot of the continental slope defined by the gradient.

        Adoption of the 1982 convention will enable Australia to claim a larger total area of continental shelf than we have been able to do under the 1958 convention. According to the government, the gains made by adopting this new definition outweigh any of the minor potential losses and will in fact bring Australian legislation into conformity with internationally accepted principles. The bill also deals quite expressly with a contiguous zone. This zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea to a distance no greater than 24 nautical miles from the territorial sea baselines.

As a relatively young nation, we must be very cautious not to discard traditions that have a very deep meaning. Of the 102,000 Australians buried overseas, the majority of them were buried in countries where Australian troops fought major battles: France, Belgium and Turkey during World War I and Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Singapore in World War II. Many are also buried in the United Kingdom, which was the principal training ground and hospital area during the First World War.

A copy of the second reading speech was faxed to me today, with annotations which clearly show that the main alterations made to the bill were alterations which rectified some minor drafting difficulties. But in substance, the bill remains as it was in the first draft.

         The difficulty with this bill is that it applies to young persons above the age of 15. For example, the Victorian Attorney-General claims that the provisions in the area of obtaining fingerprints will bring the state of Victoria into line with the provisions that obtain in other states. I have had a search conducted and found that this is simply not true. In most other states there is a requirement for a court order, the order of a magistrate or the authorisation of the officer in charge. In almost all cases in almost all states, if the person concerned is under 16 or 14, that person must be in custody before fingerprinting can be carried out.

          â€”I wish to raise a couple of matters tonight. Firstly, I want to comment on Senator Sandy Macdonald's remarks about the return of the unknown soldier on 11 November, which will mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the First World War. It is a moving tribute to the sacrifice of those 60,000 young Australians who died in the First World Warâ€”all of them far away from Australia. About 47,000 of those soldiers died in France.

          In the early 1980s I had the opportunity to make a private visit to France, and I made the effort to visit Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens and the River Somme to see the war graves of the Australian forces. It is a particularly moving and sombre experience to visit Villers-Bretonneux and see something like 10,000 to 11,000 names engraved on the wall of that Australian war cemetery. Those Australians died in the epic battle of March and April 1918.

          I do not think most Australians realise that that battle was in fact a turning point in the First World War and that it was the Australian divisions that stopped the last gasp German advance that nearly won the war for Germany in early 1918. In fact, when the whole of the British 5th Army disintegrated, the Australian divisions were marched from Flanders and around Passchendaele south to Villers-Bretonneux. They went straight into battle and stopped the German advance. Then on 25 April 1918, in a major counter attack, the Australian divisions defeated the Germans around Villers-Bretonneux and started the German retreat. This was the turning point of the war.

          It is most moving to be at Villers-Bretonneux and to see the memorial and the streets named after towns in Australia and to witness the respect which the local French people have for the Australian forces and those who died there. All the way along the Amiens-Cambrai road for nearly 60 miles there are various Australian war graves for the various divisions of Pozieres and so on.

          Senator Macdonald's remarks were very appropriate and we all support them. The ceremony on 11 November will be a very fitting one. I hope that it helps Australians to understand their historyâ€”the extraordinary contribution that Australians made in the First World War and their sacrifices. In proportion to the size of our population our casualties were about the heaviest. It should also be remembered that every soldier who died in France and elsewhere overseas was a volunteer. The rest of the armies of Europe were raised by conscription. All the Australian soldiers volunteered to go and fight.

          When visiting Villers-Bretonneux some weeks ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made this point to the French when discussing their present agricultural policies. He said that if he had told these young Australian volunteers defending French sovereignty that their contribution would be paid back by France's present economic policies they might not have been so keen to go. I think it is worth pointing out to the French that in the two world wars Australians have laid down their lives to defend the French and French sovereignty and to liberate France. I wish the French would remember that. Nevertheless, the ceremony on 11 November will be a very moving moment. I think Senator Macdonald is to be congratulated on his remarks tonight.

          The other matter I wanted to mention briefly relates to an area in my portfolio. It has come to my attention tonight that Dr David Kemp, the shadow minister for science technology and export development, has issued a statement based on a speech he made in the adjournment debate last night in the House of Representatives. It attacks remarks I madeâ€”or was reported to have madeâ€”in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Herald-Sun
          </emphasis>
          newspaper on 22 October. The paper claimed that I said scientists were `grey haired men in cardigans'. What the story in the press failed to do was give the context and explain where I made those remarks. I want to put the record straight on the context of those remarks not only for Dr Kemp but also everyone else.

          Last week, on Thursday, 21 October, I had a meeting with some of the youth ANZAAS congress 1993 delegates. They were a group of young people who attended the ANZAAS congress 1993 in Perth. About 300 young people from high schools and secondary schools around Australia attended the congress. Most of them came from Western Australia. At the end of the congress, four of them were elected to make a report to me about their impressions of the congress and ways to improve the role of young people in science.

          On Thursday of last week four of them came to Canberra and presented me with a very good report on the impressions and issues with respect to young people and science. It was the most well-written and precise report that one could hope to receive. In the discussion with them that followed, at which some science journalists were present, including one from the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Sun-Herald
          </emphasis>
          , one of the issues that the delegates raised was the lack of women being encouraged to pursue a career in science. The youth delegates believed that this was due to there being a lack of role models of women in science for other women to follow.

        </para>
        <para>
         who are not represented in science. That is the context in which I made the comment. It was not in any way meant to denigrate the role of scientists, as Dr Kemp remarked that it was. Of course, he based that on a report in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sun-Herald

          I do not resile from the fact that I have consistently argued for programs to raise women's consciousness ofâ€”and encourage them to go intoâ€”science and engineering courses. I will continue to do so. I think those professions are diminished by not having an appropriate balance of our women members of society participating. For Dr Kemp, and even the journalist in the

        In the absence of a precise definition of "information kits", it is not possible to attempt to answer the honourable senator's question and he may, therefore, wish to rephrase it. I should indicate to the honourable senator, however, that unless the definition were very restricted, and the years for which the information is sought reduced, I would be unlikely to authorise the expenditure of resources across the public service required to provide an answer.
