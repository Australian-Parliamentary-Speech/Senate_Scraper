        The Explanatory Statement advised that the AGM of the Board for 1991-92 must be held on or before 30 June 1993. As the Regulations were only gazetted on 23 June 1993 there may have been some difficulties in complying with them.

        The Regulations attempt to deal with this problem by providing that certain provisions do not apply to the first AGM. However, these exceptions may themselves have affected the rights of persons entitled to vote at the AGM.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        More significantly, there is a number of other provisions affecting rights of voters which apparently could not have been complied with and which do not appear to have been excepted. These include correcting voter details, giving notices of motion and appointing proxies.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One provision sets out the consequences which flow from the payment of a penalty under an infringement notice. In short, the liability of the person is discharged, no further proceedings may be taken and the person is not regarded as having been convicted of the alleged offence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These safeguards emphasise the personal rights of those affected by the infringement notice scheme. However, their effectiveness is considerably reduced because there is no requirement for an infringement notice to notify people of these rights. The regulations provide for such a notice to contain a variety of information, but not these important safeguards. This is a matter which the Committee has raised in respect of a number of similar schemes. In every case the Minister has undertaken to amend the relevant instrument to provide for notification of safeguards.

        Several of the Principles provide for the Minister or Secretary to determine certain matters. This appears to grant legislative power to those officials.

        It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if an instrument purports invalidly to subdelegate power which the parent Act has restricted to specified persons or organisations. On the other hand, if subdelegation is valid then its exercise should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

         The move to disallow this amendment also gave me time to investigate many other concerns that have been raised by those who are most affected by the management plan and these ongoing concerns may be addressed by the standing committee's current investigation into the adequacy of the Commonwealth fisheries legislation. Finally, I would like to note that the timing of this amendment, 23 December 1992, after parliament rose, and not being tabled until May 1993, meant that the amendment could not have been disallowed before the management plan expired on 31 December 1992. Therefore, there was no possibility that a disallowance could have had any real effect prior to the expiry of the plan.

        This Bill amends the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) to simplify the operation of the "points" system provided for in the Act. The "points" system provides for the application of a competitive points test which is used to assess people of working age seeking permanent entry to Australia under the Independent Entrant and Concessional Family classes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Presently, the "points" system sets out three marks against which an applicant's score is compared  "applicable pass mark", "applicable priority mark" and "applicable pool entrance mark". Currently the way in which the "points" system operates is that the pass mark and priority mark are set at the same level and a pool entrance mark is set at a lower level. Applicants whose score is equal to or more than the pass and priority mark proceed to further processing and applicants whose score is less than the pool entrance mark are rejected. Applicants whose score is at least equal to the pool entrance mark but less than the pass mark are placed in the pool and can be removed by meeting a subsequently gazetted pass mark. However, applications in the pool that fail to meet the pass mark after three gazettals are rejected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Variations in the pass and priority marks are one way that changes in demand for migration are managed between one program year and the next. Adjustments can be made to the level of the pass mark and priority mark to control the number of applicants who would be able to proceed to further processing. Therefore, where the number of successful applicants is inconsistent with the program planning levels the priority and pass mark can be lowered so that more applicants move to the next stage of processing or they can be raised so that fewer applicants move to the next stage of processing. The numbers in the "pool" can be increased by lowering the pool entrance mark, however the "pool" cannot be reduced by increasing the pool entrance mark.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are a number of problems with the current operation of the "pool "mechanism. First, rejection of applications in the "pool" requires three pass mark gazettals and an applicant in the "pool" must be notified on each occasion. This process is administratively cumbersome. Secondly, there is no time requirement in which the three gazettals must occur. Therefore, they could occur on consecutive days or over a number of years. This provides little certainty or security for applicants. Thirdly, the system provides little flexibility to reject those who receive lower marks in the "pool". Finally, the current system of three different marks  has confused applicants.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will remedy these problems by replacing the three mark system with a two mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark. The Bill will also simplify the operation of the "pool" mechanism by introducing a mandatory time limit of twelve months after which time an application still held in the "pool" must be rejected. This will replace the current requirement of three pass mark gazettals which, as previously stated, could have occurred over a period in excess of twelve months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the scheme proposed in this Bill an application where the assessed points score is at least equal to the gazetted pass mark at the time of assessment would proceed directly to the next stage of processing. An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pass mark but at least equal to the gazetted pool mark would be placed in the "pool". An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pool mark would be rejected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill sets out the manner for dealing with applications in the "pool" and provides that an application in the "pool" must be assessed against any gazetted changes to the pass mark and pool mark during a period of twelve months from the date of the original assessment. At any time over the twelve month period an application in the "pool" could proceed to the next stage if the pass mark is lowered, or be rejected if the pool mark is raised. If an application had not been removed from the pool by either of these means at the end of the twelve month period it would have to be rejected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Variations in the pass mark and the pool mark will be notified in the Gazette. Each time these marks are varied an application in the "pool" will have to be compared with the varied marks. The Bill makes it clear that this comparison does not allow a reassessment of the applicant's assessed score.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also makes provision for the pass mark and the pool mark to be varied independently of each other. When the pass mark and the pool mark are the same, no "pool" would exist.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The transitional provisions in the Bill ensure that applications that are held in the "pool" on commencement of the provisions will be held in that "pool" for a further period of up to twelve months. This will ensure that no applicant is disadvantaged by the operation of the new provisions.

         —The wine tax is a matter which is of crucial importance to my home state of Western Australia. I have a specific interest in it in that I have spent a lot of my recent years living in the Swan Valley district of Western Australia and have enjoyed many fine wines from the Swan Valley district, the Margaret River district and the rapidly expanding wineries in the south-west of the state of Western Australia.

         The wine tax which was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on budget night was, of course, an absolute shock to the industry right across Australia, particularly to the relatively young industry in Western Australia. Although it has had a very strong base in the Swan Valley since the first settlement and the planting of the first vines by John Septimus Roe and other people many years ago, the industry has rapidly expanded over the last 20 to 25 years. One needs only to look at some of the figures that have been achieved in terms of production increases in recent years to see just how important the wine industry has become to Western Australia, and how important it is when one considers that there is an enormous concentration on the importance of value adding to our primary products. This is to ensure that we do not just produce raw products and export them but we actually process those products. Wine is a classic example of how that has been done very successfully, both in Western Australia and in the wine making regions in the eastern states.

         It is interesting to note that, in terms of value adding, wine when sold as the end product increases the value of the primary product, the bunch of grapes, by something like seven times. So it is quite a massive value adding process. The figures from Western Australia—and I will concentrate on Western Australia, being a proud and parochial Western Australian—have seen production increases even in the last few years. Going back to 1988-89, in terms of exports from Western Australia, we exported only $770,000 worth. The export figures—and these are figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics—have increased in the latest year, 1992-93, to in excess of $2.57 million from Western Australia.

         This is a tremendous performance and it is very important to note that much of this export performance has been created on the foundations of a very solid domestic market. The Western Australian domestic market is very important to young producers and I would like to use it in what necessarily will be a brief contribution to this debate. There are enormous numbers of speakers on the list and we would like to see these bills defeated, if possible today, for the benefit of the wine industry and the employment it creates.

         To get back to the line of argument, I will refer to the example of a winery that I know very well that is not so far from my home. It is a winery called Jane Brook on the Toodyay Road just out of Midland. David and Beverley Atkinson, who are friends of mine, started rebuilding the Jane Brook estate and building up their market share and building up the acreages they have under vine. They have built up a good marketing image. They have a new range of products, aggressively marketed through cellar door sales and through selected bottle shops mostly for the domestic market and the local market in Western Australia. They have increased their production year after year and they have increased the number of crushings they do. In the last three years they have gone to Japan on a number of occasions with the help of Austrade and have sold their products into the Japanese market.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is a highly competitive market and not an easy market for a small husband and wife team from Western Australia to break into, but my latest conversation with David indicated that he sold something like a container load of wine to Japan last year and I think he has doubled that export this year. He is also providing wines to some international airlines. This is a tremendous achievement. It is actually a good example that proves the government's arguments, that the tax will not affect export markets, to be quite fallacious because export markets will be developed only if we have a thriving domestic industry. If a 55 per cent increase is put on the tax it will affect domestic sales. It will decrease sales.

         Senator McMullan has admitted that in answers to questions in the Senate on this matter in recent weeks. He has said it will not affect the government's revenue because if the sales of bottles of wine go down people will transfer to buying beer. He is saying there is a total sort of elasticity there; people will just move from one product to the other. It does not really matter if people stop buying wine because if they stop buying wine they will buy a bottle of beer and the government will collect the revenue from that. So Senator McMullan has admitted that the tax will potentially decrease wine sales. Of course, all of us know that if the price goes up people will either buy cheaper wines or not buy at all.

         This will have a devastating impact on an industry that has been one of Australia's export success stories in recent years. Only a year ago I was at a supermarket in London—I think it was Sainsburys—buying groceries to have a home-cooked meal. I was very proud to see in the wine section of Sainsburys a whole range of Australian, including Western Australian, wines for sale at very reasonable prices. The market share of Western Australian and Australian wines in England is rocketing. I visited France last year as the guest of the French government and I found that the French are extremely jealous of Australia's success in wine marketing because we are rapidly taking away their traditional markets in the United Kingdom for champagne and red and white wines. Our wine industry is a tremendous success story.

         Let me make some other brief comments about the importance of this debate. The Green senators, my colleagues from Western Australia Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette, initially agreed with Senator Kernot and Senator Lees on the Australian Democrats' position that this matter should be deferred for a year. I spoke to the press and suggested that Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette would not be acting in the best interests of Western Australian wine producers and winegrowers if they were to agree to defer that tax. In fact, in a slightly flowery press release, I suggested that, if a sentence of a thousand lashes is imposed on someone, it is of little comfort if the person is told that the sentence will be delivered on him in 12 months time. It really does not help very much.

         He said that it takes four to seven years to create a crop that can be crushed commercially. Even after four to five or six years, when that crop has been developed, it is exposed to the vagaries of the weather and, as people like Senator Panizza who grow wheat would know, there is still an enormous risk involved. Mr Kerin said that it costs $30,000 to $35,000 per hectare to establish a crop. All that money is paid up-front and it takes at least four or five years to get any sort of commercial return. So the wine industry is very different from other industries, and Mr Kerin should be complimented for having the honesty to expose the flawed decision making that has taken place on this measure.

I conclude by saying that the negotiations that have taken place with the wine industry over the past few weeks, where the government has been offering carrots in terms of early tax write-offs, industry support mechanisms and so forth, further reinforce the argument that this tax is a very bad tax and that it will hurt the wine industry. The ameliorative measures that the government is offering the wine industry are recognition of the fact that the tax will severely hurt the industry, and further support the wisdom of the opposition's position and the wisdom of the position adopted by the Democrats, I am informed by Senator Kernot, some five weeks ago.

         I look forward to these bills being defeated, for the wine tax to be axed and, more importantly, for there to be certainty in the minds of those in the wine industry and those who choose to invest in it and put their hard work and hard labour into growing the grapes, crushing the grapes and marketing the products nationally and internationally. They can then be assured with the strongest message to the wine industry from the Senate—from a majority of senators, including the Democrats and the Greens—that a wine tax today, tomorrow, next year or the year after is off the agenda and that people in the industry can go ahead and invest with certainty. The message will be that if the government ever tries to bring a 55 per cent increase to a very important industry like this into this place it will be booted out as quickly as it is today.

         The government has chosen to change the tax mix by increasing the rate of wholesale sales tax. The choices that have been put before the Australian people have been quite simple ones—a GST or a wholesale sales tax. The government and the opposition have rejected other, more progressive suggestions such as a jobs levy, the abolition of negative gearing, the removal of some of the exemptions from the capital gains tax or increased marginal tax rates for very high income earners.

They expect the members of their families who are unemployed to get unemployment benefits. We have to pay taxes to provide those unemployment benefits.

         If we are given a choice, however, between a wholesale sales tax and a goods and services tax, why do we choose a wholesale sales tax? There are trade-offs all the time in politics. Although the wholesale sales tax is not as pure in terms of simplicity and efficiency, the Democrats believe its great merit is that it has the capacity to discriminate. By contrast, a consumption tax is a very blunt instrument. It offers no flexibility in terms of how heavily it falls on those least able to bear the burden of the taxation, specifically, low income earners. Although the wholesale sales tax is not perfect, it is superior if we are debating a choice—as I think we are, as a nation—between a goods and services tax or a broad based consumption tax and a wholesale sales tax.

         The sales tax is imposed by four acts, namely, a duty of customs, a duty of excise, a tax on in situ swimming pools and a tax that is none of the above.

The bills we are debating contain the following measures: an increase of all sales tax rates by one percentage point from budget night, a further increase of one percentage point for all sales tax rates from 1 July 1995, an increase in the rate of sales tax on wine and an increase in the rate of tax on luxury motor vehicles.

Whereas 10, 20 and 30 per cent are quite simple to use, I would like to know whether it is true that 11, 21 and 31 per cent are not. That suggestion has been made to me.

         The wine tax proposal is a different matter. I agree with Senator Campbell that the industry has done well in the last decade, but it is on the cusp of a burgeoning export boom and now is not the time to impose a massive increase in sales tax on it. I do not just stand here and say that we are opposed to taxation increase of any kind, but I think the government has failed to make out a cohesive rationale based on industry policy. This is very clearly a question of industry policy. The wine industry is a regionalised industry; whole communities are dependent on it. It is one of our success stories. Senator Lees will be elaborating on the Democrats' position and negotiations with the wine industry in her contribution to this debate later today.

         The final matter is the alteration of the luxury car tax. One would have to say that this area of policy has had a pretty poor record over the last few years. Firstly, in the 1990 election campaign, the government announced an increase in the rates of tax from 30 to 50 per cent. This caused a delay in the implementation of the measure, which means that purchases are simply brought forward and consequently the extra revenue from the rate increase is never collected. Then we saw that the recession battered the luxury car market. Perhaps that is one of the most benign effects of the recession! This caused the government to reverse its decision, so subsequently we had a further finetuning of the tax to try to make it operate in a less anomalous manner. Today we are looking at the further change that we now have to the structure.

         The tax on luxury cars further demonstrates my point about the ability of a wholesale sales tax regime to be discriminatory where a consumption tax is not. Luxury vehicles in excess of a $32,486 threshold are currently taxable at 30 per cent of their total wholesale value and cars below this threshold are subject to the applicable sales tax rate, depending on their classification. This has the effect that, once a car costs $1 more than the threshold, an additional tax on the `sub-luxury' part of the car is payable. We know what effect that has on people's purchasing decisions. I think that is a legitimate function of a taxation regime. The Democrats endorse this change.

First, it is financially bankrupt; secondly, and more importantly, it is morally bankrupt. Its moral bankruptcy is indeed more important than its financial bankruptcy, because this has destroyed the government's capacity to provide inspiring and effective national leadership. Quite simply, nobody in this country accepts the authority or legitimacy of this government anymore. That is the direct consequence of the government having lied its way to success at the last election and having broken its promises since then. And that is one reason why the Liberal and National parties are opposing these tax increases: they are the very antithesis of the Labor Party's campaign at the March election.

         It is time for this government to apply some real discipline to its spending. The government's claim to be reducing the tax burden is patently false. In the 10 years since this government came to office, the average tax rate on people earning average weekly earnings has increased from 23 per cent in 1983 to 24.4 per cent this year. On top of that, over the life of this government we have seen massive increases in sales taxes, fuel and other excises and many other taxes. This means that the tax burden on many Australians has increased. These bills seek to increase that burden even further. And that is another reason for opposing them.

It may be that Sydney has won the 2000 Olympics, but this Keating-Dawkins budget has most certainly already won the gold medal for government greediness, botched legislation and fumbled fiscal strategy.

         Many of my colleagues want to direct their attention to these bills, so I will address what I believe is the worst aspect of the government's now somewhat revised revenue raising measures, that is, the 55 per cent impost on alcoholic wine, raising the rate of sales tax on that product from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. It does not matter whether you drink wine or not, the fact is that this tax will hurt ordinary Australians—Australians who are already overburdened with taxes and, in particular, Australians who derive their income from the wine industry. It will hurt them unjustifiably and in a regionally discriminatory way. It is particularly detrimental to my home state of South Australia, and that is another reason for opposing these bills. This industry is just starting to capitalise on its vast export potential, but now the government has come along and nipped all of that in the bud.

We know because the South Australian Labor government—a government of its own political persuasion, a government that will undoubtedly soon be in opposition, not only because of its own mismanagement but also because of the direct impact of this tax on South Australia—commissioned a quarter million dollar economic research program on the wine industry. That report predicts that 15 million litres of the domestic cask wine market will be lost because of this tax. That cask wine is not exportable. The report also predicts the reduction in domestic demand by 15 million litres of premium wine. In other words, total domestic demand will be 30 million litres less than it would otherwise be. This 15 million litres of premium wine would become available for the export market. Hence, there will be lower wine production, and this in turn means that the industry will invest less in vineyards, inventory and wineries to meet its overseas market opportunities.

         In short, this government has done more to the wine industry than a year of bad harvests across the nation would have done to it. In fact, it is devastating the industry. This all represents a loss to Australian industry and lost opportunities for job creation—lost opportunities for Australians who want to pull themselves out of the economic malaise which surrounds them and put something back into this country and back into their own lives. Wine production throughput will be lost as a result of this tax, due to the loss of cask wine sales. This will increase production costs in Australia and will therefore increase the cost of the product they wish to export and make them less competitive on those overseas markets. This cost increase has been estimated to be around 16 per cent.

         A continuing lack of international competitiveness is reflected in a further balance of payments deficit of $1.4 billion, or $80 per Australian last month. So as a country we are continuing to go further and further into debt. The government's commitment to Australia's international competitiveness is shown to be no more than lip service because of its high domestic tax regime. No other major wine industry anywhere in the world has to operate under such imposts. Brian Croser, the president of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, is on the record only weeks ago as saying in relation to this budget `that logic and wealth creation for Australia are the victims'; and further, that it `is now bankrupt of concern for the fate of one of Australia's most rapidly expanding export and highest value adding industries, and that is shameful'.

         In addition to that South Australian government report to which I referred, a further report, the so-called Sharp report, challenges the claim by the federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that the government's 55 per cent tax increase will not harm wine exports. The truth is that both reports provide independent proof that the Australian wine industry cannot afford the budget's savage tax increase. Exports and potential job growth will both be harmed. There is little doubt that reduced profitability will result in investment in new vineyards and winery upgrades being abandoned and marketing budgets being reduced, affecting primarily advertising and sales support. All of that affects jobs. Indeed, as I found in a visit to the renowned Coonawarra district a couple of weeks ago, new vine plantings have already been put on hold pending the outcome of this tax bill.

         To demonstrate the depth of feeling from those involved in the wine industry and from constituents, I presented to the Senate last Thursday over 7,700 signatures, just from South Australians, calling for this unjust tax to be defeated. These signatures were collected in only a few weeks, which proves that Australian voters have already had enough of repressive tax measures. A search of the Senate records reveals this number of signatures to be amongst the highest ever presented to the Senate on a single issue. That they were collected in just a few weeks is truly remarkable. For most petitions attracting large numbers of signatures, the collection of signatures takes many months, even a year or two. To attract such numbers of signatures in just two or three weeks demonstrates the absolute outrage of the South Australian community at this proposal. Completed petitions are still coming in.

         The Winemakers Federation and the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia have campaigned responsibly and professionally against this tax increase. Members of those industries are more than astonished at the Treasurer's attacks on them in his attempt to defend the government's position. The industry certainly sees the threat the government has made against them as particularly shallow. There is no doubt that a 55 per cent increase in tax will most certainly damage the low end of the market, which is required to undergird the overall profitability and expansion of this industry and to undergird its export potential. It is incredible that this government comes along and does this at the very time that this industry is successfully achieving such export growth.

         The Treasurer has claimed that tax equity between wine and other alcoholic beverages demands that we have this impost, and we have heard very fanciful claims from him in justification for it. Each and every one of those claims has been shown by the industry, in documents they have presented to the government, to be fanciful and false, yet the government still persists with these false and fanciful claims. The claim is that tax equity demands that similar industries bear similar tax levels. To say that, in taxation terms, wine should be treated at similar levels to brandy, beer and spirits begs the question as to whether they are indeed like industries. Certainly they all produce alcoholic beverages, but a logical comparison beyond that suggests that they are not the same.

         The beer industry relies on raw materials, with short production lead times, crops sown and reaped on an annual basis, plus the addition of water. The raw materials of spirits are essentially waste products. In contrast, grape vines, the raw material source for wine, require up to seven years from planting to adequate grape production. So the supply tap cannot be turned on and off over a short period in response to government tax policy that is detrimental to the industry.

It is not necessarily all about wine, though people could be excused for thinking it was totally about wine. The government in its election campaign promised no new taxes. To attack our situation the government promised no new taxes and no increased taxes. Now we have this package of sales tax bills to complete the package of lies perpetrated by this government during the election. These budget measures come in with increased sales tax in every direction. In fact, these bills will total $1 billion in a full financial year.

         I am not going to spend much time on wine tax, but that tax is an attack on a growing industry. It is growing, but still small, and this attack when it could have done without it means people in that industry will be paying 55 per cent extra. The idea behind bringing in the increase in the sales tax on wine was to balance it up with beer and spirits; but if the government wanted to balance that up, I can think of an easier way to do that, and that is to reduce the sales tax on beer and spirits. That would have been much easier. It could also have looked at other measures to cut the wasting of money—something this government is good at doing—to balance the budget.

         Increases in sales tax on any industry puts on it an impost that gets in the way of industries competing on export markets; but our wine industry also has to compete on the Australian market, so it will cause a loss in jobs. This government set out to increase job opportunities, and increasing job opportunities is what our GST package was about; yet here we have this government going in exactly the opposite direction. Last time this government put an increased tax on wine, there was a cut-down in consumption and a loss of jobs in the industry. Maybe some people reckon it is a good idea to cut down the consumption of wine. I do not know, I do not drink the stuff; but whatever the government wants to do, in this case what it is doing is bringing about the loss of jobs.

         But as I said when I first started, I am more interested in the other sales tax moves. There is a general one per cent rise: one per cent now, two per cent in August 1994. Let us look at the effect that will have on transport through plant and repairs, tyres and parts. For instance, in transport, for a prime mover that is worth about $200,000 wholesale, the tax will put $2,000 on it now and add $2,000 next year. That is $4,000. Look what that will do to the cost of transport and the cost of goods, especially in those rural and remote areas. Look at that sort of situation.

         For the family car, there is to be a wholesale sales tax rise of one per cent this year and one per cent next year. That will be $300 there. For a set of tyres that cost, say, $200 each retail and $140 wholesale, it will put $1.40 on to each tyre this year and another $1.40 next year. What does this sort of measure do? It causes people to keep plant going longer. Plant that goes longer is not as safe, not as up-to-date and not as efficient on fuel. It is the same with cars. We are trying to get more modern cars on the road in Australia, ones that use unleaded fuel. The average car out on the road in Australia is 10 years old, a 1983 model that burns leaded fuel. So how is this measure going to help? All that increased sales taxes will do is stop or cut down the sales of new cars.

I have heard big noises about the sales tax on wine which will raise $100 million or less. The general rise in sales tax is the killer. It will be raising around $1 billion.

         My time is limited so I will wind up by stating generally what these bills do. In Australia, sales tax raises $9.44 billion a year. These bills will increase that by 10.6 per cent to $10.23 billion. That is about three times what inflation is today. It is a total disgrace. Government supporters lied. They tried to shoot holes in our Fightback package. Having lied their way back into government, what are they doing now? They are breaking every rule in the book and giving us these massive rises.

One of the things that honourable senators and the general public ought to do is go back and have a look at the election promises. Senator Panizza, who has just concluded speaking, made the assertion that the government promised in the election campaign that there would be no increases in taxes. In my recollection of the election campaign—a very good election campaign to which many people contributed, which convinced the public to reject the people who now sit on the opposition benches—the government never made those grandiose promises as was asserted. It was said that there would be no general increase in taxation rates. What we are getting here is not what Senator Panizza asserted. Certainly, there are proposed increases in wine taxes. There is an 11 percentage point increase on wine; we all consume it from time to time.

         It is also said this will have a damaging effect on our export industry and the growth industry in Australian wines. This is a big lie; it is a big fib. This increase in tax on wine is not going to be levied against wines that are being exported; it is not going to be levied on them at all. The export part of the wine industry of Australia is exempted from that. Hopefully, that has put the big lie to bed as well. Following my speech, when Senator Ferguson gets to his feet, I hope he will agree with me, because I think he understands it, coming from the state that he does. He does know about this. I am not so sure that Senator Panizza does.

         What I really wanted to talk about today is the double standards that exist from time to time in this place, in the other place and out there in the community. It is not so very long ago that we had a debate in this place about the increase in the excise levied on unleaded fuel. Part of the reasoning behind that decision to increase the excise on unleaded fuel was to do with the bad health effects on our community, particularly our children, caused by lead in the environment.

I have been trying to get measurements of lead levels in the environment in my state of Western Australia. I have been able to get some indications of the ill effects of it by measurements in the capital city of Perth. Those measurements do not compare in any way with the measurements that have been made in Melbourne or in Sydney—certainly, in specific areas of those larger cities. It is not as bad a problem in Perth as it is in Melbourne or Sydney. But Western Australia is a big place; there are one million square miles in Western Australia.

So the point Senator Coulter was making a while ago about increasing the excise level of taxation on leaded fuels really does not apply right across this great nation of ours. But it was done for health reasons so we should all support it. Indeed, I think we all do support that.

Without question, the abuse of alcohol does have a bad impact on many of the citizens in our society. There are unfortunates in our society who are addicted to it. Those people are not going to be helped. It could be argued that an increase in sales tax on wine, on the alcohol content of wine, would be helping those people.

That industry was brought into stream with everybody else, but at the time we heard the gloom and doom and predictions of despair and the death of the industry.

The draft industry report shows that the Riverland area, which forms part of the statistical division of the Murray Lands, is one of the four poorest regions of Australia already.

         —Let me quote some of the other figures and then the minister may himself be able to understand. Let me say that three of the four poorest regions of Australia are in the South Australian rural and regional areas. The Yorke Peninsula-Lower North, the Murray Lands and Eyre regions all record average personal incomes of less than $14,000 per year and now there is an added impost in these areas which are already suffering. Senator McMullan comes in day after day saying that this budget is to try to help those people who are low income earners and yet here we have the people who are in the lowest income earning areas in Australia who are the ones who are suffering the most. It is very interesting to note that the people living in each of those three areas are represented by Liberal federal members of parliament. Liberal members are representing those people on lower incomes whom government members always claim that they can do the best for. Government members always claim to represent the low income people and those in the lowest socio-economic groups.

         Let me go on and give some idea of the effect of this wine increase on some of the small producers. It is the small businesses and small producers which are the ones that we are looking after. I would like to read one of the many letters that I have received from wine producers over the past months since the budget was announced. This is one letter written by two very small wine producers from Eyre Peninsula. Eyre Peninsula is one of those poorer economic regions where the average household income of something like 60 per cent of the people is less than $25,000 a year. It is from the Delacolline Estate and the Boston Bay wine producers in Port Lincoln. I will read into the

        At the present time, we represent the only members of the grapegrowing and wine industry on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. In the light of the recent savage increase in sales tax applicable to wine products, it is unlikely that we will be joined by others in the foreseeable future.

        Both of our vineyards were established in 1984. The first commercial release of wine from either vineyard was in October 1988. When the first plantings were done, there was no sales tax applicable to wine products.

        By the time we reached a productive status, the tax had been doubled. Any budgetary adjustments that we made in 1984 were consequently rendered useless, even though those adjustments had been in place for four years whilst we waited for a commercially saleable product.

        Neither of us is an exporter. The volumes of our production are such that we can only hope to realistically market our product on the domestic scene. Nevertheless, the real impact of this latest increase will be just as devastating as it is for larger producers who do export. We participate in a legitimate area of the wine market, namely the production of premium quality wines in small to medium volume. With others, we have evolved to meet a gap in the market place. Producers of our size must be extremely careful of the cost inputs whilst at the same time providing our products to the market place at a reasonable and acceptable price. We cannot overcome cost difficulties with increases in volume. This latest tax increase will go a long way to making it impossible for us to keep our products in a reasonable and affordable price range. The effective retail price on our products will instantly jump between $1 and $2 a bottle.

        We believe that the wine industry on Eyre Peninsula, however small, makes its contribution to what is already a fragile local economy, providing a level of employment, a market for local suppliers and contributing to a balanced tourist economy.

        That is signed by Mr Tony Bassett of the Delacolline Estate and Graham Ford of Boston Bay Wines. I think that highlights what will happen in the wine industry. There is no future for anybody else to take on small production, as these people have done since 1984, when the government has changed the rules. Every time they get near to putting wine into production, we see an increase which throws out all of their forward projections.

         I would like to make one other brief comment, Mr Acting Deputy President, on the issue of sales tax in general—that is just sales tax, without taking into effect the fuel taxes—and in particular its effect on regional and rural people. I note that the government still has not acted to amend the anomaly in the sales tax legislation with regard to spare parts used to recondition machinery which is later sold to exempt primary producers. It will cost primary producers another $10 million a year in taxes—$10 million which, as I have pointed out several times in this chamber, our rural sector cannot afford.

         The government has already admitted that this is an unintended consequence, and yet we have seen no legislation introduced to change that sales tax provision so that those people in rural and regional areas who are being hardest hit at present will have the benefit of tax exemption on second-hand machinery. I will confine my remarks to those matters. I urge the government to reconsider the effect that the wine tax and the sales taxes are having on those people who can ill afford it.

         In the coalition's response to the federal budget the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, outlined the position that the coalition would take. He said that we would vote against the four increases in taxation announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). During the time since the budget we have consistently opposed the increase in the fuel tax, the increase in the wholesale sales tax, the increase in the retrospective changes to taxation on accrued unused long service and annual leave lump sums, and the increase in wine sales tax. Since the budget, the opposition has been resolute and consistent in opposing all these increases.

It is incredible that a government that is supposed to support and be representing people on lower incomes brings in such measures. The effect, particularly of measures like the wholesale sales tax, will be to put a disproportionate burden on the people who can least afford it. It has become more that way as the years have gone on. During the time of this government, we have found that the top 10 per cent of the population have become richer and the bottom 10 per cent have become a lot poorer. Now the government, with these sales tax measures, is putting the boot into this group yet again.

         The other major reason why the coalition has chosen to oppose the government's tax increases is their effect on jobs. We have almost one million people unemployed in Australia. We now have an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent. But the Treasurer said that the primary objective of the budget was jobs. As I will go on to prove to Senator Cook in a few moments time, the effects of these measures will be actually to reduce jobs and increase unemployment. As a matter of fact, the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures has calculated that under the measures of the budget there will be a loss of 50,000 jobs. That is of concern across the whole country, but to people like me who are based in a regional area like the Hunter Valley it is of particular concern because our rate of unemployment is much higher than 11.1 per cent. We have an unemployment rate of 13.4 per cent in the Hunter Valley.

         The effect on the wine industry, not just in the Hunter but Australia-wide, has been pointed out by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies. It was interesting to listen to what Senator Cook had to say earlier. He kept saying, `Prove it'. This is a proper research body. The study was funded by the Arnold government. I say to Senator Cook that the Labor government of South Australia thought so much of his government's measures that it spent $250,000 on funding this study. It discovered that, following this tax measure, the sales tax on wine would put prices up by nine per cent. It would displace 15 million litres of non-premium wine. Fifty per cent of the grapes grown to support this production would disappear. Exports would be constrained by the availability of premium grapes.

Constant chopping and changing of government policy creates havoc in the industry.

What the minister fails consistently to understand—I say this through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Cook—is that to have a successful export industry one must have a thriving domestic industry that gives one economics of scale and gives the opportunity for the small wineries to become large wineries. Not only will the small wineries not become large wineries, but under the government's policies what is going to happen is that they will go out of business. This whole area will go backwards. All the economic figures that I have quoted today prove that.

         The dishonesty of the government's position is highlighted by the comments this morning of Mr Kerin, the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. He said that the policy to increase the sales tax on wine was based on `ignorance, stupidity and prejudice, and the 55 per cent tax increase is a massive disincentive to invest'. I repeat for Senator Cook's benefit that his colleague Mr Kerin, a former Treasurer, says that the 55 per cent tax increase is a massive disincentive to invest in one of our few expanding export primary industries. The government's budget is one of betrayal, and the opposition has the right to hold the government accountable and oppose these tax measures.

On the analysis coming from the opposition, people have been buying wine because there is only a 20 per cent tax on it. But if the government puts another 11 per cent tax on it, it does not matter how good the wine is, how great the quality of it is, people are not going to buy it. They are not going to buy it for its quality; they are going to buy it because it has only a 20 per cent tax on it instead of a 31 per cent tax. It is an amazing proposition that we are building an export industry, not on the basis of the quality of our wines but on the basis of the level of taxation we are going to put on it.

I do not say that, but I do say that, when they make a proper assessment of how this wine tax will affect the industry, they have to realise that it is one of many industries and it is one of a whole series of income producing organisations in the country that ought to make a contribution to what they get out of this place.

I would not say that even the Labor Party is so dense that it cannot understand what it is doing with this legislation. I can only think that the Labor Party has introduced this legislation, which is to tax one of our better industries, out of sheer prejudice—not out of a desire to gain revenue or a desire to do anything in the taxing area but simply out of prejudice.

         The arguments have been made but the debate would not be complete without some reference to the wine industry, which has the greatest potential within the Australian industry. The Australian industry is now world renowned for its quality, its value and its consistency. The area which has the greatest potential within the Australian wine industry is the Queensland wine industry. Many of our colleagues have spoken about the wine industry in other states but not a lot of people realise that there is a substantial and increasing wine industry in Queensland. There are 31 registered winemakers and approximately 25 of these winemakers use grapes. The rest of them in Queensland use tropical fruits, for example in the Daintree area of north Queensland, and they also use dates from Surat in western Queensland. Most of the vineyards in Queensland are in the Granite Belt region; other locations include St George, Roma and Charters Towers.

         The industry has 18 operating commercial wineries with a total annual crush of 600 tonnes. This is only small when compared with production in the Hunter Valley, which has a crush of around 18,000 tonnes. The Queensland industry accounts for just 0.1 per cent of Australia's total grape production. All traditional grape varieties are grown in Queensland and they all show very great promise. Over 90 per cent of the Queensland wine sales is for the Queensland market. I understand that the balance is for the Australian market and there is very little, if any, export. That is very important in this debate. The industry in Queensland has great potential. Over the last six years the industry has grown by 50 per cent. Queensland wines are increasingly gaining national recognition, winning awards in major wine shows in the southern capitals.

The Stanthorpe-Granite Belt region was starting to get real gains from the tourism activity which follows a successful wine industry. That area in the border region of Queensland, in the Granite Belt, is seeing an increase in tourist activity because of the wine industry.

         Like my colleagues, I oppose the tax on wine because it is simply brought out of prejudice by this Labor government. I am pleased to see that the Democrats and the Greens—I think—are opposing the tax. I cannot help but say what Senator Cooney was not prepared to say, that it seems to me that the attitude of the Greens and the Democrats is purely for crass political purposes. If they were concerned about the taxes on an industry affecting adversely that industry, they would be the first ones to join with us in opposing the increase in tax on petrol. But no, the Democrats are not interested in that; perhaps there are not the same sorts of votes in that in their constituencies. They seem to think that they have a real constituency in South Australia and it is to pander to that that they seem to be opposing this tax, but not opposing the petrol price increase of 7c a litre which will affect every rural industry and every other industry in Australia. That is not to say I do not welcome the Democrats' opposition to this proposal, but it does show again quite clearly the hypocrisy of this particular political party of the left.

All it proposed was that there be reductions in personal income taxes which it told us were fully funded and did not need any new taxes. That is what it told the Australian public about.

         I oppose the tax for the reasons that my colleagues have mentioned, but as well because it will set back a Queensland industry which has enormous potential for growth. Investment and expansion in the Queensland industry would vanish if this tax were to be implemented. The concessions held out by Mr Dawkins in a desperate attempt to save his position in this failing government would have mainly helped the large winemakers and disadvantaged the small companies which make up the entire Queensland industry. So Mr Dawkins was trying to buy off the big fellows but completely ignore the little fellows who comprise the total amount of the Queensland industry.

         The tax increase means a decrease in demand for wine, an oversupply of grapes, falling grape prices and heavily discounted wine competing for a smaller domestic market. Consequently, winemakers will be absorbing the tax rather than passing it on. The government just does not seem to understand that winemakers are price takers, not price setters. As I mentioned previously, Queensland does not export wine; so this tax will fall directly upon it. I am sure Senator Burns, as a loyal Queenslander, will be joining me in opposing these taxes which will adversely affect the wine industry in Queensland.

         I am informed that, if this tax were to go through, there would be many wineries in Queensland that would become bankrupt. It would completely stifle this new and potent industry for Queensland—an industry which, without this tax, will make very great strides.

I point out to Senator Cooney that Mr Kerin—not I, not the Liberal Party, not the industry but Mr Kerin himself, one of the honourable senator's colleagues—said that the proposed wine tax increase was based on `ignorance, stupidity and prejudice'. It seems that so much of the legislation in this budget—I mention also the FBT on business travel, which according to former Labor minister Mr John Brown is in the same category—is based on prejudice by the Labor Party against others in Australia.

         Perhaps I should begin also by answering some of what Senator Cooney had to say, in particular to stress that the wine industry is already paying a considerable amount of tax. This is an increase on what it is expected to pay now. More importantly, I should put in a couple of points that Senator Cooney glossed over. This industry provides more than just a tax base for the government. It also provides employment, particularly employment in rural areas of Australia, where jobs are not easy to come by, and in particular it provides this country with considerable income, thanks to its success on the export markets.

         The Democrats believe that winemakers have provided sufficient evidence to show that this sudden tax increase would have a negative impact on the industry—indeed, quite a disastrous impact, not just on the industry itself but also on entire rural communities. There is no doubt that winemakers feel betrayed.

         The winemakers believe the proposed tax increase to 31 per cent would see the retail price of wine jump somewhere between nine and 15 per cent, resulting in a $100 million fall in domestic wholesale sales. They base these figures on what has happened previously when there has been an increase in the tax on wine. The winemakers say that the proposed tax increases would have seen the displacement of 50,000 tonnes of grapes and that $126 million per year in export income would have been lost.

I had first-hand evidence of that when I recently visited the Coonawarra area of South Australia, where a number of plantings have been put on hold awaiting the outcome of this tax impost. The $445 million in lost investment is in an industry that proudly boasts that it is on target to achieve its goal of $1 billion worth of export sales by the turn of the century.

         The extent of the damage that this tax could have caused is open to debate. It is open to debate primarily because the government has no industry plan for the wine industry. The government has not done its homework. It does not have the figures. Indeed, it seems from the letter from Mr Kerin leaked to the

So we cannot put a precise figure on how many grape growers would have been pushed to the wall to the point where they were forced out of the industry or how many small wineries would have closed. What we do know is that some grape growers would certainly have gone, or indeed will go if we have an impost of this type, and that some wineries certainly would not have survived.

         The need to develop a full industry policy for the wine industry is now urgent. The budget shows that the only industry policy that the Australian Labor Party seems to be able to come up with is one that revolves around the idea of to tax or not to tax, one with absolutely no parts that consider what this industry is able to contribute to the Australian economy. The winemakers' view is that there certainly will be severe damage, and the Democrats do not question that. Their views are supported in the findings of a detailed examination conducted by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies.

         Given the nature of the export market—the low price points on the market and the higher production costs associated with the smaller levels of production—the smaller wineries have to market their wine hard in order to compete at the higher price end in export markets. Significant costs are involved in a marketing exercise of this nature. Notwithstanding, the possibility that many small wineries will successfully export part of their volume, it is anticipated that these wineries will experience a decline in sales as a result of the increase in sales tax to the order of 3.6 per cent in the short run and up to 18 per cent in the long run . . .

Now is the time for investment in marketing activities which build market-based assets . . . It is in light of this commercial reality that any change in the tax system which reduces the ability of Australian wine exporters to invest in the building of market-based assets has the potential to substantially downgrade the industry's international competitive advantage . . . Put simply, the Australian wine industry's competitive advantage is neither as secure or as strong as some would wish. One hopes it has the ability to weather the consequences of this tax increase but any drop in the investment in export marketing activities is a waste of a current, temporary opportunity.

The government must put aside this tax grab and institute a thorough regional development study into this industry. Indeed, the wine industry is a perfect case for such a study.

In its current form the commission, with its entrenched ideological bias towards extreme economic rationalism, is not going to be the way to proceed. It is interesting to compare the very detailed work the government was able to put into the Button car plan and, indeed, the excellent work that has also gone into a policy for the pharmaceutical industry, with the fact that it has done no work at all on the wine industry. There is no effort on the part of the government to put forward a comprehensive package for this industry to ensure its future. Hopefully, the Democrats' decision not to support the proposed tax increases on wine will help the government to get to such a point where it will acknowledge that an industry plan is required. If the government does not, then the Democrats will proceed anyway. As Senator Spindler was able to show with his successful inquiry into tariffs, we can put together an independent parliamentary inquiry. Indeed, it is urgent that we do this if the government itself is not prepared to move on the wine industry.

The Democrats will continue to oppose any increase in future budgets unless there has been that full and detailed study; and that examination has then led to a detailed industry policy that shows a tax as an acceptable part of the package; and that taxing the industry in such a way will not have any negative impact or repercussions.

         The Winemakers Federation represents one of Australia's few industries clearly able to establish export goals, and feels it has been tripped at the last hurdle by the government's change of rules. The change of rules does not even represent a distribution of burden but is a straightforward, discriminatory, targeted action aimed at the one industry which is constructing an orderly solution to the Australian malaise in the international marketplace. The ultimate disappointment for the Winemakers Federation is that it will not make its full contribution to the Australian economy if it is hamstrung by this government's taxation policies—indeed, hamstrung by taxation policies here, while its international competition enjoys subsidies rather than taxes. Let us hope sanity prevails in this debate and that an industry plan can be quickly and thoroughly developed so that we will be enhancing this export industry, enhancing the employment opportunities it is able to offer and actually supporting a very valuable Australian industry.

         I must say that I was rather amused at the wide-ranging contribution to the debate by Senator Cooney, who came in here with a great pile of papers and showed us today's headlines about the share market, as if that were going to save Australia. He did not mention the adjacent headline, `Former Minister brands wine tax hike dishonest'. I went out and got out the share price list, thinking that I would see how the wineries were going. The only four I could find were Penfolds, which had not moved; Petaluma, which had gone down; Peter Lehmann Wines, which had gone down; and Rothbury, which had not moved. Whilst the share market might be steaming ahead with gains of 40c and 50c by some of the major companies and the blue-chips, certainly the buyers have not fallen over themselves to buy shares in wineries. I can understand why when I look at the decision that this government has taken to impose a 55 per cent increase in sales tax on the industry.

         This industry is one that has really been a flag carrier in the last few years. Its exports have grown by 1,000 per cent in six years. It has gone from a $20 million industry in 1986 to $300 million in 1993. As Senator Tierney said earlier, it was on track to become a $1 billion wine export industry by the year 2000; but I am afraid that is not now going to happen. It has been an example of our technology and of cooperation between industry and science. It is another example of the wonderful work that the CSIRO and the Wine Research Institute have done. It is interesting to note that large winemakers such as Penfolds, Orlando and Hardys have ploughed almost $40 million a year into the industry.

The interesting part is that, I believe, the French are actually advertising a French chardonnay made in the Australian way.

         To reiterate, the government's wine tax will, at one blow, increase retail sales prices by up to 15 per cent, reduce domestic sales by $100 million, raise sales tax from $200 million to $279 million, cut export income by $126 million each year, cut back on investment in the vineyards by $250 million, cut back on investment inventory by $160 million and slash investment on equipment by $35 million. For the government to try to gain a projected $79 million, the wine industry is going to suffer a total investment and income loss of some $445 million. What a ridiculous state of affairs that is.

In the few brief minutes I have left, I particularly want to put in a word for the fledgling wine industry in Tasmania because, as Senator Murphy would know, Tasmania being a small state has been relying on its high quality products to become very competitive and to make a name for itself with such things as its fish exports and its high-priced luxury goods such as cheeses. The Tasmanian wine industry has become an integral part of this as it has also become an integral part of our tourism industry. We have 100 winegrowers and 25 of those have full-scale operations. They employ about 100 people and they have 400 people on a part-time basis. So whilst these may not be huge numbers, from our point of view in a state of our size they are quite significant. In fact, this year the Tasmania winegrowers will harvest something like 1,200 tonnes of grapes which will produce more than one million bottles of very high quality Tasmanian wine.

         This industry did not just happen overnight. In fact, the first experimental vineyard of any consequence was established by the CSIRO in conjunction with the local winegrowers at a property right next to mine some 20-odd years ago. I had the pleasure of watching this wine industry development. Bob Menary from the CSIRO has been mentioned in Tasmania as one of the early pioneers of the industry. Claudio Alcorso is well known to most Tasmanians. I believe he is a very good Democrat or Greens supporter at the moment, but in the early days he was a very good Labor supporter and his son was a strong Labor voter. I can tell honourable senators that they are not very pleased with what has happened with the wine industry because the Alcorsos were, really, the first major wine producers in Tasmania.

         They have just invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in improving their vineyard, bringing in a restaurant and making it into a wonderful tourist attraction. We can understand the devastating effect that this increase in wine tax is going to have on them. I spoke to one of the members of the family only on Sunday and, like Senator Lees who was here earlier, he gave me the same sort of sad news that she has been receiving from her constituents. So it really is very serious; it is not something that can be scoffed at.

         The increase in the wine tax is going to have a devastating effect, particularly on small wineries in all sorts of areas over Australia. As I said earlier, the wine industry itself is not only producing export wines, it also has a very important role to play in the tourism aspects of each different area. As wine drinkers like Senator Murphy and Senator Loosley would know, a wine reflects the nature of a particular area and for that reason it is popular. People like to take what they see as part of an area when they are visiting and so it is very important for our tourism industry.

         Time is short so I will conclude by reiterating that the wine industry is one of the true success stories of our recent agricultural endeavours. It has prospered because winegrowers all over Australia—like those in Tasmania—have concentrated on a quality product. I guess some of that growth of the wine industry can be attributed to our friends from overseas. It was originally commenced, in Tasmania anyway and I guess in some other places, by immigrants who brought their skills to our country. There is no doubt—as Mr Kerin said this morning—the government tax will decimate the industry. The industry itself says so, and independent financial research confirms those views. We will be opposing this tax because we believe, unlike the government, that the wine industry is very well worth preserving.

        First of all, I remind the House that any taxation changes, unpopular as they inevitably are if they involve increases in taxation for any section of the community, have to be seen in their overall economic context as part of a Budget which seeks to achieve an overall economic objective. At this time, amongst other things, the economic objective is to take pressure off interest rates which is a very important cause to all Australia's families, and the entire country. Therefore, it is important to see these changes in the context of the Budget because they are clearly an integral part of the Budget and cannot be severed from it. It has been our view from the beginning that they are central to the Budget. That has been and will remain the view of the Government on this legislation.

         The circumstances that confront us this afternoon are well beyond those that just reflect upon the tax measures that are proposed. Senator Ian Macdonald, in his earlier contribution, actually maintained that the legitimacy of the Labor government was in some question. As coalition speakers are wont to do these days, he continually talked about whether or not the government had a mandate to legislate in the national interest. The answer to that is a resounding yes; of course, the Labor government has a mandate to govern—confirmed for the fifth successive time by the Australian people on 13 March 1993.

         It is not only a circumstance whereby we made certain commitments to the Australian people which we are about honouring, including the tax cuts which also form an important and integral part of the current budget. We also made certain commitments not to do things. We maintained, for example, that tax would not rise overall relative to GDP. That commitment has been honoured. We also maintained that we would not do things that were being proposed opposite consistently and vehemently—slashing Medicare to pieces, up-ending the industrial relation system and introducing a goods and services tax, 15 per cent, on everything that opens and shuts. There is no question that, in terms of commitments, we committed ourselves to take certain positive steps. We are doing precisely that. We also committed ourselves not to do certain things that are still embraced by the coalition, and we have honoured that commitment as well.

         We cannot have a debate on tax in the chamber without reflecting on Australia's position among Western industrial countries overall. Australia, according to the OECD, now has the lowest rate of tax applying in any Western industrial economy. That is a first-class achievement in terms of the direction in which the government has gone over the last decade. When we came to office, after the Fraser-Howard-Stone period, we had tax rates routinely going above 60 per cent. They are now, in many cases, half that, or getting towards half that. We have seen the corporate tax rate well down, we have seen the individual and personal tax rates well down and we are seeing another raft of tax cuts coming through as a consequence of this budget, when ultimately it is passed, even by the recalcitrant senators opposite.

         The Tasmanian forest industry has had a number of inquiries over a long time, the most recent of which was set up arising out of the Helsham inquiry. It was funded by the federal government and a forests and forest industry council was put in place. It was made up of bodies representing the conservation movement, industry, state and federal government, and the trade union movement. It conducted a process of seeking to develop a strategy for Tasmania's forests arising out of other inquiries and also of trying to settle disputes arising out of those matters and the use of the state's forests.

         The process dragged on for a long time. I think it started in about 1989 or 1990. I was a member of the Forests and Forest Industry Council, by ministerial appointment. I have to say that, although at the start we had great initiative and, I think, we set down some very clear objectives for the state's forests, many of which were very good objectives, we still failed to deal with some of the very key and important issues.

         We have gone from being an industry that was quite a large employer to an industry where we have lost a lot of jobs in a lot of the larger manufacturing mills such as paper and pulp, mainly due to technology. I am concerned with the sawmilling industry. The state government at the moment has the opportunity to deal with the industry and actually bring about some changes, particularly in light of the recent sale to Amcor of the paper making processes that belong to North Broken Hill.

         I will go back to make the point about how the major companies operated in this state. Some years ago they were granted concessional rights on the basis that they would undertake downstream processing. Those rights were granted in very substantial areas of forest over long periods of time. They were legislated rights, but they were mostly associated with a program that required the company or companies that had those rights to enter into downstream processing, primarily associated with pulp and paper manufacture.

         Sadly, we have seen the demise of those industries to the extent that North Broken Hill has sold the APPM paper mills it owned at Burnie and Wesley Vale. The company still retains the concessional rights, and it is my view that it should not. I believe the state government ought to terminate the rights.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I say that because in 1991 there was legislation passed in the House of Assembly in Tasmania—and supported by the then Liberal opposition—that concessional rights would be replaced with wood supply agreements, and that those wood supply agreements would be based on volume rather than area. It is my view that the current Liberal government ought to terminate immediately the concessional rights that still exist in Tasmania's forests today. It is the only way that we will see the industry changed in a way that will ensure greater participation from other developers and other proposers in what I hope will be better downstream and value adding processes for the wood that we take out on a commercial basis from both the public and private forests in the state.

         In the circumstances that exist now, we have North Broken Hill proposing a further woodchip mill. North Broken Hill initially proposed it on the basis of primarily using wood from the company's private property. It was going to be built for the primary reason of securing the future of the two paper mills at Burnie and Wesley Vale, but they are paper mills that they no longer own. As a result of that, I have some doubt as to the legitimacy of the company's claim for the building of another woodchip mill.

         Nevertheless, I think that if we are able to convince investors to build a pulp mill in Tasmania in the longer term, it will be a very worthwhile investment.

         One of the other very important areas is the utilisation of the wood. When we actually cut trees down we should try to maximise the value adding. Some people would say that if one looked at value adding on a dollar basis one would make it all into paper. It is probably true that on a dollar per tonne basis paper is the most valuable manufactured product that one can get out of trees; but it does not employ many people, and it is going to employ fewer because of the technology that is available in the industry.

         The Tasmanian state government has not signed the federal government's national forest policy statement; it is the only state that has not signed.

The statement says that we have to take it into account that:

This simply should not be allowed to continue. The statement says:

        Again I would have to say that the state Liberal government has failed dismally to do that, even though it currently has proposals before it that would increase the recovery and utilisation of wood harvested from Tasmania's forest and would also increase employment in the industry. The state government has not done anything about it. In fact, one proposer who has sought my assistance has had nothing but difficulty—brick walls, almost, are put up to the projects that he has proposed. Given the state of unemployment in Tasmania, it is a sad reflection on any government that it would take that sort of position.

         As the Senate representative on the council of the National Library of Australia, I was present recently when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, officially launched the current contents database service developed by the Council of Australian University Librarians. In his speech, Mr Beazley noted that the architects of the current contents database are addressing a very real problem faced by libraries in the higher education sector. Mr Beazley acknowledged that, with the cost of journals rising annually at a rate substantially above inflation, pressure is being placed on libraries to cut serial subscriptions, especially as more and more library expenditure is taken up by serials at the expense of books.

         It is outrageous that this government can acknowledge the problem and then fail to come up with any sort of workable solution. It has decided to increase funding, but what a pathetic amount! At the National Library, the minister tried to boast about the measly $5 million extra he planned to spend. I must point out to the Senate that this $5 million will be spent across 36 universities. Also, he is not talking about an annual figure; he is talking about a triennial figure. Bringing that back to how much extra he is planning to spend on capital infrastructure for libraries in the next three years across Australia, it amounts to a figure of $50,000 per university per year. That will go a long way! It is really throwing cents at a problem that needs big dollars to fix it.

         Mr Beazley should know that the $5 million that the government has allocated for the next triennium is on top of the miserable $1.5 million over the past three years. This is creating, over the six-year period—the last three and the next three—a massive run-down in our university library system. What this minimal commitment shows is that the federal government simply does not understand the extent of the crisis it has created.

         The effects of this crisis have been illustrated recently to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training inquiry into the organisation and funding of research in higher education. The hearings of our committee have been conducted all over Australia, and at each university we are constantly hearing about the deteriorating state of university libraries. At the hearing in Perth, Mr Ellis, the librarian at the University of Western Australia, said:

        The dire nature of some of these consequences was probably best illustrated at the University of Adelaide. There they have an excellent library, the Barr Smith Library, which really becomes a regional library, in a sense, for the rest of South Australia. The pressure on the Barr Smith Library was so great that it could not keep up with just restacking the shelves from use. Because the librarian did not have sufficient money, he was forced into a position where he had to bar access to that university's library by people outside the university, and that bar continued for three months.

         It is Third World stuff if libraries are forced into a position where they are so lacking in resources—not just for books and journals, but for proper staffing—that they have to cut back to that extent. What is the minister's answer? His answer is $5 million over three years for 36 universities—$50,000 per university per year—to solve what is an absolutely massive problem.

         It is now reaching the stage in some universities where the journals, which are absolutely essential for research, are being cut back—not just fringe, marginal journals but essential journals. Journals can be very expensive and the costs are going up, but the government is not recognising this in its funding arrangement. What is happening in a number of universities is that they are saying to the various departments, `We want you to cut a number of journals out of the annual stock you subscribe to. Your choice, you can pick the journals, but you have got to cut them out'. As I said before, this is really Third World stuff.

         Additionally, just as the libraries of our higher education sector are not able to keep up with updating their journals, nor are they able to keep up with the technological advances that are occurring so rapidly in the information industry. A major capital injection is needed for library infrastructure to enable them to access electronic databases in Australia and especially those now being created overseas. This is the life blood of academic research, yet because of the lack of funding by this government our academics are being denied it. Our academics and researchers cannot remain at the forefront if they do not have regular access to this information.

         I first became involved in this issue some years ago when I assisted a constituent, who happened to have been born in the same part of the world, who had just discovered—he was in his late fifties—that he had some relatives living back home. He had no travel documents and he came to me for assistance to get travel documents so that he could go back and visit his sister, who was very ill. Luckily, we were able to arrange for the travel documents to be provided quickly. He was able to jump on a plane and to meet up with his sister just before she died.

I have met with a number of people who approached me for assistance in the matter. These people allege that in their childhood, while they were in these institutions, they were abused not only physically but also sexually. It was disturbing to sit and talk with people who were trying to block out memories from their childhood. It was very difficult, and I felt inadequate to the task of talking with these people about something they did not want to talk about yet did want to talk about.

        I hope that the government does not agree with the writer of that particular letter, because the Brothers organisations themselves have conducted their own inquiry into this matter. They have been motivated, from the results of that inquiry, to publish an apology and a form of explanation in the media. They have publicly admitted that some form of sexual abuse and physical abuse has occurred in institutions which they were in charge of. That report, the result of their investigations, remains secret to the Brothers organisations. Whilst they would argue that they have a right for it to remain secret, it is a matter for the community. And it is a matter, I believe, not only for the current Western Australian state government, but also for this government.

Unfortunately, when accusations like this are made in our community, all people get tarred with the same brush; and nowhere are the VOICES organisation, the victims or I saying that all Brothers are abusers. We have never said that. Neither has Mr Blyth and neither have any of the spokespersons and, to the best of my knowledge, neither have any of the victims made that accusation. Nonetheless, it does happen that it is spread around. So it can help to clear up the name of the Brothers organisation and, to a certain extent, the church as well.

I do not think a parliamentary inquiry would be the right way to investigate the various allegations that have been made on this issue—I really do not think that is the right way to go—but, if it is the last course open to us, that might be a road that we will have to go down.

         I am a product of the Christian Brothers education system, and I must say this in their defence: if it were not for the Christian Brothers movement, a lot of people in a lot of places today would not have had the opportunity to gain a secondary education. The Brothers provided boarding schools that were cheaper than the normal private schools around the place. They were probably a third of the price of the normal boarding high schools that were available. It was through these cheaper schools that people were provided with an education, and it was a good education.

         For that reason, with the other reasons that Senator McKiernan has mentioned, I want to see an inquiry. From what I have seen, there could have been a few rotten apples in the barrel. The brothers who are still alive will now be quite old. But it does not matter how old they are; I do not accept the excuse that an inquiry should not be held because they are too old. I do not want the whole Christian Brothers movement brought down or discredited because of those few rotten apples. The brothers did provide for the education of a lot of people. There are a lot of good Christian brothers who are still alive, and I still have contact with them.

         I welcome an inquiry. I have made inquiries, too. Christian brothers, just like sisters, do not stay in the orders for ever. I took the opportunity of speaking to a former Christian brother whose opinions I trust. I knew he was a former Christian brother, but he did not know that I knew. I rang him up one day and broached the subject. I asked him to tell me what went on, and whether there was any need for an inquiry or whatever. I wanted to know. I will defend the innocent, but I will not defend anyone who is guilty of some of these alleged crimes. Having that in mind, and having spoken to Brother Faulkner, I am of the opinion that we need an inquiry.

         Only last week I wrote to Brother Faulkner telling him my view that it is time that we held an inquiry. Four or five years ago he was rather reticent about having an inquiry. I also wrote to the Catholic Archbishop of Perth, encouraging him to have an inquiry. I thought that as head of the church in Western Australia he should be involved, but to date he has been backward in being involved. The inquiry will show whether there was right or wrong, and I believe the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Western Australia should be involved.

         Senator McKiernan will probably be interested to know that I have written to Cheryl Edwardes, acknowledging what she has said—what Senator McKiernan read out to the chamber. I suggested to her, and in fact I implored her, to have a judicial inquiry. Like Senator McKiernan, I do not think a parliamentary inquiry is really the way to go, but if we were to be denied a judicial inquiry then I would support it. I think we have got a bipartisan approach on this. I will certainly keep encouraging Cheryl Edwardes, the Attorney-General in Western Australia, to have an inquiry, and I hope that over the ensuing weeks or months we will get some result.

         —I rise to speak about a matter concerning Senator Richardson answering a dorothy dixer in question time. I will quote his reply to the question, which was in relation to the medical benefits schedule:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The AMA has been claiming that the latest increases can be defended on the basis that the MBS fee has not kept pace with doctors' costs. Between 1984 and 1992 the average medical benefits schedule fee went up 62 per cent. At the same time the CPI went up 59.8 per cent and full time average weekly earnings went up 54.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I probably should entitle my few words `Lies, damned lies and medical economic statistics' because that was the gist of what Senator Richardson was talking about. I have done an analysis since the reply and I am appalled that a minister of the crown should manipulate statistics to suit his own purposes in an attack that has gone on for two days now. On the one hand, he has spent the time since he was appointed Minister for Health going around the country telling everybody what they wanted to hear because that is how he functions, I know from past activity; on the other hand, he has been giving them a slap over the face when it suits his political purposes. Ultimately, as I mentioned previously, they will wake up to it and understand how he does function.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I would like to revert to the statistics. The first point to make is that there have been dramatic changes in medical services between 1984 and 1992. The actual explosion in technology has been phenomenal, far exceeding any of the other explosions in technology that have occurred, say, in telecommunications, the developments in fax machines, mobile telephones, et cetera. In that time we have seen, for example, the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy—removal of the gall bladder—through the use of video cameras and instruments, allowing the patient to be discharged from hospital within 48 hours but often 24 hours, as opposed to the situation in 1984 where a patient was in hospital for about a week and then unable to return to work for at least four weeks, sometimes six weeks. That time is now a week.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So the first point I want to make is that there have been dramatic changes in relation to medical services. To come back to Senator Richardson's answer, to equate an average medical service in 1984 to an average medical service in 1992 is comparing apples with pears or something of that nature. There is no such thing. It is like comparing a motor vehicle that you bought in 1984 with the improvements that have occurred in the average motor vehicle that you can buy now.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The next point in relation to those statistics is that some of those procedures, of course, take a lot longer in time to perform—to use that same operation again, the removal of a gall bladder using video cameras to do those procedures. As Senator Kemp would know, it is like using chopsticks as a lot of us do sometimes in eating Chinese food; surgeons have to learn those procedures using chopsticks through small holes in the abdominal wall to remove internal organs.

         —Not at all. It is very successful, as Senator Schacht would know from his knowledge of these procedures. The other comparison that puts the lie to the figures that were produced is, as I mentioned, not only the sort of technology but the introduction of technology. One of the most dramatic increases has been in the insertion of ocular lenses, and there have been coronary bypass procedures, diagnostic imaging, organ replacement—all those things. So to draw a comparison, as I mentioned, between 1984 and 1992 in relation to medical procedures is also fallacious.

         The next point I want to make is in relation to the bulk-billing of services. Again he claims that something like 80 per cent of procedures are bulk-billed. But what he does not tell us is that most pathology and most radiology is bulk-billed. Of the specialty procedures, less than 10 per cent are actually bulk-billed. The bulk-billing is heavily weighted by 24-hour clinics, the very group that he is looking at in relation to overservicing and the other matters in relation to that. He has ignored practice costs. On the one hand, he is saying that is immaterial and, on the other hand, he is introducing tax bills that will considerably send up the cost of petrol, when a major feature of medical practices is driving between hospitals and seeing patients in their homes. That is not acknowledged on his part.

         Using the CPI as a reference guide, I can produce a table for him which quite clearly demonstrates that the CPI has accelerated far in advance of medical benefits schedule fees, which is the true measure, rather than actual medical costs. It has exceeded them by over 20 per cent in that time. He did not acknowledge that the Auditor-General in his report in 1991 clearly stated that the medical benefits schedule fee is regarded, for audit purposes, as the fee that the government is prepared to subsidise a patient for his medical costs. It has no relation whatsoever to the costs of practice or the fees charged by doctors. That is conveniently forgotten. The Auditor-General said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no longer a single well established and commonly understood basis for the schedule fee. Reductions in schedule fees have generally resulted in reduced observance of schedule fees by medical practitioners and increased costs to patients.

        The very man who, when he was minister, introduced the concept of co-payment in relation to pharmaceutical benefits and claimed that it was an important feature in restricting the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme—and it has successfully done so—is now claiming that that is not acceptable in relation to medical services.

         Finally, he instanced the top 25 per cent—`quartile' was the word he used—of medical specialists who earned incomes. His figures were, for the ophthalmologists, obstetricians and ENT surgeons, between $400,000 and $500,000. Senator Patterson interjected with the previous point about ignoring practice costs. I have done an interesting exercise—I have not completed it, so I cannot give the figures—on the top quartile of politicians. It is very interesting. The minister has 13 personal staff, even more than Senator Schacht has.

I know whom I would rather trust in those circumstances. It is no good his coming in here, throwing mud at the top of a profession and then smugly sitting down and saying, `Aren't they rats? Aren't they terrible? They are costing the Australian public this'. I know what members of the Australian public would think about whether they would have the bunch of politicians down here or the top percentile of eye specialists, obstetricians and ENT surgeons around the place, if one wanted to put them in a boat and send them offshore. I will expand on this at a future date in relation to bulk-billing. It is obvious when we look at the bulk-billing figures that there are many other factors there.

         As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which conducted a hearing into this matter last Monday, I think it has to be asked how a mistake of this magnitude could occur. I suppose it is not surprising when one considers that this amendment bill arises out of an error in previous amendments which were overseen by the former minister for customs, now the Minister for Communications, Mr Beddall. As we have seen, the former minister has moved to bigger and better mistakes over pay TV.

         However, with regard to this particular mistake, it has recently been contended that under paragraph 41 of the Customs Tariff Act and the accompanying customs administrative by-law, the duty-free importation of all passenger motor vehicles, including by those companies which are not participants in the car plan—that is, which are not domestic manufacturers—is allowed. It is as a result of this that at least two companies which are not domestic manufacturers have now submitted claims to the Australian Customs Service for a refund of duty paid on all vehicles imported in the last 12 months.

         This is obviously contrary to the original intention of the car plan, to support only those importers which manufacture in Australia. Duty is paid on a motor vehicle at the time it is imported. The duty is subsequently claimed back from the Australian Customs Service, if export credits are available. Importers who are eligible for a refund of duty using export facilitation credits obtain a determination from the Australian Customs Service which waives payment of duty on vehicle and components when they land on the dock. This has obvious cash flow and administrative benefits because the businesses do not have to pay duty and then claim back a refund. Importers who do not have these facilitation credits simply pay the duty and obtain the cargo.

If this duty was successfully claimed from customs, it could provide a windfall for the companies concerned because the duty has already been paid, and it has already been built into the sale price of the vehicles. Moreover, as the claim is for a rebate of duty paid over the past 12 months, many of these vehicles would have already been sold. So it is for these reasons that the consumers presumably would not gain any benefit at all from refunding duty to non-exporting companies.

         It is important to note that the two companies that I have mentioned did not apply for a duty exemption. I guess that is because they had already paid the levy before they found out there was this possible loophole, and only then did they decide to take advantage of what might be construed as a drafting error in the legislation. I note that other car importers have not tried to take advantage of this error, because they want to see stability in the car plan. But I wonder how long these companies would have held out in the face of their competitors getting an unfair advantage. I cannot imagine it would have been too long. How long would it take them to join the line to claim a refund? For all the reasons that I have outlined so far, the coalition obviously supports the original intent of the export facilitation scheme. Therefore, we will be supporting this amendment bill.

         Having said that, I have several serious reservations. The first concerns the right of all Australians to rely on the law as it is written. The two companies involved have relied on the law as it is written, and they have applied for a refund of duty paid, even though they have not earned export credit points. They believed, and they had advice that the law, as it stands, allows them to do this. I also have a concern with the retrospective nature of the bill because we are always loath to support retrospective legislation, and for very good reason. I would like to quote one small passage from the evidence that was given to the committee by Mr Carlsson from Volvo Australia in which he said:

         I would also like to point out that we are very concerned about the retrospectivity of the proposed legislation. What industry wants is to have stable conditions and a legal framework within which to work that does not alter and does not change. We have in this country experienced quite a lot of uncertainty and changes to legislation without proper notice being given. We find it difficult to operate under such conditions.

         May I just call to your attention that not even at the present time do we know what sales tax is to apply to the sales we are making and have to make. The luxury car tax has been going up and down with very little prior notice. It makes it very difficult for us to plan and it causes losses to our company and then, in the long run, also to the consumers of Australia. We would very much resent it if the legislation were to be passed retroactively.

        He says `retroactively', but I think he means `retrospectively'. We have a particular concern about the retrospectivity, and have a belief that we should not be agreeing to retrospective legislation. It is our view that taxpayers must be confident in the legislation so that they can plan accordingly for the future. They must be certain that a government cannot levy extra taxes and charges which are retrospective, and hence certain that they will not face a backdated fiscal responsibility.

         However, there are some places where the coalition may feel that there are compelling reasons to support retrospective legislation. It was with this in mind, and because of the retrospectivity of the nature of this legislation—Volvo in particular having applied for a refund of the duty paid because it believed it was entitled to that under the current legislation—that the matter was raised at the committee hearing. The rules have been changed after Volvo had made application for the refund of duty that was already paid. Had this legislation been changed 12 months ago, or at the time of its making that application, I am quite sure the company would have never made that application.

         With this in mind, the committee in its deliberations believed that as there was no provision for a refund of the lodgement fees, the government should make an ex gratia payment to those who lodged applications under the legislation that was in force at the time. This was communicated to the minister, and I compliment him on the speed with which a reply was given to the committee. In a letter to the finance minister he has asked that those application fees that were paid under the original legislation, which will now be superseded by this retrospective legislation, should be refunded to those companies—including Volvo.

I am quite sure that he would have had an answer by now, but I think it would not be right for us to proceed under the belief that these fees will be refunded and then find at some later stage that they are not to be refunded. As I understand it, it is only a request from the minister.

         In considering the retrospective element of the amendment bill currently before us, the coalition has examined what would happen if we did not allow the amendment to go through. We have considered the likely impact on industry and consumers and the original intentions of the legislation. Accordingly, and after considerable deliberation, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. The amendments proposed are obviously in line with the original car plan, and to oppose the amendments would give car companies which do not manufacture in Australia an unintended advantage. We have, I believe, made a responsible choice, but one we would not have had to make if the legislation had been right in the first place.

         The drafting error makes it possible for a manufacturer to claim the credits without actually having exported vehicles. Clearly, that is not the intent of the legislation and it would be ludicrous to allow that to happen. The Australian Democrats are therefore supporting it. We are well and truly aware that this is retrospective legislation. I wish to put on record as well that this is something that is abhorrent to us. Under normal circumstances, we would not agree to retrospective legislation. Indeed, we have weighed this one very carefully. But in this case it is quite clearly an error.

If all individual senators and members in the parliament felt that it was their right or responsibility to scrutinise or to have their staff scrutinise legislation, there would be much less likelihood of such errors going through to legislation with their unintended consequences.

We believe that if it had gone through the legal process of challenge we would have won, but there was a doubt. When there is a doubt on an industry policy of such size and importance to Australia, the government is not willing to take even that slight risk.

         —I do stand by what I said back in August on this subject. Indeed, I agree with what Mr Kerin has said in this respect because the selective quoting of Mr Kerin's private correspondence omits to include a couple of really rather crucial sentences where, at the outset of his letters to a small number of people in the industry, he said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are no reasons in tax equity why wine should not be taxed at a higher rate.

        More specifically, in response to what Senator Tierney has just said, the second sentence states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I don't believe the dire results projected by the wine industry with a 31 per cent tax will necessarily occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly, as I say, the government agrees with Mr Kerin's judgment in this latter respect for a number of reasons. The first is that wine exports will continue to be wholly exempt from WST, given the nature of that taxation; but, secondly, and more specifically, because there are indications that there is still very strong investor support for the industry, particularly given its present buoyant state with exports at record levels and the long term future is very bright.

         I remind Senator Tierney—he might not be aware of the facts—that since the budget BRL Hardy, for example, has announced a $75 million vineyard development program. Again, South Australia Brewing has announced additional capital expenditure of $100 million to $150 million over the next few years. This is not the response of an industry that feels itself subject to some kind of knockout blow as a result of what was contained in the budget in this respect.

         Another thing to bear in mind about what we have said in the budget, because I think these have been insufficiently emphasised in the debate, is that wine will be permanently excluded from the imposition of excise. That is something the wine industry has sought for a very long time—a guarantee of exclusion in that respect—and that is exactly what it got.

         Wine does remain lightly taxed and the increase in wholesale sales tax applying to wine has reduced a longstanding anomaly that did place wine at a very significant tax advantage over beer and spirits. That tax anomaly was a legitimate concern, given that wine and beer are substitutable alcoholic beverages. Prior to the changes, beer and spirits were taxed around four times more heavily than wine. That gap has been a little reduced as a result of the changes and certainly it is not an intention, I repeat, to impose an excise on wine, which would close the gap completely.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The remaining point to be made is that the tax we are proposing will also be progressive because the price impact will be lowest on the cheapest wine. The price of a four litre cask of wine is estimated to increase from only around $7 to $7.50 and there will be similar orders of magnitude on bottled wine. Mr President, that is the response. I do not think we have anything to be remotely apologetic about in terms of the way that this issue has been handled and certainly not in terms of the basic core proposition about the impact of these proposals on the industry as a whole.

        Quite clearly, we have a package of legislation which was rammed through the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. Although the minister, Mr Kierath, claimed that his legislation was similar to this government's proposal, it is significantly different in a number of ways, but most importantly because it does not have a no disadvantage test. That is the crucial difference.

         The only constraint on flexibility which our proposal provides is a no disadvantage test. That means that employers can have all the flexibility in the world, except to cut the conditions of workers. People who do not like it are complaining only because they cannot pursue their preferred policy, which is to cut the wages and conditions of working men and women. We do not accept that, we will not accept that and that will not be the basis of any package which we introduce. That is what is fundamentally flawed about the proposal in Western Australia. It is why Mr Viner's advice is such good advice. It leaves individual workers unprotected in negotiating their wages and conditions and it stands in very stark contrast to the more reasonable, humane and consistent with Australian tradition policy of industrial relations which we are putting forward.

         The introduction of random drug testing into the Defence Force working environment is an initiative with which I, as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, and Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, are in complete agreement. I firmly believe that all possible protection needs to be provided to service personnel who are performing tasks such as flying or servicing aircraft or helicopters, handling explosives ordnance, operating heavy equipment such as armoured vehicles or trucks, or being responsible for the safe manoeuvre of warships.

         I stress the point that the introduction of this measure does not in any way indicate that the ADF believes that there is an unusual problem with drug usage by ADF members. Because of the nature of service life, I think it is more likely that drug usage in the ADF will be more apparent to service authorities and that the testing proposal will assist service authorities in fulfilling their occupational health and safety duty of care.

         Although the testing program will be random in the selection of individuals, it will place emphasis on important and high risk areas, such as operational units and basic training establishments.

         To ensure that ADF members' careers are not adversely affected by false screen test indications, no disciplinary or administrative action will be taken against a member before a confirmatory laboratory test is carried out and that will be analysed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. This is a definitive test that can be substantiated legally. The US, Canada and New Zealand have all introduced workplace random urinalysis testing in their defence forces. I believe that this proposal will receive a very positive response within both the ADF and the broader Australian community.

         —The government welcomes the draft report on the legal profession of the Trade Practices Commission that was conducted by Professor Fels and was part of the Trade Practices Commission's study of the professions. We believe that the report, which was released this morning, is an important contribution to the debate about how to reform the structure of Australia's legal profession and make it more responsive to the economic needs of the 21st century, but not just to economic needs.

         There is little doubt—it is recognised very widely in this place—that the legal process has become inaccessible and remote for many Australians. We recognise that governments have a responsibility to increase access to justice for all citizens. One way of doing that is to establish procedures which are simple, cheap and fair. In this context, the Trade Practices Commission report is one important source of information to facilitate the changes that are necessary in this profession. This report, together with the report of the Hilmer inquiry and the very eminent Senator Cooney Senate inquiry into the costs of justice, provide cogent arguments about the urgent need for state and territory governments to look at the structure of their legal systems and to identify anti-competitive practices.

         In respect of certain aspects of the report, the government supports the argument of the Trade Practices Commission that restrictive trade practices which cannot be justified in the public interest should be eliminated. That point was also made by the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, in a recent speech. We also believe that the draft report makes a persuasive argument for the need for an integrated national profession, a goal which both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice have been pursuing with some vigour.

         There is also little doubt about the costs of our legal system and the fact that those costs have the potential to impact on our international competitiveness. For instance, the legal profession has an annual turnover in excess of $3 billion and employs some 55,000 people. The current situation, where there are some 17 representative bodies spread over eight jurisdictions, indicates that the profession is over-regulated and in need of reform.

         We also note that regulation of the private legal profession is very much in the hands of the state and territory governments. There has already been significant cooperation between those governments and the federal government in respect of the mutual recognition scheme. We anticipate that we can build on that cooperation to achieve some changes that are highlighted in the Trade Practices Commission report.

         We believe that the approach of the Trade Practices Commission to remove restrictive practices and to increase the scope of the profession by allowing lawyers to advertise and engage in multi-disciplinary practices is something which the government will seriously examine as part of our law reform agenda. We welcome the debate and discussions that the draft report will generate. We welcome constructive input by the profession and the community. We hope that the legal profession embraces the spirit of this draft report as an opportunity to examine its structures and to increase access to justice for all Australians.

         There are 38 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in support roles with UNOSOM in Mogadishu—30 movement controllers and eight headquarters staff.

         Any UN peace operation—whether it is in support of humanitarian objectives, as is the situation here, or otherwise—does need, in order to be fully effective, clear and achievable goals, widespread international support and maximum possible local support, adequate total resources, complementary peace making initiatives—where those are relevant—and clearly designated criteria for termination. It has to be acknowledged that by no means all those conditions have been clearly satisfied at every stage of the Somali operation to date. So far as the future is concerned, the UN is now working to a mandate spelt out in two Security Council resolutions—814 of 26 March, which mandates UNOSOM to disarm the Somali factions to facilitate national reconciliation and rehabilitation, and 865 of 22 September, which strongly endorses UNOSOM's performance to date while, at the same time, urging renewed efforts to achieve national reconciliation and further develop the Somali police, judicial and penal systems.

         What has to happen now is the finalisation and implementation of a comprehensive and internally consistent plan to address the full range of Somalia's needs.

         The security dilemma posed by the recent action of Aideed's supporters is an acute one, and the temptation for the UN, and especially the US forces, to engage now in a massive military action is obviously very strong. I have to say, however, for my own part, that I continue to believe that peace enforcement action in Somalia should remain firmly fixed on the basic objectives of enabling peace keepers to carry out their protective and humanitarian relief mandates, should avoid using disproportionate force and, so far as humanly possible, should avoid becoming involved in an escalating cycle of retaliation.

         Of course we promised to deliver the direct tax cuts and of course we promised to deliver the first element of those in full this financial year. That remains our intention.

We made a very clear commitment to medium term deficit reduction of an order of magnitude that was fully spelt out.

         On the contrary, it was made clear that while there would be no new taxes of an indirect kind and while the overall tax burden would be maintained at roughly its proportion of GDP, nothing more was said on that subject. Nothing more could have been said because obviously we were committed to a course of fiscal responsibility which could be achieved only by the combination of strategies that we have articulated in this particular budget.

The article by Mr Cribb drew attention to the fact that, in his estimation, there had been declining attendances at recent ANZAAS congresses and this was for him a disturbing trend. I think the evidence that he puts in the article is true. Compared with ANZAAS congresses of a decade or more ago when 2,000 delegates turned up to a congress, there has been a decline in attendance at the congress. Some of the suggestions he makes about why this has occurred are thoughtful comments; whether they are correct or not needs wider assessment.

         I would point out that the congress in Perth was still extremely successful and more than 700 delegates attended. Considerable press publicity was given to many of the major papers presented and the discussions that took place. However, it has been recognised that in the past few decades ANZAAS has been a peak forum for the promotion of science in Australia and in New Zealand and for the promotion in awareness terms for the general public; it gives the opportunity to our science community to explain what it is doing and to explain to the Australian community that in many areas of science research we are at the cutting edge of world developments.

         As a result of the ANZAAS congress and my concern, partly raised in the article by Mr Cribb, I have arranged for officers of the science and technology awareness section of my department to have discussions with the organisers of the ANZAAS congress to see whether there are ways in which we can promote future ANZAAS congresses to get the attendance up and, above all else, to make it the fulcrum of science awareness in Australia. Certainly we as a government are committed to the ANZAAS congress as a major forum. At some stage in the future I look forward to being able to report on the results of those discussions between the officials in my department and the organisers of the ANZAAS congress.

         As Mr Willis said at some length and very effectively in the House of Representatives yesterday, in 1982 we had an economy that needed the stimulus of an increased deficit. That was the argument of the day. That was the economic context of the time. That is why we argued then, in 1981, that some of these things were both economically responsible and affordable. That is, no doubt, the context in which Mr Willis was making whatever remarks he was in 1981-82 about the payment for direct tax cuts. As I said earlier this week, context is everything in these situations.

         We have absolutely nothing to apologise for in terms of the way in which the fiscal programs of this government have been put together or the way in which the outlay reductions have been managed throughout the 1980s. Of course there has been a blow-out in the last two or three years. Of course it has been a function of the particular transient economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. The underlying structural condition of the budget is as sound as it has ever been as a result of the efforts that we put into it right throughout the 1980s.

         If those opposite think they can carve into outlays in the way they were blandly and blithely promising they would in the Fightback package, without causing monumental damage to many people in this country, then they simply do not understand the way in which the current budget is structured. They do not understand the degree of room for manoeuvre there is as a result of the extraordinarily tough limits that have been made over a very long period.

It is typical of the misinformation and opportunism we have come to expect from Senator Newman on these matters. The accreditation and quality improvement system was developed through the establishment of an interim national accreditation council. That emerged after some two years of consultation and that has further been refined with the establishment of the national accreditation council. Both councils have included members of all sectors of the child-care industry—public and private, providers and parents. The interim council consulted very extensively throughout Australia in the development of the system. It is absolute nonsense for Senator Newman to suggest that the process has been deceptive in any way.

         As to background, the Rind sisters, Kulsoom and Zeenat, are Pakistani nationals. Their father was born in Australia but moved to Pakistan in 1930 where he married twice and had 13 children, including Kulsoom and Zeenat. The girls' paternal grandmother was a full blood Aboriginal and their paternal grandfather was from Pakistan. These two sisters entered Australia in 1989 and were subsequently given permanent residence. They are now eligible for citizenship by grant, having met the residence requirement. They or their supporters are suggesting that they should be automatically entitled to Australian citizenship by virtue of their Aboriginal descent—of course, their paternal grandparent.

         Senator Chamarette asked some questions arising from this. It might surprise Senator Patterson, but I was not able in the short time that I have had to focus on this question, to find out whether there has been advice from the Attorney-General on the question of citizenship status of persons of Aboriginal descent who were born overseas. Senator Chamarette refers to the effects of the 1976 referendum. Of course, a referendum of itself cannot confer powers on the Commonwealth or confer citizenship; there has to be legislation to implement the result of a referendum.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. In 1983 Susan Ryan re-announced the government's policy of seeking to put 50 per cent representation of women on government boards, authorities and instrumentalities. This week, one decade later, the minister re-announced the same policy. Therefore, my question is twofold: will the minister explain to this parliament why her governments have been so consistently unsuccessful in delivering on that promise that they keep repeating; and, secondly, when can we expect some new and innovative policies in relation to status of women from a Labor government, now that Susan Ryan has left?

It was this government that put the appointment of women to boards on the political agenda; it was this government that put women on the political agenda at all; and it is this government that has introduced the affirmative action legislation, the sex discrimination legislation and the equal opportunity legislation.

         What Senator Vanstone has not told us is that the election to boards, while still short of 50 per cent, is dramatically more than it was 10 years ago. In some areas, the representation of women is now up to 24 or 25 per cent, which is a dramatic increase on the five per cent that was there in 1983. What we have seen is a considerable improvement, but an insufficient improvement. So I cannot see why, when it is quite clearly a commitment of this government to that kind of equal representation, I should not properly restate that continuing aim of government to see fair and 50 per cent representation.

         I hope that Senator Vanstone actually notes the dramatic increase that has occurred in the 10 years since this government has been in office. The fact that representation is not at 50 per cent is a matter of such importance that of course I restate this commitment again. But I note that there has been a very significant increase, improving from the figures that were there when we came into office.

Firstly, she said that Labor first put the appointment of women to boards on the agenda. Does she categorically deny the role of the Fraser government in that area? Secondly, does her government seek to implement that policy in its own appointments to its own ministry? If not, why is what is good for the goose not good for the gander? Thirdly, next time she re-announces this policy, will she have the good grace to admit that she is simply re-announcing a commitment and not pretend that this is some new initiative and push of her own when she is just dangling on the coat tails of Susan Ryan?

        The thrust of the recommendations of this report tabled in the Senate today by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training is that industrial disputes must be settled within the framework of industrial relations legislation and sections 45D&amp;E of the Trade Practices Act should not be invoked to deal with them. The report is a majority report, and contains a dissenting report by Senators Crane and Tierney.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Trade Practices Act has a legitimate and important role in dealing with activity which deliberately sets out to corrupt fair trading operations, to manipulate prices, or to undermine free competition in the market. When it comes to industrial action, however, the use of sections 45D&amp;E are entirely inappropriate. The vast majority of occasions on which 45D&amp;E are either threatened or used involve disputes of an industrial nature—that is, they involve workers undertaking an action to achieve ends which they regard as being in the economic or social interests of themselves or fellow workers, and employers or businesses who are seeking to protect themselves from any economic harm which results from that action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The sorts of actions which have typically drawn 45D-type responses are essentially industrial issues rather than trade or competition issues. This is not to say that there is no overlap between these two arenas, but to point out that such disputes and their resolution lie most appropriately and conveniently with the practice of industrial relations rather than the practice of corporate affairs. The Committee acknowledges that it is secondary boycotts which are the focus of attention here, but sections 45D&amp;E have much wider ramifications. In order to deal with such actions, modifications to industrial relations legislation will be required. There must be an efficient mechanism established which will deal effectively with these matters by negotiation rather than penal action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee has found that sections 45D&amp;E are in breach of ILO conventions and are not a satisfactory means of settling disputes. The Committee asserts that the legitimate rights of businesses to trade in a fair and competitive market should be properly secured by trade practices legislation, but that sections 45D&amp;E are an unacceptable mechanism for achieving this because of their impact on the legitimate rights of others to take industrial, protest or other social action. The Trade Practices Act should be amended to recognise the distinction between the competition and non-competition aspects of sections 45D&amp;E, and to deal with boycotts involving competitors where they have the purpose of restricting trade or reducing competition in a given market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The report affirms the principle of a right to withdraw labour, and that any qualifications attached to that right should be spelled out in industrial relations legislation, and not in trade practices legislation. The Committee has also recommended that industrial disputes should be dealt with in the first instance under modified industrial relations legislation, but where a dispute cannot be speedily resolved by negotiation, then a certificate should be issued enabling the matter to be dealt with in a civil jurisdiction.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The report comes at a time when major industrial reforms are the subject of intense discussion between the government, employers and unions. It is important that Australia takes this opportunity to simplify and rationalise what has become a complex web of statute and common law surrounding how we run industrial relations in this country. The report sets out some clear principles for dealing with dispute resolution. We have identified in an unequivocal way the regulatory frameworks for dealing with industrial and competition matters respectively. It is up to the government and the parliament to ensure that the legislative details attached to those frameworks protect the legitimate interests of all industrial parties and contain mechanisms which can quickly and effectively deal with any problems which arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Sections 45D&amp;E of the Trade Practices Act have been a controversial part of industrial relations in Australia. The submissions to the Committee from business and employer associations have argued strongly for the retention of 45D&amp;E, which they regard as a vital legislative mechanism enabling them to prevent industrial disputation or to obtain damages for losses incurred as a result. The union movement and many others in the community regard 45D&amp;E as a harsh piece of legislation, arguing that it works against the democratic right to take industrial and other social action, and that its provisions are contrary to ILO Conventions. Conservationists are unhappy with 45D&amp;E because it exposes them to the risks of being sued as a consequence of protest action. They believe that peaceful protest action against companies involved in environmentally risky activity is a fundamental right which should not be impeded by legislation such as 45D&amp;E.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee has sought to identify clearly the legislative frameworks in which the competing, legitimate interests of various groups should be dealt with. The mechanisms established within those legislative frameworks must be consistent with the traditions of justice and fair play which our community regards as important. The community must have confidence that regulatory mechanisms will achieve what they are intended to achieve, and that they are both responsive and equitable in their operation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee has heard from a wide range of interest groups. We believe our recommendations establish clear guidelines for revised industrial relations legislation and trade practices legislation. It is imperative that the complexity and confusion which has dominated the operation of sections 45D&amp;E be resolved once and for all by the repeal of these sections of the Trade Practices Act.

         The Hunter Valley is the sixth most popular domestic tourist destination in Australia. The increased cost of wine, combined with the increase in fuel prices and the wholesale sales tax, will make this wine growing area a much less viable tourist destination.

         Small wineries, which in reality are small businesses, will be particularly disadvantaged by the increase in their sales tax bill, which has to be paid for up-front. Sales tax billed in the current month must be remitted to the government by the 21st of the following month. If average credit is 60 days, the increase in sales tax will be a very heavy extra burden on the working capital of these wineries. One Hunter Valley grower said to me last night that under the present tax regime he presently owes $480,000 in sales tax. If the tax increase is to be introduced, that will increase to $750,000; he will owe $0.75 million dollars in sales tax.

         —To indicate where the Greens WA stand on this set of bills, I make the point that the government's budget was framed to set out a four year strategy for reducing the budget deficit to around one per cent of gross domestic product, while delivering the first round of income tax cuts for middle income earners legislated in last year's budget, as well as the reduced company tax rates promised in the lead up to the election. Of course, this led to an unaffordable situation.

         The cut in company tax was put through parliament between the election and the swearing in of the new Senate, in order to be placed at the beginning of the current financial year and avoid any difficulties in getting it through the Senate. Whilst we understand that any action of the Greens WA and other parties in the Senate may affect the government's strategy for deficit reduction, I would like to remind the government that we have made suggestions, the most recent of which was last evening, about alternative revenue collection measures. We have suggested that there are alternatives available.

         Therefore, while we are likely to flag opposition to some aspects of these taxes in an effort to decrease the level of wholesale sales tax and wine tax, I point out that we make these suggestions within the perspective of fiscal responsibility.

         One thing that everyone can be certain of is that the Greens WA will not support a grossly regressive budget. We have always said that we would support an equitable strategy to reduce the government's deficit in the medium term in a way that does not undermine the government's revenue base. The current package of bills fails in these two tests. The combined impact is highly regressive as it takes from the poor and gives to the rich. Furthermore, a shift from income taxes to indirect tax measures is a dead alley in terms of providing the revenue required to govern effectively and promote equity in the future.

         Therefore, we foreshadow our amendments to this set of sales tax (deficit reduction) bills 1993. We intend to support the deferral of the second round of wholesale sales tax increases. This would be more than offset by delaying upper levels of tax cuts. There is no reason for the top one-fifth of wage earners to cream off that extra $1.3 billion in tax cuts. Like all taxpayers earning over $20,000 they, too, would get the basic $612 per annum tax rebate.

         There is a popular myth that lower income earners do not spend enough to be really hurt by an increase in wholesale sales tax. In fact, they spend all their money on consumables. It is those people on higher incomes who have the luxury to save and invest. It reminds me of the wealthy man who believed he could help a poor man. The wealthy man asked, `How much do you spend on groceries?'. The poor man responded, `About a third of my wage'. The wealthy man said, `Ah, that's your problem. You need to manage your money better. I spend only two per cent on mine'.

         Targeting the second increase in wholesale sales tax serves four purposes. It reduces the regressive impact that is the result of the shift from income taxes to indirect taxes, and that is not compensated for by the tax cuts or rebate for low income earners. It confronts the government with the need to find more equitable ways of raising the additional revenue required to provide important public services and reduce public debt as part of its medium term deficit reduction strategy. Not legislating to increase wholesale sales tax by a second one per cent in 1995 simply reinforces the need arising from the lack of funds to deal with Mabo legislation and labour market programs.

         It allows the government adequate time to investigate and implement these revenue measures. It also reduces the inflationary impact of the budget in years to come.

         We also foreshadow our opposition to the sales tax on wine. The good point about the wine industry is that in Western Australia and many other parts of Australia it is locally owned, it has a high number of local employees and provides indirect employment in the hospitality, tourism and service sectors. These are specifically associated with the domestic market rather than the export market. Providing some sort of compensation for those parts of the industry simply for export does not deal with this kind of indirect employment.

         Beer and spirits, on the other hand, are almost completely transnationally owned, high profit and centralised. The profits are repatriated overseas. The industry is currently retrenching employees at a vast rate of knots because it can mechanise and go for chemical production which allows for fewer employees. Much equipment is imported, as well as some materials, including hops.

         It could be said that alcohol is alcohol is alcohol, but that overlooks all the details and the vast differences between these industries. In WA alone there are 500-plus wineries, mostly locally owned. In WA a number of the smaller wineries are working to establish minimum input viticulture. If they were forced by the nature of the industry to cut down costs, some of those wineries would be swallowed up by the larger operators which, generally, are not able to be as careful with their inputs as the smaller wineries can be.

         The net effect of the proposed tax would concentrate the industry and make it go towards a more mechanised form of agriculture, one leaning heavily on pesticides and herbicides. Any fall-off in domestic sales would create pressure for amalgamation by those wineries going for export markets. A well-founded rumour has it that some of the bigger eastern states wineries, the transnational ones, do not in fact mind the tax; it is their chance to increase holdings here and they can mark down profits and pay less company tax.

         Concern over the proposed Industry Commission study is based on the fact that the Industry Commission, in our estimation, has not shown itself capable of giving a wider picture in an industry study. The commission tends to be very narrow in its focus and does not look at the spread effects, negative or positive, of any particular aspect of industry to be studied.

         An example that springs to mind is the Industry Commission's study on the greenhouse effect. Most of the first part of the study said how important it was for Australia to look carefully at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but finally came to the conclusion that it was not possible because it would adversely affect the coal industry. The report ignored totally the number of jobs that could be created by energy efficiency, energy management and energy conservation, and also ignored any prospect of a cost efficient, revenue neutral cutback in greenhouse gas production. It did not look at those matters at all. So I do not have great faith in any government proposals for Industry Commission studies into the wine industry. If the government is serious about promoting regionally based development, it should find out which industries are relatively successful in regional development.

         The government is left with a number of options. First, and best, is that it can accept our suggestions and majority suggestions of other parties in this place and support the budget bills in their amended form. This would result in an increase in revenue in the current and the next financial year and the development of more equitable means of raising revenue in the following years to offset the loss of the second increase in the wholesale sales tax.

         The second, more simple, option would see the government either accepting that the 1995 increase in wholesale sales tax will not go ahead or proposing additional measures to compensate low income households for the impact of the budget package in the 1995-96 and 1996-97 financial years. Should this latter path prove too difficult, we would be happy to leave the second round of wholesale sales tax increases until next year's budget, where they might be discussed as a possible part of a larger package of measures.

If the amended legislation returns from the House of Representatives with the 1995 increase reinserted, we will not support the bills. This would cast grave doubts over the additional tax revenue currently being collected in the expectation of the legislation successfully passing into law.

         These propositions are essentially very simple. They involve three measures: an increase by one per cent of general rates of sales tax, increases in wine tax and changes in the tax regime for luxury cars. While these proposals are modest and involve only small increases in the existing wholesale sales tax rates, they will make a major contribution towards the government's fiscal objectives.

         These measures will have a very small impact on prices. For example, the rise in the rate from 10 per cent rate to 11 per cent will increase the retail price of goods taxable at that rate by less than one per cent, and it will increase the price of a good currently taxable at 30 per cent by less than three-quarters of one per cent. These measures will have no effect on goods which are currently exempt from sales tax such as food and clothing. There has been no decision to extend indirect taxation to services. Passenger motor vehicles will continue to be taxed on a concessional basis. Although the concessional rate of 15 per cent introduced in One Nation will increase to 16 per cent and then 17 per cent in line with other rates, it will still be five percentage points below the general rate of sales taxes.

         When we talk about wine, we should make sure we understand the full implication of what is actually being said. The industry itself states that exports of Australian wine have increased dramatically in recent years from about 40.4 million litres in 1988-89 to 103.2 million litres in 1992-93. This represents an increase of 155 per cent in export sales over that period in volume terms alone. So it is a bit hard to talk about the effect of taxation on exports because we all know that those taxes do not apply to exports.

         In real terms, wine exports have increased by 130 per cent over the period I have just indicated. The value of Australian wine exports in 1992-93 was $289 million. The major markets for Australian wine are the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. If we look at international comparisons we can see that the Australian wine industry is doing extremely well. The wine industry has a very enviable record. There is high recognition of the quality of its produce. It has made excellent inroads into international markets as a result of its quality, not just its price. It has a major level of value adding in this country which has to be recognised.

They say that rather than the yeoman farmer image that those opposite are so keen on—the notion of the peasant farmer, the poor little battler out in the sticks—the fact is that the Australian wine industry is run by four major companies. Ninety per cent of its output is controlled by four major companies.

         I must say that I am not too keen on either wine or beer, so I find the preoccupation with alcohol on the other side quite a strange thing, but if we compare beer and wine we see that wine incurs only about half the federal tax collected on beer. We see that 17.5 per cent of the purchase price of a four-litre wine cask goes in federal tax while 32 per cent of the purchase price of a similar quantity of beer is taken in federal tax. That does not include the state licence fees, which make that gap even greater.

I guess that that is the nature of opposition. But it is a bit hard for the opposition to then turn around and say that it is behaving in an economically responsible manner. It has to get its position clear. Is the opposition seeking out new constituencies—as I believe the Greens are doing—or is it talking about the genuine economic benefit of this country? It is saying that this budget has to be undermined, but what is it saying about where the revenue is actually going to come from to pay for social programs? One does presume that there is some measure of economic responsibility on the other side of the chamber.

         The conservative opposition in this chamber is taking every opportunity to undermine the work of government. It is essentially trying to cut the sinews of government. That is the same strategy that Jeff Kennett undertook in Victoria. It does not surprise me that the same personnel have appeared here. Petro Georgiou is now on the staff of the opposition. It would follow that the same sorts of tactics which were followed in Victoria would be followed here. The only difference is that the federal opposition does not have nationally the same control over the media that was exercised in the run up to the Victorian election by the Liberal Party and the conservatives. Over a two-year period every action of the Victorian Labor government was held up to public ridicule and, of course, public confidence was undermined in the key institutions of society. That same sort of political advantage does not occur at a national level, so the opposition will find the task a lot tougher.

We understand just where the people of this country stand, because they rejected the opposition so completely. I do not suppose one can expect the opposition to understand this, but the Labor government is not about attacking the wine industry; it is about continuing to support it.

         I turn to luxury motor vehicles. Once again, we can see the point: the conservatives have to defend vested interests. Attacking the tax on luxury motor vehicles is a popular cause. The changes in taxation rates would see vehicles costing over $300,000, in some cases, being taxed more heavily than vehicles at a base rate of about $53,000. The concessions to the passenger vehicle industry will continue. However, there will be changes to ensure that the greatest share of taxation is paid on the larger, more expensive vehicles. I find that a very worthwhile proposition and I would find it difficult for anyone to suggest that that should be rejected. However, in voting on the matter today, that could happen. But I am sure that the Greens will be able to explain that in terms of the great social justice principles that are involved.

In fact, it has actually expanded. The Australian wine market—and this has been said before—is worth over $1 billion. It is one of our most successful domestic and export industries.

Wine has really burgeoned at Mudgee, although it has been produced there for a long time. The industry has really increased dramatically in the Hunter, and even out where I am, on the Liverpool plains just north of the Hunter Valley and south-west of Tamworth, wine is now being grown by Murray Tyrrell.

         —Senator Margetts, as economics spokesperson, has already introduced the Greens (WA) assessment of the budget; I will be commenting on the social justice aspects. The government has proposed to achieve its twin objectives of reducing the deficit and cutting income taxes by increasing indirect taxes principally through increases to wholesale sales tax, which are covered by these bills, and excise rates on fuel and tobacco, which will be debated later.

         This is highly regressive because indirect taxes have a far greater impact on low income earners who consume a greater proportion of their income and are less able to respond to price increases. In addition, low income earners are more likely to own cars that require leaded petrol and live in outer suburbs, exacerbating the impact of fuel price increases. The hardest hit group is low income households which pay little or no tax and do not receive social security benefits, as these people will not benefit from the new tax rebate or the indexation of benefits. Therefore, this budget has proven to be very unpopular. The people of Australia feel abandoned by this government.

        This budget is clearly regressive. Independent analysis suggests that low income households will generally suffer the losses. The worst hit group, as I mentioned earlier, is people on low incomes who are not on social security benefits and who have little or no tax liability. These people receive neither the income tax rebate paid in the following financial year nor the lagged CPI indexation of benefits.

         The modifications to the budget, such as dropping the last 3c per litre increase in the excise on leaded petrol, have attempted to lessen the regressive impact of the budget package. However, we remain concerned about the impact of the budget in years to come, in which the government has proposed further increases in wholesale sales tax and fuel excise rates, with no further measures to cushion the impact of these on low income households. We, the Greens, therefore, cannot commit ourselves to supporting the government's purported strategy which places the greatest burden on the poor, gives benefit to those who need it least and, in the final analysis, does not deliver the financial responsibility it trumpets.

         The two senators for the Greens (WA) had planned to introduce four amendments or requests to the budget bills. Firstly—and this one will be considered in the committee stage of this debate—we propose dropping the second increase in wholesale sales tax proposed for July 1995. Secondly, we attempted yesterday to introduce a top-up tax of five per cent on incomes above $100,000 at the same time as the other income tax cuts were introduced—and, once again, it was the Greens and the Democrats against the rest. Thirdly, we would like to support the dropping of the proposed taxation of credit unions. That will be debated later. Fourthly, we supported the dropping of the link between the passage of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) 1993 and the other so-called deficit reduction bills, which was referred to the other place yesterday as an indication of its lack of support.

         We targeted the second increase in wholesale sales tax for four reasons. The first reason was to reduce the regressive impact that is the result of the shift from income taxes to indirect taxes and that is not compensated for by the tax cuts or rebate for low income earners. It confronts the government with the need to find more equitable ways of raising the additional revenue required to provide important public services and reduce public debt as part of its medium term deficit reduction strategy, such as it is.

         Not legislating to increase wholesale sales tax a second one per cent in 1995 simply reinforces the need arising from the lack of funds to deal with the Mabo legislation and the labour market programs. It allows the government adequate time to investigate and implement these revenue measures. It also reduces the inflationary impact of the budget in years to come. This reduces the need to rely on monetary policy and increased interest rates for economic management. Over-reliance on high interest rates hurts consumers and small business and should be avoided.

         Honourable senators will notice that there has been no mention of a wine tax. This is because it did not figure in a major way in our approach to the budget, partly because we knew it was being opposed by the opposition and the Democrats. The wine tax was a complex matter for the Greens. We received varying lobbies. I will again summarise the two aspects that are of concern to us that would have led us to support an increase in wine tax if we had responded to them. Those views deserve consideration, even though I will later tell honourable senators our reasons for not following them. In a letter from Kalamunda in Western Australia we were told:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I don't agree with you on revoking the proposed sales tax on wine. The proposed increase from 20 to 31 per cent is not enough and should at least be doubled because of the long term cost of alcohol usage associated with social problems plus the short term financial cost of $6 billion a year nationally to Australian taxpayers. As a Greens Senator you should also be aware that the wine industry is a type of land developer, acquiring valuable land for the production of wine, especially clay-soil based wetlands which were and I am sure are still filled in for vineyard developments.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will respond to the environmental concerns later. They represent one genuine concern about the wine industry. A second concern—which, I am sure, has also been referred to earlier—is the health impact of alcohol in our society. A letter from the WA branch of the Public Health Association of Australia states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe that alcoholic beverages should be taxed according to their alcoholic content so favouring the substitution of lower alcohol variants for higher alcohol variants.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have to agree with this point. One of the pleasing aspects of opposing the wine tax is that we will also be opposing the increase in the tax on low alcohol wines at the same time. The letter further states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This issue has raised the need for a comprehensive examination of taxation on alcoholic beverages, with a view to reducing overall alcohol related harm. Until such an examination can take place we believe that the current, highly favoured tax position enjoyed by wine producers would justify support of the proposed increased sales tax on wine.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is another aspect of this quite complex debate. It was because of that complexity that, when we initially challenged this budget, we wanted to defer the wine sales tax pending an inquiry, with a result coming down in one year's time. We did this because of the impact of the proposed increase and the importance of the wine industry in terms of local employment and tourism. We wanted consideration of any increase deferred at least a year to enable a full inquiry and to allow opportunity for those people who expressed the concerns that I mentioned earlier on environmental, health grounds and social behaviour costs to be heard and responded to appropriately.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I said, we proposed an inquiry but because that has not been raised as an amendment to this bill we are planning to support a request for an amendment opposing the increase in wine tax that will be raised later in this place. Our reasons are as follows. We did not believe the government's claim that an increase in tax would actually help the industry to expand overseas, and we certainly knew that it would not help it locally. The claim was based on anecdotal evidence of what happened after the last increase in tax on wine from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, and I think the argument is tenuous.

         We believe that the wine industry is significantly different from the rest of the alcoholic beverage industry, firstly, because it is largely Australian owned. There is some multinational and foreign ownership in the industry but this is significantly lower than in the beer industry, which is largely foreign owned, and the spirit industry, which is almost entirely import oriented. Secondly, it is regionally based, it is rurally based and provides significant employment and industry in the towns that service the wine growing areas. Thirdly, it is relatively labour intensive—people friendly, in fact. The industry provides high levels of employment on a seasonal basis and cannot become as automated as other sectors of agricultural industry, such as wheat farming. Fourthly, it has higher levels of stock holdings. The industry maintains stocks of wine for around 17 months, whereas the beer industry has a turnaround time of 43 days. This has a significant impact on the cash flow and capital investment required.

         While we have some significant concerns about environmental problems in the industry, such as the use of herbicides and pesticides, these are not uncommon in any agricultural based industry and an increasing number of wine makers are modifying their practices to make them more environmentally sustainable. The wine industry is far more sustainable in terms of its use of land and the effects on the soil than most other agricultural pursuits. It is a high value added use of an agricultural product which draws in a wide variety of other industries to support it. The multiplier effect of the wine industry is possibly more significant to many regions of this country than any other.

         We are concerned about the public health aspects of increasing levels of consumption of wine, particularly by teenage girls, but we are concerned that an increase in revenue is not necessarily an ethical way of addressing that; neither is it effective in this case. The government needs to do more to stop this. However, a percentage increase in wine has less overall effect on the price of cheap wine bought in casks—that being the wine consumed by teenage girls—than higher priced wine. Therefore, a percentage increase in the price of wine is less of a deterrent to teenage drinkers than to other consumers. We need to avoid the double standard of condemning the detrimental effects of alcohol in our community, and then taxing it and gaining revenue from something we have condemned, without actually putting into place genuine preventive, educative and treatment oriented approaches to the problem.

We have been criticised for not making commitments to pass the budget—lock, stock and barrel—long before the bills were on the table and able to be examined in detail. We agree that certainty is important, although it is by no means the only thing which is important. The one thing that everyone can be certain of is that we will not be supporting a grossly regressive budget—ever. A fax we received from Victoria pointed out some of the underlying concepts of the Senate that are being picked up by ordinary people in the community. It states:

         Many small wine producers in Western Australia will suffer disastrous effects should this increase come into effect. The industry in Western Australia is a fledgling industry and, as Senator Margetts pointed out, it is largely locally owned.

         The case was put to me by the small winegrowers of Western Australia that 15 to 20 per cent of their produce is exported and that the remainder is consumed by the domestic market. We cannot export unless we have shored up ourselves at home and unless we have increased our domestic production; then we can go offshore. That is the problem that these small winegrowers will face. In order for the industry to become a large exporter, it firstly has to consolidate at home. At present, the annual production of wine in Western Australia is worth some $60 million a year. I urge the Senate to oppose this increase in the tax on wine so that that industry can be left alone to develop and, in the future, to bring home to Australia hundreds of millions of dollars of export earnings.

         I also advise the Senate that, since this measure was talked about on 17 August this year, there has been some feedback. Mr Tomlinson, whom I mentioned previously, has advised that sales in the Margaret River area alone are already down by 20 to 25 per cent. Winegrowers are discovering that restaurateurs are not buying wine; they are holding on to present stocks and they want to see what exactly will happen with this increase in the tax on wine.

         Market research in Western Australia has shown that there are two psychological barriers in price: one is $10 and one is $15. The majority of the market tends to buy bottled wine under the value of $10. This increase in tax will push those prices up so that a bottle of wine, which was previously under the value of $10, would then go over that psychological barrier and a share of the market will be lost. The small wine producers do not have the economy of scale that the larger ones have and they have overheads which could force them into the higher brackets of the market price and thereby cause them loss in the market share. The flow-on from that is obvious: a loss of jobs, as I have mentioned, and a loss of support to tourism in the areas which I have mentioned.

         The increase in the tax on wine will be disastrous for Western Australian winegrowers. They cannot be compared with multinational brewers or distillers. They are only small businessmen who are trying to make a go of things and who are in the process of bringing some great benefits not only to their state but also the country at large. There is absolutely no comparison between the money that we will get by increasing the tax on wine and the benefit. By increasing the tax on wine we will be kicking an industry whilst it is still growing, and that is just untenable.

The Sales Tax Assessment Amendment (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 aims to provide for a reduction in the taxable value of luxury vehicles by a proportion of the motor vehicle depreciation limit.

The part of the price of the vehicle that exceeds the depreciation limit will be taxed at the new rate of 45 per cent, with no change in 1995.

         I will mention two vineyards in Victoria of which I have had particular experience, namely, the Drumborg vineyard near Heywood, which employs between 70 and 80 pickers, mainly female, during the season, and the Crawford River vineyard, located slightly to the north of that in Condah, which employs between 20 and 30 pickers, also mainly women. This scenario is repeated across rural Victoria and Australia, especially in the areas of the Pyrenees and the Yarra Valley. Most smaller wineries tend to be labour intensive—that is, they use less machinery—and any fall in volume from this type of vineyard will have a disproportionately high effect on employment. The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies has estimated that the effect of the sales tax will be a 3.6 per cent decline in sales in the short term for smaller wineries and up to 11.8 per cent in the long term. Such a decline may make their operations unsustainable and therefore they will all lose their jobs.

The machinery and equipment suppliers of bore and irrigation equipment are already suffering from the rural recession. They do not need another body blow like this.

It is very important that in the context of considering economic measures such as these we consider the economic implications not only of acting in a certain way but also of failing to act.

        What that is essentially saying is that it is all very well to take a nitpicking little sectional responsibility and say, `There are a few people in this suburb, a few people who live near that town, who might vote for me if I oppose this tax bill'. Tax bills are always unpopular. There has never been a popular tax increase. Everybody thinks the government needs to fund services, but nobody welcomes the fact that the taxes on them will be increased. That is hardly surprising.

         Nevertheless, what the IMF is saying is that if we take that nitpicking industry-by-industry, town-by-town, vote-by-vote, opinion-poll-driven approach, we will in the long term significantly adversely affect the people whom, as the rhetoric would have it, we are seeking to assist. We are talking about the pressure on interest rates, which is much worse for any of the industries than a very small increase in sales tax. We are talking about the reduced capacity for job creation which is much more fundamental in the overall economic situation. The overall job possibility for the unemployed, those coming into the labour market and those seeking to re-enter the labour market is much more fundamental than the impact of any particular regional or industry measure. It has significant long-term effects in lowering the rate of growth in output.

        That describes exactly the situation in which Australia finds itself. Even though, as we recover all too slowly from the recession, we need to increase the deficit this year to provide more stimulus, to generate more jobs, at the same time we need to announce that over the medium term we will be reducing the deficit so that the long-term job potential is generated, the potential for growth is maximised and the long-term advantage of Australia is enhanced.

         It is all very well to make populist appeals to an industry in a particular state or electorate. It is all very well to make simple populist appeals against any tax increase. That is exactly what led the United States into the budget gridlock it now has. There was an interesting sentence in an

          Economist

         editorial recently. It said that the hardest thing for anybody in government to do was to be tough on taxes, particularly to raise taxes to cut the budget deficit. That is the test of one's mettle. That is the test of whether one has what it takes to be a responsible government.

         Do we recognise that it is necessary to do something because it is right, even if it is unpopular? The Senate is being put to the test with regard to that matter right now. That is probably why Malcolm Fraser, of all people, said:

        That is the context in which we are dealing with this matter. I also want to deal with some questions about the equity of the tax changes. Some rhetoric that was very familiar to me came from those saying that these are not equitable measures, because that is what we were saying in the last election about the GST. They failed to appreciate the difference between the GST and the wholesale sales tax.

         It was said correctly that all the evidence is, as logic obviously would argue, that lower income groups spend a higher proportion of their income and save less than upper income groups. That is why a GST is unfair because everything is taxed. Therefore, those who consume a higher proportion of their income pay tax on a higher proportion of their income.

         In terms of the wholesale sales tax, that is very deliberately, as a matter of conscious policy, not so. The necessities of life are not subject to the wholesale sales tax. Broadly described, food and clothing are not subject to the wholesale sales tax; nor are things like electricity, water and those other basic necessities which make up a disproportionate part of the expenditure pattern of lower income groups. Senator Margetts' little anecdote was absolutely right when she spoke about the percentage of income that is spent on groceries, which is a correct description of the different pressure that is put on budgets by spending on the necessities. The difficulty for her is that those things are not subject to the wholesale sales tax, even though they would have been subject to the GST.

         One of the ironies is that in the name of equity it is proposed to oppose a tax increase on swimming pools. It is very hard to argue in the interests of equity that the tax on swimming pools should not go up. One can see the poor and underprivileged in tears about the increase in tax on swimming pools, but that is what is being argued in the name of equity. What a farce!

         It is equally farcical to argue the case about wine. Quintessentially, wine should be subject to indirect tax because upper income people spend more of their income on it than lower income people, and they buy more expensive items than lower income people. There is a much higher level of tax paid by upper income people than lower income people, but in the interests of equity some people are proposing to oppose this increase.

         It is true that the wine industry is important and the government is engaged in discussions with the industry about industry assistance.

         The other thing that needs to be assessed in looking at the equity of the tax changes is the context of the government's record. Over the past 10 years the priority has been to assist lower income individuals and families. This has been achieved by the way the tax cuts have been targeted, by the way the welfare measures have been introduced and targeted and now by the introduction and—by agreement with the Democrats—the increase in the tax rebate for low income people. But on this occasion, after 10 years of focusing those measures on lower income people—properly so—this time the bulk of the personal tax cuts are quite deliberately targeted at middle Australia who have not benefited as much from the previous tax cuts. In my view, so they should be.

         What we are faced with here is the circumstance in which honourable senators are being tested. Senators are elected to discharge national responsibilities; that is, to look beyond the short term interest and beyond the popular to what is right and appropriate in the national interest. Everybody in this chamber knows that the deficit reduction strategy is in the national interest. Some people know it and will vote against it, but the responsible people know it and will vote for it.

        We have had a very long and full second reading debate on these issues. We also had a full debate which was relevant to these bills in the context of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) yesterday. I do not propose to reiterate the remarks that we have made other than to say that, so far as the government's proposal to put a massive 55 per cent increase onto the sales tax on wine is concerned, I think there are few people in Australia, other than those in the government, who believe that that will not do great damage to an industry which, to use Senator Kernot's words, is on the cusp of a major development, particularly so far as exports are concerned.

         Putting this tax on wine, although it does not apply to exports, will have an enormous impact on the domestic side of the industry in terms of production and sale and consumption. That, in turn, will have a major, debilitating, very damaging effect not only on the domestic side of the industry but, just as importantly—more importantly in some respects, if one looks at our national needs in terms of exports and our balance of payments crisis with foreign debt exceeding $200,000 million—on the international side. Taking it all together, it is an impost of enormous impact which would be very devastating and very damaging to the industry. There is no way that we as a parliament should be prepared to allow through a measure which we know is going to be so devastating. It is for those reasons that I move those amendments.

What we are talking about with the totality of these bills is something approaching one and a half per cent of the government's total revenue collections for this financial year. Sure, it builds in the future, but there is every scope and every opportunity for the government to so rearrange the rest of the huge totality of its fiscal policies, both on the expenditure and on the revenue side, as to be able to cater for that very simply.

         I can cite no better authority as to the non-vitalness, if you like, of these bills than the current Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans. In 1981, with the parties on opposite sides of the chamber, he participated in a similar debate when the then Fraser Government was attempting to pass sales tax bills. At that time, Senator Evans made it absolutely clear, in a very good second reading speech, that there is no moral, conventional or other requirement or expectation on oppositions not to oppose bills of this nature. They are non-survival bills, to use Senator Evans's words at that time. There is no reason at all why, if they are bad bills, bad law, bad policy, the Senate should not oppose them. These bills are bad law; they are bad policy; and they are very damaging. For that reason, we have no hesitation at all in requesting these amendments.

        by Senator Short, they are identical to th requests we had circulated yesterday. The Democrats will be supporting them because we believe, firstly, that the question of whether or not there will be damage to the wine industry has been proven beyond doubt: there will be damage. The only thing left to debate is the extent of that damage. Even some of the government speakers have acknowledged that there will indeed be damage to the wine industry.

         However, when we come to budget strategy, we do not believe there will be any major impact on the major thrust of this budget strategy or, indeed, on the total amount of revenue collected. It is very interesting to note that the government, in its continuing negotiations with the wine industry over the last few days—indeed, over the last couple of weeks—has basically acknowledged that it is prepared, in the short term, to live with no additional income from the wine industry. Therefore, the Democrats do not have any problem, as far as the deficit reduction strategy goes, in opposing this measure.

Senator Foreman said that those on this side of the chamber spoke only on the wine tax. That is totally incorrect; I can guarantee that at least 90 per cent of my short delivery of 10- to 12-odd minutes related to the approximately $915 million—nearly $1 billion—of other sales tax that will result in the next full financial year. The wine tax accounts for only about $85 million in a full year. So let me put that to rest. Those on the other side of the chamber seem to have a bit of trouble with mathematics. Again, it might have been Senator Foreman who insisted that it was a rise of only 11 per cent.

I also ask the minister whether the government is prepared to institute a process to develop an industry plan for the wine industry in the months following this parliamentary session.

I do so because I believe that, in the long term, this action will jeopardise the wine industry. I say that because, unlike beer and spirits, wine and cider are not subject to excise. If we adopt this motion and it is rejected by the House of Representatives, the government has indicated that the excise exemption currently applying to the wine industry will be looked at. In fact, if I understood his statement correctly, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is considering looking at ways and means of applying the excise to the wine industry.

         There is about $14 excise per litre of alcohol on beer, and regular beer contains about five per cent of alcohol and light beer, say, 2.5 per cent. There is about twice the excise on a can of full strength beer as there is on a can of light beer. I had hoped this would be discussed at the committee stage, because I wanted to make the point that what the government is doing here has a number of problems.

         Let me come back to the first point. I believe that adopting Senator Short's proposal does not enable the committee to get into the meat of the proposition put forward by the government. If we did get into the meat of the proposition I believe we would see that it  increases the percentage of tax on low alcohol wines to a greater extent than it increases the tax on full strength wine. That is not a good thing. As the explanatory memorandum says, the government is increasing from 20 per cent to 31 per cent the tax on wines that do not have a low alcohol content, but for those that do it is increasing the tax from 10 to 21 per cent. I do not have my calculator handy, but anybody would realise that that is a greater increase on sales tax on low alcohol wines than it is on full strength wines.

         —Yes. To me this is a problem, at all events, and perhaps at some stage the government should have a good look at that. There are other aspects of this measure that we could have discussed in the committee stage—for example, the propositions that have been put up about door sales not being subject to the increase in tax, and perhaps having a volume threshold for a particular producer below which this increase would not apply. All of those things will not now be able to be subject to propositions put forward in the committee stage because there is not much point in doing so.

         The opposition has indicated that it will press ahead with its requests to the House of Representatives that there be no increase at all in sales taxes on wines. It appears that will be agreed to by the Democrats and the Greens, so there really is not much point in pursuing this. But I do ask the government to consider that in the event the whole issue is considered in the House of Representatives again, not necessarily on this occasion but on some future occasion.

         I reiterate my concern that the measures that are being proposed by the opposition will, in the long term, have the effect of exposing the industry to excise action or some other action that a government in the future will impose upon the industry to redress what does appear, on the face of it, clearly to be an unfair advantage to the wine industry over, for example, the beer industry.

The bottom line is that the consumer of beer, which is generally of much lesser alcohol strength than wine, is paying something like double the taxation that a wine drinker is paying. I think that is unfair. I suppose future governments will think that is unfair too.

         I think Senator Short finally made clear what the essential underlying political rationale of the opposition strategy is. It has always been clear to those of us who have been observing it closely but not publicly. He said that the measures overall—and he was not talking just about the wine tax; he was talking about these amendments overall—over the three years will cost us about $4 billion.

         The point that is now apparent publicly, which has always been apparent to me, is that the opposition's real concern is that if these revenue measures pass and the government's medium term deficit reduction strategy is put in place as a result of this legislation, we will not have to bring in the sorts of punitive taxes in the budgets close to the election that the opposition would like to see us bring in, so that it can score political points about it closer to the election. That is a gloriously irresponsible matter.

         Senator Spindler raised some questions about a plan—an inquiry. I did not respond then because it seemed to be more of a speech to which I might respond now. The government has made its position clear: if the industry is prepared to talk to us, we are happy to talk to it. At the moment it is pursuing what I think is a very short-sighted policy that is against its own interests. I happen to share Senator Harradine's assessment—not every dot and comma of the things he said, but the broad assessment—that this is not a measure that is in the long-term interests of the wine industry. I think some people are pursuing it for whatever reasons. I am sure that they believe they are doing the right thing; I think they are not.

         What Senator Harradine did make clear was that we are not here talking about an equity measure at all. The equity is quite clearly in favour of this motion; the redistribution of income is quite clearly in favour of this measure. It is a tax measure that will tax the wealthy much more than lower income earners. But the people who come in here spouting equity will oppose it for reasons to do with the local politics of South Australia and Western Australia. That is fair enough, but I just wish we would not pretend that we are being pious when we are being opportunist. That is all.

        A couple of these amendments are very minor, being consequential upon others in terms of changing the numbering and so on. Collectively, they seek to remove the first of the two one per cent increases in sales tax that are contained in the bill. I will not speak at any length on these amendments, other than to say that this increase in sales tax, this first tranche, means a 10 per cent increase in sales tax on a very wide range of goods for which the existing rate of sales tax is 10 per cent, for example, and a lesser percentage increase for those goods where the sales tax rate is higher. It is a hefty hike in sales tax on a very wide range of goods, despite the fact that the government told the electorate throughout the election campaign—including in the election policy speech—and in the months leading up to the campaign that it would not increase taxes.

         The government can try to argue with that and Senator McMullan can try to argue the contrary until he is blue in the face, but the debates we have had in the parliament and elsewhere for weeks have made it absolutely clear that the government has no mandate at all to increase broadly based taxes of this nature—indeed, any taxes. For that reason alone, this measure deserves to be defeated. But there are other reasons why it deserves to be defeated. The paramount reason is that these sales tax increases are harsh, regressive and unfair, and they hurt low income earners in particular.

         The government will argue that it is giving tax reductions which compensate for these indirect tax increases. But when we do the arithmetic, it works out at nothing like a fair compensation. It is only a partial and inadequate compensation. For all those people who earn less than $20,700 a year—that comprises 60 per cent of the total female work force in this country and about 40 per cent of the total work force—the only compensation they will get for the very significant flow-through in price increases that will occur as a result of this increase in sales tax is a measly $2.88 a week. It will go nowhere near compensating for the price increases that are being forced on the electorate in the budget's proposals. Not only is the increase only $2.88 a week but, worse still, because it is a rebate they will not get it until they put in a tax return after the end of this financial year. It will be June or July or, in some cases, closer to Christmas next year before they get this measly, partial and inadequate compensation for a whole range of price increases that will occur as a result of the sales tax increases from now on.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and other government ministers have been talking about goodies for Christmas in the sense of the income tax cut. By the way, that cut has now been put in jeopardy by the government's obduracy in the last few days. Even if some taxpayers get that tax cut before Christmas, a vast majority of low income earners will not get it for a minimum of eight or nine months, many of them closer to 12 months. They will have gone through all the price increases in the meantime. That will hit very hard.

The wholesale sales taxes are currently being collected, as are other items in the government's proposed budget. The Greens will not be supporting this request for amendments, simply because in the medium term that would make it difficult for this government to keep to any reasonable deficit reduction strategy. Because we are cognisant of that desire and have obviously made requests on other aspects of the budget, we believe that in this instance we can live with this tranche. But we will, as we have foreshadowed, oppose the second tranche, which gives the government time to find alternative sources of revenue.

The opposition proposed a GST, and because it could not have that it is now saying that the government does not have a right to propose its own agenda. I do not agree with that agenda either, but I do agree that the government was elected, however slimly, and this is the economic direction it has taken. We have had some influence on that, although nowhere near enough. We wish we could have more. When we come to speak about the second round of tax cuts I would like to say more about the cumulative effect of rejecting a whole range of government revenue-raising proposals.

         —I wish to add to my colleague's comments. We are not supporting these amendments. We have already spoken about the regressive impact of the wholesale sales taxes. Despite our disagreement with them, we feel that it would be regarded, with some justification, as fiscally irresponsible if we were to support these amendments. However, let that serve as a warning that, unless the government heeds the requests of the Senate, any further delay in the passage of these bills will be fiscally irresponsible; that is, if the passage is delayed and it creates a hole in the deficit right now. Whereas the cutting of the second round of wholesale sales taxes will have no impact this or next financial year, the passage of these amendments or any delay by the government in the passage of the bills because it holds up the request of the Senate will also jeopardise the legal ability, or even the moral legitimacy, of the government to collect the money that it has been collecting since 18 August.

I am talking about the first tranche that we are considering here. If we were fair dinkum about it and we stuck to our guns, then the government would not have the money to continue to exercise its rights as an elected government. This would create a great problem for members of this chamber and the government. That does not worry me a great deal, but I believe that we have to look at our responsibility in respect of tax measures such as these. I do not agree with them. I do not like them for the very same reason advanced by Senator Short: they are regressive, particularly on single income families. I have made that point, both in this chamber and outside the chamber.

         I feel hopeful that the government, when considering its approach to the whole taxation area, will have a look at what I think we all agree is very important. The taxation system should in some way recognise that income is spread and shared amongst the family group which depends on that particular income. In respect of the first tranche, there is a real argument, frankly, against allowing this measure to go through. That is the reason I am voting reluctantly against the requests proposed by Senator Short.

        The remaining requests for amendments that I have moved relate to the government's proposal in the three bills we are debating to impose a second tranche of sales tax increases of one per cent from 1 July 1995. Amendments 1, 2 and 9 of my nine circulated amendments relate to this. Most of what I want to say in relation to this has already been said.

         As far as the first tranche is concerned, I repeat that the government has no mandate for this increase. These taxes are unfair, harsh and regressive. They particularly hurt low income earners and low single income families with children. There is totally inadequate compensation for any of this in the government's budget proposals as a whole. Indeed, the impact will be very significant on a range of people, particularly low income families, as we approach this Christmas. The clauses we have just passed will have an impact this Christmas.

         As a result of what the Senate has now done, there will be an increase in the cost of children's toys and games, flavoured milk, soft drinks and baby foods, which for many people are necessities. We have passed an increase in sales tax for such items through the committee's failure to adopt the opposition's requests for amendment. I urge the committee very strongly to look at this second stage of sales tax increase that has been proposed by the government. It is proposed that from 1 July 1995 the sales tax be increased again by a like amount to the increase coming in this year.

         Senator McMullan said in relation to the last group of amendments for the first tranche that the sales tax increase for this financial year is central to the funding of the 1993 budget. There is no way in the world he can say that the second tranche being proposed to apply in 1995-96 is essential in any way, shape or form in that context. I know that this is a government of enormous incompetence, but I would have thought that even it, in the intervening period between now and 1995-96, would have been able to so adjust its fiscal policy and budgetary strategies as to be able to more than encompass the potential loss in revenue two or three years down the track which acceptance of the opposition's amendments on this occasion would incur. Therefore, there is no way in which the government can say that this second unfair, harsh, regressive, uncompensated, very damaging further tax hike for low income earners and families can be justified or required in a fiscal sense in any way.

We have heard that the government is beginning to realise that it is necessary in the medium term to frame budgets in a different way—to be more consultative and to involve more people in the way that budgets are framed—while still being fiscally responsible and meeting the needs of the community. This is a welcome move. There is no need to think that will necessarily throw fiscal policies out the window. I believe this is one thing that time will prove.

It has collapsed essentially because, as many have said, the government lied its way into office. It is not the only issue, but it is important that we make an attempt to keep the government honest. One of the Democrats' great principles in ancient days, under former Senator Chipp, was that governments should be kept to their commitments and promises. I do not say that this is the only consideration, but it is an important consideration. There is no question that the government has comprehensively broken the commitments that it made to the Australian people.

         —I rise to speak very briefly in support of these requests. The government provided some buffers to the introduction of the first round of wholesale sales tax, some of which were attributed to the involvement of the Australian Democrats. I refer, for example, to the $50 increase in the rebate, the lowering of the fuel excise and the dropping of the proposed change to optometry benefits available under Medicare. On that basis why, therefore, is it legitimate to support an increase in wholesale sales tax in July 1995, in 18 months time, without also legislating in advance for social equal compensation measures? That is the point I would like to put to Senator Kernot.

         Senator Kernot says that we cannot have it both ways. Neither can she; nor the government. The Democrats and the government have shown that they are prepared to legislate in advance. As has already been detailed, they are prepared to show compassion for the regressive impact that this first round of measures will have. Why, then, are they not prepared to make available ahead of time measures that will compensate for the second round when it hits the community and those in the community least able to afford it.

I have heard other figures which state that 67 per cent want the government to change its budget in recognition of the regressive impact of its plan. The point is: it is not the number of people who want the budget passed; it is who is asking and why. I maintain that these requests, if supported, are signals to the government that, in the eyes of the community, these budget measures do not represent equity or compassion. I therefore will be supporting the requests.

One can understand the need for any institution, whether it be a home, a business or a government, to engage in deficit reduction. It is a commendable task. But what the parliament—and, indeed, the government—always needs to be aware of is whether the burdens of that effort fall fairly throughout the community; that is, whether they are shared properly. I have already mentioned that burdens are falling—unfairly, I believe—on the shoulders of the one-income family. I also believe that they are being shared unfairly by the unemployed.

There needs to be a combined approach to see that that does not occur and that the unemployment situation improves.

The two very obvious examples were the local capital works program, which was a pork barrel operation leading up to the last election, and, in Canberra, the construction of the new headquarters for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, colourfully known as `Gareth's gazebo'. These sorts of expenditures do not help people living in the outer suburbs of suburban Australia who do not have good access to education, quality health care and income support where they really need it. Those examples help to illustrate the fact that there are expenditures of the Commonwealth, the states and local governments which can be reduced and then redirected to properly help those most in need in this society.

         —I do not want to unduly delay the conclusion of this debate. There are a couple of things I want to say briefly in response to Senator McMullan's remarks because, like Senator Campbell, I cannot, in honesty, in conscience, let them go uncommented on. Senator Campbell has covered the first point that I would have made relating to government expenditure. I will not go into that any further—Senator Campbell made the point very well—other than to say that Senator McMullan is totally wrong in his assertion that the Opposition's policy position is based essentially on slashing outlays. That is simply not true, and the evidence shows that quite clearly.

         The second point I make—which relates a little to the first—centres on what Senator McMullan said about deficit reduction strategies. We all agree with the need to reduce the deficit. He omitted to point out that, over the last three years, including this financial year, the accumulated deficit resulting from the deliberate policies that this government has pursued is $40,000 million. In three years, this government has cranked up this debt; it has put the nation's savings into hock; it has put its sticky fingers into the nation's cookie jar to the tune of $40 billion. For Senator McMullan to come in here now and cry crocodile tears over deficit reduction strategies and the like is hypocritical in the extreme.

         Senator Harradine very rightly made the point that we need in our policies, in our approach to government, to ensure that burdens fall fairly throughout the community. Senator Harradine is absolutely correct. We in the opposition are so critical of the policies and performance of this government over the past few years precisely because the government has not allowed the burdens to fall fairly on the community.

         The government's approach does not produce equity. So as to not prolong the debate, I ask rhetorically: where is the equity when the government adopts measures which so hurt low income earners and families, as this government has done? Where is the equity when the government pursues policies that have the result of putting one million Australians out of work, with another one million Australians unable to find full-time work or who have dropped out of the work force altogether—the underclass which Senator Harradine was referring to? What we are all about is trying to remove from our society those evils that produce the dreadful inequities and distortions.

         To suggest that the government is going to help any of those things by jacking up sales tax in the way that it is proposing is an absolute nonsense so far as the individuals that it hurts are concerned, so far as the investment that it talks about trying to encourage is concerned, and so far as the jobs that it talks about trying to create are concerned. On all those counts, the government has failed. I reject totally the government's suggestion that it will now have its strategy for a better Australia put at risk by the acceptance of the opposition's requests for amendment. It is a nonsense.

         —This bill is here as a separate bill because of the way the government imposes sales tax on in-ground pools as a result of the loss by the Australian Taxation Office last year in the High Court in the so-called Mutual Pools case. Without going into the technicalities of it, I would point out that to impose sales tax on in-ground pools the government had to have a separate act.

         What the government is proposing in this bill is a two stage increase in sales tax—one per cent as from the night of the budget and one per cent as from 1 July 1995—which is identical to the way that it was proposing to apply the sales tax increases contained in the bills that we have just dealt with. As I say, it is just due to a technicality, in effect, resulting from that High Court decision last year, that in-ground pools were not included in the preceding three bills. For that reason, I have circulated requests for amendments to this bill. As I say, they have exactly the same effect as the amendments that we have just been discussing so far as sales tax is concerned.

         Of the eight amendments circulated in my name, amendments 5 and 7 relate to the first sales tax tranche increase; amendments 6 and 8 relate to the second tranche increase; and amendments 1 to 4 relate to both. If the Senate is to be consistent with the way it has voted in terms of the last three bills in its approach to the sales tax increases, one would expect the Senate to vote the same way in relation to this bill as it did then. To take the amendments in sections, I seek leave to move amendments 5 and 7 together.

         —I feel that it might be useful if I came into this debate a little earlier than on previous occasions. Senator Short's description of the legal history of why we have this bill is accurate. I will not waste time on that, but one of the advantages of it, although it was an unfortunate decision at the time from the government's point of view, is that it exposes the weakness in the argument that increasing indirect tax is necessarily inequitable.

         Here we have, starkly for everybody to see, people purporting to be arguing in favour of the interests of the poor and the unemployed—`We do not want to put up tax on swimming pools'. Although I understand the origin of this argument, it just exposes the fact that those opposite need analysis which is a little more sophisticated than, `Putting up wholesale sales tax is inequitable'. One of the good things about the wholesale sales tax that distinguishes it from the goods and services tax is its capacity to distinguish—and here is a classic example. It is an interesting equity argument to say that there is something inequitable about putting up tax on swimming pools.

I believe that for people in Perth to put in a swimming-pool is a luxury when that city has the beaches that it enjoys. But in regard to houses in the country that are 500 and 600 kilometres from the nearest beach and 200, 300 or 400 kilometres from the nearest public swimming-pool, I do not believe it is a luxury to put in a swimming-pool. I reckon it is hypocritical of this hypocritical sort of minister to be saying that, in places like remote areas of Australia, a swimming-pool is a luxury. Since he says these things surrounded by the manicured lawns of Canberra, it shows just how hypocritical he is.

We are not talking about undermining the deficit reduction strategy with this one. I think it is a proper thing to do, but I do not want to pretend that it will blow the deficit out if we do not do it.

        I have moved this second set of requests for amendment on behalf of the opposition. They relate to the second tranche, the further one per cent increase due on 1 July 1995—a tranche which we now well know the Senate has rejected in terms of the other three bills. I repeat the point I made earlier: if there had not been the High Court decision last year which produced a technicality in terms of the requirement for a separate act for the taxing of in situ pools, we would not be having this debate because we would have already acted on it as part of the preceding amendment.

         The only point I want to make in addition to those I have already made is that, given the way the Senate has decided on the first three bills that have we discussed, if the Senate does not reject this second tranche, we will have the situation where, come 1 July 1995, excluding a zero rate, we will move from a rate scale for the wholesale sales tax of five per cent to a rate scale of nine per cent—in fact, 10 per cent if we count zero. On 1 July 1995, if this second tranche is not rejected, we will have zero, 11 per cent, 12 per cent, 16 per cent, 17 per cent, 21 per cent, 22 per cent, 31 per cent, 32 per cent and 45 per cent. No rate structure could be more ridiculous, more complicated and unnecessary, in my mind.

         On the basis of the principle that was adopted in the voting on the first two bills, for consistency and to avoid this nine per cent or 10 per cent rate scale, I urge the Senate to vote on this tranche the same way as it voted for the second tranche in relation to the other three bills—namely, to reject it.

        As I understood it, the Australian Democrats were prepared to support us in relation to the first bill, but not the second bill. The second bill was the test bill and the Democrats' argument was that, even though there was a question about the constitutionality, the government is entitled to that process. However, Senator Spindler's amendment to my amendment to withdraw the test bill was to be supported by the government but, due to some communication difficulty on the other side, the government voted the wrong way. As a result of that, Senator Spindler lost and he was then faced with the prospect of having to support our motion in full, which included the part that he did not like; therefore, he had to vote against it.

         The opposition will be supporting this bill because we are, and have been for many years, committed to privatisation as a way of, firstly, encouraging more people to be owners of shares in Australia and to participate in the economy in that way and, secondly, getting governments out of businesses that they do not need to be involved in and ensuring that government concentrates on its core business, which is to provide a broad economic framework and support to those in need. This bill will also ensure that the government is not tied up in business enterprises that it is not really best qualified to be involved in.

         The Commonwealth government has sold 30 per cent of the equity in the Commonwealth Bank so far.

         The opposition takes the position that, if the Commonwealth is serious about privatisation to achieve micro-economic goals, it should be moving to the sale of the full remaining 70 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. That is our policy; it is the policy that we took to the last election. We predict that the Commonwealth government will move to a full sale of the Commonwealth Bank because of fiscal pressure and the diminishing opposition to privatisation within the government's own ranks, particularly the left wing, which has opposed privatisation for many years.

         In Sydney, on 9 June 1993, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration held an inquiry into the Commonwealth Bank's annual report. We took evidence specifically from Mr Ian Payne, who is a senior director of the bank. At that hearing I asked for Mr Payne's broad views about the taxpayers of Australia having 70 per cent equity in the bank, and whether the government maintaining equity in the bank, be it 70 per cent or 51 per cent—which will be the case once the current tranche is sold—will `achieve any real public policy input'. I also asked whether government input into the policy of the bank would be any different should the Commonwealth own 70 per cent, 30 per cent or any other amount. Mr Payne agreed with my proposition that, effectively, the government could no longer, and does no longer, use the Commonwealth Bank as a vehicle for public policy.

It is far better for the government to develop specific programs to help those who have specific needs and to administer those programs as efficiently as possible with very clearly set out social goals and clearly measurable accountability structures, so that those social policy objectives can be measured effectively. It is very hard, if not impossible, to measure whether some public policy objectives, delivered through a 51 per cent ownership of a commercial trading operation—in this case, a very large and successful bank—can deliver public policy goals, particularly social objectives which the Democrats and the left of the Labor Party would seek.

         The other point that needs to be made in any debate on privatisation in Australia—and a number of them are coming up in future deliberations of this Senate, particularly in relation to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories—is that one of the other fundamental differences between the government and the coalition parties on privatisation is the use to which privatisation funds are put. We have always argued that privatisation revenue should be immediately offset against long-term government debt. The benefit of this to the community and the taxpayers of Australia is that using the once-off sale proceeds to reduce government debt, reduces in out years the debt servicing requirement which has been a significant part of Commonwealth government outlays in the budgets of the past few years and which will be a part of budgets in future out years.

         The policies that we took to the last election ensured that something like 90 per cent of the proceeds of sales that we had in our policy and manifesto were used to offset Commonwealth debt. They would have made a significant contribution to reducing the burden of debt servicing payments on Commonwealth taxpayers in future years. They would ensure that the proceeds of sales of Commonwealth assets, including significant assets like the Commonwealth bank, which have built up goodwill and significant business in Australia and internationally are not just squandered in one year. They would ensure that all Australian taxpayers and future generations benefit from the proceeds of a sale for many years, if not generations to come.

         Australia is very much in that situation at the moment. We have an enormous debt. Proceeds from privatisation can help to reduce that debt and reduce debt servicing. This has occurred right across the globe. It is a policy that has been implemented in Western nations. The fastest privatisers are now the Eastern European countries. We see it even in China. We had the pleasure of having lunch with the President of the Republic of Chile only yesterday. The South American republics that were referred to only a few years ago by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as banana republics have used privatisation to reduce their debt and return growth and wealth to their citizens.

This point was reinforced by the director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Payne.

         There is one further point I should make which I overlooked when going through my notes. In any debate on privatisation in federal parliament at this time, it is pertinent to point out that the former policy of this Labor government was to encourage privatisation and micro-economic reform in the states. In the last few months the states have suffered a drawback by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister announcing that they will allow the states the proceeds from one privatisation to receive the benefits of a preferential compensation deal to compensate the states for the revenue from their financial institutions—whether a state bank or state insurance office—that they would otherwise receive. That revenue will be lost by the states and it will move to the Commonwealth in the form of taxes that will be derived from those institutions.

         The government is at the moment blaming the states for a lack of progress in waterfront and shipping reform. The states failing to reform their port authorities is an example of that. There are a range of privatisation ventures that need to take place in the states. Unless the Commonwealth is committed to talking to the states about sensible financial arrangements to carry out those privatisations, then the whole cause of economic efficiency and international competitiveness will be held back because of this regrettable change of policy from the federal government.

         —The Senate is debating the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993. This bill facilitates the reduction of the Commonwealth shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank from around 70 per cent to 50.1 per cent, as the explanatory memorandum so elegantly states. I think we should call a spade a spade. We should say that what is happening is yet another step along the road to selling the people's bank—

         Our government is quite happy, aided and abetted by the opposition, to hand our financial system to foreign speculators. The bill also facilitates the announced decision to provide the Development Bank with a capital injection and to relax the legislative constraints on its lending activities. It enables a capital injection of $30 million and a subsidy of $20 million per annum. What should be said about that is that the Development Bank is a fully owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, and one wonders whether the functions that this bank has as a lender of last resort—to provide mainly small to medium businesses with loans that they cannot otherwise get—would not now be substantially affected by the further sale of the Commonwealth Bank and by the relaxation of legislative constraints on its lending activities.

         In debating this bill tonight, it takes me back to December 1990 when it was legislated that the first 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank was to be sold to finance the acquisition of the Victorian State Bank. Even then it was possible to see that that was simply a subterfuge to start the process of privatisation. As we showed at the time, the financing of the acquisition of the Victorian State Bank could have easily been achieved by other means. Exactly as we forecast then, creeping privatisation is now taking place.

         It is quite clear that when the Commonwealth Bank was established it had certain objectives. Most of those objectives are still valid today. They relate to the setting of standards in the banking system rather than simply relying on regulation. Regulation has now been done away with; we no longer have that. We could still exert some influence on the standards of services provided by private banks by having, in competition with them, a bank that is obliged to look after the interests of the nation as a whole rather than private shareholders and speculators.

         We should also say that this is a profitable enterprise. Why should we deprive taxpayers and citizens of Australia of an asset that is turning a profit? It was said by the previous speaker that we should look at where the $1,500 million that the government expects to raise is going. In our view, it would be advisable to have, say, a national development fund that could be used to lend funds to enterprises that require venture capital to provide jobs. However, what will happen is that this $1,500 million will simply be part of the current account arrangements and will disappear into a big black hole.

         The origins of the Commonwealth Bank can be traced back to the economic disasters of the 1890s. In those days, the Labor platform contained a policy of establishing a national bank, although the specific purposes of the institution were defined later in history. The legendary King O'Malley led the call within the Labor Party to establish a commonwealth bank. This culminated at the federal conference of the Labor Party in July 1908.

         Among the objectives of the bank that was then established was to exempt from all fees the accounts of local government bodies, friendly societies, churches, charities, non-profit associations and state and Commonwealth government accounts. This is just an example of the policy objectives that can be pursued through a national bank that belongs to the people as a whole. But at this stage we are even asking the Industry Commission to look at charities to ensure that they turn a profit. I guess, if they do not turn a profit they should not be exempted from fees in the nation's bank!

         I turn to a question that I think is relevant to the consideration as to whether this bank should be placed on the market in the way in which it is being done. The suggestion was made that we are selling what is the property of the Australian community as a whole to individual Australian citizens. I would like the Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), to point to the constraints in the bill we are debating today which might prevent the sale of part of the Commonwealth Bank to foreign interests.

         It is also interesting to note that the decision to sell the bank originated in an ALP caucus resolution of 28 August 1990 which sanctioned the legislation, subject to the undertaking by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, that no further privatisation take place and that no sales to foreign interests take place. However, even then we were able to point to loopholes in the legislation that was then passed whereby both undertakings could be circumvented by the government of the day. Ostensibly, the sale to foreign interests was prohibited by the proposed section 27K. However, subsection 11 provides:

The Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993 before the Senate reduces the government's equity in the Commonwealth Bank from the current 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent.

         The aborted sale of Qantas potentially left a huge hole in the federal government's finances, which had to be filled if this deficit was not to blow out beyond the already horrendous $16 billion or more that we have been saddled with during this financial year.

         The government's handling of this further float—this is the second we have had—of equity in the Commonwealth Bank has been botched from the outset. The government has done an appalling job in providing the market with appropriate information on the structure of the sale, which has led to under-informed, if not misinformed, trading in trading bank shares. In fact, so little information has been provided by this government that the Australian Stock Exchange took the unusual step of requesting from the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, further details of the structure of the proposed sale so that the market could be reasonably informed. In particular, there was the issue of what rights existing shareholders would have to the new share issue, which obviously has an impact on the price of existing shares in the marketplace.

         The response from the Minister for Finance was to advise that the proposed offer structure had not yet been determined and that the government would advise the Stock Exchange of its structure in due course. Further, Labor's inability to supply these and other details had led to the market for CBA shares being driven by speculation and inadequate information. The directors of the bank have been put in a very difficult situation since they are contractually obliged to immediately disclose any information that is necessary to ensure an informed market in CBA shares.

         Of more pertinent concern to me, though, is the manner in which the government has decided to sell the shares. The government has opted against a firm underwritten price. This represents a gamble that could affect many people—I speak in particular on behalf of the small investors—since the government plans to make up to 65 per cent of the offer open to retail investors, with the balance allocated to a bidding process by international investors.

         I am not saying that the percentages are wrong. I think the government has got that sort of thing right. Minimums of 35 per cent for institutional investors and 20 per cent for firm allocations to broker clients have been set aside. Existing shareholders have a guaranteed priority to an allocation of $3,000 in shares. If all shareholders exercise this right, it will account for a further 35 per cent, leaving a minimum of only 10 per cent for new public investors. I welcome the fact that the small investor has been considered in such a way, but I think an examination of the process being used is needed.

         The structure adopted is unusual and groundbreaking. The government has elected not to have a floor or cap price. I can understand that the government is probably seeking to minimise the opportunity for arbitrage, but once the price has been set the arbitrager will move in and by that stage the tender will have been closed. While it is theoretically possible to issue shares in this manner, without a floor—or a cap in this case—there is no indicated pricing of any kind.

         I am concerned that the obtaining of a premium price could be a remote outcome. Retail investors will bid not on price but in terms of dollars that they are prepared to commit. They will only find out how many shares they will have at the end of the process. This may be deemed a clever process because many shareholders think in terms of how much they can afford to invest rather than the value that it will bring to them. The retail investor has been encouraged to invest by being guaranteed a discount on top of any discount in terms of the market procedure by the outcome of the institutional bidding. In the case of $25,000 or more, I think the 25c discount is somewhat unfortunate. If the government were prepared to offer that arrangement to the small investors, I would be quite happy with it.

         I hope I can get a response from the minister on this matter because it is concerning a lot of small investors. In setting the price, which basically will be determined at the peak of the market—I think it has crashed through the 2,000 barrier in recent days—in terms of the small shareholders, particularly those who cannot afford to take 25,000 shares and get a 25c discount, I ask that we be assured that there will be a sufficient differential between the issue price and the market price so that in the medium term, when a market correction which will inevitably occur does take place, small investors who do not really have access to professional advice will not suffer a capital loss.

         Undoubtedly, the government felt that it might have set the last price a little too low. Shareholders did quite nicely. I want to make sure that it does not go to the other extreme and set the issue price so close to the market that, in terms of a market correction, all these small investors who have been lured by the premier investment opportunities that have been stated do not make a loss in the medium term. I believe that its long term holding will be quite satisfactory and it will be a good investment, but in the long term a lot of us will be dead. I would hate to think that a lot of the small investors who do not have the opportunities to access a lot of money were being misled as a result of this activity.

It reduces the Commonwealth shareholding in the bank from 70 per cent to 50.1 per cent. I have no objection to that, but there are other concerns that should be raised. The bill provides a one-off capital injection of $30 million in 1993-94 to the Commonwealth Development Bank to expand its lending to small business and also gives the bank an ongoing annual subsidy of $20 million to assist primary industry and small business. These measures are to lift the capacity of the bank to service the small business community.

         Due to the government's absolute failure to provide for small business, or any type of business for that matter, there were 16,800 bankruptcies last year, which was a record on a very high base the year before, which was a record on a very high base the year before that. Those sorts of statistics used to make headlines. Now they have become part of the overall mismanagement of the government. Very few small businesses are surviving.

         The charter of the bank is to be extended to enable it to meet the full credit requirements of its business customers rather than to provide supplementary finance. There are 48,000 farmers, fishermen and small business people using the Commonwealth Development Bank as a last line of defence or a last lending institution. My concern is that, if the bank were able to provide full banking or credit facilities, it would be fundamental that the small business people, the farmers or the fishermen who were able to offer a first mortgage would be the people to receive the bank's first loans. The others—those who have a second and a third mortgage—would have to get in line. That has never been the case before.

Let me put the hypothetical example of two graziers applying for loans, one having a first mortgage on his property and asking for a top-up loan or a second or third mortgage from the Commonwealth Development Bank and the other able to offer the bank a first mortgage.

         I am very concerned that the change of charter could lead to the removal on the part of some people who use this bank of one of their last methods of finance. As a senator who represents the primary industry areas of Queensland and the small business community, I believe that I should put these concerns on record. The only thing I can do is ask the Senate to support this amendment. I believe it will serve to keep the bank in line when it observes that the parliament of Australia through this amendment wishes to see the bank sticking to its original charter.

         —I rise to speak briefly on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993 and to perhaps tackle a couple of issues that my colleagues did not cover. I say initially that it was most useful for Senator Spindler to draw the attention of the chamber to the history of the Commonwealth Bank.

         This is quite an historic occasion and indeed an historic bill. Who four or five years ago would have believed that the Labor Party would be presenting such a bill to this parliament? Senator McMullan is in the chamber and may well have been present for the Chifley speech in 1987. I know that Senator McMullan is interested in Australian political history and I am sure he will recall Mr Hawke saying then:

        As recently as 1987 we on this side of the chamber were being attacked for proposing the very policy which the government has brought before this chamber this evening. Whereas I do not agree with the conclusion of Senator Spindler, he has at least been consistent in relation to privatisation. He is one of the sole surviving Marxists in any parliament in the world. Senator Spindler has been a great constant in our life in this parliament. He has opposed the selling of assets such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank.

         We on our side all through the 1980s proposed that, in the interests of the Australian people, in the interests of service to Australians, it would be better for the Commonwealth Bank and indeed some of the other commercial assets that the government holds to be sold to the Australian people. But, no, the Australian Labor Party all through the 1980s said that this was social vandalism. It is quite an historic moment that this bill is brought before this parliament, not, I regret to say, by a Liberal and National party government but by a Labor government, so soon after the rhetoric of the Chifley lecture.

I have drawn attention to the great broken promise of the Labor Party in privatising the Commonwealth Bank. I happen to support that; nonetheless, one has to acknowledge that the Labor Party, once again, has reversed its history; it has done a 180 degree turn in supporting a policy which, in recent memory, it so vigorously opposed.

         I have said this before and I will say it again: when the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria merged, assurances were given by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating to the employees of the State Bank of Victoria. In a joint press release issued by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating on 26 August 1990, Mrs Kirner said that clear undertakings had been received from the Commonwealth Bank that there would be no compulsory staff retrenchments resulting from the sale of the bank.

         We have raised this matter with bank officers in a Senate standing committee hearing and we have received replies. We know that that promise to State Bank employees in Victoria was not kept. I would hope that when the minister at the table, Senator McMullan, who is here this evening, responds, he can make it clear whether the promise that Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner made to the State Bank employees in Victoria was a promise which he will acknowledge in this chamber. Can Senator McMullan explain to us why that promise was not kept? Senator McMullan has been blessed this evening in the chamber with the great advantage of very good advisers. I hope he will seek that advice and that he will be able to answer that question.

         The second issue I wish to raise with Senator McMullan relates to yet another broken promise by Mr Keating. Not so long ago Mr Keating said that the time for large-scale retrenchments in industry had come to an end. Senator McMullan would remember that speech and I remember that speech. We learnt just after the election in April how convenient it was for the Commonwealth Bank to announce that 8,000 employees would be involved in the downsizing of the bank.

         The issue of why the Commonwealth Bank board happened to delay that announcement until after the election was canvassed at a hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Answers have been received—answers which I do not regard as satisfactory. We know that the Commonwealth Bank has a major retrenchment program. I do not dispute that, in view of the Commonwealth Bank becoming more competitive, it may have to retrench people. I draw the Senate's attention to the Prime Minister's complaint about private sector organisations downsizing. I would like Senator McMullan to seek advice on whether the announcement by the Commonwealth Bank of this massive downsizing program is in line with the policy announced by Mr Keating in a speech given two or three weeks after the election at the Institute of Directors.

I stress again that not only am I in favour of this bill and the amendments that my colleagues have moved, but I believe that we should go the whole hog and privatise the bank. I want to make it clear where I stand on this issue; although I thank Senator Spindler for giving us the history of the bank, I differ on where the bank should go from here on out. I ask Senator McMullan whether he could seek advice on the propriety of Mr Willis writing to Commonwealth Bank shareholders outlining the offer of shares which the bank was making. A constituent of mine saw this as a politicisation of the share offer and thought that the independence of the Commonwealth Bank board may have been compromised by that. I would like Senator McMullan to address that issue.

         In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you that the Labor government has brought before this parliament an historic bill. I will support the government on this bill. During the 1980s and early 1990s we on our side received from the Labor Party venomous, silly, overstated, exaggerated abuse. I can remember standing on the street outside a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in St Kilda where Commonwealth Bank officers were handing out how-to-vote cards; they were encouraging passers-by not to vote for the coalition because, would you believe, they felt that the coalition would privatise the bank. How poorly they were advised by the Labor government. The Commonwealth Bank officers were not the first to be misled by a Labor government and they will not be the last. It is a lesson they should recall.

         The questions I put to Senator McMullan are, in summary: what was the nature of the promise that was given by Mr Keating regarding compulsory retrenchments? Was the joint press release of Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner saying that there would be no compulsory retrenchments as a result of the merger of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank an accurate reflection of the promise and commitment made? Is the 8,000-strong massive retrenchment program of the Commonwealth Bank in line with the policy Mr Keating announced at the Institute of Directors soon after the election? What is the propriety of Mr Willis making an offer to potential purchasers of shares, rather than the offer coming from the Commonwealth Bank board? Does the government feel this may have compromised the apparent independence of the Commonwealth Bank board?

The definition of `Marxist' in the Oxford dictionary includes `nationalisation of all industry'. I think I again need to draw Senator Kemp's attention to the fact that the Australian Democrats as a party—and I personally—are not in favour of nationalisation and that that particular designation is therefore wrong. To the extent that it implies concern for social justice, it is something of a badge of honour, but we must distinguish between that aspect of it and the means that, in the past, have been advocated for it. I repeat that that simply does not fit. Senator Kemp should take note of that; perhaps he will remember it now that he has been told twice.

         Senator Watson asked some detailed questions about pricing. It is really a matter that has been dealt with, essentially, by the Department of Finance, but with the very best advice that we think we can get from outside.

         The bill will enable the development bank to continue to provide funds to businesses which should not otherwise be able to obtain funds. But, in contrast to the existing legislation, it adds to that the capacity for the bank to provide the full financing requirement, rather than only part of the requirement, so it can actually provide more rather than less. Therefore, I think it is a positive for the Commonwealth Development Bank and for small business, and I think it is an appropriately structured way to do it.

        The amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986  will remove any uncertainty about the operation of the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments which are financed by a levy on all milk production. On behalf of the Commonwealth the Australian Dairy Corporation administers the market support scheme which includes what is known as an `import offset' arrangement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the arrangement recipients of market support payments must declare purchases of imported dairy products. When these are `like products' to a firm's exports, the firm is liable to pay the Corporation an amount equal to the market support payment on an equivalent volume of exports. In effect, payments are made on net exports rather than total exports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of the import offset arrangement is to prevent companies from receiving market support payments on exported product (which would otherwise have been sold on the domestic market) and then importing the same type of product for domestic sale.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the arrangement is not enforceable, the Australian Dairy Corporation would be required to make payments on the gap between net and total exports (ie for the volume of imports) and in recent years the effectiveness of the market support scheme would have been reduced by between $1 million and $2 million each year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because of uncertainty concerning the basis of the import offset arrangement the Corporation has not applied the arrangement for the last two seasons. This legislation removes any uncertainty and allows the Corporation to proceed to apply the arrangement for 1991-92, 1992-93 and the remainder of the life of the market support scheme.

        The International Dairy Federation's World Congress will provide Australian dairy producers with increased exposure to international technological developments, and allow them to develop closer working relationships with those at the forefront of the world dairy industry. Australian industry will have the opportunity to demonstrate that it is efficient and that there are positive effects from this Government's policy of reducing both assistance and trade distortions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has agreed to allow the industry to use the Dairy Industry Fund to underwrite the World Congress. The Fund is presently used for Australian contributions to the International Dairy Federation, the organisation under whose auspices the World Dairy Congress is held. This Bill includes an amendment of the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to enable the use of the Industry Fund to underwrite the Australian hosting of the 1994 Congress.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is a long-standing agreement between Government and industry that $1 million would be made available to underwrite the Congress.

        The amendment to the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Amendments) Act 1991 extends the period during which Part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 continues in force. Part IVA enables the Commonwealth to enter into arrangements with the States and Northern Territory to vary the jurisdictional arrangements for identified fisheries in accordance with the Offshore Constitutional Settlement. These provisions are complemented by State and Northern Territory legislation. Similar powers have been included in the new Fisheries Management Act 1991 but these provisions cannot commence until State and Territory legislation has been amended.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Initial expectations were that these changes would be finalised by 3 February 1994. This timetable has not been achieved. The amendments will extend the operation of Part IVA for an additional 12 month period to enable the necessary State and Territory legislation to be put in place. Part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 will be repealed when all complementary State and Territory legislation is in place.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 reflect the original intention that seasonal and other closures may be authorised under a Management Plan and provide greater flexibility in the type and number of fishing concessions a fisherman may hold.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Fisheries Management Act 1991 which commenced on 3 February 1992 provided the new Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) with a firm foundation to undertake the Commonwealth's fisheries management responsibilities. In particular the Act established a new system of Statutory Fishing Rights and provided for the making of Fishery Management Plans to be the primary instrument for managing Australia's commercial fisheries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Act provides general powers for AFMA to make Management Plans and create and issue various types of fishing concessions. The success of this approach relies on the certainty that Management Plans, rights issued in accordance with those Plans, and any other action taken under a Plan are fully supported by the law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recent legal advice indicates that the provisions of the Act may not fully support the level of flexibility needed to implement some fishery management arrangements. Rather than leave the issue uncertain and open to different interpretations, these amendments put beyond doubt the matters that may be included in a Plan.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Statutory Fishing Rights were created to give greater security to fishermen. For fishermen to have confidence in the arrangements there must be unambiguous provisions to support the issue and holding of the widest range of Statutory Fishing Rights that may be required under a Plan. Provision is made for a fisherman to hold a number of Statutory Fishing Rights as a discrete package of Rights which authorises a particular fishing activity. Examples are combinations of quotas to take various species of fish or specified combinations of fishing gear or boat characteristics such as size or engine power. Provision is also made for the smooth transition of existing fishing rights in fisheries subject to Management Plans, to the new Act.

        The amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 are consequential to the establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation and the related forest industries research levy and charge Acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments reflect changed funding arrangements for the Corporation of $1 Commonwealth for every $2 from industry rather than the $1 for $1 currently provided in the Act. The basis of the changed funding arrangements for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation arises from the structure of the industry—half the industry has a primary industry focus, while the other half has a manufacturing orientation. Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments will also provide that revenue derived from charges under the Forest Industry Research Import Charge Act 1993 will be directed to research and development of relevance to the timber importing industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will enable the forest industries levies and charges to be collected under the same arrangements which apply to the collection of other primary industries levies and charges.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also includes a minor amendment to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 to empower the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the need to obtain prior Ministerial approval for each transaction. The amendment will avoid the delays which can occur while obtaining this approval and associated unnecessary losses. It furthers the Government's objective of reducing controls over day-to-day operations as part of its wider Government Business Enterprise reform to deliver best possible performance.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is to correct an anomaly in the Act to ensure that it provides the necessary constitutional power for the States to confer functions on the Australian Wheat Board to allow it to conduct intra-state trade in grain and grain products. Changes are also being made to improve efficiencies in the operation of the Wheat Board.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Doubts had been raised as to whether the Commonwealth Act presently confers the necessary powers to enable the Wheat Board to conduct intra-state trade in any grains other than wheat even though State Acts have purported to confer those powers since the commencement of the revised wheat marketing arrangements on 1 July 1989. In order to validate the Wheat Board's intra-state grain trading operations these amendments will be made retrospective to that date.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments in other areas include provisions to allow the Wheat Board flexibility to make adjustments to pool return payments based on variety, quality, transport, storage and handling costs and other similar matters which are unable to be accurately specified in the delivery contract, so as to ensure that growers within a pool are treated fairly in respect of the wheat they deliver.

        This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. Successive Governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditure that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Budget deficit of $16 billion for 1993-94 gives rise to a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund about $7 billion higher. This situation arises because appropriations from that Fund include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund to redeem or repurchase Commonwealth securities and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the Loan Fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $13.4 million for 1993-94, the Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated, or currently before the Parliament. I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament.

         —During question time today I asked Senator Cook some questions in relation to the hearings of Estimates Committee A which examined the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I asked those questions because there is grave concern about what is happening in AQIS and with the management of AQIS. Senator Brownhill and I and other honourable senators, such as Senator Boswell and other members of the committee—I notice that Senator Crane is in the chamber, as is Senator Panizza, who has taken an interest in AQIS in the past—are all very concerned about what is happening in terms of management and accountability.

         Senator Brownhill and I raised particular criticisms in relation to AQIS which can be summarised as accountability and scrutiny. There is a clear obligation on us in this place to ensure that public administration gives the taxpayers value for their tax paying dollar. Section 27 of the Public Service Act sets out very clearly that the Public Service Board must devise `means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of departments'. It also says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All officers who incur or authorise expenditure shall exercise due economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are lofty sentiments which we hope the Public Service abides by. Senator Brownhill and I have been attempting to ascertain whether this has happened in the case of AQIS—a government department operating on full cost recovery from its users, who are mainly farmers or those involved in the processing of primary industry products. Our attention was drawn to the matter because recently there have been two separate audit reports relating to AQIS activities and both have found inefficiencies and unsatisfactory management practices.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Our interest was further heightened when an internal review of AQIS SES travel, albeit one that was considerably more curtailed than envisaged by those who commissioned it, discovered numerous irregularities and other actions which are contrary to the terms of the Public Service Act involving the senior executive service within AQIS. For some reason that we simply have been unable to discover, this review was wound up with only nine months travel activity monitored, despite discovering hundreds of instances of prima facie irregularities and breaches of the rules.

       </para>
       <para>
        Surprisingly, however, at the estimates hearing and in light of those statements, we found that there is no budget for travel within AQIS. Coming on top of the statement about woefully deficient record keeping, this is of great concern. The irregularities include—I list these for the benefit of the Senate—travel without authorisation, authorisation for travel by officers when they are not in Canberra to do so or when they are overseas on the date on which they are supposed to be signing the authorisation, officers appearing not to have been where their travel documentation says they were, and overuse of mobile phones for personal use.

         The final draft of the management review suggested that there was `serious and consistent obtaining of benefits to which recipients are not entitled'. It went on to say that there is `lack of management' and `consistent disregard for the Secretary's instruction'. It detailed extensively the breaches—major and minor—of every SES officer. It produced various drafts to chart usage and it produced travel summaries. The review concluded:

       <para>
        It noted that one officer's travel records could not be ascertained for most of the nine months that were examined for the simple reason that the Mastercard files were missing. It noted that the weekly report to the secretary to the department of AQIS SES movements omitted, on a regular basis, details of overseas trips of some weeks duration involving several officers. It noted the frequent occurrences of travel remaining unauthorised or being authorised subsequent to the travel. That is not supposed to happen. It noted such things as the head of the service spending 46 per cent of his time travelling outside the office. It noted that this same officer requested his travel documents back from the review team during its review and it is suggested that he altered them—or persons altered them on his behalf—on several occasions. They are very serious matters.

         The review noted that one officer undertook a private trip to Dublin after an authorised visit to North and South America and there was no documentation on file to authorise the change, although the travel allowance was calculated to match the revised schedule. That is rather strange. Neither was this additional leg of the trip notified to the secretary, as is required in the guidelines. The same officer had repeated instances of claiming for taxis in cities he was no longer in or claiming airport parking fees when he took a taxi to the airport. This is the same officer who had no Mastercard files for any period after June 1991.

         We also saw evidence of a senior officer soliciting money from the private sector to attend an overseas conference for which he was quite happy to admit he had no automatic entitlement for financial assistance from AQIS. Yet it also appears that he subsequently did attend, on pay, and claimed travelling allowance. The review recommended that the SES officers have their travel benefits independently investigated.

         At the same time as this internal review was being conducted, another unit of AQIS—the internal investigations unit—was also asked to look at SES use of Commonwealth plated cars and domestic travel. This internal investigation team also experienced difficulties with SES officers removing original travel documentation and returning it amended. I understand that there is substantial evidence to show the documents before and after they were removed, and they are not one and the same.

         Subsequent to this progress report being submitted—this is an important point—the unit experienced difficulty in having its authorised officer status maintained.

The officer who was removed was the linchpin of the unit because he had 22 years of investigative experience with the Australian Federal Police. The words that we heard from the head of the internal investigations unit at the hearings was that it emasculated the unit.

         The head of the unit complained about those restrictions but, unfortunately, to no avail. It appears that there was an internal departmental review of the methodology and findings of the travel review but it has not been sighted. The secretary to the department then appointed another authorised officer from outside the service to investigate the issue of SES travel irregularities. This officer then proceeded to undertake this review, accepting written documentation from officers without ever accessing the original travel documentation to ascertain their veracity. He concluded that there were no indications of irregularities. He argued:

        I will come back to that in a minute. I suggest that what he wrote is a personal interpretation, his own view, which is not based on any departmental ruling, and it is quite simply wrong.

It fails to take into consideration the necessity for senior officers to adhere to a standard of professional care and skill, as outlined in the discipline manual.

         It has been put to me that there are numerous flaws in the analysis that that review officer did. That analysis, the findings and the way in which the SES officers were treated are hypocritical when one recalls that the same department—that is, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, because AQIS is an outrider of that department—took a junior officer to the Magistrates Court in Canberra in September 1991, which is the same time these irregularities were supposed to be taking place, and prosecuted her for altering a sick leave form for a personal financial benefit $71.83.

         The officer suggested that the officers who undertook the original travel management review were at fault and that they had denied natural justice to those they had examined.

         I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that about 40 to 50 wineries have been set up in Tasmania in the past 30 years, many of them in very recent years. About $9 million worth of wine is produced in a year at wholesale value and the retail value of that wine is about $15 million. About three-quarters of the wine is sold in Tasmania, about 20 per cent is sold to the mainland and about five per cent is exported. So it is a very fledgling export industry, but it has great potential for the future.

If this legislation were to go through, the impact of these extra job losses on Tasmania would be horrific.

         This proposed tax increase would affect Tasmania more than almost any other state, as our wines are very expensive because they are produced on a small scale.

This proposed tax hike would put between $1.50 and $2.50 on top of bottle shop prices.

          In the face of overwhelming evidence of the detrimental effect on the wine industry of an extra 55 per cent increase in sales tax on its investment, employment potential and export growth, the only defence which the government can offer, apart from shonky figures and analysis, is the need for tax equity. But unlike the federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the wine industry knows its grapes. It knows that the Treasurer's rationale for the 55 per cent tax hike is unfounded.

          Among the fanciful claims to support the Treasurer's view that tax equity demands this impost occur are as follows. There is the claim that Penfolds Grange Hermitage be taxed at the same rate as lemonade; that the previous tax structure discriminates against other alcoholic beverages; that the previous structure ignores the pre-eminent turnover and employment position of the brewing industry; and that it ignores the socioeconomic consumption patterns regarding different alcoholic beverages. All these claims are false and have been shown and demonstrated to be such by the wine industry in publicly available evidence, of which the government must be well aware. The facts to support the Treasurer are very scarce on the ground, as indeed will be new vineyards if the government, with its majority in the other place, persists with this tax.

          —I thank the Senate. All these countries, with the exception of France, completely exempt wine from excise. French excise on wine represents only 0.3 per cent of the excise on spirits. Even value added tax, which like a GST is uniformly applied at retail level, is less for wine in a number of these countries. This reinforces the argument that a wholesale sales tax, which already in Australia applies to different goods at different rates, at the wholesale stage in Australia should most definitely give preference to wine. Reference to this table clearly shows the strong preference given to wine by our competitors in the international marketplace.

          In these countries wine gets far better tax treatment than in Australia with our pre-budget tax structure, let alone what it will become under the tax hike rejected today in the Senate. Quite simply, every successful wine exporting country treats the industry preferentially, as against other alcoholic beverages, in terms of taxation.

          On the other hand, countries which fail to do this have destroyed the export potential of their industry. New Zealand is a prime example of this. Investment and expansion for export has dried up since New Zealand changed its tax structures to bring so-called equity between alcoholic beverages. Its export potential has not been realised as a direct consequence of this. It is one of the few areas where New Zealand has ignored international best practice and, in contrast to its resultant success with other commodities and products, it has suffered the consequences. So international best practice and competition demand that this tax hike be rejected, and I trust that members in the other place will see the wisdom of the Senate's decision this evening.

          Before concluding, I wish to turn my attention to the consequences of the legislation passed today to correct anomalies in the motor vehicle import by-laws to prevent certain vehicle importers reclaiming duty paid and, therefore, contrary to the intent of the government's motor vehicle plan, effectively allowing vehicles in duty free. As my colleague Senator Ferguson indicated during the lunch time debate on this legislation, the opposition reluctantly accepted it, despite its retrospective features, to protect the integrity of the car plan. However, we are highly critical of the sloppy drafting of earlier regulations which made it necessary.

Senator Schacht commented earlier that he still did not have a response from the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, regarding the refund of application fees to the companies which lodged applications for customs duty refunds.

          I also want to raise a further concern which came to light with regard to the car plan in evidence to the committee hearing. It was claimed by a witness that further loopholes exist in the by-laws allowing any manufacturer to import vehicles duty free, virtually without limit. Customs officials denied this, so clarification was sought. However, Minister Schacht's subsequent letter providing this clarification in effect confirms the claim of the witness. The relevant part of the minister's letter said:

        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, the volume of duty free imports allowed to a manufacturer is not directly controlled by the by-laws. It is a voluntary action by the manufacturer undertaking such imports. If the volume imported exceeded the duty free entitlement under the export credits accrued, the only action the government could take would be to revoke the determination allowing those imports. That is, a further initiative is required by the government to prevent such an occurrence. We cannot rely on the immediate effect of law.

          This raises the question: what if a manufacturer decided it no longer required the benefit of that determination for whatever reason it might have?

          Under the present voluntary arrangements, the government is at best relying on the goodwill of manufacturers and, at worst, its own capacity to blackmail them to control duty free imports. In the light of the experience surrounding the need for the legislation that was passed today, this is hardly acceptable. I believe the government should take a long hard look at this situation. I warn the minister that the government should not come back to the Senate again with another piece of retrospective legislation—relating to the by-law anomaly that was corrected today—and seek the opposition's support if a problem emerges with regard to this issue that I have raised in the latter part of remarks. Given the experience we have had and given the warning given to the government, it would be very hard pressed to gain our support.

         I understand that since I last spoke on this matter a week or 10 days ago, there has been some movement and some attempt to speed up the process. But this stands, as I have said before, as a damnation of the inhumanity of the bureaucracy when it comes to righting wrongs that have been perpetrated by the bureaucracy against individual Australians. If any of these people die before this matter is determined, then the responsibility for the death or bankruptcy—or both—of these individuals will have to hang on the consciences of those people who simply will not respond to what the parliament and a committee of the parliament has determined after full and thorough research and evaluation. They need to bring some justice to people who have suffered in a way that no ordinary Australian should be forced to suffer at the hands of the bureaucracy.

First, I turn to the speech made by Senator Chapman on the amendment to the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill dealing with retrospective legislation to close off a possible loophole that could have ended the export enhancement program for the car industry. I emphasise `possible loophole'. We in government never conceded that that loophole automatically meant the outcome that was claimed; that is, that people could import cars into Australia without paying a tariff. We did concede in the estimates hearing that there was a chance that if the legislation went to the courts and ultimately to the High Court it could rule against us. No matter how small that risk was, we as a government were not going to put at risk that excellent program and policy for the car industry in Australia.

I have already spoken briefly in this chamber about this case and about the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which was tabled in December last year. I have said before in this chamber that I may be one of the very few senators who has actually read the whole 600 pages of that report. Three weeks into the job as minister, I spent the whole of my Easter this year reading the whole of that report. As a result I have had lengthy discussions with the customs officials over many hours, going through one by one not only the recommendations of the report but also the descriptions in the report about what happened in that case according to the public accounts committee.

I anticipate that there will be amendments coming into the parliament in the next sittings to alter the Customs Act in a number of areas—again as a result of the government's acceptance of some of those recommendations in the Midford report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I have noted before that that report was supported by both sides of the public accounts committee. I think it has been acknowledged that this is not a majority and minority report; it is a bipartisan unanimous report.

         As Senator Bishop would be aware, since taking on this job I have announced a complete review of the operation of the customs department with the broadest possible terms of reference. It is chaired by Mr Conroy, former chief executive of the Westpac Bank. The two other members of the review are Ian Macphee and Susan Ryan. They have taken submissions all around Australia and had consultations with industry, customs and other interested parties. I do not know whether they have had discussions with Senator Bishop. If they have not, that offer is still there.

I hope that the report, when it is tabled and made available to the public by the deadline at the end of this year, not only deals with some of the obvious complaints that people may have, such as those arising out of the Midford report, but above all else looks at a way of structuring the operation of the customs service in this country that makes it relevant and effective not just for the rest of this decade but into the 21st century.

         I think the Australian Customs Service, though it is under criticism by such reports as Midford, in a number of areas does an excellent job. It is leading the world in the introduction of electronic technology and removal of unnecessary paperwork. The Compile system is still being developed. It still has some teething problems. We recently adopted optional port of lodgment, with some controversy; some custom brokers completely opposed it. But it means that in the long run we will have a more effective electronic system for people to make their entries into the customs system for their exports or imports.

That is already well under way. Despite problems that I acknowledge have been raised by Senator Bishop and others, there is much in the customs system to be commended.

         Finally, I turn to the remarks that Senator Bishop raised about the personal side of those affected by the Midford Paramount case. The IDC, the interdepartmental committee, was established by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to look at the compensation claims of the people affected. Of course, it is chaired by the finance department, as is appropriate in these cases; it is not chaired by the customs department or DITARD. Those departments are able to send observers but they are not full voting members.

I appreciate that this has taken longer than anticipated. When I have asked about the delay, I have heard that this is because various parties to the Midford dispute, including those seeking compensation, have changed their arguments from time to time. I do not automatically accept that that is correct, but I have heard that put.

        (1) The Commonwealth has approved an allocation of $16 million for the establishment of around 8,000 hectares of eucalypt plantations in Tasmania on both Crown and private land. This is part of the $50 million Helsham structural adjustment package agreed by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments under the 1988 Heads of Agreement following the World Heritage Listing of certain Tasmanian forest areas. It is important to note that a key objective of this package was to enable Tasmania to replace resources which were withdrawn as a result of the World Heritage listing and the agreement specifically included provision for this plantation program. To date, some $4.957 million has been provided to Tasmania for specific activities relating to this project. All plantations established to date are located on Crown land.

        Plantings on cleared land totalled 280 hectares in 1991 and 1992. It is anticipated that, on preliminary estimates, a further 640 hectares will be planted on cleared land in 1993. In addition to these plantings, some 560 hectares have been planted on understocked land which is predominantly covered by wattle and scrub, with a further 590 hectares expected to be planted on similar land during 1993. The balance of the areas planted in those years (561 ha in 1991 and 1992; 610 ha in 1993) was planted on land which had been logged to meet the TFC's sawlog commitments.
