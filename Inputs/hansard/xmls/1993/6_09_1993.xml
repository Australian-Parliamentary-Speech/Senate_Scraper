         —Senator Colston has raised an important question. There has been interest for some time in the recognition of the importance of EDI, electronic data interchange, in the development of more efficient business processes in the public sector and private industry. There has been active involvement in this area. The department, in particular, has been investigating for some time the use of new technology to support more efficient business processes. These investigations have shown that there is the potential for significant savings—in response particularly to one of Senator Colston's points—for the government through the introduction of electronic purchasing practices.

         The project will establish the viability and benefits of electronic trading to the government and to its suppliers. I am very confident, and it seems self-evident I would have thought, that electronic trading can bring significant benefits to government purchasing activities. There also seems to me to be significant potential in benefits to industry, including time savings on both sides, reduced paperwork, simplified procedures, reductions in errors and lower prices for goods and services.

         The government is running educational awareness programs to help managers within the Public Service gain a better understanding of the benefits of electronic trading. Given that the Commonwealth spends about $10 billion a year on goods and services, it seems a significant contribution to economic efficiency in the country if there is a coordinated approach. This project has the potential to lead in that process and to create significant benefits for industry and for efficient government.

         —No, that is not the case at all, as Senator Chapman would wholly expect me to say, and I say so for very good reason. The situation is that the government remains determined to further reform the industrial relations system by increasing its flexibility and by accelerating and widening the spread of enterprise bargaining. The government will do that cooperatively and constructively. We will not do it by allowing for reduced wages and conditions. We will not do it by emasculating trade unions. Our approach to industrial relations reform will continue in that respect to differentiate us from the opposition's wholly confrontational  agenda. We believe that a permanent and reliable safety net, in effect, is essential to industrial relations reform and we will therefore continue to be committed to legislating for minimum standards to apply to all workers and to maintaining and updating the award system to protect those who are unable to negotiate workplace agreements.

         The Commonwealth has argued before the Industrial Relations Commission that it ought to replace the current wage fixing principles with a statement of guidance based on the accord mark 7. We are committed to establishing clear and balanced industrial rights and responsibilities and to providing for effective enforcement within the context of the industrial relations system, rather than through the common law system which is costly, slow and inaccessible to ordinary workers. They are the elements of the government's current approach to industrial relations. That is an approach which I am sure will be capable of being thoroughly and effectively implemented in a constructive and cooperative, rather than confrontational, way.

Might I just add this further comment on the subject of workplace bargaining: we, of course, recognise that there are lots of employees who, for one reason or another, cannot participate in workplace bargaining because they do not have a union to represent them. Our overriding concern is with the objective of spreading enterprise agreements. We have made that clear, as the Prime Minister did back in July, and we continue to do so. We formed a working party with the ACTU to discuss that issue. We will be considering a solution to the problem as a result of that exercise, and that response will be considered by cabinet in due course.

         —The incidence of child abuse does appear to be rising in this country. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that in 1991-92 more than 50,000 reports of abuse were brought to attention in Australia. That represents a 7.7 per cent increase in cases over the previous year and a 20 per cent increase in cases since 1988-89. Whether that is a real increase or whether it is just a reflection of more people being prepared to report cases of child abuse is not known. But either way, it is somewhat irrelevant because what we do know is that child abuse, whatever the size or amount of it, is totally unacceptable.

         Just as we have moved as a government—and the opposition is with us on this one—to make clear the refusal to tolerate violence against women, I think we now have to move to make sure that the issue of child abuse is equally unacceptable to all levels of society. The Commonwealth has recognised the seriousness of this issue. It addressed it by establishing a national child prevention council in 1991. That council has now produced the first ever prevention strategy for child abuse in this nation, and I was able to release that yesterday. That council has not only produced a strategy but it has established a clearing house on research into child abuse. That is very important because we do not know the amount or the size of this problem, nor do we know the multi-factor causes of it.

         Until now the efforts to deal with child abuse have mostly involved trying to treat cases once they are diagnosed. This government's national strategy is moving to early intervention and even prevention of child abuse. We recognise that the cost of child abuse is just appalling, not only in straight dollar costs but also in terms of the consequences. We want to break the cycle of child abuse of whatever sort being passed on from one generation to another.

         As I said, we do not know the causes of child abuse. We do know that many of the parents who are guilty of child abuse report having been abused themselves as children. That is not true of all adults who were abused as children, but there is certainly a high figure in respect of parents of abused children. So I think it is vitally important that government makes clear its commitment to breaking that cycle, to trying to interrupt the passing on of very unhappy, destructive childhood experiences and child abuse practices that may, when the children grow into adults, affect their behaviour. The cost is far too high—not only in terms of dollars but also in terms of the damage done to members and representatives of our community.

         With the launch of this strategy, I have written to all my state and territory colleagues seeking their support for the implementation of this preventive strategy and for cost sharing funding arrangements so that we can proceed to see whether we cannot make a difference in this quite horrible, shocking condition that is confronting our society. I think we must also not be distracted by the kinds of cases that draw the headlines in our newspapers. Child abuse is much wider and much deeper, and sometimes one could say that more ordinary abuse is occurring. We must concentrate on making sure that all of those families that suffer abuse, not just the headline cases, are equally the concern of government.

We did not pass that bill in that time; we got half a bill.

         —He got a lot of kicks for it at the time, so I think that he is due for a little credit for it now. It is a timely question because under the Broadcasting Services Act broadcasters are required to develop codes relating to programming matters and complaints procedures. The Australian Broadcasting Authority on 19 August endorsed a code of practice which will form the basis for commercial television program regulation. The code of practice was developed by the Federation of Commercial Television Stations, FACTS, after extensive consultation with the television industry, the public and the Australian Broadcasting Authority and took effect yesterday.

         One of the most important aspects of the code of practice is the new classification information about programs. Last night the new classification information provided this information before the Sunday night movie. A summary of this information was also screened after each ad break during the movie. Significantly, the code introduces the new M and MA classifications to television. This means there is now a  uniform treatment of classification across cinema, film, video and television—something that people have been wanting for a  long time.

         It is true that it is claiming that up to $22 million a year in savings could be made if there were a clampdown on the way optometrists conduct their business. It would appear that this is based on saying that the numbers of optometrists are growing rapidly and hence their services are growing rapidly and that optometrists are in fact seeing people quite often for the treatment of ocular systematic medical conditions for which, according to the ophthalmologists, the optometrists have no training or legislative right to treat. As a result of these suggestions, I am asked to investigate the matter.

         Obviously, when one is confronted with allegations of $22 million a year being improperly taken from the public purse, one has to look at it, and I certainly shall be. I have in fact asked that we have a special look at this question of eye disorders and the way they are treated. That having been said, I think one really has to see the correspondence I have received from the ophthalmologists as part of what has been a very long-term campaign by them against optometry which they see as having invaded their patch to some extent. It is interesting to note that the optometrists do not seem to retaliate. Perhaps after the last couple of weeks they will feel more empowered to do so, but at this stage of the game because I have these on the table I will be having a look at it.

I think we will be having a very good look at optometrists and ophthalmologists over the course of the next few months to make sure the integrity of the government dollar is being protected.

The review was headed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and involved both federal and state governments and representatives from the oil, petroleum exploration and shipping industries. A comprehensive report was presented from that review to the last meeting of ATAC, the Transport Ministers Council, which adopted the review's recommendations. They included the acquisition of an additional $5.6 million worth of pollution combat equipment to provide an improved initial response capability in high risk areas. Natplan now incorporates management of some $30 million worth of oil spill response equipment; an improved national training program for response personnel to ensure prompt and effective action to an oil spill incident; enhanced arrangements for the rapid response of personnel and equipment; clearer command and control procedures for managing the response to a marine incident; and closer integration of existing government and industry response capabilities. These recommendations are now being implemented and a national plan advisory committee, comprising government and industry representatives, is overseeing this process.

Those who were not at the meeting of the mineworkers—and neither Senator Parer nor I was—cannot know what were the various factors at play. We cannot hypothesise what might have happened in the changed industrial relations law setting that would follow from Australia taking what I think is the internationally responsible decision to deal with sections 45D and 45E, such that our laws dealing with industrial relations are no longer the subject of that criticism from the ILO which it has directed at those particular sections. There will be a new industrial relations framework when those changes are made.

         The rate of increase in the number of cases of AIDS is now falling but, curiously enough, while it is falling overall and falling for men, there has been a small increase in the number of cases of AIDS positive women. That is of considerable concern. Something like 733 women in Australia are HIV positive; some 133 women have got AIDS; and there have been 73 deaths of women from AIDS. Some 47 per cent of those cases seem to have been contracted through heterosexual sex.

         What we have to look at now is the way in which we can increase the education campaign for women so as to make them sure that they hold responsibility for safe sex and that they actually try to practise it themselves. The challenge for many women who felt that they were protected from the likelihood of catching AIDS is that, in light of this evidence, they must face the fact that there is a risk and that the best way for this to be managed is by women taking responsibility for the practice of safe sex.

         One of the very important considerations to bear in mind is that women in practising safe contraception, in particular by using the pill, provide no barrier against the transmission of not only AIDS but other sexually transmitted diseases as well. There is some paradox for women in that in looking for contraception guarantees—that is, to insure against getting pregnant—they may inadvertently be putting themselves at risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases. It is one of the areas of education that we must make sure we pass on to young women in Australia.

         The program produced by the Family Planning Association certainly deserves commendation. The questionnaire program and interview involved about 1,000 women in four family planning clinics around Australia. There was a 98 per cent response to the questionnaires. It indicates just how seriously the women took this and how well it was carried out by the Family Planning Association.

         Judith Robinson, the chief conductor of this research, said that we have a lot of information in posters on the wall but we have to get that information off the wall and into people's behaviour. Changing behaviour is probably the very hard part of what we must do here. It is no easy matter when we are trying to negotiate safe sex. There is no way women can practise safe sex unless they can negotiate with their partners, particularly if the best barrier—it seems to have been tested as the best barrier—is a condom. The old slogan `If its not on, it's not on' is a very good one, but we have evidence that although people know that, translating it into practice is the challenge ahead for the women of Australia if they want to avoid the spread of AIDS through the heterosexual community. We have a very good reputation in dealing with AIDS; we do not want that good reputation to make us complacent.

We are hoping that there will be complementary legislation, cooperatively achieved, to produce that result. Until then, any speculation on the subject in terms of budgetary implications would be quite idle.

         —In the past two years and currently the United Nations has been involved in a record number of peacekeeping activities, most of which have been the result of some very good diplomatic efforts. The obvious weakness that has appeared in the past year or two is that the actual military planning from the United Nations in New York has shown great deficiencies—that is, poor planning and too often decisions changed at a day's notice, et cetera. This is causing enormous angst amongst defence ministers around the globe.

         In the past three months I have had the opportunity of having discussions with six defence ministers and representatives from at least three or four other major countries, all of whom have expressed great concern at the lack of military planning that has gone into these ventures. The United Nations has set up a working group to look at this, and I know that the United States has produced a major paper. Unless the matter is resolved, the various defence agencies around the world will be far less likely to be involved in peacekeeping in future.

         It should be said at the outset that only 28 people in New York are involved in planning these multifaceted operations. They are badly resourced financially and, sadly, intellectually. From time to time we have made loan arrangements for officers to go there. But the fact is that, the way the military works around the globe, there must be planning. If there is a lack of planning and casualties occur, it would be extremely unlikely that, at least, defence ministers and, in turn, their foreign ministers will sign up for these ventures in future. In my view it would be very regrettable if that were ever to occur.

         I do not know what the solution is. We have contemplated here that maybe one country should take over on a rotational basis the planning of any particular operation. Senator Gareth Evans and his department are working very hard at the moment on the production of a blue book, which I am sure will tackle this issue, amongst others to do with peacekeeping. Most of that emphasis, of course, will be on heading off the need for peacekeeping activities.

That advice was to the effect that Mr Rose agreed with the conclusions of Mr Witynski's advice of 12 August and, moreover, that he saw no problems under section 55 of the constitution in combining the various revenue elements in the bill.

There were, as I intimated may have been the case when I spoke last week, several drafts of this document, none of which Mr Rose considered to be final. Neither the Attorney-General nor I regard such working drafts as being opinions within the meaning of the Senate resolution. In any event, it would be inappropriate for such working documents to be produced. The final version of the opinion of Mr Rose was tabled on 31 August. Should the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs wish to ask Mr Rose about the steps by which he arrived at his final advice, I am advised that he will be happy to enlighten that committee when he appears before it on 9 September.

I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories that unleaded petrol was introduced in 1986 and sales will exceed those of leaded by 1994. Leaded petrol sales will continue to decline until production is no longer economic in Australia—probably by the year 2002.

         The Roundtable Conference on Lead in Petrol on 29 July 1993 noted that ethanol can be added to petrol instead of lead without the need for retuning or modification. The Australian Institute of Petroleum has claimed that there are economic and technical disadvantages that outweigh the possible benefits in the short term, including problems in producing and distributing sufficient ethanol, in dealing with water in ethanol and with corrosion. Others are confident these problems are being overcome. The conference expressed support for an urgent study of the use of alternative octane enhancers such as ethanol, and the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is now organising such a study.

         The government is implementing a number of measures that will assist in promoting the use of ethanol as an alternative transport fuel. It has commissioned a feasibility study into the construction of a small scale plant to demonstrate new Australian technologies for producing ethanol from woody fibres and other waste organic material. Following the study, the Commonwealth will provide a grant of $2 million on a dollar-for-dollar basis in partnership with industry for the demonstration project. To encourage the development of alternative transport fuels, including ethanol, the government has committed itself to a five-year guarantee of the current excise free status of alternative transport fuels with at least one year's notice of any intention to change that status. This guarantee will provide the certainty and impetus needed to help ethanol and other alternative fuels become established in the Australian transport sector.

          —I rise in response to the resolution of the Senate dated 19 August on the motion of Senator Tambling regarding a proposed fundraising scheme of the ALP to provide access to ministers, which was cancelled by the national secretary of the party several days before the event was to take place. I table now the requested responses dealing with this matter from all ministers or ministers' offices as the case may be. On my own behalf, I state that neither I nor any member of my staff had any knowledge of this scheme before it became public.

          The responses from ministers or the ministers' offices that I am now tabling will demonstrate—when Senator Tambling has had a chance to have a look at them—that this has been yet another time consuming, time wasting fishing expedition which has precisely the catch it deserved, namely, nothing. With the precise legislative record for two sitting weeks being one half of one particular bill, let me express the hope once again, as articulated by Senator McMullan earlier on today, that we will regard ourselves as having exhausted for the moment these kinds of exercises and get on with the proper business of this place; namely, the legislative program.

Like Senator Gareth Evans, I am also conscious of the fact that we should not unnecessarily waste time in this chamber, but I think it does bear some assessment of precisely how the time of this chamber has been used.

        The Opposition, with the support of the Independents, is dragging its feet in the Senate, doing almost nothing except spoiling and haranguing . . . Of that 41 hours only 66 minutes have been devoted to legislation: three minutes in the first week, and 63 minutes on Wednesday night of this week. The rest has all been Opposition flummery.

        Even Senator Kernot ought to appreciate that at the start of the new session a whole series of matters have to be dealt with by this chamber to rearrange the business. I am surprised that Senator Kernot swallowed this line—hook, line and sinker. It is precisely that point which is a dramatic overstatement of any problem that has arisen to date, and to the extent that there is a problem it is the responsibility of those on the other side.

         For example, we have had eight first speeches. There is four hours for a start. Presumably one would not call that opposition flummery. We have had 2 1/2 hours of condolences following the death of Sir Condor Laucke. Again, I would not think one would describe that as opposition flummery. We have had two days of estimates—does the government describe that as opposition flummery? We have had a discussion about the IPU conference, one of the biggest conferences ever organised in this country.

         We have also had a very important constitutional debate about the legality of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill containing the extraordinary admission from Senator Gareth Evans that indeed the purpose of the government is precisely what is banned by section 55 of the constitution. In other words, Senator Evans made it plain in this chamber that the government is all about packaging various provisions and various subject matters of taxation that the constitution clearly says one should not package. This is a deliberate flouting of the constitution. That is why it is necessary for that matter to be referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee. Again, I would not have thought that anyone could seriously stand up in this place and suggest that that sort of debate, which goes to the heart of the legality of the government's budget bills, is somehow to be passed off as opposition flummery.

         There has also been taking note of answers and a number of other matters, including questions, which is perfectly proper business of the Senate. Unless one is in the business of jackboot democracy—as they seem to be in the House of Representatives where the government no longer believes in the opposition's right to move censure motions and it no longer believe in MPIs. I noted the other day that even Senator McMullan still clings to that quaint notion that somehow question time is a matter of grace and favour on behalf of the government.

These are all very important matters that go to the heart of the conduct of the chamber; they are necessary and, particularly at the start of the sittings, are part and parcel of what the public expects of this chamber. If the government cannot accept that and it cannot then decide what bills are urgent and bring them on when they need to be brought on, then it is the members of the government who are responsible. I hope that the Democrats will appreciate that. Most of all, I hope that Alan Ramsey will understand that there is a bit more to the business of this chamber than the government's inability to list the bills it wants debated.

Although some of that was essential, it was nevertheless a matter at our discretion. That is five hours.

         However, we were not being ungenerous in our measurement because of the 66 minutes of consideration of legislation, 11 minutes were spent with ministers getting up and introducing bills. About one-sixth or 16 per cent of the time, which we included in the assessment, is not the Senate considering legislation at all. I think we have been more than fair in pointing out that the Senate has fundamentally failed to discharge its legislative obligations in these sittings. I hope that it will very quickly move to correct that. We have a lot of legislation on the

This conspiracy between the government and the Democrats to undermine the standing of the Senate does this place no good, and the record ought to be corrected. Senator Kernot believes that she can make some cheap political point out of this matter but in doing so she detrimentally affects the standing of the chamber altogether. We can tell that it is simply a cheap political point by the fact that the question had been given to the minister to answer; the deal had been done.

         Let us analyse for a second or two exactly what has been happening in this chamber. Do you remember, Mr Deputy President, when we came back a month after the election, what items the government listed to be dealt with first?  We basically went for two weeks on the government's initiative: motions concerning the procedure committee reports on the consideration of appropriation bills, motions concerning the powers and functions of parliamentary secretaries, motions concerning the time limits in question time, motions reducing second reading debate speeches to 20 minutes, motions reducing the number of Senate legislative and general purpose standing committees, motions concerning debate on motions relating to answers given to questions without notice, motions relating to quorums, and so on.

         That was the priority of this government when we returned after the election—procedural matters that went for a  fortnight. It was not surprising that we objected to some matters, like reducing the number for quorums and reducing the time for speeches, because this is the chamber of debate. It is the only chamber of debate in the parliament, particularly given what has happened in the other place in the last few weeks. We objected, and that took some time. In the following two weeks we sat down in a cooperative way—notwithstanding the way we had been treated by the government—and worked through the government's legislative program, sitting late practically every night of the last two weeks of the month so its program was achieved within the one-month sitting time.

         What has happened since then? We have come back for three weeks. The first week was budget week and consisted of only three days—needless to say, taken up very much with the budget and matters surrounding the budget. But what was the highest priority of the government during that budget week?  It was the register of senators' interests, which the government was determined to push through this place and pursue. It had the highest priority. On the top of the list every day in budget week was that item—not a legislative item, a procedural item.

         Then Senator Chamarette brought on her motion on cut-offs. Every frontbencher on the other side got up to debate that, a motion that was simply designed to make the parliamentary process work better. That was the first week. Then we came back for the second week. Two of the four days were taken up with estimates committees, Mr Deputy President—and I remind you that that is part of the legislative process in this place. You cannot take out estimates and say that is not dealing with legislation; that is an integral part of the legislative process.

We are anxious to see the program dealt with properly, in an appropriate order. We have as much interest in that as the government. The government has to learn to manage the show properly.

We will talk to them about the program and see whether in a cooperative way their program can be put in order so that we can deal with it sensibly. That is what we are prepared to do.

         That the Senate take note of the additional answer given by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter on 2 September 1993 relating to petrol.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I am pleased that Senator Schacht has informed himself on the question of the addition of alcohol to petrol as an octane enhancer and as a way in which we could completely eliminate lead from petrol. In his answer today he observed that if we follow the course on which we are now embarked, lead will not be removed from petrol before the year 2002 and that by then production will no longer be economic. I am quite sure that even then, in 2002, there will still be some people driving older cars that will need to use some octane enhancer.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I just want to pick up two points with respect to Senator Schacht's otherwise excellent answer. Firstly, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Institute of Petroleum has claimed that there are economic and technical disadvantages that outweigh the possible benefits in the short term, including problems in producing and distributing sufficient ethanol, in dealing with water in ethanol and with corrosion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, one should not be surprised that the Australian Institute of Petroleum should be averse to the replacement of roughly 10 per cent of the fuel, which it currently imports and sells, with a different source of fuel. It has very much a vested interest in selling as much petroleum as it possibly can. Senator Schacht needs to deal with those claims from that quarter with a certain degree of circumspection.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I note that when Manildra, a company in the south east of New South Wales, produced a large amount of ethanol from wheat starch and sought to put that into ethanol, the manager of that company approached one of the oil companies to see whether it would take the ethanol on board and use it as a fuel. The oil company said that it would get back to him. When he approached two other oil companies it became clear to him that the first oil company had already approached the other two and that they were intent on blocking the use of ethanol as an addition to fuel.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The manager then went ahead and actually bought a service station and proceeded to offer the ethanol petrol mix to the public, whereupon the remaining major supplier of petrol undertook to buy as much ethanol as he could produce. That gasohol mixture is now being sold exclusively—it is the only fuel which is sold—in six service stations in southern New South Wales. They are doing very well out of it and the petrol company is continuing to sell that mix.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Schacht mentioned—and I am pleased to note this—that the government has offered $2 million for the development of a plant to make ethanol out of cellulosic wastes. That grant will be matched dollar for dollar—so the amount will be $4 million. The technology to do that is already quite well advanced. This raises one of the other very significant arguments which have been brought against the use of ethanol—namely, the energy required to actually make the ethanol available.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The technology which is being developed involves the separation of the ethanol from dilute fermentation mashes without the use of distillation. It involves a method of preparation which not only separates the ethanol but also provides in floccular form the cellulosic wastes which are left over. These can then be used as a fuel which can reconcentrate the solutions which are used in the extraction. So it is a totally energy self-sufficient process. I think that other objection to the use of ethanol, which the minister did not mention, has already been addressed and has been overcome. So again I would press the government to go ahead with this as quickly as possible.

       Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations

       To the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:

       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.

      <para font-size="-=2">
       We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.

        The wine industry is a particularly South Australian industry, but it is contributed to very substantially by Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania and even the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland. I have been to wineries in nearly all of these states and have enjoyed some of their produce. This industry is not peculiarly a South Australian industry; as I say, it is an Australian one.

         It has one other very special characteristic at the moment: compared with just about any other Australian industry, it is enjoying the most phenomenal increase in exports. For those who are not familiar with the details, I will provide some. In 1986 Australia exported 10 million litres of wine. In 1993 it has jumped to 103 million litres. The value of those exports in 1986 was $20 million. The value of those exports in 1993 is $289 million. As people like my colleague Senator Ferguson, who is here today, will tell you, that is one of the most dramatic increases in exports of any industry in Australia. Coming from South Australia, as does Senator Ferguson, I cannot resist saying that this was particularly contributed to by my state.

         Three-quarters of Australian wine is currently consumed on the domestic market. That should tell us that this massive move into exports has been perhaps the greatest public relations exercise for Australian industry that has ever been undertaken. It does not matter how much someone increases their exports in, for example, furniture. That is not going to go on every table around the globe. If someone increases exports in some sort of computer software, that is a very valuable sort of thing but it is not a public relations exercise that reaches the tables of individual people around the globe. What we have here is a fantastic public relations exercise. People can buy a little bit of Australia, take it home, put it on the table and enjoy it with their meal. If you like, bottled wine represents the spirit of Australia that one can purchase at the local wine store.

         With this phenomenal export increase, we find that those opposite want to increase the sales tax on this industry by 55 per cent; they want to jump it up from 20 per cent to 31 per cent without warning. Senator Sherry, who is not here, is the next speaker in this debate. He was telling this chamber the other day that he had consultations on this matter with the industry before and after the budget. I hope he takes the opportunity in his speech to tell us whom exactly he did consult with about this increase prior to the budget. The information the industry has which has been passed on to us is that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) found out about this increase being imposed at 6 o'clock on budget night.

         If the government does not want to listen to what people on this side of the chamber have to say about the devastating effect that this tax increase will have on exports, I think we could turn to the Premier of South Australia—one of the last Labor premiers. He will not be there for much longer if Senator Ferguson and other South Australian senators have their way. If all South Australians had their way, he would be gone by now—if he had the guts to call an election. He turned the State Bank into a disaster. He turned the entire state into a disaster. Desperately clinging to power, he finally came to his senses and thought, `I have been sent down the chute by my federal colleagues. They do not care what happens in South Australia'. In relation to the most recent study on this matter which was released in South Australia last week, the Premier of South Australia, Mr Arnold, said that the study made it clear the federal government had made the wrong decision.

         I say to Senator Sherry that the Labor premier of South Australia is telling the Labor federal government that it has made a mistake. This is what it really comes down to. Who is the government going to listen to? I do not mind if it does  not listen to us, it never does. That is why the country is in such a mess. Perhaps it should listen to Premier Arnold. He is, after all, one of theirs. He went on to say:

        I presume `our concerns' means the concerns of the Labor Party in South Australia. But when I look over at those empty benches, even if I can imagine a South Australian senator sitting there, I cannot imagine that senator crossing this floor to support us, to support the Democrats who I understand will support this tax not being imposed—albeit with a caveat on it for 12 months—and to support, possibly, the Greens. If that is what the South Australian Labor Party thinks, let us see the South Australian Labor senators put their money where their mouths are.

         If the government does not want to listen to what we say about an investment decline, it might like to look at an independent report which will be released this afternoon by KPMG Peat Marwick showing that investment decisions in this industry—the industry that has had such a dramatic export increase—will decrease by $400 million to $500 million. A massive export drive in the wine industry cannot be funded unless it is coupled with a successful investment program. We just cannot produce more grapes from the same acreage every year; we have to have more plantings, more equipment and more vats—the lot.

We will see a reduction in investment of $400 million to $500 million—a downturn in investment of half a billion dollars. If for some reason the government does not like KPMG Peat Marwick, it can turn to the Elton Mayo School of Management in South Australia which has put out a paper entitled `The adverse effect of increased wholesale sales tax on the competitive advantage of the Australian wine industry'. It has three things to say that I would like to mention. First:

        We accept that. Most of us have read good parts, if not all, of Michael Porter's book. Someone on the government side has probably given members of the government a briefing of some sort.

        So it is not looking too good at that point. The two points made are: firstly, that the domestic market does impact on the capacity to export; and, secondly, this change will produce an investment downfall. The third point is probably the most important point—the point that the wine industry says the government just does not understand. It is:

It has managed to increase exports under increased taxes before and it follows that it will be able to do it again'. With the greatest of respect to Mr Gittins, that argument is like the one run by the chicken when there were 20 chickens in the yard. Every time the farmer came in and took another chicken, the chicken said, `See, he proves it every time; he doesn't want to cut off my head'. He kept saying that until he was the last chicken in the yard. That is what Mr Gittins is doing; he is saying, `It has all worked before; it follows that it will continue to work'. It does not follow like that at all. The industry has tried its very best. It has burnt the midnight oil to accommodate the cost increases that came with an increase in sales tax in 1986—another unannounced increase in sales tax, which I had the pleasure of voting against at the time.

They have done that, and their reward for that effort from this government—from Senator Sherry and his colleagues—is a 55 per cent increase in the tax yet again.

We can produce better wines than the French. There is no doubt about that; we can do it, and we do it, with some regularity.

         The government admits that there will be some downfall in the domestic market. We could argue until the cows come home what percentage it will be. The crucial point is that the truth of the matter is that when there is a downturn in the domestic wine industry market, investment in the wine industry is reduced. There is no way that the industry can go on with its planned dramatic increase in exports unless it has that investment. The regional impact on grape growers and small wineries is that they will be put out of business, especially in my state but in some other regions as well.

         Why, one might ask, pick on the wine industry as opposed to the beer or spirit industries? I notice that Mr Gittins made some comment about this in his article. Whenever it is desperate, Labor drags out the equality issue and says, `Why should wine be treated any differently?'. There is every reason why it should be treated differently—it has been a responsible industry all along. The wine industry started the `Drink in Moderation' campaign. That campaign has been very effective. The wine industry is a responsible industry and does not deserve to be treated the same as others which, perhaps, in the past have not been as responsible.

         I note a survey done in 1989, and I do not know that our drinking patterns have changed that dramatically since then. It showed that, yes, more people drink wine than beer on a reasonably regular basis—that is true—but the percentage of those who drink at heavy or very heavy levels is dramatically higher for beer drinkers. Ask members of the medical profession whether the problem with alcohol abuse lies primarily with beer or wine and, if they are informed and honest, they will say that it lies primarily with beer.

Six hundred small winemakers, all employing a number of people and paying for some packaging, printing, labelling and bottling; and 5,000 independent growers.

For the same costs, it will be producing less for the domestic market. That means that some may be encouraged into some sort of quality degradation to keep up with their export demand; they will cover costs by slightly lessening quality here and there.

He has to choose between one or the other. I look forward to hearing that argument.

         Firstly, Senator Vanstone referred to the attitude of the Premier of South Australia, Mr Arnold, and his position in opposing this tax. The Premier of South Australia represents a constituency in South Australia. This parliament represents a national constituency. It comes as no surprise to me that the Premier of South Australia is opposed to the increase in sales tax. Last year, when we had a debate on resource security in the Tasmanian context, the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, berated Tasmanian Liberal senators for not crossing the floor on the issue of resource security.

         Premiers represent their own constituency. It is a more limited constituency than a national government, and rightly so.

         The second point that Senator Vanstone raises is the issue of why the South Australian Labor senators are not here to listen to this debate.

If members of the public are listening to this debate I want them to understand that the norm in all parliamentary debates in this place is that it is very rare for all senators to be in the chamber, and extremely rare for all senators from one state to be here, even if the issue has some particular importance to that state.

That is a dangerous argument to tread because to some extent all producers of alcohol are irresponsible. Alcohol is a drug and its producers are in there to make a profit. Frankly, I do not distinguish between the wine industry, the beer industry or the whisky industry because at the end of the day they are all there to make money. It is alcohol; it is a legal drug. I do not think it is particularly wise to say that one producer of alcohol is ethnically or morally superior to another producer of alcohol.

         I turn to the central elements in this debate. Firstly, the reference to a 55 per cent increase in sales tax. As I said on a previous occasion, the tax is being increased from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. It is important to understand what the final effect is on the retail price of a bottle of wine or a cask of wine. The opposition keeps giving the impression that the final price will go up by 55 per cent; that is not correct. The price of a $10 bottle of wine is estimated to go up by between $1 and $1.50 retail. The price of a $20 bottle of wine is estimated to go up by between $1.50 and $2. At the end of the day, it is nothing like a 55 per cent increase in the final price of the retail product.

Domestic sales of wine grew from 320 million litres in 1984-85 to 331 million litres in 1987-88. Sales declined gradually, after the 1988-89 budget tax cuts on low alcohol beer, to a floor of 296 million litres in 1990-91. Domestic sales of wine have since recovered to reach 315 million litres in 1991-92 and 312 million litres in 1992-93, and I suggest that the slight decrease last year had something to do with the recession.

         The per capita consumption of wine, beer and spirits has also been falling over the last 10 years, at the expense of a rising soft drink consumption. I think that should tell us all—if we are not too affected by what we had to drink at lunch time—that there is a general decline in the consumption of alcoholic beverages at the expense of non-alcoholic beverages and low alcohol beverages, particularly beer. In fact, full strength beer consumption fell by 22 1/2 per cent over the last decade, whereas light beer consumption increased. I think that does put the statistics in some sort of context.

         The third issue I want to mention is investment. The argument of those opposite is that we need a profitable, strong domestic market in order to expand and obtain capital in order to obtain the investment to export. As I said earlier, in the wine industry 80 to 90 per cent of Australia's production is dominated by four large companies. It is very similar to the beer industry in that respect.

         The interesting issue is that those four large wine companies do lead the export drive, as Senator Vanstone has admitted. They have not had a great deal of difficulty in attracting investment. Since the budget BRL Hardy announced it would outline a three-year $75 million vineyard development program within the next few months. South Australian Brewing announced that its wine division, not its beer division, would benefit from $100 to $150 million of capital expenditure planned for the next few years. This is all post budget.

It is introducing a 10 per cent general investment allowance to address the run-down in capital equipment in agriculture. This will also assist the wine industry because the production of wine is in part an agricultural production.

        It may surprise the opposition to know that these major rationalisations amongst wine companies over the past 10 years in order to make themselves more efficient, in order to boost investment, in order to introduce new technology and in order to improve productivity, have meant the loss of hundreds of jobs in the wine industry. So job loss in this industry is nothing new. Frankly, it is to be expected. The opposition is claiming that further job reductions will occur over the next five, 10 or however many years we care to look at. There will be further job reductions, but they will not be because of this tax measure; they will be because the investment and the rationalisation in this industry will continue to go on as they have over the past 10 years. It is totally dishonest for the opposition to claim that job losses are the result of the wine tax when they are not. They are the result of an ongoing rationalisation in the industry which is occurring anyway. That is stated on the second page of the executive summary.

The other issue in this document—and it is quite interesting that no-one opposite has yet mentioned it—is the devaluation of the Australian dollar. It is one of the factors to which the industry attributes the important expansion of the wine industry over the past 10 years. I put on record the fact that the industry has done a very good job. It has exported; it has successfully sold its product overseas—with some help from the Australian government in the form of research dollars, marketing dollars, et cetera. The industry has done a very good job, but it does acknowledge the devaluation of the Australian dollar relative to the currencies of other wine producing countries since 1985. It is nice to hear that the devaluation has been of some assistance to the export value of Australian wine. We have only to look at the devaluation of the Australian dollar in the last week or two. The return to wine exporters has improved because of that devaluation. That will be a major stimulus for the export of wine. That is a point made in the executive summary of this document to which Senator Vanstone referred in her speech.

We will be striving to reduce the deficit in the budget to as low an amount as we can over the next four years—to about one to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product. Unfortunately, some increased tax measures are necessary in that package. We do not resile from that because that is the responsible way to do it.

         —The Senate is debating the urgent need for the government to ensure the continuing viability of the wine industry by deferring, or certainly not proceeding with this year, the increase in sales tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. Before I deal with the substantive arguments, I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) that the Australian Democrats have been thoroughly consistent on this issue rather than, as he claimed, inconsistent. We have voted against the previous attempts of the government to impose a wine tax, the latest being in 1986 when the opposition—with one exception; that of Senator Vanstone—voted for the increase in the tax on wine. While Senator Vanstone's action was very honourable, it did not carry sufficient weight to move the opposition to join with the Democrats to stop this pernicious tax on one of the most effective growth industries that Australia has.

         Our objection was then, and is now, that this tax is being imposed as a revenue raiser without any consideration of the effect it will have on the industry, without regard for the economic and social consequences, and without any regard as to how it fits into an industry plan for this or any other industry. The truth is that this government does not have a positive, constructive, strategic industry policy.

         As I have said before, the Australian wine industry is one of the success stories in Australia's industrial development. We are told that Australia's economic salvation lies in exports and I would like to refer to that aspect of the wine industry. Exports have increased from around 40 million litres in 1988-89 to 103 million litres in 1992-93. In real terms, wine exports increased by 130 per cent in that period. In 1992-93 the value of production in Australian dollars was $289 million. But the growth of the industry is exponential. The annual volume is expected to reach $1 billion by the year 2000.

         However, exports are only a small part of the wine production in this country. The domestic market takes three-quarters of the wine production. Australia is still a small producer in world terms, taking something like two per cent of world production and trade. Our inroads into overseas markets therefore are dependent not only on acknowledged excellent quality—and I would say it is much better than French or other overseas wines—but also on the cost of production.

         It is a matter of record that the cost of production has been lowered in recent years to put the industry on a highly competitive basis. I would remind Senator Sherry that that merely places the industry in a better position to employ more people in the future, as the projections for the year 2000 clearly show. It is also quite clear that in the last few years the industry has been assisted by the progressive devaluation of the Australian dollar. In many ways this argument—and a lot of weight was placed on it by Senator Sherry—does not alter the basic proposition that this tax has been imposed on an industry without consultation and without consideration of its effects on production right here and now or on the development of this industry in the next few years.

         It is a matter of record that the growing of premium grapes has increased from 36 per cent in 1985-86 to 44 per cent in 1986-87. It is also a matter of record that export wines predominantly use premium grapes, whereas domestic consumption is mainly based on non-premium grapes. We know that about 72 per cent of domestic sales are in casks and flagons, which clearly identifies the quality level of these sales. The important point to be made about these figures is that the two markets are not readily interchangeable. It may have been expected by the government—and clearly the government has not considered this carefully—that wine produced from grapes grown for the domestic market, the demand for which will inevitably decline if this tax is imposed, can be switched to the international market. Clearly, that will not be possible.

         Make no mistake about it: demand for wine will certainly decrease. When the 20 per cent sales tax on wine was introduced in 1986, against the opposition of the Democrats and with the support of the Liberal and National party coalition, per capita consumption decreased from 22 litres to 18 litres in 1990-91, a decline of almost 20 per cent. It took another year to show a slight increase to 19 litres per capita in 1991-92. The proposed increase in sales tax by 11 per cent will translate into a price increase of 9.1 per cent, which in turn will translate into a medium-to long-term decrease in demand of 12.7 per cent, according to research commissioned by the South Australian government and carried out by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies.

         As I have said before, it is quite clear that investment in the wine industry is not mobile. To establish a vineyard one needs to find and select suitable land; engage in thorough site preparation; and arrange water supply or irrigation. There are at least three years between planting and the first harvest of grapes, and between seven and 10 years before one can expect the vines to reach their full potential. We have a situation in which wine growers will find that their product is no longer acceptable on the domestic market and that their grapes are not suitable for export wine because they are not premium grapes. What are these wine growers to do?  Should they pull up their vines? Should they perhaps hope that at some future stage they will be able to replant with vines that produce premium grapes? If growers did pull up their vines—and I believe that would be a logical consequence—the devastation would be worse than the phylloxera which devastated vineyards in the 1870s in Victoria. Wine growers could be excused if they christened our Prime Minister `Phylloxera Paul'.

         It will also affect a most important ingredient—confidence. I refer to confidence in the future of their industry, confidence in their government which could make such a decision on the basis of the still very scant information, a decision which will jeopardise the future of one of Australia's most promising industries. And here is the nub of the argument: the decision was made as a revenue raiser and obviously without consideration of the factors which determine the industry's success or failure. In that, it follows the miserable tradition of the tariff cutting regime—sink or swim.

         With this government measure we have another example of that tradition. Someone in Finance or Treasury saw a disparity in government revenue between the rate imposed on beer and the rate imposed on wine and forgot to look at the large scale manufacturing beer brewing industry able to sell its products on a cash basis virtually as soon as they leave the assembly line, and the winegrower and vintner, the many small producers who are labour intensive and who require time for storage and skilful marketing in the home market and, more particularly, overseas. So we have a total disregard of the character of this industry, of its potential and of its future.

         The Australian Democrats reject totally this ad hoc, marauding approach to industry policy. It is clear that the Australian Government is not prepared to construct and pursue a considered, goal directed industry policy in the wine industry or in any other industry. We believe that this must change. The Democrats' concept of a positive industry policy is for the government to consult with producers and workers in each industry sector and to balance this with independent objective research to maximise the capacity of the industry, to lift its productive capacity, to enable it to compete against imports in the domestic market and against all comers in the international arena.

         It is for this reason that the Democrats will vote against the imposition of the additional 11 per cent sales tax on wine this year, and this is why we are prepared to have another look at the matter at the end of this financial year, when this consultation has been done, when this research, including by the regional development task force, has been completed, and when the effect of various levels of taxation on the future of the industry has been clearly established. More importantly, we will combine this with an assessment of what needs to be done not just to maintain but to increase the viability of the Australian wine industry. I confirm and repeat that we will vote against the wine tax to be imposed by this government.

         Tax, as such, is an increased amount payable to government, and that means an increased cost of production to wineries. The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies, as Senator Spindler indicated, showed that there would be results in the retail price increase of at least nine per cent. It is through the production of wine from non-premium grape varieties for the domestic market that significant economies of scale can be obtained in production and packaging that enable Australian wine to be produced at a competitive cost on world markets.

         If domestic sales fall—and they will with an increase of nine per cent in retail prices—effects on the industry will be significant. Economies of scale obtained in production and packaging enabling Australian wine to be produced at a competitive cost on world markets will no longer apply because profits from the burgeoning domestic sector will not be applicable. Overseas consumers, notably in the UK, where we export 44 per cent of our wine, look at wine critically when it is before them on the supermarket shelves. They have a choice of US, French and Australian wine and they will buy the wine that suits their pockets.

         —Senator Sherry should listen to what I am saying. This argument goes on and has a logical conclusion. Up till now, Australian wines have been presented at a realistic cost. Over 90 per cent of Australian wine sold in the UK sells for between 300 and 500 pence per bottle. Less than five per cent of Australian wine is sold for over 500 pence per bottle. There is a limited room for the margins to be squeezed before the market ceases to be profitable. Therefore, if domestic sales are reduced there will a limited margin for Australian wine exporters to send their wine overseas.

         As cited by Senator Spindler, there were 301 wineries in Australia in 1982, increasing to 739 wineries by 1993. Even with some cross ownership, there are seven major producers and a proliferation of smaller producers. Given the higher production costs associated with the smaller levels of production, smaller wineries have to market their wine very competitively. With an estimated 16 per cent increase in winery costs as a result of this tax measure, they will need to be very competitive indeed.

For many small wineries, such a decline in sales will be unsustainable in the long run.

         Employment in these areas is particularly important. Casual seasonal work provides additional income for rural families. At a time when many farm incomes are at a zero or negative level, the working vineyards and wineries give rural people, particularly women—and I will detail this more in a moment—a chance to make extra income for their families. Wine is one of the few growth areas in rural Australia at the moment and it deserves every encouragement. Given the government's avowed commitment to jobs, and particularly its supposed commitment to maintaining and improving employment opportunities for women, I believe that the regressive nature of the increase in the wholesale sales tax is immediately apparent.

         I would now like to examine in reasonable detail the operation of a small winery in my home area of Victoria. In the global statistics that were presented by Senator Sherry he seems to have forgotten the human element in which there are people working in vineyards and families supported by them. I base my remarks on the Crawford River winery, which is south of Hamilton in the south west of Victoria, run by the Thomson family. It is a typical small winery whose success is based on quality products and diversity from the big four wineries. The tax will particularly affect these types of wineries because of the price impact on their wines. Medium to high value wines can be expected to rise by $1 to $1.50 per bottle. This is laughed off by the government as not being a significant factor in the way consumers purchase wine.

         —Yes, Senator Sherry laughed it off. I can tell him that there is a point at which consumers will stop buying wine. It is most unfortunate for the smaller wineries if their share of the market is restricted because of this. However, since the sales tax was introduced in 1986, Crawford River has not increased its prices in an attempt to arrest the fall in consumption resulting from the tax. As Senator Spindler detailed, wine consumption fell from 21.5 litres per capita in 1985 to under 18 litres in 1990 and has only just recently picked up again to 18.5 litres. Another tax increase will postpone any non-tax price rises and further squeeze profit margins that have been shrinking from falling volumes.

         During a vintage Crawford River employs 20 to 30 pickers, the large majority of whom are female. Given that the nearest small town has a population of some 100 people, the impact of that income addition means increased economic security for a large number of families in that area. The Seppelt's winery at Drumborg, slightly further south, employs between 70 and 80 pickers and pruners during a vintage—and again the overwhelming majority are female. Other than seasonal work with vineyards, there is very little casual work available for rural women. This scenario is repeated again and again in the winegrowing areas of Victoria such as those that I have already detailed.

         I would also like to point out that because smaller vineyards have restricted their investment in machinery and therefore employ large numbers of people, there is an even greater effect on employment in these areas. It is particularly important that they be allowed to continue those operations. Boutique wineries tend to be more labour intensive; the picking and pruning is done by hand rather than by machines. As a result, any fall in volumes from these types of vineyards will have a disproportionately high employment effect. I certainly join with my colleagues in emphasising the importance of this urgency motion and ask the Senate to adopt it.

         Tax increases of any sort are never popular. Politicians can always win themselves some cheap popularity by opposing them. On this occasion the opponents had a good argument: the Government's proposed increases in indirect tax were regressive. But that's not true of the wine tax.

        Of all the budget measures, perhaps the most progressive is the wholesale sales tax on wine. Because it is a wholesale sales tax, the higher the product's price the higher the tax per unit of alcohol. There are big variations in wine prices. For example, let us take a four-litre cask of wine, which costs on average $7, and the same amount of Grange hermitage, about 5.3 750 ml bottles, which costs about $450. There is a big variation in prices according to the quality of the wine. A 31 per cent wholesale sales tax on the former, the four-litre cask of wine, will add 42c to the price. The 31 per cent wholesale sales tax on the latter, the same amount of Grange hermitage—5.3 bottles or, again, as close as you can get to four litres—would add about $27. The tax is clearly progressive, yet the Democrats are prepared to forego an extra $27 tax collected for that unit of alcohol at the top end of the market because of the 42c tax at the lower end of the market, which just does not make sense in terms of their social justice arguments.

         To take the analysis further, the cheapest bottle of wine—at, say, $4—would increase in price by about 20c a bottle. A medium level wine—at, say, $15—would increase by roughly 78c a bottle. Each of these figures assumes that producers pass on all the increases. History has shown that in fact that is not what happens; only part of the increase is usually passed on and sometimes none of it is passed on, as in 1986.

         Importantly, if we are talking about equity and progressivity, why should wine drinkers pay far less tax than beer or spirit drinkers? How is that fair by any standard? Because beer and spirits, unlike wine, are subject to wholesale sales tax and excise, they are taxed at a far higher rate than wine. Raising sales tax on wine from 20 per cent, which was the same level as soft drinks, to 31 per cent goes some way to closing this gap but only a small part of the way. Even with the increases in tax on wine, the wine industry enjoys a massive comparative advantage over both beer and spirits.

         If these taxes are passed by the parliament—at present it is certainly looking as if they will not be passed by this chamber but they may be as members and senators become more economically responsible later in the game—the effective tax on alcoholic beverages, including excise, for the same quantity of alcohol would be 201 per cent for spirits, 80 per cent for beer and 31 per cent for wine. There is a big disparity still remaining regardless of the increase in the tax. So no argument against the tax has anything to do with progressivity, the application of social justice principles or any sense of fairness or equity. These arguments advocate taxing one group of drinkers more heavily than another based simply on their tastes and nothing more.

That is utter nonsense. These other industries are equally important, particularly the brewing industry, which has had significant export successes. I say this even though, as I have said, I am a supporter of the wine industry and would not like to see it suffer in any way as a result of any action of the government.

The industry suggests that it does and the opposition is just parroting the industry, so it seems that it is supporting its view. The industry argues that successful exports demand a substantial domestic market from which to spring. It needs as a springboard a big domestic market which is successful. I do not argue with that point either and it might make sense if it were not for the fact that the big four wine companies in Australia, despite the figures that we are given about the number of small winegrowers around the country, produce 80 per cent of the wine.

         It is clear that the wine industry today is not any longer a fledgling industry or a cottage industry. To the degree that it is, it is only at the margins. There might be lots of small wineries around but they are not the ones that are currently doing the exporting in the volumes that are going to be important. It might make sense if the wine producers were finding it difficult to attract investment but they are not, as Senator Sherry has already pointed out.

         There should be, rightfully, concern at the estimated $1.2 billion that the industry needs in investment to meet its target of $1 billion worth of exports by the year 2000. But, again, as Senator Sherry has already pointed out, the BRL Hardy float, the South Australian Brewing Company wine division plans for the future and the floats in a number of smaller companies, all successful in recent months, attest to the fact that they are not having any trouble raising finance, and I predict that they will not in the future.

         The industry is also aided by government initiatives: the reduction already announced in the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent; and the 10 per cent general investment allowance which is designed to address the run-down in agricultural equipment. Both of these commitments will assist the industry in a positive way. They show the government's support for industry policy, which Senator Spindler brought into question in his argument.

But even here, according to the Tasman Institute report—and the Tasman Institute is a very conservative institute—cask wine will face a decline in sales of only 3.8 per cent; bottled wine, on the other hand, is estimated to face a decline of only 1.3 per cent, which is less than the decline expected to be faced by spirits.

         It also has to be said that previous increases in the tax on wine, both in 1984 and 1986, have not, despite what the opposition claims, had the disastrous effects predicted. There was a fall in consumption for a period, but that fall was paralleled by a fall in consumption in other alcoholic beverages; it was a fall due more to health choices than to price.

Ninety per cent of sales come from big wineries but Helm's Wines is one of those smaller wineries which is having a very tough time of it. Exports are not available to these people because the return on the average sale overseas is only $3 a litre, and that is too low to cover their production costs. What the measures of those opposite will do is put those production costs up so that they will never get into the export market. We have the situation where smaller wineries have to give quite a lot of their wine away at shows and exhibitions—which they are taxed on and which reduces their profit even further. That sort of winery will go out of business under this government's measures.

But we can go beyond that. What actually would the urgency motion accomplish if carried? Does it have an impact upon policy? Does it have an objective that is either stated or implied from reading between the lines as to what the policy framework ought to be in respect of the Australian wine industry?  Is there an alternative? Is there a suggestion that guarantees the Commonwealth revenue? Again, the answers to all these essential, fundamental questions have to be in the negative.

         Is the proposition based on equity? Is there an equity consideration at heart? The answer to that is clearly no. Is there an efficiency concern? Again, the answer to that is clearly no. Does it give any indication whatsoever of an alternative coalition policy? Again, the answer to that must be no. Is it based on fact? Is it based on a reality in the Australian wine industry? Is it based on perceptions of realities—well, the answer to that might be in the affirmative—or is it based on what the opposition would like to believe is the reality?

         Overwhelmingly the answers to those propositions, with the exception of the penultimate and ultimate questions, have to be in the negative. It is for that reason alone, in my view, that the Senate ought to say no to the proposition. It is not an urgency motion that ought to enjoy majority support. That is my view. I really believe that there ought be to some constructive element in a motion of this kind; there should be some purpose in the proposition.

         Part of the duty of this chamber is to show a capacity to indicate a policy framework, to indicate policy goals, to indicate policy objectives. That is nowhere present in this urgency motion, as is the case time and time again with proposals that come before the chamber. Urgency motions give us an acute insight into opposition thinking, into what is in the collective mind of the coalition. As Mr Beazley said just the other day, the opposition in the Senate is bent upon cherry picking proposals that it likes and cherry picking proposals that it does not like—for endorsement or defeat. That is worthy of the United States Senate under Presidents Reagan and Bush. They cherry picked all the time. That is why the American budget was in the dire consequence it was in when Bill Clinton was elected. Cherry picking occurred in the Senate and in the House of Representatives in Washington.

         Essentially, it is a negative approach to politics; it is a negative approach to legislation; and it is a negative approach to urgency motions. It lacks a purpose and it is defeatist in the sense that what the urgency motions say is that all change happens to be wrong, no matter what it seeks to do, no matter in what context it is operating, and no matter what the perspective of the government is. We have seen that for several weeks, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you are aware, as everyone on this side of the chamber is aware, and as the Democrats—Senator Kernot made this clear at question time—are aware. All we have seen from the opposition is delay, frustration and obstruction. Those opposite have become the guardians of gridlock in the Australian political system. That is how they are increasingly going to be seen by the Australian community. We have seen virtually no legislation being dealt with by the chamber. Senator Sherry might correct me, but I think we have spent less than 70 minutes in total, day after day, on legislation.

         Let us be candid about the approach that the coalition takes. It is saying that considerations of the Commonwealth revenue count for nothing, that budget strategy counts for nothing, that deficit reduction strategy over the ensuing four or five years counts for nothing. Day in and day out we have seen the impact of opposition thinking on the money markets. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, let us pin the villainy where it lies.

         There is no doubt that the opposition's approach is flawed. The propositions before the country in terms of the government's legislative measures are simply based on equity. There is no doubt about that. Prior to 1984, there is no question that Australian wine drinkers enjoyed a privileged position. There is no question that the tax changes in 1984, in 1986 and, indeed, in 1993 still mean that, overwhelmingly, wine drinkers enjoy a privileged position. In seven years of Fraser government we saw no action based on equity in terms of the wine industry. The government's proposition is an equity proposition.

         We have heard all these dire predictions of terrible consequences if the government's measure is embraced by the parliament. Look at the record. Exports of Australian wine between the years 1985-86 and 1992-93 grew from a mere $21 million—a base figure of only $21 million—to $289 million. That is an enormous increase and that is a matter of fact. The dire predictions of those opposite were made in 1984 and 1986. They simply did not materialise and they will not materialise.

         I have no doubt that the $1 billion figure the industry has struck for itself in terms of exports by the turn of the century will be realised. This is an industry that markets itself on the basis of diversification, quality, sensible marketing strategies abroad, endeavour and innovation. There is no question about that. That has been the hallmark of the Australian wine industry. No doubt, we will see growth of similar dimensions in the years leading up to the turn of the century. As people have made clear earlier, the McKinsey report, the drop in the corporate tax rate, and a whole range of measures will assist the industry in its period of adjustment. The $1 billion is a reasonable figure that has been struck for export markets by the year 2,000 or so. I think it is achievable.

         The government has been prepared to be fair and reasonable in dealings with the industry. In 1984 the wholesale sales tax rate was struck at 10 per cent; in 1986 it became 20 per cent. We are now seeing another increase that is based on equity, looking towards the whole range of beverages that are available to the Australian community. Despite the propaganda that has issued from some Liberal and National Party senators and some people in the other place, this tax does not apply to exports at all. The urgency motion is fatally flawed in terms of its logic. It has no impact whatsoever on exports of Australian wine.

         The Australian wine industry flourished and grew, as I made clear earlier when reading the figures to the chamber, between 1985-86 and the current year. It continues to flourish and grow. We have seen evidence of investor confidence in the industry with the amalgamations that have been taking place and with the float of Hardys and the like. A number of small winemakers have also been successful in attracting investor confidence. The capital investment is there for the industry to grow. I believe the doomsayers will be proved wrong yet again. The urgency motion deserves to be defeated.

         —in reply—I do not want to take up much time but, really, the arguments put by Senator Loosley display the baselessness of this government. The argument was put that members of my party are a bunch of vandals because they are choosing which budget bills they will and will not support. Senator Loosley conveniently overlooks the historical involvement of his party in the last years of the Fraser government and the attitude his party took at that time to budget bills. It is a case of saying one thing one day and another thing the next, whatever is most convenient, whatever gets it into power.

         Similarly, Senator Loosley speaks on behalf of a government which went to the people opposing increases in consumption taxes. Once having gained power, it increased them. He speaks on behalf of a government which promised tax cuts and then delayed them. He speaks on behalf of a government that ran against any extra charges on students and then sought to impose them.

         Our argument is simply this: an increased tax on wine will reduce domestic demand. It will increase industry costs because less wine will be produced at the same cost. It will reduce investment in the industry as wine production will be less attractive. The consequential effect of that will be the industry's incapacity to fund new plantings and winery upgrades, which it will need to do to meet its export drive. There will be a serious risk of quality degradation as people put in lesser quality grapes to try to cover the costs incurred domestically. Export prices will be put at risk because there will be a need to recoup the added costs the industry will experience as a consequence of both reduced demand and other increased sales taxes.

         As I have pointed out, the export market we are in is a very fragile one. We cannot keep saying, `You are doing well. It will be all right; you can take on more costs'. Eventually that has an impact and the whole thing falls apart. That is something those opposite simply do not understand. It does not surprise me that this comes from a government that basically lied to people at the last election and, no doubt, will continue to do so.

          —I thank the Senate for agreeing to deal with this motion formally and, I hope, to agreeing to the motion to refer this matter to a committee. Most senators will have received submissions from many constituents on the potentially horrendous effects of the proposed fringe benefits tax on business hotel accommodation and travel. The proposal to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure will give the industry, unions and others directly affected by the proposal the opportunity of explaining in detail how the fringe benefits tax on business travel will mean a loss of jobs—some 10,000, or five per cent of the entire industry; the destruction of future employment prospects; and the stopping of investment—there is evidence of $29 million worth of capital investment projects disappearing already.

          The fringe benefits tax will mean a regressive tax measure which will fall more heavily on smaller and less wealthy businesses; and it will mean an estimated 50 per cent reduction in the convention revenue—in the vicinity of $650 million—meaning exporting Australian business to Singapore, Bali and Hong Kong, further eroding the profitability of the industry. It will mean more regulation and, therefore, cost to business, estimated to mean by this measure alone an increase, for example, in Sydney of between 34 to 49 per cent in the cost of securing hotel accommodation and in country areas even more than that. Businesses are already burdened by the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee level, payroll tax, workers compensation, sales tax and withholding tax, to name just a few.

          Even the former ALP minister and tourism flunkey, John Brown, has recognised the real difficulties which will flow from the implementation of the tax and has suggested alternatives such as an increase in the departure tax. Interestingly, John Brown gave the real reason for this proposal when he said that it was `an antiquated philosophical dogma of the ALP, whereby Labor appears to have ceased its social maturation process and reverted to the worst aspect of envy and class warfare'.

In a democracy it is essential that those whose investments are threatened, those whose jobs are threatened and those who understand the part that tourism and related accommodation and travel play in Australia's export earnings are given the opportunity of putting their case forward.

        This matter was discussed again at last Thursday's estimates hearing. We provided information about the costing arrangements for the diesel rebate scheme's administration. In regard to the timing of the decisions relating to the administrative charge, the decision to impose an administration charge on the diesel fuel rebate scheme was a cabinet budget decision and part of a package of measures affecting the diesel freight rebate scheme. It was and is therefore confidential, as were and are the legislative drafting instructions in relation to the package.

        As I said in the estimates committee last Thursday, I spoke to the customs officials, including the head of the department. As soon as I found out after the first hearing on 26 August that there were people present who knew, in general terms, about the need for legislation, I expressed my disappointment. I pointed out that it was unsatisfactory that none of them approached the table where I was sitting as we were having this discussion with Senator Ferguson. The head of the Customs Service accepts that it was an unsatisfactory performance.

        I have also instructed the Comptroller-General of Customs to make sure that in future at estimates hearings it is not a matter of having the quantity of officers turning up to provide advice—20 or 30 officers—but of having the right officers. I discovered at the estimates hearing only last Thursday that Mr Stephen Holloway was not at the hearing on the first Thursday. If he had been, I suspect that I would have been informed that legislation was needed. I hope that following these changes such a slip-up does not occur again.

So it was an unfortunate incident. I certainly hope that it does not happen again. We always try for perfection, and we will continue to try for it. All I know is that in this game one never gets it 100 per cent right all the time.

        This issue was first raised on Thursday, 26 August at the hearing of Senate Estimates Committee E with Department of Industry, Technology, and Regional Development representatives. I asked a series of questions under the inland revenue subprogram about the diesel fuel rebate scheme, because it was announced in the budget that an administration fee was to be charged.

        This was to be a user pays scheme equal to one per cent of the total amount rebated to miners, farmers, hospitals, nursing homes and other off-road users of diesel fuel. Customs estimated that it would be rebating over $1 billion in 1993-94 and, therefore, this tax will raise about $10 million a year.

        Prior to the hearing I sought advice about the difference between an administration fee to recover the actual administrative costs, and a tax which does not bear a direct relationship to the actual administration costs, either because the tax is more than the administration charge or because it is a percentage. My suspicion, based on information in the program performance statements, was that the so-called administration fee did not relate to the actual costs of administration and, therefore, was unconstitutional.

        I asked questions in the estimates committee hearings on 26 August on this basis. Senator Schacht initially said that he did not know whether any legal advice had been sought on the issue and, if it had, it would not have been sought by the Australian Customs Service because its role was an administrative role. He said that any legal advice would have to be sought by cabinet as part of the budget process. The

       The customs officials sat through Senator Schacht's initial comments about customs not being involved in providing legal services and did not seek to correct any of those statements. After the hour-long break, they sat through Senator Schacht's further comments about no legislation being necessary. Again, the customs officials did not seek to correct those statements. So I wondered if maybe there was a way to bring in this administration fee, which looked to me very much like a tax, without putting it into tax legislation. But what I could not accept is that no-one in the Australian Customs Service or Treasury had even considered the possibility that this might be a tax. I do not profess to be Perry Mason, but I have been on a farm long enough to know when I can smell a rat.

        In question time on Tuesday, 31 August I asked Senator McMullan, who was representing the Treasurer, why the government was trying to disguise the tax as an administration fee and stating that legislation was not necessary; whether the government was intending to introduce legislation to implement the tax; and whether a draft bill was already in circulation. I was amazed when Senator McMullan said that he did not even have a brief on this matter. I wondered how a minister representing the Treasurer could not have a brief on an important issue like a new tax. After question time, Senator McMullan gave the following answer:

       Senator McMullan's answer raises two very interesting points. Firstly, someone must have been burning the midnight oil in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, because less than five days before, Senator Schacht had said that he did not believe legislation was necessary, yet during question time Senator McMullan was able to provide the Senate with very detailed information about this new tax.

        There would not be one bill, as I thought, but two.

Obviously someone had put a lot of thought into it. I would have thought that it would have taken a lot longer than the intervening Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday to come up with that sort of detail.

       The department received details of the proposed admin fee from Treasury some days before the date of budget. That information came to me as the Director of Parliamentary Services in Customs to see what was necessary to implement that decision. It was my opinion at the time, prior to budget, on my understanding of what was being proposed by policy, that it would require a separate taxing statute. I informed the inland revenue people of that fact and instructed the Office of Parliamentary Counsel accordingly. In my discussions with the eventual drafter of the legislation, he confirmed my opinion that it would require a separate taxing statute, and it was drafted on that basis.

        At the time Senator Schacht stated that no legislation was necessary and that it was not the role of customs to seek legal advice on this matter, customs' senior legal officer, Mr Holloway, had already received instructions from Treasury to implement the administration fee, decided that a taxing statute was necessary, had discussions with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and Paul Tilley in the Treasurer's office, and issued drafting instructions to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I would like to know why Senator Schacht did not know this. Why did not Senator McMullan know this when I first asked him the question?

        I am not sure that we have got to the bottom of all this yet. I believe there are still several questions that remain unanswered. Firstly, has the Senate estimates committee been misled, whether by a minister, by departmental officers or both? Secondly, why was not Senator Schacht, as Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, provided with briefing notes on the introduction of this new tax? Thirdly, why was not Senator McMullan, as Minister representing the Treasurer, or Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, provided with briefing notes on the introduction of legislation to bring in a new tax? Did the Treasurer not know that he was introducing a new tax?

Why did someone not say something? Were they unsure, as Senator Schacht suggested? Were they wilfully withholding information from Senator Schacht, or did they feel that they could not come forward and speak to him on this particular matter? Fifthly, why did Senator Schacht not formally advise the secretary of Senate Estimates Committee E, either on Friday 27 August or on any other date between then and Thursday, 2 September, that misleading information had been provided to the committee?

          The budget that was brought down on 17 August and the subsequent amendments announced by the government—some of which I think are going through the House of Representatives tonight—will have an enormous impact on many individuals, families and industries, not just this year but in the medium term right through to 1996-97. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has released a partial modelling of the impact of the budget which almost miraculously reveals that almost everyone is better off with virtually no detriments. But that analysis is incomplete and it is also deliberately constructed so as to put the best possible light on the budget measures.

           The way that works is that the distributional analysis that has been given takes into account 1993-94, which is the only year in the four-year period in which there are tax cuts. The benefit of those tax cuts erode throughout the four-year period that the government is really concerned about. The government says that its real bottom line priority is the budget outcome in 1996-97, not the outcome in the intervening years. Yet all its modelling is on the first of those four years, not the last.

           The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made claims, as has the Treasurer, based on this modelling to argue that the budget is neither regressive nor unfair, or leaves middle or lower income households worse off. Without the information that I am seeking on behalf of the Senate in my motion, senators will be unable to form an opinion as to whether the budget is all the things that the government says that it is. In particular, is it regressive? Does it have a harmful impact on certain households or industries?

           The information that I am seeking is obtainable. Eighteen months or more ago, at the end of 1991 or early 1992, this modelling and the information that derived from the modelling were extensively used by the Treasurer and Prime Minister in their attack on the coalition's then Fightback proposals. Indeed, the Treasurer at that time put out a statement in March 1992, at which time papers were tabled by him relating to the analysis that the Treasury had done on the coalition's Fightback measures, which said, amongst other things:

          He went on to show the results of the modelling that the Treasury then did, which included the indirect tax changes that the coalition was proposing, the effects of bracket creep, a hypothetical roads charging proposal that had earlier been examined by both the coalition and the government, and illustrative households specific price effects of the health proposals that were contained in Fightback. So that was all available as a result of the modelling of Prismod back in 1991-92. The ability of the model to do the same is obviously still there. Just last week, on 31 August, the Treasury released a fairly detailed statement headed `Distributional analysis of budget measures'. The first line of the press release said:

          He also said that it had been possible to model many of the revenue measures in the work that he then presented. So the government has already released some of the distributional analysis. But it is incomplete because it deals only with a one-year effect, in essence, which takes into account the full effects of the personal income tax cuts in year 1 but which does not take any account of the erosion effect of those tax cuts over the period beyond the first year. We had quite a lengthy debate in Senate Estimates Committee D about this matter last week. I will not go into all the details of that other than to say that on page D154 of the

          Then Senator McMullan intervened and stopped the debate going much further on that. But it is quite clear from that exchange, plus many of the exchanges in estimates hearings last week, that the information that is being sought by the coalition in the notice of motion on behalf of the Senate tonight is certainly available. All we are asking for is the same analysis that has been done on previous occasions. It is a very important point. The Senate has an obligation to the people of Australia to scrutinise the government's legislative program, including, in particular, its budget proposals.

           If we are going to be able to uphold our requirement of holding the government to account to the people of Australia, then the full information has to be available in terms of the basis of some of these very important budget decisions that have been made.

           The Senate is very soon to refer the government's revenue bills to Senate committees for detailed examination. That examination and proper due process will be very sorely deficient without the information being sought in this motion. Therefore, those are the reasons in essence why on behalf of the coalition I have moved this motion. I hope it will have the support of the Senate because, without it, we will not be able to do our job properly in terms of the thorough and proper examination of all the impacts of this very important budget on all Australians.

           Mr Evans sought to explain patiently and carefully to the Senate via the estimates committee that Prismod is a static model; it is inherent in the nature of such models that that is necessarily so. It is one of the reasons why I do not have a great deal of faith in the use of these models as tools. I have grave doubts about the extent to which people place reliance on them. It is the sort of illusory comfort and the appearance of certainty that some bottom line number out of a computer can produce when, if we are honest with ourselves, we know that there are significant inadequacies in trying to reduce the complexities of a society and an economy to a computer model that will just produce some reliable outcome.

It may even be right to say that it cannot do industry specific analyses. I understood Senator Short to be saying something opposite in reference to something an officer said before the estimates committee. He was reading from the transcript. It is not the context in which I remember those statements being said. As I am going from memory, there may be more to it. Certainly it is not very meaningful; it is arguable.

           I do not wish to take the time of the Senate by reiterating more than the brief outline of why this is an absurd proposition. Modelling is inherently limited in its usefulness, but to seek to get it to do functions of which it is not capable is an absurd proposition. Prismod is, by its nature, a static model; it takes snapshots at a particular point. One can take a series of snapshots, but as one gets further and further away I think the usefulness of the snapshots gets less and less and the dynamic processes by which one got from A to B are not capable of being measured by Prismod. One may wind up at point B rather than point A but one has no way of working out how one got there by virtue of Prismod. It has no capacity to provide that sort of information. As I said, Prismod is household expenditure based. As I understand it, it cannot do industry specific analyses.

It was not my understanding of the context in which those comments were made, but Senator Short was quoting and I am not going to challenge that here tonight because I do not have that evidence in front of me. I thought Mr Evans said the opposite. It is certainly not my advice now and it is not my understanding of what one would expect to get from an econometric model of household expenditure data, which is what we are talking about here.

           Prismod also ignores possible dynamic factors which would make a series of static snapshots of the type proposed here irrelevant. I do not think a proposal such as this does the Senate any good in its seeking to have, if it is seeking to have, public assessment of its reputation enhanced when it seeks documents which either cannot be provided or, by any sensible assessment of their usefulness, should not be provided. Not only do we oppose the motion but I think there is no prospect that the government will accede to the request in the resolution should it be carried.

           So often, so much of what is budgetary hyperbole is in fact based not on accuracy or a knowledge or a capacity to predict the future, but rather on the political philosophy which is seeking to be justified by some degree of credibility which attaches from using the word `computer' often enough for people to say, `Well, if the computer says it is so, it must be so'. We hope that by revealing the inadequacies of Prismod that thesis will be tested sorely. In fact, Senator McMullan has assisted us greatly with that tonight by sharing with us his grave concerns and his lack of faith in a computer's bottom line, suggesting to us that which we have feared for some time—that there is an over-reliance on the computer's credibility.

           There is a new group of young Australians—I suspect that the average age of this group is actually getting younger by the month—who are computer literate enough to understand their limitations and also understand that the games you can play with computers are just that—games—and that they bear very little relationship to reality. Computer modelling programs which purport to model the whole of civilisation are being sold in retail stores throughout our cities at this very moment. In fact, there is one called `Civilisation'. It is a computer modelling toy and the various assumptions which have been made in that particular game are readily accepted as assumptions by people from eight years old to 80 years old—anybody with the commonsense to realise that it is just a game and that there is no credibility attached to the assumptions made.

           There are many others. There is even a computer simulation game, `Castles', based on the concept that we are living in medieval times. The assumptions upon which that is based are that one is a ruler and that one distributes one's wealth and makes the sorts of decisions that medieval rulers were supposed to make. If one gets all of those cliches right, fits the model and understands the assumptions, then one becomes a more successful ruler. I know eight-year-olds who are capable of understanding that the assumptions there are not connected with reality. I know of eight-year-olds who are able to deal with the assumptions upon which the computer game `Simearth' is based.

           I was fascinated to watch the discussion which was held between Senator Short and the Treasury officials during Estimates Committee D. I watched as Senator Short asked whether the computer model could provide information for things it had not been designed to provide. I was not convinced. I was more interested in the perambulatory manner in which the answers were delivered to his questions. I thought much more succinct answers could have been given to many of the questions and I thought the answers were, to a large extent, evasive and not helpful.

We on this side are not quite sure why the government is seeking to break a long time convention—almost—in this place that the parliament does not sit when the allotted time for party meetings occurs each Tuesday morning. With respect, I thought Senator McMullan's colleague, when he became a little excited earlier today, was somewhat misleading when he suggested that these meetings, in effect, are not part of the legislative process and that, therefore, senators should not be paid except for the time that they are in the chamber.

         In fact, as the government knows, the meetings of caucus and of our party room are essential in order that the legislative program proceed in an orderly and sensible way. Caucus has to be convinced by its ministers to support the government's legislative program and we have the opportunity in opposition to debate and reach a position on the government bills in our party meeting. For as long as I can remember, those meetings have been held on Tuesday morning in this place and, as I said, a parliament never sat when the meetings were being held because that would simply fail to recognise the importance of those meetings as part of the total procedure.

         What the government is asking us to do tomorrow morning is abandon that long held practice in order that the Senate might sit for a few more hours. I am not opposed to that. In fact, I think the Senate should have sat for many more hours this year. The Senate would have almost sat for a record few days this year. It has been somewhat embarrassing to senators, certainly on this side of the chamber, how few days the government has required this place to sit during the course of this year.

         —Rubbish. The Senate could be sitting a sensible time rather than simply a few weeks. How many weeks has the Senate sat this year—and we are now in September—six weeks? I know we had the election, but then the government came back for only a very short time. The Senate should sit longer hours—more sitting days than it has at the moment—but that is not a reason to break this convention.

         In fact, I am somewhat bemused as to why the Senate is only sitting two days this week. I understand the IPU is meeting in this building next week, but why is the parliament not sitting on Wednesday and Thursday of this week? It may well be that there are preparatory meetings of the IPU which are going to occupy certain committee rooms around this place later in the week. But this is the largest parliamentary building in the world; there must be room for the IPU to take a few committee rooms whilst the parliament continues.

         There is no reason that I understand why this parliament cannot be sitting on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. If it were sitting on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, there is no reason why the convention that we do not sit during party meetings should be broken by the government. That is the concern we have. That is why we say to Senator McMullan: why cannot the government get its sitting days in order and organise a program that can deal with its legislation, and we will sit that program and the job will be done, as I have said, in an orderly and sensible way.

         The only other point I want to make, because there are some around here who have decided it is opportunistic to win a few cheap points on the state of the legislative program—I will not repeat the things I said earlier this day about what has happened over the last few weeks—is to remind the Senate that the estimates committee process was in place for all of last week. As a matter of interest, one of the estimates committees, I have just remembered, is sitting on Wednesday this week, all day. So, in actual fact, this parliament apparently, through a committee, will meet on Wednesday of this week. If that is the case, why cannot the chamber sit on Wednesday of this week? The government runs the program and we sit the hours the government requires; that is really basically how it works.

         Not only have all the estimates committees been meeting for many hours, which is the most time consuming part of the appropriations process—which Senator McMullan failed to mention earlier when he was arguing that so little legislative work had been done—but also so many of the bills which ultimately have to be debated are currently before the legislative and general purpose committees, which is also part of the legislative process.

         Just in case the government has not caught up with what has been happening in relation to its program, I remind those opposite that the following bills are all currently before committees: Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Amendment Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill, the Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill.

         In fact, we have even been referring issues to legislative and general purposes committees relating to bills before the bills get here in order that those bills might ultimately be dealt with more expeditiously than otherwise.

          So in addressing this motion, which seeks to refer a number of very important issues and considerations to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry, we should be asking a number of important questions.

          I share the concerns expressed by Senator Panizza. Many Aboriginal people are asking for a proper accountability and a proper consideration. What should be our response?

This inquiry is timely and it certainly is appropriate.

          The various tenets of the motion that has been put forward by Senator Panizza could very easily be summarised under a number of headings. The first one is accountability. The second is the effective working relationships between various government departments, agencies and programs, including whether those program delivery services are actually being appropriately delivered by each department or agency, and whether programs should be transferred to other agencies or departments.

          Senator Panizza also referred to the very important issues that arise from capital expenditure in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. This certainly needs addressing. Then, of course, there are the more routine and administrative issues that arise from the procedures, funding, travel and accommodation for Aboriginal representatives themselves in Australia, particularly those on ATSIC. Finally, the motion deals with the very important issue of noncompliance with conditions for which very generous and very appropriate grants have been made for Aboriginal people.

          Firstly, I will deal with accountability. It is obvious, upon consideration of the operations up until now of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, that there does need to be a further examination of the whole area of accountability. The Senate estimates committee reports to this parliament have made that very clear. Senator Panizza and I have both taken a very close interest in a number of the issues that have been pursued by Senate estimates committees. We are well aware that the office of evaluation and audit, inside ATSIC itself, has raised many of these issues.

          On behalf of Senator Panizza, at the preliminary discussions the other evening concerning ATSIC I asked questions with regard to the activities of the fraud control area inside ATSIC. The officers placed on the record a number of very concerning issues that are being pursued internally within ATSIC at this time. There are, of course, additional inquiries such as those being conducted at the moment by the Australian National Audit Office into the Aboriginal benefits trust account and the land council operations in the Northern Territory, with which I am familiar.

          Senator Panizza also raised the very important issue of the effective working relationships between departments and agencies. This parliament has become aware that there are a number of conflicts in these areas. The achievements and targets that the government has very properly set for each of those programs need to be very carefully monitored, checked and balanced. In particular, we need to look at the outcomes of the Aboriginal deaths in custody recommendations, to which the government responded with very specific budget requirements in the previous financial year and in the current financial year. Major areas of expenditure flow through to the areas that are addressed in this motion for inquiry.

          Capital expenditure is now very timely in Aboriginal communities because of the issues that will arise under the proposed legislation for Aboriginal native title. Capital expenditure goes hand in hand with any provisions anywhere for land and land administration. There is a need to check and look at pastoral properties and estates and the expenditure that has taken place in a cooperative way between the federal government, its ATSIC agency, and the West Australian government, particularly the former Labor administration. I know that Senator Panizza will have a particular interest in Western Australia in this respect.

          The final point in this motion refers to whether or not there is adequate compliance in the area of grants to Aboriginal organisations. This is most important. Very good and proper grants are made to Aboriginal organisations throughout Australia. However, projects often fail because there is no follow-up; no recurrent expenditure is built in. For example, a youth centre in a community in the Northern Territory was built with a very generous grant. There was no follow-on finance in the following financial years either for programs or for repairs and maintenance. The entire project failed because of that.

        These amendments were not foreshadowed in my speech at the second reading stage. The effect of these amendments would be to address the amendment by the government which seeks to confer on the ACT legislature the capacity to determine the number of representatives in that legislature. The amendments which are proposed by the Democrats would consider that number of representatives in the legislature in terms of a referendum to be conducted in the ACT, by the ACT and responded to by the ACT electors.

         It is the belief of the Democrats that that is a much more appropriate way of addressing the problem than the manner proposed by Senator Ian Macdonald's amendment which seeks to retain that authority within this federal parliament. We believe the ACT electors appreciate the capacity to have within the territory a government which is not overshadowed by big brother here, but rather a government which determines its own future. However, there are some concerns about allowing the executive government unfettered opportunity to determine the number of representatives. With all that in mind, the Democrats propose that such a decision be made by the electors of the ACT in full through a referendum. It is for those reasons that we propose these amendments. I think that explains the amendments sufficiently.

         —Amendment No. 2 makes sense of No. 1 because it describes how it will happen. The essential effect is to replace that part of the government's amendment which proposes to grant to the ACT government the capacity to determine its numbers. Having omitted that paragraph, amendment No. 2 describes how that will be done. I do not think any further explanation is warranted.

         —The government opposes both of the Democrats' amendments which have just been circulated. In our legislation we are giving the power to the territory assembly. If it chooses to hold a referendum to increase or decrease the size of its House of Assembly that is its business. I am not quite sure of the mechanical section in amendment No. 2. I ask Senator Bell: who decides the question for the referendum?  Say there were a proposal to increase it by two, or to decrease it by two, or put it up by six; who decides that issue to go to the referendum? Is that the House of Assembly itself? If it is, why not leave it with the power to have a referendum outright?

         —The question is whether it is only the legislature of the ACT which has that capacity and also whether the determination of the question is left to the assembly. The answer is no. By requiring, as in this amendment, that a referendum be the mechanism by which the numbers are changed, the sovereignty remains with the electors rather than with the legislature. The need for that was demonstrated in the recent move—which the Democrats supported from the very beginning—to determine the electoral system for the territory. It was our constant position.

         In the face of vehement opposition from this government and, at various times, from various parts of the legislature of the ACT, we held out for a referendum. We were justified and vindicated in that position not only by the decision to hold a referendum in the ACT but also by the very result of that referendum, which supported our original position.

I was not aware that the matter was being called on—that is not the fault of the Australian Democrats—and I came in here and found these, I suppose, not so terribly detailed amendments for me to look at for the first time, as I am catching my breath. When I proposed my amendments, I telephoned Senator Bell and told him what they were about. He indicated that he would support them. When I got here I found these amendments and I do not even know what they are about. I am opposing them simply to give myself a little time to try to work out what they are all about. I was going to say that I do not even have a copy of the Australian Capital Territory's Electoral Act to see where the amendments fit in, but I see that my staff did diligently put a copy in the file, so at least I have it, but I have never opened it prior to this time.

         Whether the second amendment proposed by Senator Bell is in order is something I simply cannot say because I cannot read that quickly, particularly while I am speaking. In some way I have to delay the procedures sufficiently just to let me check that that part is appropriate. It is not that we are about to embark upon some amendments which do not mean anything or which are in the wrong act or which are inappropriate. It is certainly something that I, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, want to look at more closely than I have so far.

         The thrust of what Senator Bell is proposing is similar to the thrust of the amendment I foreshadowed and will be moving. That simply is that the Liberal and National parties do not think that the current ACT assembly should be left in a position where it can determine what the numbers of the assembly will be. It was for that reason that I foreshadowed—and will move—the amendment that the determination of how many members there should be in the ACT assembly is one which, as at present, remains with this parliament. If there is to be any difference in the number of members—that is, 17 members—of the ACT Legislative Assembly, the ACT government would have to convince the government, convince the lower house of this parliament and convince this chamber that there was a need to alter that from the current number of 17 to some other number. I indicated in my speech on the second reading debate that if a good case was made to this parliament and, certainly, to the Liberal and National parties for amending that number of 17, we would not object, we would be objective about it and we would consider the matter on its merits and so determine it, but we did not think that the ACT assembly should have that power.

         Senator Bell, through his amendment, wants the same result. He does not want the ACT parliament to be left with that power and obviously has the same concerns that we do—at this stage of the maturity of the ACT government. So Senator Bell and the Australian Democrats also have that problem. Their solution to it is different from the one that I have proposed. As I understand it, their solution is that the number shall be 17 or such other number of members as is provided by an enactment following a referendum, which will enable the electors of the territory to choose the number of members to be provided for in that enactment.

         All along the line I suspect that it shows a belief that someone else should determine it.

         In his second reading speech, the minister said that possibly more important changes were being examined and would be included in a separate bill at a later date. That bill will obviously come back to this chamber later, with possibly more important changes. If Senator Bell is able to talk to us at greater length about the reasons behind his proposal when the bill comes through, we might be able to have a look at it then. For the moment my attitude and the attitude of the Liberal and National parties is that we will oppose the Democrat amendment but proceed with the amendment that I will move at the appropriate time.

During that period there have been two different governments in power in various combinations in the ACT assembly. Whatever the views of the national parliament are about the governmental structure of the ACT, it is now well accepted that self-government is here to stay, although there was considerable controversy some five or six years ago when it was first proposed.

The government believes it would be very odd to say that the ACT assembly should not have the powers that are possessed by every other federal and state government and the other territory government of Australia—that is, the Northern Territory government.

         Since the Northern Territory got self-government in the mid-1970s it has increased the size of the Northern Territory assembly. That has had more to do with trying to preserve some seats. But it is one vote one value by and large in the Northern Territory and the size of that parliament has been increased. The average enrolment in the Northern Territory is still only about 2,500 to 3,000 electors per member of parliament per constituency.

So I do not think either Senator Bell or Senator Ian Macdonald have put forward their views based on totally altruistic reasons.

Senator Schacht and Senator McMullan are the secretary type people that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talked about so disparagingly. They know what that is all about; they know those things.

         The opposition is concerned that the ACT assembly might do what Labor parties everywhere do: fiddle the books and fiddle the rules to make the numbers such that no other party could ever have a say in the parliament.

         I am rather nonplussed by the fact that the Democrats, while seen to be sharing that view, are prepared, as I understand from Senator Bell, to roll over again and go along with the government on this proposal if its amendments do not get up. I am finding it a little difficult to work out from Senator Bell just what the situation is. I really do not know whether he is just—to use a colloquialism—pulling my leg or whether he really means what he says. Every time I ask him he bursts into laughter and I am not quite sure what he is referring to.

         When I say that I am going to vote against the Democrats' amendments and propose my own, I suppose that with some decent debate and decent arguments Senator Bell could convince me differently. When I inquired of Senator Bell why this amendment was not brought to our attention, he said, `We've only just drafted it'. I asked when that was and he said that that was at 9 o'clock this morning. That was 13 hours ago. I have been around the parliament all day. I would have thought that just a fraction of courtesy might have been appropriate. We could have had a look at it.

         —In explaining this amendment to try to relieve Senator Ian Macdonald of some of his confusion, I thought I was fairly specific in describing the consistency of this proposal and the position we held, for example, on the issue of the electoral system to be adopted by the ACT. The Australian Democrats argued long and consistently that a referendum was the appropriate mechanism for determining the electoral system, and we argued that in the face of consistent opposition from those who wish to impose upon the ACT what we thought was an inappropriate electoral system. Consistent with that approach, we have proposed this opportunity for the ACT electors. After consultation with those electors—I am not suggesting for one moment that I have consulted with all the electors of the ACT—we had sufficient responses to guide us to the view that it would be an acceptable, consistent proposition to have the issue determined by referendum.

         Senator Ian Macdonald asked specifically whether there was any indication of the sorts of costs that would be involved in that. Our earlier proposition for a referendum on the electoral system was dismissed by a number of opponents on the basis that it would cost in the order of $1 million to deliver the decision making capacity to the electors. Senator Ian Macdonald, because of his intense interest in the ACT, may remember my direct question in this chamber some years ago about the cost of such a matter. I do not know whether that was before Senator McMullan developed his interest in the ACT. I was able to participate in that debate about that particular election and illustrate that such a referendum, even if held independently of any other election, would not produce a cost of anything like $1 million. As a matter of fact, it would have been closer to an amount less than $200,000.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Regardless of the eventual cost, the order of the cost is something which raises the question: what is the price of democracy? In this instance, I would suggest that such a question would usually be coincidental with a general election within the ACT and the cost at that time would be incidental to the conduct of the major general election. This is consistent, of course, with the Democrats' support for the concept of citizens' initiated referenda. Although it is not necessarily the exact mechanism, the idea of regularly consulting electors with various questions at times of general elections is a concept which has been supported, especially in local government throughout Australia, and is gaining increasing acceptance.

         What I am proposing here is but a shadow of that. When this question was raised by Senator Ian Macdonald, I said that the Democrats would be entertained by the question, and the amendment that I propose here is the result of our consideration. I really think Senator Ian Macdonald has illustrated for future reference the fine art of filibustering. He asked a question which had been answered in the first two minutes of my explanation of these amendments. He asked that question not only several times, but also in several different ways. If I need an illustration of filibustering when I am speaking to school groups, I shall use this example that Senator Ian Macdonald has so aptly provided tonight.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         </emphasis>
         released into Australian society?  The Film and Literature Board of Review, the body that is the final arbitrator of the film's classification and release, is responsible. Its chairman, Mr Evan Williams, is therefore the responsible person. Mr Williams has publicly and before the Senate community standards committee vigorously defended his decision and claims that the release of the movie can be justified on four grounds.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Those grounds are, firstly, that the movie is of artistic merit. According to Mr Williams, `It is the task of the artist, at least occasionally, to shock the old and complacent'. The second ground is that the movie would be shown only in art-house theatres, a proviso which cannot be enforced and is not mentioned in the guidelines as a relevant criteria. The third ground is that adults in a free society ought to be allowed to see whatever they like. Mr Williams confirmed his view in a letter to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Age
         </emphasis>
         on 15 November saying that:

       </para>
       <para>
        The fourth ground for Mr Williams releasing this movie
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Salo
        </emphasis>
        may be found in his article in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        on 21 May 1993 when he said, `Quite simply, we thought it was a good film'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is my view that the position of Mr Williams as Chairman of the Film and Literature Board of Review is no longer tenable, and he should be dismissed. I take this view on four counts: firstly, there has been a clear breach of the guidelines for the classification of films and videotapes which he was obliged in law to apply. Under the refused classification section of the guidelines, subsection (b) has been breached. It reads:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . any film which includes unduly detailed and/or relished acts of extreme violence or cruelty; explicit or unjustifiable depictions of sexual violence against non-consenting persons, will be refused classification.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Williams himself has stated that the adolescents suffer `sexual torment and sadistic humiliation of an extreme kind'. Secondly, Mr Williams was in breach of the principle found in the preamble of the classification guidelines which reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . community has the right to ban material considered likely to endanger public health or safety; or to offend accepted standards of public decency.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, he was in breach of the clear direction from the June 1988 Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers meeting in Darwin requesting that the Chairman of the Film and Literature Board of Review apply tighter restrictions to sexually violent films in the M and R categories. Fourthly, in my own State of Victoria, section 8(2)(c) of the Classification of Films and Publications Act 1990 provides:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that a censor must refuse to classify a film that depicts a child (whether engaged in sexual activity or otherwise) who is, or who is apparently, under the age of 16 years in a manner that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult person.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Not only do I believe that Mr Williams' position is no longer tenable because of the flagrant breaches of the above but also I question his competence to be a judge of community standards. This belief was confirmed by the incredible assertion by Mr Williams that he could see no evidence to link a level of sexually violent crime to sexually violent movies. His opinion clearly shows poor judgment and it could be supported only by a very small minority of people in society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is clear from the committee hearings that community views were never a touchstone in the film and literature review board's decision making process; rather, the artistic value of the movie and the freedom of expression of the director overrode community standards. Mr Williams is employed to apply the law, not to make it up. These boards are made up of appointed officials; they are not elected. For this reason they cannot be allowed to roam free, interpreting the guidelines as they might, inventing new criteria and then being unaccountable to the community and protected from criticism by government departments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As public representatives, we are here to represent the standards of the community as well as the public sentiment towards issues that arise from time to time. As a public servant, Mr Williams is obliged in law to follow the guidelines which are laid down by the parliament. He and other members of the board are not at liberty to substitute their own philosophical judgments, as they have done. I therefore put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and the other senators present in the chamber, to join me in calling for the dismissal of Mr Evan Williams, since the only appropriate signal we can make to the community is that we will not tolerate breaches of the guidelines which place the safety of our citizens in peril. This will no doubt send a clear signal to a worried community that any member or chairperson of the film and literature review board is accountable for his or her actions. I agree with Mr Williams on one point, when he said:

In a modern society, tragically, never have children been more at risk both here and overseas than they are at the moment. Nightly on our television screens we see images of children caught in the cross-fire of adult wars in Bosnia, Somalia and Ireland, and on our Asian doorstep we have the appalling and shameful trade in child prostitution—an industry, thriving, I am disgusted to say, in part because of Australians who travel to Asian countries for that purpose.

         At home our children also face danger. During August, six children were killed as a result of domestic violence. It is a daily occurrence for some families. Some children never know what it is like to have peace in the home, never know what it is like not to be abused physically or mentally by their parents. As pressure increases on families through unemployment and other worries, stressful conditions mean that parents increasingly are not coping. They take out their frustrations on their children, and sometimes that frustration leads to serious injury or to death.

         One of the messages for parents this week is that it is not okay to shake babies. Babies have very soft brains and their blood vessels are fragile; they break and bleed easily. When you shake a baby you are hitting its brain against the hard, bony skull. Shaking a baby is not an acceptable alternative to smacking. Throwing a baby high in the air to catch it is not safe, either. Yet throwing and shaking are quite common for babies.

Many schools have overcome problems of truancy and disruption in class by simply ensuring that children have food in their stomachs.

         One activity with which NAPCAN has become involved is the rural health support education and training program, supported by the New South Wales state government and the federal government as well as non-government organisations. It has been established at Orange. It aims to encourage optimal health for rural and remote communities and works on the NAPCAN concept of neighbourhood network and extends it to provide community based training. Neighbour network is a low-key community arrangement for alleviating stress which, as I said, can lead to abusive situations in the home. It was established in 1989 but has only had minimal success. It is hoped that the formal vocationally trained volunteers will expand the scheme.

Children are people too. That is the message the NAPCAN people are trying to give us.

I came back with a couple of thousand Taiwanese dollars, which does not make me as wealthy as it may sound to honourable senators, unfortunately. Like any traveller coming back from overseas with a pocketful of money, when I got into Australia I sought to change that money back into our currency. As is frequently the case, people do not always change all their money when they leave a country because they may wish to purchase something duty free, or something like that. Frequently, travellers come back with money in their pockets either intentionally or accidentally. Sometimes they forget that they had a little wad of notes in a pocket in a jacket somewhere.

In the 1991-92 financial year, we had a balance of payments surplus with Taiwan of $559 million. Our total exports to Taiwan in the 1991-92 financial year were over $2,537 million. Taiwan is our sixth largest destination by value for our exports and our sixth largest trading partner, if one ranks it in terms of the balance of trade surplus between our country and Taiwan.

         It is absolutely absurd that our trading banks between them cannot organise to be able to change Taiwanese currency here in Australia. What sort of signal does that give to people coming from Taiwan who want to do business here? What sort of signal does it give about our commitment as a nation to doing business with them and respecting them? In Taiwan, banks will happily exchange Australian dollars. They will exchange Australian dollars in the streets, in the hotels and in the banks. Yet people can go to any of the major banks in this country, in the heart of our capital city, and not be able to exchange their money. Nor will they be able to exchange it in any other large city in Australia because they just do not quote the currency at all.

         To add insult to injury, 35,000 Taiwanese visited Australia last year alone and that was at the commencement of direct air flights. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office was kind enough today to provide me with an estimate that between 200,000 and 300,000 ROC nationals—that is, Taiwanese people—are likely to be coming here every year by the year 2000. They will be a major source of tourist dollars for this country. But I would not want to be a Taiwanese tourist lobbing in Sydney, Cairns, Townsville, Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne or Darwin for that matter with a pocketful of his own currency and nothing else because he will not be able to change it. That is the sad message that our banks are giving to people who come from that country.

If they are going to be fair dinkum, if we as a nation are going to be fair dinkum about respecting our near neighbours and doing business with them, it is about time they realised that they have to be willing to trade that currency. Some of the banks will say, `Well, there is not enough demand'. Of course it is difficult to assess demand if they tell people, `We are not going to change the currency, so don't bother asking'. That sort of answer is just not acceptable as far as I am concerned and certainly not acceptable as far as the people who arrive from Taiwan expecting to spend their money here are concerned either.

         Finally, after discussions with my bank, the NAB, it has kindly agreed to privately negotiate the notes for me but, whilst I am very grateful for that offer—and I will be taking it up—it does not solve the problem that our banks should be doing more. We have to respect our trading partners. If one can walk into any of the major banks in Canberra and change currency from the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and a host of countries which in terms of the value of trade are smaller than or roughly equal to the value of our trade with Taiwan—I cannot even find the Solomon Islands listed in the statistics produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics—one should be able to change this currency.

         —Thanks, Senator Collins. Last week the wool market indicator plunged another 17c per kilo clean, mainly we are told as a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding the Garnaut recommendations and the government's likely response. The view is perhaps taken by the trade that, given the chance of a stepped up stockpile sell-off starting in November, the price can further be expected to weaken.

         I think it is timely to remind the world wool trade that whether one blames Garnaut, China's reluctance in the market, the dollar's instability or the Europeans being on holiday, growers are in a desperate position. I warn the trade that the pain now felt by growers may eventually be felt by them. The low and unstable prices of today may eventually become the high and unstable prices of the future.

         There is a saying in the bush, `The worse things get, the better they will get'. But will it come soon enough? Many specialist woolgrowers are voting with their feet and exiting the industry, if possible. Some have the option of growing more crop. This may have ramifications to grain prices later on but, whatever, we are seeing established growers leaving the industry forever. Can we blame them?

         At current clean prices, western division growers are receiving around $2.50 greasy, which is just over $400 a bale. The wool production forecasting committee's projections is that for 1993-94 production might only be 693 million kilograms. Anecdotal evidence from major broking houses suggests that it may be much lower. If the forecasting is correct, it means that 1993-94 will see at least a 14 per cent fall in greasy wool production from 1992-93 production of 806 million kilograms. With another 20 million kilograms sold out of the stockpile in 1992-93, the shortfall from physical production to meet demand this year will be substantially short of last year, maybe by 100 million kilograms. In short, wool production through price is being reduced to a cottage industry status while a shortage in production is just around the corner.

         Already last week's 107,000 three state catalogue is well below the 140,000 plus bales per month that might normally be expected at this time of year. This just adds up to the view that, despite higher deliveries expected in the spring, the omens are already showing. I hope that if and when the Garnaut recommendations on the stockpile reduction are accepted they will not act as a dampener on the auction price that must improve.

         It would make a substantial difference to growers if the government can delay the introduction of Garnaut's stockpile reduction schedule until the high delivery months have passed, at least until the beginning of 1994. This will make it more equitable for the owners of the 60 per cent of wool which will come into store for auction prior to Christmas. We all wait in anticipation for Garnaut's recommendations to be analysed and implemented.

         in Queensland, which had the highest ratings, I believe, of anywhere in the country, or had the ABC chosen not to renew her contract, one could have understood that that would be a programming prerogative. However, the problem is the way in which the ABC has chosen to deal with the transfer of presenter for that program.

         Ms Bornhorst is in receipt of what I would regard as a most unprofessional letter which accused her of being—wait for it—overly aggressive in her interviewing style.

Are we going into a new and gentle style of political interviewing within the ABC?

         There were other matters relating to Ms Bornhorst's professionalism which were queried in the letter which, I believe, is not the normal way of discussing the future of a valued employee. Quite clearly, it would appear that the ABC, which, I must admit, I thought had high industrial relations standards until this particular case, has not followed the appropriate process; nor has it given Ms Bornhorst due process for appeal.

Today she was phoned at home, she went into work as normal but was not allowed to proceed with the program. Effectively she has been sacked today.

I do not believe I am taking from the ABC's right to determine who it puts in as presenter of that program—of course that is its prerogative—but the issue is not one of whether a presenter will change at some point in time. It is the way in which that presenter has been dealt with in relation to normal, standard, reasonable industrial relations procedures.

A loyal person in the employ of the ABC, someone whose reputation is well known in Queensland—I am sure that a number of Queensland senators will agree with me in this regard—has been replaced. Her professional integrity has been questioned and she has been dealt with, I believe, very harshly and very unfairly.

         It shows also that in the seat of Swan in Western Australia a candidate by the name of Luke Garswood gained 576 votes. What it did not show, however, was that Mr Luke Garswood was a very active student politician, a member of the left from universities in Western Australia, an active participant in the National Union of Students and someone who negotiated a preference deal with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Kim Beazley. That deal ensured that any votes he received during the polling would flow to Mr Beazley.

         The importance of this election result, and the candidacy of Mr Luke Garswood, is probably eluding you at the moment, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will try to fill things in a little bit. At the moment there is a particular bill in the Western Australian Legislative Council, if it has not yet moved to the Legislative Assembly. This bill, introduced by Mr Norman Moore, the minister for education, ensures that, when it passes through the houses of parliament in Western Australia and becomes law, no student in Western Australia will ever again be required to compulsorily join a student union. Indeed, students in Western Australia will be unique in that when they go to university or a tertiary institution they will not be required to join a student union. The bill, of course, is called the Voluntary Student Unionism Bill and has been put forward by the minister for education, Mr Norman Moore, who has championed the cause of voluntary unionism for about the past 12 or 13 years. Indeed, he introduced private members bills into the Legislative Council in Western Australia on many occasions in those 10 terrible years in opposition which, of course, have passed.

         The two instances I have mentioned here need to be linked together. Firstly, it was crucial that the NUS and Luke Garswood gave their preferences to Mr Beazley so that Mr Beazley's political career could continue. That is why Mr Beazley is here. The support of the National Union of Students occurred in an extremely well-funded campaign, a campaign that was funded using tens of thousands of dollars of compulsorily collected union fees to attract votes to Mr Luke Garswood. As I said earlier, the majority of those 576 votes—well in excess of 90 per cent—went straight to Mr Beazley. We should find out how much money was involved. In fact, I think every student in Australia who has paid a compulsory levy to a student union should know how much National Union of Students money went to the campaign for Luke Garswood, which really was the campaign to elect Kim Beazley.

Also, those of us who were in the Senate last year will remember the higher education funding bill that went through which also threatens universities and state governments with a cut in their funding if they introduce voluntary student unionism.

The people elected a coalition with a clear set of policies. One of the sets of policies was to wipe out corruption and to put accountability back into government in Western Australia. I think what I have described here tonight is a form of political corruption that does need to be exposed.

         It also makes an absolute farce of the debate we are having spasmodically at the moment in the Senate regarding declaration of members' and senators' interests. It makes a farce of the declaration of members' interests because it is fair to say that the most significant interest that Mr Beazley has had in his political career this year, at least, is this significant form of political corruption and the deal that was done with the National Union of Students. The deal would go something like this: `If you run a candidate, if you help me get re-elected, if you help me defeat the Liberal candidate in Swan, then I will ensure that we will penalise the government of Western Australia if it introduces voluntary student unionism'.

         The corruption is that the federal government is trying to trammel the right of the Western Australian coalition government to introduce its platform by saying to the government of Western Australia, `We will rip millions of dollars off you if you implement voluntary student unionism'. Of course, the NUS and Kim Beazley would be concerned because their political power base will be threatened if students have the right to choose whether to join a union or not. It is an absolute travesty of democracy in Australia that people should be forced to join a union against their will—and that is the case in Western Australia at the moment—but it is a greater travesty of democracy that any federal government should say, `We will reduce your grants, we will reduce the money that flows to your state, to your universities, if you allow students to have that freedom'.

One farm I visited in Scotland had about 450 acres and was getting #60,000-odd sterling in subsidies, which is about $A136,000. That included about $226 per cow for having it standing in the paddock, and about $90 per ewe; and earning something like $226 per acre set aside. By law, they set aside some 15 per cent of their land for about seven months each year. It was a great revelation to see that first-hand.

         As far as how the GATT negotiations were progressing, I had the opportunity to meet with members of the Cairns Group in Geneva and also the Assistant Director-General of GATT. We all know the advantages of a successful outcome to the round: something like $US200 billion. One of the comments made to me was, `If you think you understand GATT, you haven't been listening'. It is very complicated and it will take a lot of hard negotiation to get a successful outcome.

         I hope that we do get a successful outcome. I am afraid I am pessimistic about getting real, meaningful results for the Australian farming industry, especially in the areas of access, even though some of the external support systems may be reduced. I think that the internal support systems will remain because the Europeans have always said that they want food security, and that happened after the Second World War. So it will be interesting to see the results. I am afraid, however, that I am pessimistic.

         I also wanted to assess the opportunities for Australian exporters in central Europe, which is now emerging out of the communist occupation that has basically been there since the Second World War. For example, in the Czech Republic and Poland I believe there are great opportunities for the Australian wool industry to be involved in joint ventures. I know that one venture with the Czech Republic should eventuate in the next few weeks. I am very hopeful that in the near future quite an amount of Australian wool will be going into Poland as part of a joint venture in that country as well.

         Another area I wish to mention relates to the environmental clean-up in central Europe, which I believe has been mentioned in the newspapers and also in the Senate today. I also investigated the factors that would encourage or discourage foreign investors from investing in Australia. At the moment there is a great deal of concern amongst the investors that I met in the business community in Europe about the Mabo issue and the question it raises with regard to investment in Australia, and also about the republican debate. As far as Mabo is concerned, people over on the other side of the world who want to invest here are very concerned about the security of their money if they put it into investments here—especially in mining and land generally—and as to what might happen.

         In regard to the other area of concern, the republic debate, I do not think it worries the English much whether or not Australia is a republic, but they do have a great concern about the instability that is being shown here in Australia at the moment. People overseas are concerned because they have always regarded Australia as a safe haven to put money into, and it is not a safe haven any more.

         Basically, Mr Acting Deputy President, the report that I have now tabled is there for you and others to read. The message is clear, in my opinion. We cannot expect the rest of the world to give us a living. We cannot expect everyone to change things just for Australia. We are really only a small country in a big scene on the world stage.

         Basically we have to get things right here at home. Things are not right here at home because our parameters that everyone has to work under are not right. For instance, our tax system does not give people the incentive to want to invest. Our transport system is not efficient enough so that people can actually get their product to the seaboard; our waterfront is still one of the most inefficient in the world.

         There is an indicator which shows the extent to which infrastructure meets the business requirements. In relation to port access, I believe that Switzerland and Austria—two landlocked countries—are ranked behind us, as is Italy, which is torn by industrial strife most of the time. It is quite interesting that we are ranked 19th out of 22 countries in an indicator which shows the extent to which infrastructure meets business requirements in OECD countries. So I think we have a lot to do there.

         My thanks to all the people who helped me on the trip. I wish to thank Tod Mercer, who is from the parliamentary liaison office of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra, and the other 80-odd people who gave me briefings and helped me on my trip for the 35 days that I was out of Australia. I appreciate very much the courtesies and the help given to me by the embassies and the high commissions around the world. My thanks are due also to Senator Cook and Senator Gareth Evans for the hospitality that their two departments extended to me and the help that they gave me on this trade trip where I was trying to find out for myself how Australia was faring in Europe and other parts of the world. I thank the Senate very much for allowing me to present my report tonight.

        My advice is that when the first Australian servicemen arrived in the area, the level of radiation present in the environment in Nagasaki and Hiroshima was essentially at normal background levels.

        For example, in the case of Hiroshima, the maximum dose to entrants into the city immediately after the blast has been calculated by studies at 24 units of radiation.

        To put this in context, if a serviceman had been at the middle of the blast area for a full year, his dose of radiation would have been the same as the figure permitted for public exposure by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. This figure for the general public is itself one tenth of the annual dose equivalent limit for those engaged in radiation work.

        (6) My Department is not considering such a survey. I am advised that malignancies that may have been caused by radiation have no special features that will distinguish these from other malignancies. Unless there was a great increase in the rate of cancer, only a survey of very large numbers could detect any increase in cancer. The number needed to be surveyed to detect small increases may be larger than the total number in BCOF.

        The new arrangements provide a strong incentive for more efficient and effective safety practices, as a home will be reimbursed for what its expenditure on workers' compensation would have been if its record of claims had been the average for the industry in that State. A nursing home with a better than average claiming record will, therefore, be able to keep the difference between the funded amount and its actual costs as extra profit, while a nursing home with a worse than average claiming record will have to meet the difference from its own resources.

        (2) The Department monitors the success of JOBSTART by surveying 50% of program participants three months after their subsidised placement has finished. As JOBSTART subsidies are payable for up to 26 weeks a  number of the 1992-93 commencements will continue in subsidised employment until December 1993. The results of the surveys completed by these commencements would be available in April 1994. The latest available monitoring has shown that for the 12 months to June 1993, 59.1% of jobseekers assisted into employment through the JOBSTART Program were still in unsubsidised employment or non-DEET funded training three months after the completion of the JOBSTART subsidy. The monitoring also has shown that 29% of jobseekers surveyed were still in employment with the employer who received the JOBSTART subsidy.

        The Australian income tax system is, in general, based on the individual taxpayer rather than the family unit. The Government considers that this is an appropriate basis in terms of equity and economic effects, particularly given the availability of other policy mechanisms including the provision of assistance to families through the outlays side of the Budget. It is not clear from the question what Senator Harradine has in mind in referring to greater tax equity for families and it is therefore not possible to say what the possible effects might be on the economy.  To the extent that tax concessions might be made to families, the revenue forgone would have to be recouped from other taxpayers and may then give rise to other concerns about equity.

The HCCA will be introduced with effect from 29 September 1994 and the amount of the payment will be increased to $30 per week, compared to $27.40 per week for the DSR in 1993-94.

        The Government has also announced the bringing forward of the first tranche of the One Nation income tax cuts.

Senator Crowley referred the question to the Treasurer who has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

        The Government has responded to the needs of the economy by bringing down a budget that gives the economy some additional impetus in the short term while winding back the budget deficit in the medium term (thereby contributing to national savings objectives). Advancing the timing of the first tranche of the personal income tax cuts—along with the provision of a tax rebate for those taxpayers on lower incomes—and deferring the second tranche for later consideration in the light of fiscal conditions are consistent with this strategy.

        The personal tax cuts, in conjunction with the increases in indirect taxes in the 1993-94 Budget, will help restore balance to the Australian tax system which had become too reliant on direct taxes.

        These changes do not involve massive cuts in services nor do they impact unfairly on women. A number of measures which are being implemented in the 1993-94 Budget will improve the situation of women. For example, from 29 September 1994, the Dependent Spouse Rebate (DSR) for families with children, a tax rebate provided to the spouse who is in the workforce, is to be replaced by the Home Child Care Allowance which will be paid to the primary carer who is not in the workforce and increased from $27.40 to $30 per week. From the same date, the Social Security allowance paid to a married person, which is currently paid to the member of the couple in the workforce, will be split and a separate Partner Allowance will be paid directly to the person not in the workforce.
