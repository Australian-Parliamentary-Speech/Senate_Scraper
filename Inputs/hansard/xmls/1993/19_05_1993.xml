          —On behalf of the President, I make the following statement. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has raised with the President a matter of privilege, and asked that he consider whether a motion to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges should be given precedence in accordance with standing order 81.

          The matter raised by the Public Accounts Committee is the alleged adverse treatment of a witness, Mr John Richardson, in consequence of his giving evidence before the committee. The committee indicates that it believes that Mr Richardson has been penalised in consequence of his evidence, and that the committee has collected some evidence in relation to this question.

          The Senate will recall that Mr Richardson made three submissions to the Senate in which he has referred to certain proceedings before Estimates Committee A relating to the same matters as were the subject of inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee. His submissions, dated 17 and 19 February and 30 April 1992, were tabled on 25 February and 4 May 1992.

          As the President has indicated in previous statements, the matter of alleged interference with witnesses is regarded with great seriousness. He considers that the letter from the Public Accounts Committee indicates that this matter meets the criteria which he is required to take into account in determining whether a motion should have precedence.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Public Accounts Committee has indicated that Senator Watson, the Deputy Chairman of the committee, will take carriage of the matter in the Senate. Senator Watson has raised with the President as a matter of privilege the claims set out in Mr Richardson's submissions that false answers were given to the Senate and to Estimates Committee A.

         —It is regrettable that we have had an indication this morning that the Opposition does not feel able to accede to these motions being declared formal and passed accordingly today. It is also regrettable that the obvious pressure of business that we confront between now and the end of this sitting period makes it very difficult to contemplate the issue being debated with the attention it deserves before we rise. It is obvious that the first opportunity we will have to do that will be in the first week or so of the Budget session. It is for that reason that I have moved for these matters to be postponed.

         The Government believes that it is important that this issue continue to have some momentum and that we not lose it now as a result of this matter being further delayed. It is a matter that has been debated in the Parliament and in this chamber on and off since 1974. The system that now applies was introduced in the House of Representatives in 1986. We have debated it in the Senate in 1987 and most recently, I think, in 1992.

I believe that it is likely, as a result, to be a much more acceptable system than that which has not found favour unanimously in this chamber in the past.

I will come back to that in just a moment. The first point the Minister made was that it is unfortunate that we would not agree to this motion being treated as formal today, and simply pass it through on the nod, in effect. We have always said that this is a serious issue. We have said that we are prepared to debate it properly, and debate it properly through to a final resolution. Some of us are on the record as saying that the principle is correct and that we believe there should be a form that sets out details of interests in order that the public can have confidence in the system. But we have every right to debate the detail in this place and determine it in a form that is satisfactory to the Senate, not a form that is satisfactory to the Minister or to the Government.

What it really demonstrates is that the Government has no genuine interest in setting up a register in a form that is fair and reasonable and that will work. It simply wishes to play politics with this issue and it does so every couple of years. Senator Evans has made the latest attempt. He is one of a series of government leaders who, every few years, comes in to this place and says, `I am different from the last. I will take this issue seriously. I am putting it on the table. We will pursue it'. He has put down the matter today and he has lost interest in it already.

         We have been back here for a fortnight. We spent the whole of the last fortnight debating the Government's procedural issues. We spent hours and hours in this place debating whether or not speeches should be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. We could have been debating this issue if it had been given the priority which the Minister came in here today and said it had. It demonstrates that there is no real good faith in what the Minister is seeking to do today. It is not a priority of the Government's; if it were, the Government would have given it priority last week or the week before over all of those other procedural matters that it thought were so important. That is why we are not simply going to agree that the motion be declared formal and that it go through without debate. Senator Alston is telling me I have an important phone call which would probably be more useful than what it is going on here.

         The second point relates to the content of the document which the Government has put before us. It is still, in so many ways, meaningless. For example, the document refers to `a holding company or a private company'. This is the problem with the disclosure document of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); it is totally meaningless. It tells us and the public absolutely nothing about his real financial interests. What is the point of having a form of disclosure that is ineffective? That is one of the debates we wanted to have on the last occasion, but the Government did not want to pursue the issue, so it did not debate it. If there is to be a form, it has to be an effective form. The Minister should think about it. What is the point of us knowing about `Gareth Evans Pty Ltd' and that the Minister is a shareholder in it? We do not know what its interests are.

         A disclosure form has to be in a form that genuinely works; otherwise it is a sham, and it is ineffective. It might make the Government feel good to be able to say publicly, `We've progressed this matter', but if it is ineffective it has achieved nothing. The whole complicated issue of spouses' interests and children's issues needs to be properly worked through; it has not been. I see that spouses' interests are still included. We have spouses who are very serious about maintaining their personal privacy.

         I now get to the Minister's last point: he is going to ask us to voluntarily fill in his form. That is not the way to do business in this place. If the Senate wants to set up a structure and a form that has been agreed by the Senate, so be it, but for the Minister to come in and say, `I'm going to invite senators to fill in a form which I think is appropriate' is really quite offensive and unreasonable. What has he said? He has invented the notion that we should lodge it with the President. Why the President? This motion says that details have to be provided to the registrar of Senate interests, but of course there is not a registrar of Senate interests. There is also to be a committee of senators' interests to protect the interests of senators under the Government's own mechanism, but of course that committee does not exist at the moment. It is not to be tabled by individual senators but by the chairman of the committee of senators' interests at the start of each Parliament. That is all inappropriate in these circumstances.

         —by leave—I believe that this is a very serious issue to be dropped on us at this point with very little debate. Although Senator Evans said it has come before the Parliament before, to my knowledge, it has not been formally debated in this chamber since I have been here—that is, since September 1987—although different Ministers have skirmished around the idea in that time. Let me tell the whole Parliament that I am in favour of such a proposal, provided it is within the right sorts of guidelines, and I have told my party that.

         For Senator Evans to come in here, make a statement and ask for his motion to be taken as formal is totally ridiculous.

If I or anyone were to attempt to do it by Tuesday, we would submit what we think we know and then by Wednesday we could be accused of making an inaccurate statement of our financial position of what we own because we had very little time in which to do it.

         That hid the reality that he half-owned this multimillion dollar operation. He says he did not have control because he shared control.

That is just a classic example of how, behind the facade of respectability presented by this kind of statement, we get a complete misleading of the Parliament and the people in respect of his specific interests.

         If there are any matters of substance for the Opposition to raise, these can be dealt with later in the year, after we all have a well-earned winter recess, because of the time wasting of the Opposition. I place on record that we have never seen a commitment from the Liberal Party or the National Party, in opposition or in government, to the principle of declaration of pecuniary interest. We have never seen it in this chamber. Every senator on both sides of the chamber knows it. The Opposition's record is abysmal and its contributions today are gross hypocrisy, and those opposite know it.

         —by leave—Senator Collins has just commented on the passions that arise from talking about procedural matters, and the point has been proven. There are a number of things that can be said about the speech by Senator Faulkner, who preceded me. He made the point that the Opposition had been filibustering in relation to dealing with the procedures of the Senate, a charge which I categorically deny. Nobody is suggesting that the Government does not have the right to put before the Senate the orders under which it wants the Senate to function during the next term, and we have debated them.

         There was a very serious erosion of senator's rights and responsibilities in reducing their right to speak for 30 minutes to 20 minutes during the second reading debate. That was a matter that a lot of senators took very seriously. Many speeches—as was proven from the facts put forward—take less than 20 minutes to deliver, but now and again some speeches take 30 minutes. To suggest that we should come into the chamber and merely agree to that issue in 10 seconds, because that is what the Government wants, is just not the way to run the Senate. There has to be some give and take and some opportunity for senators to express their views on how the Senate should function.

         A most serious change has been on the books as a proposal for a very long time: to remove from the chamber the opportunity to deal with Senate estimates committee reports in detail, as we have done ever since I have been in the Senate. Although that proposal has been in place for a long time, we have not had the chance to debate it. To suggest that senators should come into the chamber and just agree to that proposal without having the opportunity to debate it is to deny the right of the Senate to be a legislative chamber. I think the Government knows that. It has not had its business or legislation before us and there is now a great deal to be dealt with, although I am pleased to say that it has been pruned to slightly more manageable proportions.

         The other attack that Senator Faulkner made was on whether or not we are serious about disclosure. I personally think there are a lot more people than just the politicians involved in politics in this country who should be disclosing their interests. That would apply to a lot of writers and journalists who write and express their views without any of us knowing what their salaries are—

The point that Senator Baume made—and he was unreasonably attacked by Senator Faulkner—was merely to highlight the inadequacy of the form at present. Senators can have millions in a family trust or some sort of a trust and merely disclose that they have an interest—a quarter interest, one-eighth interest or one share—in a family trust, which conveys absolutely nothing about what their financial situation is or what their interests are. Other senators may have shares or own property, and others may have only debts.

The normal concepts of integrity are destroyed once we say to people, `Fill in this little form and you can do as you like'. That is clearly what has happened. I refute and resent the way we have been spoken about by the Government on this issue. I certainly reject this concept that by putting in a form by Tuesday morning everything will be okay, and the implied threat associated with that, especially when we read the motion and know the sorts of penalties that Senator Faulkner has in mind.

         This four-page motion poses some reasonable questions that we are entitled to have answered before complying with the provisions it will impose, especially in view of the penalties for non-compliance, such as incurring the contempt of the Senate for getting something wrong. I could give a $100 cheque to a junior soccer team in my electorate to go on a trip to Darwin or somewhere and finish up in contempt of the Senate if I missed that cheque when going through my electorate accounts. What an absurd situation. It is time the Government had a close look at the definitions needed for this sort of procedure and the information that senators are entitled to before they are asked to fill in such a form. Instead, Senator Evans comes into the chamber and simply says, `Fill this in'. I do not have time between now and next Tuesday to go through my electorate account cheque books and check whether there are $100 cheques which need to be disclosed.

         Obviously Senator Evans does not have enough to do with his time if he is able to spend from now until next Tuesday checking off all the receipts and cheques from his electorate account to prepare the form for next Tuesday. It is outrageous to suggest that that should be done with a motion such as the one we have before us. It should be properly debated and dealt with. I resent the way in which Senator Evans has behaved. He came into this chamber, dropped this proposal on the Senate, stayed for 10 minutes, and then drifted off. He was not even interested in hearing or becoming seriously involved in the debate. He has merely tried to waste the time of the Senate and to that end he has been successful.

        This Bill gives legislative power to a Registrar to obtain from industries using toxic chemicals information pertaining to their use, storage, handling, transportation, recycling and manufacture.

        This Bill will not only provide for a National inventory of all toxic chemicals currently in use in Australia, but also the information relating to the health and environmental effects of toxic chemical use, reports from industry of toxic chemical releases, the production and disposal of toxic chemicals, reports on the emergency procedures that are in place and reports on methods of reducing the use of toxic chemicals.

        The most important and fundamental object of this legislation however, is that all this information is to be made freely available to the community through the Registrar.

        It is stressed that this Bill by no means overrides any other Acts. It does however make a significant contribution to enabling the free access of information to the community. Like the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, and the National Occupational Health and Safety Act, this legislation will encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories—something which is well overdue.

        It is through the recent experience of Coode Island in Melbourne, that we have been reminded of the urgent need for this Legislation. This experience highlights clearly the necessity for the formal dissemination of information concerning toxic chemicals.

        Had this Legislation been in place before the Coode Island disaster, not only would the people of Melbourne's western suburbs have been properly informed as to the exact nature of the chemical release, but the emergency services, media and the rest of Melbourne threatened by the plume of toxic smoke would have been informed as to the health effects and emergency procedures to be put into place.

        Currently if someone wants to obtain information about toxic chemicals they go through the State Environment Protection Authority using the F.O.I. Act. This process has developed an inertia all of its own as ordinary people are expected to negotiate a bureaucratic minefield. Quite often the information is decided on a case by case basis (NSW), or the information is hidden behind the veil of trade secrecy.

        This Legislation should not be considered to be an extension of F.O.I.

        In my state of Victoria there are a number of Legislative provisions which limit information about chemicals to the public. For example information on the types and quantities of chemical products is not available except through The Dangerous Goods Act and Dangerous Goods (Storage and Handling) Regulations 1989 which require appropriate HAZCHEM signs displayed on site or during transportation of chemicals. This provision is solely to assist emergency services and not predicated on any public interest principles.

        There is not enough information on these signs to adequately inform the public of emergency procedures or health effects in case of disaster. Other Victorian legislation deal only with very limited and specific aspects of chemical use eg. The Agricultural Preparations Act 1958.

        1) The establishment of a Registrar, who collects information, as contained in the Objects of the Act, from the chemical industry and makes that information available to the public upon request. This will be done through the creation of an on-line data base, available at local libraries, a 008 phone number or through application to the Registrar's office. Studies both in Australia and overseas have shown that the chemical industry is unwilling to respond directly to community requests for information. Through the establishment of an independent Registrar these barriers will be taken away.

        Only recently thirty companies in Melbourne were surveyed asking for information. To the shame of the industry only eight even responded. Fifteen of these companies belonged to the Chemical Industry body which claims to have its finger on the pulse when it comes to community health and safety concerns. Again if we look at the chemical accidents in the western suburbs of Melbourne 60% (19 out of 32) of all incidents were perpetrated by ACIC members.

        Clearly the environment would benefit greatly from the introduction of this Legislation. As a result of the publicly accessible data base and telephone hotline, the public would be able to discover hitherto secret information about toxic releases from chemical facilities. Facilities would report toxic releases to air, water and land. Already in the United States since the introduction of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act in 1986,

        Obviously industry self-regulation, although attempting to have the community's interests at heart, does not have the required commitment to work openly with the public. This Legislation would make the chemical industry more accountable to the community. Through the provisions in the Bill the public can find out what chemicals a business is using. The Legislation would guarantee public access to chemical information for use in emergency response, pollution prevention and/or control and local community information or action groups. The information would also be useful for land use planning, insurance, property transfer or any other public purpose.

        As a result of this very comprehensive consultative process a large number of suggestions have been made to my office for the improvement of this Bill.

These proposals have been borrowed from other jurisdictions where they have been effective.

        This Bill represents an important step forward in the protection of the health and safety of Australians and the environment in which we live. It is an attempt to bring us up to speed with other parts of the world where there is now a realisation that both the environment and the human race are gravely at risk of extinction if we fail to develop a sustainable approach to the way we live. I look forward to the public debate which this Bill aims to engender with the resultant response from the Labor and Coalition parties as they grapple with the community's expectation that they place the health and safety of people and their living environment ahead of the profits of the large corporations which have come to rely so heavily on the chemical industry. This conflict is not new. Indeed, in the next decade, I doubt there will be any other political dynamic which will so dominate the thinking, discussion and action of our nations body politic. I look forward to further community response to the Bill and commend it to the Senate.

In seeking leave to withdraw my notice of motion, I welcome the fact that the Senate has accepted the Liberal and National parties' demand that the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill be given the careful and proper consideration it requires and, as well, to involve the Australian community in the desirable consultation processes. That would not have been possible under the Government's initial proposal which was to rush the Bill through the Parliament. The Bill seeks to abolish the oath or affirmation of allegiance made by new citizens on the grant of citizenship and to replace it with a so-called pledge that omits any reference to the Crown, the Constitution or any of our basic national institutions without consultation, and in a pre-emptive, pre-emptory and divisive manner. The fact that the Senate will now be considering the Bill in its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs over the next couple of months and reporting back to the Senate at the start of the next session is a welcome development. Accordingly, because of the redundant nature of my notice of motion, I withdraw it.

I gave an undertaking that I would cooperate to the fullest extent in providing the Senate with documents that were not covered by Cabinet-in-confidence problems or commercial-in-confidence difficulties. After officers of my department had looked at this for two or three days, I was advised that because of the all-encompassing nature of the request—the Senate might be interested in knowing this—departmental officers had identified in excess of 113,000 pages of documents that could potentially be caught up in such a request. Each page would have to be checked for compliance. That concern was relayed back to Senator Alston and Senator Bourne. I have not yet had an opportunity to look at the details of the motion that is before the chamber now. I indicate my thanks to Senator Alston for narrowing the focus of the paper.

        This motion is very similar to the disallowance motion I moved last year relating to the increase in the minimum payment to students under Austudy. Last year the Government, as part of its 1991 Budget, increased the minimum payment to $5. This year it will increase the minimum payment to $20 per week. That means that the minimum possible payment that a student could receive under Austudy is $1,000 per year.

         For many people, that might not sound like a great deal of money, especially when it is fragmented into 52 payments of $20 per week, but for many families, especially low income families and larger middle income families with children at secondary school or attending tertiary studies, whose income is slightly higher than would be the case if they qualified for full Austudy, $1,000 a year is a tremendous sum of money. It represents the cost of purchasing textbooks, uniforms, transport and all the other costs associated with education which have so greatly increased for so many families over the past few years.

         I understand that the Government is seeking to ensure that administration costs in relation to Austudy are reduced. In relation to this particular measure, I went to see the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) last year to see if there was some way that administrative savings could be made without disadvantaging families, especially those middle income families with a large number of children.

         I put it to the Minister that perhaps a more streamlined way of dealing with the administrative burden of a large number of small payments would be to make these smaller payments in, say, two lump sums per year, one at the beginning and another half-way through the year. In that way larger middle-income families would not be disadvantaged by the loss of $1,000 per year in Austudy. On the other side of the coin the Government could certainly save some money through implementing what would be, in my mind, a very sensible administrative move.

         The Minister, to his credit, listened to what I had to say and gave my remarks some consideration, but I had the strong feeling that by that time the Budget had come down the $14 million saving had already been factored into the Government's Budget deficit and it was all too late to change. As a result we have this regulation before us today and I find myself once again seeking to disallow a very regressive measure which impacts hardest on those middle-income families with a large number of children at school. I refer to schools in particular because last year when this Budget measure was announced I asked the Minister then representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Senator Cook, how many students would be affected by this measure.

Of that 38,000, 8,000 are tertiary students and a massive 30,000 so affected are secondary students. I put it to the Senate that 30,000 students is a very large number. Therefore, this measure hits very hard those middle-income families with a large number of children at school—at school, not at university. This is a very serious measure which affects an enormous number of people who are struggling to make ends meet and facing higher living costs and higher costs of sending children to school.

         In implementing this particular Budget measure the Government was doing what we saw it do quite a bit last year—that is, it was picking the eyes out of the Fightback package. In Fightback the coalition proposed to lift the minimum payment from $20 per week to $30 per week, which would clearly have seen many more than the 38,000 students affected by this move cut off the Austudy list. In fact, it would have raised the annual minimum payment from $1,000 to over $1,600. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that, again for large families with children at school that represents a very large amount of money that will no longer come into the family budget and that this will seriously affect the capacity of those families to send their children to school and to meet all those ongoing small costs that doubtless these amounts of Austudy have been used to offset.

         I would further submit that this is yet more evidence of the Government seeking to squeeze those middle-income families and larger families. It is seeking to gradually tighten up regulations and tighten up the Austudy budget in such a way as to seriously disadvantage many in our community. We have already seen this happen in a range of ways. Not only do we have this measure today, but last year we saw the implementation of yet another regulation which has meant that students are now slugged with a 20 per cent interest payment on Austudy overpayments. In reports to this chamber in the past, the audit office has indicated that there is a very serious deficiency of administration in the Department of Employment, Education and Training which has meant that many of these overpayments occur as a result of departmental bungling. Yet students are being asked to fork out additional interest payments if for some reason they are unable to meet their obligations, even when these overpayments occur due to genuine error or administrative bungling.

         At that time the point I made to the Senate was that the impost of 20 per cent interest in fact bore no relation to current market interest rates and did not accurately correspond with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as the Government last year purported it did. So once again we saw the Government penalising students with punitive measures and doing it through regulation rather than through legislation.

         I believe that the increasing incidence of regulation and delegated legislation is a very serious matter which must be dealt with by the Senate in coming years. We have seen this Government—and, I guess, all governments—move towards implementing policies through vast numbers of regulations which, of course, cannot be scrutinised by this chamber with the same degree of effectiveness as legislation can be. In fact, these particular regulations were tabled on the last day of sitting last year and have been in force since 1 January. The Government used the regulatory measure to get around the scrutiny of the parliament in the hope that nobody would notice. There was an election, and it thought that other things would take precedence, so it got away with simply delegating this responsibility once again to bureaucrats, thereby avoiding the scrutiny of the parliament.

For example, I would like to see implemented a standing order or a procedural mechanism whereby a regulation could in fact be amended by this chamber rather than simply disallowed. I think that would be a far more positive way of having input to the legislative process than simply disallowing the regulation and saying to the department, `Go back and start again'. I would like to see us have much more input in actually redrafting and reforming regulations so that we can have much more control and much more scrutiny over what is being presented to us by departments.

         I have promised honourable senators that I will not continue my remarks for too long, because we have a lot of business to get through, and I understand that the Opposition will not be supporting this motion of disallowance. I remind the Opposition that this regulation is precisely the kind of measure that lost it government on 13 March. It is precisely this kind of punitive measure that the electorate rejected and which made the electorate wonder whether the coalition had a social heart. The coalition needs to go back to the drawing board and assess where it stands on social policy and the delivery of welfare in this country. If the coalition turns up to the next election with a document that is similar to Fightback, the electorate will reject its policies once again. The coalition has a lot of work to do.

         —Senator Sowada has moved to disallow a regulation giving effect to a government Budget decision which would increase the minimum payment under Austudy to $1,000 a year; it was previously $250. This is a savings measures and means that students whose allowance would have come to less than $1,000 on the means test taper do not receive any Austudy payment. Some 38,000 students are expected to be affected at an annual saving of $28.8 million.

         However, students in secondary courses would instead be entitled to receive a family payment of $10.35 a week from the Department of Social Security. Affected students in tertiary study would be entitled to an Austudy loan, known as a category 2 supplement, of $2,000. These special loans apply to students who are above the parental income test limit for an Austudy grant but who have a parental income of less than $50,000 a year. These loans require no trade-in of the Austudy grant, unlike the category 1 Austudy supplement, but clearly carry the same very generous interest and repayment provisions as normal Austudy loans.

         In the 1992-93 Budget, the Government made significant improvements to Austudy and Abstudy, which are the major student support schemes. These improvements have provided more generous and flexible support to help alleviate the difficulties faced by many students. In particular, students will benefit from a lowering of the age of independence from 25 years progressively down to 22 years by 1995. In 1993, students will qualify from 24 years of age. For students reaching this age, the parental means test will not apply. In addition, a 20 per cent increase in the personal income test threshold will allow Austudy students to earn up to $6,000 in 1992-93 before affecting their entitlement.

         Existing allowances are now indexed so that they will keep pace with increases in the cost of living. This has been legislated for in the Student Assistance Act. These changes involved a significant increase in funds available for Austudy and Abstudy to about $1.5 billion in 1992-93. This was due to an estimated increase in the number of beneficiaries from around 510,000 to about 560,000, including those who will benefit from the Austudy-Abstudy supplement.

         The Opposition does not support the disallowance motion moved this morning by Senator Sowada of the Australian Democrats. We believe the account Senator Faulkner has just given of the Budget decision is an accurate one and one that the Opposition supported at the time. Indeed, we wanted to go further and call for a proper review of Austudy. We welcome the Chapman review and the implementation of its major findings—that is, the loans scheme that has been added to Austudy. But we still believe that Austudy is not well managed. It still requires review to ensure that it is fair and is seen, especially by students, to be fair.

         Let me focus on the Austudy question that is involved in the regulation that Senator Sowada's motion seeks to disallow. I must first refer to the principle of equal opportunity of access to education. The Liberal and National parties support very strongly equality of opportunity to education. Through student allowance schemes—through the support of students at tertiary and secondary levels—we wish to see equality of opportunity achieved. At the same time, it is our responsibility to be accountable to all taxpayers for the spending of their money in a way which is fair and balanced—in terms of the interests of students to have access to education, on the one hand; and the interests of taxpayers to have a minimum reasonable level of taxation, on the other.

         For years the Democrats have consistently argued that all students should have access to Austudy. The Democrats are not happy with the independent rate of allowance. They want to see a vast extension of the numbers of students who would be free of the parental means test so that they could gain the Austudy allowance. At the moment, if students come from moderately or very wealthy families, they are not eligible for Austudy allowances because it is seen that they have a means of support from their parents' income—even if they are aged 18, 19, 20, 21 and so on. It is only at age 24 that they are deemed to be independent.

         I want to be fair to the Democrats. On the one hand, they have consistently gone to campuses and said, `Write your cheque; tell us what you want. We'll support you; we'll give student allowances'. Then, on the other hand, they are embarrassed when all the promises they make to the electorate add up to a burden of billions of dollars in extra taxes which would be laid upon the Australian people. Indeed, the Democrats do understand that they are a high-taxing party. They did not want to see the tax cuts that have been put in place by the present Government. They did not want to see the tax cuts that the Liberal and National parties were offering. They want to have higher taxes and they want to have more schemes to benefit groups such as students.

         The Liberal and National parties have called for additional benefits in one area—that is, for the children of rural families suffering as a consequence of the rural depression. Many students, tertiary and secondary, have been cut off from any Austudy benefit purely on the basis of the asset value of the farm, not because there is any income in the family. This has led to very serious deprivation for these students who have had to stop their studies. So in this area there is a need for more compassion on the part of the Labor Party and a recognition of the impact of the rural recession upon these families.

         In the generality, I have debated education policies on campuses as much as any senator over the last 15 years. Senator Sowada referred to those of us who have debated on campuses. During the last election campaign I proudly went to all of the campuses in my State of South Australia and I defended the policies which I believed were going to improve the education outcomes for students. I did so alongside speakers from the Labor Party and speakers from the Democrats—the Democrats president and the second Senate candidate in South Australia, a young man who spoke very earnestly and very well for the Democrats alongside Senator Crowley and me on one such occasion. Other representatives of the Democrats also debated with me. I believed I was well received in the campuses of my own State of South Australia and I do not duck any debate at any time on any campus, especially when it is against the inadequacies of the Labor Government's provision for education.

In the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, in March 1991—that is a little more than two years ago now—there was a very well considered report on student financial assistance. One of the matters that this committee unanimously agreed upon—and we must give some credit to a large, well established House of Representatives committee—was stated on page 18 as follows:

         I conclude by responding to Senator Sowada's comment that the Democrats had the appropriate policy on this matter. It is true that they took a clear policy to the election last March, but the Democrat vote went down from 13 per cent to four per cent. One of the reasons for that was the excessive taxation which would inevitably follow the implementation of the announced Democrat policies, including this one. I say on behalf of the Liberal and National parties that we will not be supporting the disallowance motion, and we call upon the Government to complete the review of Austudy so that it is seen to be well managed and fair.

         —I would like to congratulate Senator Sowada for having moved this motion to disallow section 51 of the Austudy regulations. The motion seeks to redress an injustice; to redress a blatant discrimination perpetrated by this Government and supported by the Opposition against large families, particularly—I notice Senator Panizza is in the chamber—those large families from the bush. Senator Sowada is trying to redress that injustice and discrimination. What the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner), who was previously at the table, said has virtually nothing to do with what Senator Sowada advanced for the disallowance of section 51 of the Austudy regulations, which says:

       </para>
       <para>
        That is $20 a week. So the Government is trying to cut down on those who are in receipt of $20 a week or less. As Senator Sowada said—and as I said last year in debates in this chamber on these matters—that means a lot to families with three, four and five students. It particularly means a lot to families in the bush with three, four or five students because, once we cut out the $20 a week or whatever it is, they are then no longer eligible for the incidentals, including the support for return visits to home each year. That is also scrapped by this regulation. So it is a double whammy against families with a number of sons and daughters who are students and, incidentally, who have to go away from home into the cities to attend tertiary or secondary educational institutions.

         I am very surprised to hear that the only response by the Opposition to this question is that it will not deter those families from sending their sons and daughters to tertiary or secondary education. That is just one point. But it is not the essential point. The essential point is a matter of pure and simple tax equity. It would be a different matter if families were able to claim a tax deduction for the money that is expended on the education of their children. But they are not entitled to claim that. Up to 1976 we were able to claim a tax deduction for the education of our children. That is no longer the case. It is extraordinary that it is no longer the case since recent developments in economic theory have emphasised the importance of investing in human capital. Australia needs to not only invest in creating future workers but also ensure that they are trained and skilled to match the best world standards.

         We hear it repeatedly stated by Government members, over and over again, that one of the best ways of overcoming the drastic unemployment problem with which Australia is faced is to invest in human capital and the education and training of our young people. But when we try to do that, we find no taxation recognition of expenditure on education at all—none. That is an injustice. Unfortunately, the major expenses undertaken by parents in meeting the educational costs of their children are not recognised by the tax system. Businesses and businessmen can claim deductions for attending all sorts of seminars of more of less educational merit, but ordinary workers get absolutely nothing for the out-of-pocket expenses of educating their children. This injustice suffered by families because the taxation system will not recognise their educational expenses, needs to be placed on the priority list for consideration by the Government in this forthcoming Budget session.

         I come back to the point which I have made more stridently in recent times and that is the injustice of failing to acknowledge for taxation purposes the fact that an income is shared by a large number of people in a family where there are three, four, five or six children. I am not making any pleas so far as I concerned because I am not involved in Austudy at all. However, we need to look at the effects of the regulation which Senator Sowada has moved to disallow and the regulation which was introduced last year to change the sibling concession.

         Let us take the situation of a farmer in the bush who has three children at university. The family income is $36,000 a year. What would happen if that farmer tried to earn an additional few dollars by pulling petrol or beer at the local servo? For every extra dollar earned, the children would lose 75c in their Austudy allowance, and the farmer would have to pay tax on the extra income. If his income were $36,000, he would be taxed at 46 per cent. He would have to pay 46c for every extra dollar he earns, plus 1.4 per cent of his income for the Medicare levy. For every extra dollar he earned, his children would lose about $1.25 in Austudy payments. There is not much merit in that, is there?

         What sort of justice is there in the regulations when that situation exists?  People ought to have a good, hard look at what they are doing in this particular area. The reason why students lose 75c for every dollar earned is because of the change to the sibling concession. Honourable senators would remember that last year I moved for the disallowance of that concession. I was supported very strongly by Senator Sowada. The unfairness of that situation has gone over the heads of both government and coalition members.

         Here we have a situation where 38,000 students are going to be affected. Those students are mainly from middle income, large family groups who are struggling to make ends meet. They are the ones who are battling. They are the ones who are paying their way. These people are the new poor. They sometimes have to rely on the St Vincent de Paul Society or the Salvation Army for help. Very often they are temporarily strapped for cash for a year or two because of their overcommitment to mortgage repayments and various other commitments. This is another attack on those families. It is a ludicrous situation. The Government is saying, `$20 is not much. It doesn't mean anything.' It means a heck of a lot to these people.

         I will now address the motion before us, which is that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1993 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993 be read a second time. On behalf of the Opposition, I note that we do not oppose the two measures but we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill. This amendment will provide that in addition to the 17 commissioners of ATSIC, who are elected through regional councils, there be a continuation of the two commissioners appointed by the Government and that the Chairman of ATSIC be appointed by the Government as one of the 19 commissioners who would comprise the commission. I now authorise the circulation of an amendment which stands in my name, copies of which I have already given to the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) and to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who represents the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner).

Those areas where there have been some sharp differences between both sides in policy have been clearly and forcefully argued by Dr Wooldridge and the coalition generally. But in the majority of areas—particularly those which touch upon the reconciliation process, making ATSIC genuinely workable and the outcome of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody—the  matters have been very maturely, carefully, sensitively and intelligently addressed by the Minister and the shadow Minister.

Accordingly, on behalf of the coalition I welcome the Government's broad acceptance of the coalition's approach and I welcome the views expressed by the commissioners of ATSIC through its chairperson and my good friend, Miss Lois O'Donoghue.

         With the Government's approval, ATSIC set up a review of the operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. For that review, the commission established a review steering committee which comprised several commissioners, including the chairperson; the chief executive officer of ATSIC, Dr Shergold; a special counsel from the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Willheim; and the First Assistant Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Richardson.

         I welcome the smaller size of the commission, in particular the smaller number of regional councils. This amending Bill shifts the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The delineation of these new regions has been usefully set out in very colourful maps that have been produced by ATSIC and by the Minister. I am sure these maps are widely available to those honourable senators who are interested to see the new arrangements.

         The smaller number of regional councils makes it financially possible for the chairpersons of the 36 regions to fulfil their responsibilities full time. Instead of receiving a part-time salary, they will now receive a full-time salary. That means that they can put their minds and energies entirely to the task of representing their region and carry out, with their staff, the executive functions of each region. Whereas in the past there was a limited number of full-time commissioners—and, indeed, that applies even now—following the election of the new ATSIC commissioners later this year, all ATSIC commissioners will be full-time employees receiving full-time salaries. This will enable them to liaise with the regions they represent and to bring their full minds and energies to the work of the commission.

         I will elaborate on the Opposition's amendment when we get to the committee stage, but the principal reason for the coalition—and, I believe, the Democrats—urging the retention of two appointed commissioners in addition to the 17 elected is to enable flexibility in the avenues that are available for people to become members of the commission and for the overwhelming balance to be elected. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs may well need to ensure that there is some precise qualification in one of the commissioners, such as an accounting, management or legal knowledge. The Minister should be able to make sure that the commissioners have such a person among their numbers. Similarly, there should be flexibility—after consultation with the regions, the Opposition, a representative of the Democrats, the reconciliation commission and those other informed groups and persons in Australia—to appoint a chairman who may be the best appointment, even if not coming through the regional council and zone avenue to the ATSIC council.

         There is one other reason for taking this initiative: in addition to the accountability mechanisms already in place, we believe that there will be an additional accountability mechanism for two members of ATSIC to have a special sense of responsibility to ensure that there is accountability for what is looking like about one per cent of Commonwealth expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. An amount of $100 billion is spent each year by the Commonwealth and about one per cent of that—towards $1 billion—is given to ATSIC for the needs of Aboriginal communities around Australia. That is a sizeable commitment of public moneys. There are already four or five accountability mechanisms in place and this initiative makes for another.

         I refer briefly to the second Bill—the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. The Opposition welcomes this measure, as it reflects agreement between all the parties involved. Three parcels of land will be added to the schedule of Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. These three additions have been carefully discussed by all the relevant parties. The first parcel of land is in the Tennant Creek area—land known as the Kanturrpa-Kanttaji—and goes into the schedule as part of an agreement that secures Tennant Creek's water supply. It has the full support of the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority and the Central Land Council. Because there is such unanimity, this is a measure that ought to be supported.

         The second and third areas are called Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley. They are near Mount Todd. Agreement between the Northern Territory Government, the Jawoyn association and the mining company Zapopan NL makes it possible for a goldmining venture in that area of Mount Todd to proceed. We note the agreement with regard to Mount Todd and these two areas of land; therefore, we agree to the amendment. However, I note that some concern has been expressed by sections of the mining community about the Mount Todd land only. There have been concerns about threats made of pursuing land claims of a Mabo type which would have delayed an outcome. Some degree of compromise is involved to enable this to be more swiftly and clearly determined.

         Background deals involving any degree of threat or lack of openness in the arrangements that lead to the Government bringing an amendment before us are always of concern to senators. I just express that concern because it is exceptional to have land added to the schedule in this way. It has not been of sufficient substance in its expression to us to lead us not to agree with the amending Bill that is before us. With those words, and noting that several of my colleagues will address these Bills, I support the second reading of the two Bills.

         I think we have to acknowledge that in its only three years of existence ATSIC has demonstrated real commitment to accountability. I remember all the speeches that have been made in this place about our not being tough enough on this commission and not requiring the same accountability standards that we would require of similar bodies. I think it can be argued that in ATSIC's first period of operation it has demonstrated great commitment to accountability. ATSIC has made extremely difficult decisions. It has been proven that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations have not performed in such things as the acquittal of funds and service delivery of decisions they may have taken as councils. I have been very impressed with the strict accountability standards that we have seen from the chairperson and from the commissioners in general.

         There has been agreement in a couple of areas. We agree on the reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. I think we can acknowledge that ATSIC has had a huge task in servicing the ordinary meeting needs of 60 regional councils. We also agree on the full-time appointment of commissioners and regional council chairpersons. It is a full-time job which dominates the lives of these people, and they deserve to be financially compensated and to have the status of full-time commissioners and council chairpersons.

         Our one area of disagreement concerns how we arrive at the appointment of a chairperson of the commission. Rather than speak for others, I will quote Mr Terry O'Shane, whose views reflect the views of many Aboriginal people who have spoken to me on this issue. In a letter to the Minister, Mr Robert Tickner, dated 11 May 1993, Mr O'Shane said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The question of the election of the Chairperson is a very sensitive issue, the community of Cairns in four different meetings opposed this idea and recommended that the Chairperson remain as an appointment, we don't believe the process of self determination is served in any way at this early stage in the development of ATSIC.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The process of self determination will not be served by the election process—it is our collective opinion that those people who have the skills to handle the Chairperson's job are in employment already and would not consider leaving their positions to take a chance on a vote, the only way they would consider the position would be if it was guaranteed by appointment and a proper employment package was negotiated.

We believe that there are some special requirements the Chairperson would need, to handle the job effectively, these include a good working knowledge of the issues concerning Aboriginal People rural and urban, experience at a high level of administration, an ability to mix freely with foreign dignitaries and understand the protocol required on these occasions and to also understand the protocols when dealing with our own communities, this person would need to have their integrity intact and their honesty beyond doubt, they would need to have a proven track record in all areas, they would require the ability to give direction to the Commission, direction to the Commissioners and direction to the administration.

We all have to accept that Mabo now means that, for the first time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people come to the negotiating table with the legitimate status of negotiators. That is a good thing. The outcome may be protracted, but in the interests of reconciliation legal status is a good thing for this country.

I want to take only a few minutes to support the matters mentioned by my colleague Senator Baden Teague in presenting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill on behalf of the Liberal and National parties.

         I am pleased to hear that Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats will be supporting us. I would never have accused Senator Kernot of having a paternalistic or maternalistic attitude towards Aborigines. As my colleague said, we support the legislation because it principally takes into account the policy and position the Liberal and National parties took into the last election for ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That policy was prepared and formulated principally by the then shadow Minister, now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Dr Michael Wooldridge, who spent a great number of months consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups.

I am sure the Government will take up many more of the Opposition's policies over the next three years, as well it should. The Government has got itself into an enormous mess in most areas of government responsibility. The only way the Government is likely to get out of it is by having a good look through the Opposition's packages presented at the last election and adopting some of those proposals, of course, with the exception of any new tax proposals.

The community's only source of income is from the canteen and I think it is an atrocious situation where, for that community to exist and progress, it has to rely on the profit it makes from selling alcohol at its community canteen. The people have asked Ms Warner to transfer the shopping complex to them, so that they can use that $600,000 to $700,000 net profit for the benefit of their community. They have had no response from Ms Warner. I wrote to her on 2 March. At this time I have not even been favoured with an acknowledgment.

That was never advised to me and, I might add—I am happy for the paper to be laid out—neither was there any reason for it to be, because the advice that was being sought, and the Senate will have it, was whether the Commonwealth had a strong case for getting the court to confirm the revocation.

         When the court case was not resolved in the way that our advice suggested it would be, it was then also assumed by the legal advisers that the court taking over the process meant—I quoted from the court order yesterday, the one that Mr Stokes quoted this morning, and I quote it again—that the Commonwealth `should accept and treat as valid any tender or revised tender complying with a ministerial direction under which the tender process was conducted'.

        I am not sure how much more clear-cut the advice could be. I agreed with every word Kerry Stokes said this morning. He and I both thought—the lay people to whom Mr Gyles referred—we had a reasonable understanding, that we had a consent order, with the court saying that the process was valid and would then continue. If Mr Stokes can succeed in persuading the Federal Court that is the view it should take, I will be perfectly happy. Regrettably, however, I doubt that will be the case.

         Senator Carr is right: on 14 May SCOCAM—the Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers—finally reached agreement on uniform credit laws. One aspect of the agreement—credit card fees—has received a fair degree of publicity. The Government's view is that a move here will take away the last excuse the banks possess for maintaining their current unconscionably high level of interest rates on credit cards.

         There was also a range of benefits agreed to last week which the Senate should know about. Uniform credit legislation will provide benefits by redressing situations where present credit laws are inconsistent—namely, the type of product covered; the monetary jurisdiction involved; the sorts of credit providers involved; the laws that presently apply; the degree of price control; and the degree of consumer protection. These inconsistencies make it impossible for consumers to find their way through the law. They also provide a massive hindrance to national micro-economic reform. We are talking about achieving uniformity, not only across States and Territories but also in the law's application to the bodies involved and to consumers, no matter what part of the market they are in.

         The basic features of this uniform law are to protect consumers by truth in lending provisions and to ensure that the provisions apply to all credit providers. The main features talk about pre-contractual disclosure of all fees and charges, the provision of regular statements, adequate notice, capacity to renegotiate contracts in times of hardship, capacity to open a contract in situations where there are unfair provisions, capped civil penalties and proper disclosure. These are all basic and important protections for consumers—protections which to date consumers have not had in a whole range of credit transactions.

We will also ask the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor credit card pricing for three years, and for a full inquiry during that three year term into pricing practices.

         This is an important agreement that will be progressed by legislation in the near future. Legislation prepared by Senator Tate in June or July 1992 will be revised in view of the decisions taken last week. By 1 August 1993 State governments also will take measures concerning credit card fees. The agreement last week will lead to legislation which will apply in all the States, with some minor deviation as to technical detail in Western Australia. It is legislation which has been long in coming but which is necessary for the marketplace.

         Mr Stokes said this morning that he thought we had a consent order from the court—so did I and so did my departmental secretary, for good reason which I have just quoted.

I would hope, along with Mr Stokes, that when it goes back to court Mr Justice Lee will say, `Look, Commonwealth, to hell with your QCs and to hell with your AGs. I validated this process in terms of this order, and it will proceed'. That would be a very good result as far as I am concerned, but I fear the lawyers will be right.

         Unfortunately, because of this technical legal defect, an opportunity could exist for a shonky bid to upset a genuine bid. So the bottom line on this, which I am sure Mr Stokes will appreciate when he reads the legal advice, is that I very unhappily took this back to Cabinet and very unhappily recommended revocation of the order in order to protect genuine bidders such as Mr Stokes from the admittedly outside chance of their genuine bid being upset by an exploitation by a shonky bidder of this technical defect.

As to the correct apportionment of responsibility, I think that the Senate will be in a very good position to determine that when we have the results of Professor Pearce's report in front of us.

         I can say to Senator Harradine that it is not new that approaches would be made to the Government to abandon the scheme. They are from time to time by people who think it is too expensive; that Tasmanians should be left to hang dry in terms of their isolation from the mainland—that it is their fault for choosing to live there. Senator Harradine will understand, but as I come from regional Australia and as I have an unashamed regional bias, I can say that that is not an argument that ever weighs very heavily with me. I am sure that National Party senators will agree with me that good government policy requires that the people who choose to live in places other than Sydney and Melbourne be given some consideration by government policy.

I also refer the Minister to his answer to Senator Kernot's question last Thursday in which he boldly embraced the trickle-down economic theories in defence of the Government's scheduled $8 billion tax cuts. I ask the Minister: in the light of international experience and mounting evidence here, when will the Government exorcise the ghosts of Thatcherism, abandon trickle-down economic theories and unaffordable tax cuts, and come to grips with the need for specific, targeted measures such as a jobs levy, a tariff freeze and a sector by sector approach to industry assistance to protect and create jobs?

That is not in the slightest a sensible interpretation of what I said. I am sorry if I said it too simply. I will give a lengthy answer some other time. The fact of the matter is that nothing I said should underestimate the fact that there is a substantial number of Australians—some as a result of the significant recession through which we have just come, others for all sorts of other reasons to do with personal difficulties that would have arisen irrespective of economic circumstances, and others for reasons of structural change in the economy—facing serious economic difficulty. It is the responsibility of a number of agencies, including all levels of government, to seek to provide assistance to them. I will not start announcing what, if any, policy changes we will have in the Budget to assist them here and now.

         Let me give just one example. Last year the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a publication on the results of a study on the effects of government benefits and taxes on the distribution of income amongst private Australian households in the fiscal year 1988-89. After taking account of the tax transfer system, the income share of the 20 per cent of households with the lowest incomes increased from 0.8 per cent to 7.6 per cent. This group paid 2.8 per cent of all taxes and received 24.7 per cent of total benefits. That is not something one can extend indefinitely and say, `Therefore, if we had 100 per cent of the income being redistributed everybody would be better off'. The laws of arithmetic do not allow that. But it does say that there is a substantial amount of redistribution going on at the moment.

         The Salvation Army study, together with dozens of others, did not say anything unique. It simply reinforced what is widely known: a large number of Australians are in need of assistance—not just from government, but including from government, not just from the Federal Government, but including from the Federal Government. The figures I have quoted are just an example of the way in which some of that assistance is being provided. The Budget will indicate further measures which the Government intends to continue to provide that assistance.

The social security system is, with the tax system, undertaking a fundamental redistribution. For so long as we have a progressive taxation system and a strong social welfare system that will continue to be the case. But that is not a basis for complacency, for saying that therefore nothing more needs to be done. Nobody that I am aware of is saying that. I certainly am not. I am simply asserting that the facts make it clear that a combination of a progressive tax system—that is, rejecting regressive tax options—and significant welfare initiatives, for example, the family allowance supplement, combine to be significantly redistributive. That is always the case. It continues to be the case.

However, I would say that, on the whole, the comments made by Mr Yahiro during a speech he made at the Australian embassy reception for Mr Arnold were very positive. Although he acknowledged that the MFP had been affected by the global economic downturn, he also indicated that there was still strong continuing interest by Japan in the MFP. He focused on progress made by the MFP in spite of these international economic conditions, including the establishment of the MFP Development Corporation, chaired by Mr Alex Morokoff, and comprising members from the Australian business community, the appointment of the corporation board itself, the appointment of Mr Ross Kennan, the chief executive officer of the MFP Development Corporation Board, the establishment of the close links with the international advisory body and the continuing strong interest by the Japanese through the Japanese support organisation. He also made very positive reference to the Arnold Government's recent economic policy statement `Meet the Challenge'.

         It is right to say that Australian design and construction in high-speed ferries is the world's leading technology. Our naval architects have used the light material of aluminium, aircraft technology and Australian design and water-jet propulsion systems to create for this country a global reputation of high quality manufacture and supply of ferries of this type. The catamaran design which we have developed in this country too, especially the wave-piercing catamaran, enjoys internationally a very high reputation.

I also refer to the fact that independent forecasters are predicting that a `no change policy' would produce a deficit in 1996-97 of more like $12 billion to $13 billion or $8 billion higher than the Government's stated target. Would this not mean that taxes will either have to rise by $8 billion or the personal income tax cuts be cancelled and/or a massive program of expenditure cuts initiated? Is it a fact that the Government has ruled out major expenditure cuts? If so, will the Government raise taxes by the $8 billion required to meet its undertaking or cancel the promised personal income tax cuts?

If we were to use both articles 12 and 19 of the GATT, if we were to succumb to Senator Spindler's blandishment, those articles would require us to consult with our trading partners so that those trading partners could agree that the balance of payments was in a parlous state such that would justify us making that application and would require us to obtain approval from the IMF as well.

The most significant step that this Government will take to improve the competitiveness of Australian industry in the very near future is to press ahead with its tax cuts for company taxation, reducing the tax from 39c in the dollar to 33c in the dollar. If one takes those cuts, together with reductions in the depreciation allowance that we have made, in Australia we now have a corporate tax regime which is below that of many ASEAN economies and competitive with the lowest taxed economies in the ASEAN area.

         The final comment I make about general balance of payments matters is that certainly there has been some reduction in commodity prices which affect our trade balance and are core to a good outcome in the trade balance, but the most important development in our trade account has been the growth in manufactured goods and provision of services. Australia's record of exports of manufactured goods and sophisticated services, particularly to this region, has been outstanding and the diversification of our export mix under this Government is one of the achievements of record.

We have also indicated that there will be a year 13 pilot program, that these courses will extend into the TAFE area, and that we are also supporting and recognising what Wollongong University is doing in an independent way in developing its own postgraduate learning units.

         —The changes that have taken place and the developments that have been undertaken at old Parliament House would have been a source of pleasure and satisfaction for most honourable senators. It was recently reported that the national museum had `millions to spend'—I think I have that correct—on old Parliament House. While that may literally be true, if one takes enough years into account, I think it is a somewhat unhelpful remark. It does not give the correct impression of what is a fairly lean operation. Nevertheless, I think what is taking place is quite important, and a lively program of activities in the building is developing.

         The program that has been developed by the national museum has contributed substantially to the development of old Parliament House since it was reopened as a major tourist venue. I am advised that, since December last year, it has attracted over 44,000 visitors. Honourable senators can see that, in the period since December, it has been quite successful, indicating that it is a very worthwhile initiative and one to which the people of Australia are responding enthusiastically. I am happy to say that I always thought that would be the case. I was active in seeking to persuade the Government that it should undertake this move, and I am delighted that it has.

         The National Museum of Australia currently offers a changing exhibition program and operates walking tours of the building. We are investigating a wider range of other experiences for visitors. As honourable senators would probably know, some of the key areas of old Parliament House were opened to the public on 15 December 1992, and the initial exhibition was called `The art of politics'. I thought it was going to be a speaking tour by Fred Daly, but it was a display of political cartoons, of which Australia also has a great history and tradition.

That exhibition was replaced by another, `Our Canberra—celebrating 80 years', which focused on the region and the connections with old Parliament House. On 7 June 1993 a new major exhibition will be opened, entitled `Landmarks', and a range of interpretative programs is being developed for 1993-94. As most honourable senators will be aware, there is an old Parliament House redevelopment committee. It is chaired by former Senator Douglas McClelland and its members include former senators representing all the major parties. There is Mr Chipp, there is Mr Davidson and I think there is a representative of the National Party; I think it is a former member of the House of Representatives. The National Party is slipping a bit there.

I would need to take on notice what that exactly means and find out the detail. The question was whether the dollars were matched. That presumes that the people who were raising those dollars understood which organisations' dollars would be matched. My understanding is that the dollars raised by major organisations such as St Vincent de Paul, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Salvation Army were matched. I am advised that the major non-government organisations raising the money were matched. But if there is further information about this matter, I shall find it and provide it to the honourable senator.

The bank's disbursements are governed by legally binding instruments. Disbursements cannot be suspended unless the country is in serious default under the contractual terms of the loan or credit. The Burmese Government has continued to meet all of its contractual obligations with regard to the nine projects for which the bank is still disbursing.

In fact, it is an IBRD loan under the World Bank auspices repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace at the bank's standard variable interest rate.

         While  this  type  of  loan  is  not  as concessional as an IDA loan, it is still more concessional than commercial loans that would otherwise be made available to PNG. When mixed on a parallel basis with concessional financing from the Asian Development Fund—the ADF—and grant financing from AIDAB the financing of the project as a whole is, as I said yesterday, very soft indeed.

        This morning there are three editorials in three different newspapers which are of some interest, particularly as they precede the latest charade in Question Time today. The
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        newspaper of today—stating the blindingly obvious, I would have thought—states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It has been a bad couple of weeks for the federal Communications Minister, Senator Collins. In fact they have been so bad that he is unlikely ever to recover politically . . . The Government's handling of pay-TV has been appalling for quite some time, but it has now become farcical . . . And if ministerial responsibility has any real meaning, Senator Collins ought to go.

        The
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Canberra Times
        </emphasis>
        has a very good quotation, given that Senator Collins seems to be pulling quotations out of everywhere, except those that have direct relevance to his personal responsibility. The article states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When Winston Churchill was attacked over the fall of Singapore, he said, "I didn't know. I was not told. I should have asked". This is one of the few quotations which Bob Collins, Minister for Transport and Communications, has not quoted in recent weeks, but as the debacle over pay television and an appalling performance over tenders continues, it might prove the one which was most apt. Yesterday, Senator Collins accepted the proposition that a minister should accept responsibility for poor administration when it could be demonstrated that there had been a continuing and a systemic problem the minister had done nothing about.

       </para>
       <para>
        Or, I might add, arcane issues. That is the latest buzz word for deflecting responsibility. No-one is suggesting for a moment that someone of the level of intelligence of Senator Collins ought to have been able to detect all the subtleties of that legal proposition. But what one ought to expect of even a Minister of average intelligence is that that Minister takes advice, asks what the implications of a proposition are, and actually understands something before signing it.

         That is the criminal offence in this matter, and it has been compounded time and again. All we ever get from the Minister is, `How should I have known—no-one told me'. As Winston Churchill said, the answer is quite clear: the Minister should have asked. That is why the Minister, in his own words, is on the block. I would have thought that if ever there was a blockhead, then we are confronted with him as a result of today's performance in Question Time. The

         ? Then he wandered into the chamber and said, `I heard the program and I agree with every word Kerry Stokes said'. Then, of course, the Minister set himself up in the most extraordinary way. There is hardly a word in what Mr Stokes said that was anything other than highly condemnatory of the Minister's performance. He was bagging the Minister from beginning to end.

         Let me say again that the issue on which I agree with Mr Stokes wholeheartedly is his understanding—as a layman, to quote Mr Gyles; that is, a non-lawyer—of what came out of the court case. It was the same understanding that Graham Evans and I had. I have read out the statement. It was that the court order had provided the basis on which a valid process could then continue. I then went on to say—before I got stopped by the clock, and I continued afterwards—that where I disagree with Mr Stokes, and I do, is that it is not just a question of semantics, as he described it. It is a question of complicated legal argument. No-one is seriously arguing that, having read the advices, which I presume—and I am speculating here—Mr Stokes has not yet had an opportunity to read.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to Government support for charitable organisations.

        The public would not be wrong to have assumed that the Government matched dollar for dollar cash donations to the major charitable organisations. In a press release dated 6 December, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am pleased to announce today that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement was clear and unequivocal. A few days later, on 11 December, he said:

        Senator Crowley, in answer to Senator West, said last week:

        Last year the Government agreed to match dollar for dollar all dollars raised in the Christmas appeals of the major welfare organisations.

        I want to look closely at the answer that Senator Crowley gave today because she gave the impression that the donations that were given to the major organisations in the Christmas appeals would be matched dollar for dollar.

         When I asked Senator Crowley whether dollars raised were the same as dollars spent—I know in my excitement that I did not make it clear the first time but I reiterated the point and asked her again—Senator Crowley sat there and could not answer me. She could not answer me either because she did not know, or because she did not have the gall to get up and say that what was promised in these press releases was not really what happened.

         What happened was that the goalposts were shifted. The Government said afterwards, `Oh, we didn't really mean all the dollars raised. We meant the dollars that you spent in a particular period, and you need to spend it in this time'. That time was before the Federal election. The charitable organisations have their Christmas appeals and maybe a mid-year appeal and use the money from their Christmas appeals to go across that extended period over winter. They then have a winter appeal, which extends them through to Christmas. All that money raised would have to be spent if they were to get a dollar for every dollar.

         Not only did the Government deceive the charitable organisations but it also deceived the donors. Many donors would say, `Rather than have the Government determine where my money is to go, I can make a donation to this organisation, I can get a tax deduction for it and I can get the Government to match it, so I can control in some ways where the money is going'. They were deceived when they gave their money. Now what will happen to these organisations? If we look at their pattern of receipts of gifts, we will see that they will taper off and there will not have been any significant increase in the annual amount of money given. They will have given money to be spent by those organisations before the Federal election.

         The Australian public—the donors—have been duped, as have the organisations. This is what this Government has done to the Australian public, and that is why Senator Crowley could not answer me today. She ought to be ashamed and embarrassed that is what this Government has done. It has duped organisations such as the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence, the Salvation Army and the Smith Family and it has duped the donors of Australia and the people who receive help from those organisations. They have been forced to spend money over a concentrated period just before the Federal election. That is dishonest and disgraceful.

         I think that those sitting on the other side ought to feel ashamed and disgraced to have involved charitable organisations in such a trick. That is what it was. Those organisations are astounded. That is the message we have had. In an estimates committee hearing Senator Macdonald found out that charitable organisations raised $14.6 million. How much did the Government provide to match that amount—$8.7 million, not dollar for dollar. Senator Reynolds might well shake her head in shame. She would be one of the few over there who would. It is an appalling situation. The public has been duped again.

I can well understand why Senator Evans and his government are embarrassed—as Senator Patterson has said—by the way the Government has duped the people of Australia. Senator Evans, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, should be able to give me the assurance that was given by Senator Richardson, representing, I assume, Senator Crowley—although it seemed a little odd—in the estimates committee. I would have thought it fairly obvious that, again, the Government will be in a position where it has enormous problems with people in crisis this Christmas.

         I asked Senator Richardson during estimates committee hearings whether he could guarantee that provision would be made within the Budget for these grants this year. Senator Richardson equivocated. I give Senator Crowley the opportunity to come down and give us an assurance that the Government will budget for further relief work. There is absolutely no doubt that because of the Government's mishandling of the economy and the tragedy that has befallen Australians more and more people will be in need of aid. It is going to be more incumbent upon the sorts of groups that Senator Patterson mentioned—the private charitable agencies that do a marvellous job—to help those people in their time of crisis.

I hope Senator Crowley will arrive shortly to give that assurance; otherwise the people of Australia could well be excused for thinking that the Government's proposal for those in trouble last December was purely another election gimmick by a government desperate to get re-elected. It seems to me, and it seems to most Australians, that that is what it was. I had hoped that Senator Crowley would prove me wrong by showing us that using the disadvantaged, those people in real crisis, was not just an election trick, that it was a genuinely compassionate move, and assuring us that similar moneys will be committed by the Government this time around. Otherwise, the Government will stand condemned yet again for its despicable action—

It saddens me a little to do this because only yesterday Senator Ray complimented one of my speeches. I can really only put down what he has done to the fact that he was reading from a brief.

        Let me make some comments about what the Government is trying to do here. In this country each year 50,000 students are turned away from universities and 140,000 students are turned away from TAFE colleges. After 10 years in government, this is the best the Labor Party can do for higher education. The Government realised that with its inappropriate structures and programs it was not going to be able to bridge this gap.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We believe that during the last election the coalition put forward the correct programs and structures to free up the system and to allow the universities greater control over the enrolment process. But the Government has failed to adopt these policies; it has continued with a very centralised regime. This program on open learning is yet another example of that sort of centralisation.

         The Government's initiative at Monash is an overengineered and overcontrolled system. This system threatens the excellent distance education provision system that already exists in this country. The 10 distance education centres that exist in various States of Australia have an excellent record. This Monash system which the Minister was trumpeting today is the wrong way to go. We should free up open learning and allow universities to develop programs according to their own mission statements.

         This Government wants to put open learning mainly in the hands of one university. Its initiative has been an abject failure, as shown by the enrolment system figures that I have just cited. I do not know where the Minister got his figures from, but I do not believe he got them from a credible source. I have cited these figures today to set the record straight and to show the failure of government policy in this area and the need for change.

          Guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities—March 1993
         </emphasis>
         , prepared by the Department of Finance, is a further revision of a series of guidelines first issued a decade ago, in May 1983, which commenced a period of very worthwhile development of the financial statements and procedures of the Commonwealth. I give credit to the Department of Finance and to the Government for the way in which they have advanced the cause of financial statements over the last few years. There is still a long way to go, but there certainly have been some worthwhile improvements.

          The document is essentially a technical document and, therefore, I will not attempt to traverse it in these brief comments. There are just two aspects that I want to draw attention to. The first one is paragraph 39 which, under the subheading of `Methods of valuing assets', points out:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In July 1991 the Special Premiers' Conference agreed that a framework for national performance monitoring should be established for Government Trading Enterprises (GTEs). As part of this process a Commonwealth-State committee was convened to prepare consistent guidelines for valuation of assets of GTEs for all jurisdictions. In February 1993, the Committee's draft report was sent to GTEs and public authorities for comment.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a very important development because one of the difficulties we have had in measuring performance, in determining accountability and in obtaining financial comparisons in Australia between the States and between the various public authorities and commercial activities has been a lack of uniformity in their accounting standards and the guidelines for financial reporting. That movement in the 1991 Premiers Conference for the development of a framework for national performance monitoring is an important development and I think we should all watch its further development with interest. Certainly I will be doing so.

          The other aspect of this document that I will comment on briefly is the paragraphs under the subheading `Annual reports'. It is pointed out that there is a responsibility for financial statements to be included in annual reports of the public authorities, and that these should be furnished to responsible Ministers as soon as possible at the end of each financial year. The report also states that, if possible, they should be furnished in time for the estimates debate in the Budget sittings; and that it is certainly important for them to be furnished in sufficient time to be tabled in parliament before it rises. That is a matter that has been of some concern, I know, to many senators. Not always are those timetables, particularly in relation to the estimates hearings, adhered to. It is a matter to which I hope close attention will be paid. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

          This document follows an announcement on 4 December 1992 by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) that Commonwealth departments are to move to financial reporting on an accrual basis as the next step in the Government's public sector reform program. This is the first document to come forward as a result of that announcement. As the document says, these guidelines prescribe reporting requirements for Commonwealth departments that have elected to prepare financial statements on an accrual basis for the year ending 30 June 1993. The document says that that election should be evidenced in the accounting policy note.

          In other words, this is the first step along a process that will eventually become mandatory for Commonwealth departments to account on an accrual rather than a cash basis. In that sense it is breaking new ground. It is long overdue. The Opposition has long argued that accrual accounting should be the essential component of financial accounting for the Commonwealth, despite there being some traps along the way. It is not a simple concept at all but, unless one has accrual accounting and reporting on an accrual basis, it is impossible to know from looking at the financial statements of government departments precisely what their financial position is. Cash accounting and reporting on a cash basis is insufficient in that sense, despite its being important in its own right for appropriation purposes while we still have the annual appropriation procedures that prevail.

         As I mentioned in the Senate estimates committees last week, ATSIC can stand proud and tall for the record of achievement in the few years since it came into existence. It came into existence after a very rough passage in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, and a great deal of criticism of the Government's handling of its financial administration in that particular area. The legislation setting it up had a very difficult and tortuous passage through this Parliament. Nevertheless, I am pleased to say that the work of the commissioners and the senior staff—probably not least the evolving role of the regional councillors throughout Australia—has meant that the transition is one on which so many people can now look back and say it has been a job well done.

         I am also pleased that this legislation picks up many of the tenets of the Liberal National party coalition policies that were announced prior to the last election. Those of us in the Liberal and National parties had spent some time reviewing the early formation of ATSIC and were pleased to develop policies that we believe reflected the views and aspirations of Aboriginal people; yet at the same time we could accept that it was a time for review of some of the administrative structures and forms.

         It is probably quite correct to say that there has been a burgeoning of administrative costs within ATSIC and that would cause some concern. The objective of this legislation is to ensure that that does not continue. I would liken the ATSIC record to the evolving role of local government in Australia. I hope that the lessons and the examples that many Aboriginal people receive through their participation in the zones, regions and commissions of ATSIC will enable them to move on and take full and proper roles in municipal and local government administration throughout Australia in the communities in which they live. I believe there will be many lessons to be learnt through the structures within ATSIC itself.

The central Australian ATSIC commissioner, Mr Geoff Shaw, is under attack because of communication problems in that particular area. In particular, I note the comments where he has had to justify certain action by his fellow commissioners. The local regional councils in that area have taken Mr Shaw on and said that they, in turn, do not like some of the considerations that are being put together and the structures that are being proposed even in this legislation. There is obviously a problem of communication.

         The Aboriginal constituency in Australia is small—some 250,000 people throughout Australia in a country of 17 million. When we look at the myriad Aboriginal organisations that feed into, receive grants from, and are part of the funded network of ATSIC, it is very important to recognise that there is almost a council and organisation for each Aboriginal family, clan, or kin group throughout Australia in one way or another. We have to guard against the influence of nepotism in such an organisation and the way in which it would be structured. Therefore, it is important that the accountability structures are totally underpinned.

The reports of the Auditor-General, because of the size of funding attributed to this portfolio, constantly bring us back to looking at it. The coalition amendment that will be considered here today, in looking at the accountability of the commission itself, still recognises that very important tenet.

         Restructuring is also important when looking at the changed relationships between State and Territory governments and Aboriginal organisations. Honourable senators would know that late last year the Northern Territory Government, with which I am very familiar, created a special Ministry of Aboriginal Development. In a press release dated 13 May, the Minister, Mr Steve Hatton, announced a number of very important portfolio restructuring initiatives to develop a better relationship between the Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal people. Special attention was given to bilateral agreements with ATSIC, to conferences with land councils, and to an accelerated process for the settlement of land claims. A number of other State governments are also entering into direct and important relationships. These are important developments.

         Probably the most important matter that we need to address today in the area of Aboriginal advancement—the improvement in their lifestyle and sense of worth—is the participation of Aborigines in private sector employment. For far too long there has been too great a dependence by Aboriginal people on funds from the government nipple. The real indicator of reconciliation will be the increasing involvement of Aboriginal people in direct private sector employment rather than dependence on CDEP programs, employment by government and semi-government organisations, or voluntary organisations that depend on government funding. The true measure of the results of independence will be when we see Aboriginal people participating in employment in the same proportion as the general community. I certainly commend those aspects of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill which reach out towards that goal and which reflect the aspirations and the progress of Aboriginal people.

         I turn now to the area of land administration, and the amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. This arises particularly from the initiatives taken with regard to what is called the Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley scheduling of land within the land rights Act. That schedule created very special tenure for Aboriginal people. The Mount Todd agreement resulted from negotiations between the Northern Territory Government, the traditional owners and the mining company through which all parties were able to access each other directly and develop mutual trust. The Commonwealth facilitated the process through the support and assistance of the Office of Northern Development. Although the Northern Land Council was required to perform statutory functions pursuant to the Act, it did not represent the Jawoyn people in the negotiations.

         As a result of this agreement, the scheduling of these areas of land was requested by the Northern Territory Government. Catfish Dreaming is a small area of land adjacent to the township area and is likely to be used as a community living area. The Jawoyn people intend to subdivide the Eva Valley pastoral lease, incorporating the western portion into Nitmiluk National Park, commonly known as Katherine Gorge. This park is Aboriginal land, managed by a board with a majority Jawoyn membership through a lease back arrangement with the Northern Territory Conservation Commission—a State functional body connected with national park management. The Nitmiluk National Park is the most innovative joint management arrangement in the country. The Northern Territory will add a further portion of land to the park, thereby more than doubling its size. The Jawoyn people, as part of the agreement, will receive—and I stress—Northern Territory  freehold title to approximately 1,800 square kilometres of land containing the Mount Todd gold project and several other highly prospective exploration licences.

         When we look carefully at these mining and community based projects, it is important that we recognise that this legislation, which facilitates certain action, must not be seen in any way as a precedent for something that today is referred to as the Mabo decision. It is very important that these special arrangements stand on their own merit and should not be used as a bribe or as a blackmail example that would be seen as not acting in the interests of Aboriginal people.

        Mabo is a new title of land in Australia created last year by the High Court. It is controversial in its implementation and its settlement, and it is going to require very careful consideration by all interested parties throughout Australia in order not to set black and white people against each other. There are implications for industry; there are implications for Aboriginal people. State governments in particular are going to have to address this issue very delicately. Yesterday the Northern Territory Parliament passed the Confirmation of Titles to Land (Request) Act. The Chief Minister's press release said in part:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation calls on the Federal Government to secure existing titles in the Northern Territory following the Mabo High Court decision. He said what the Act endeavoured to attain was security for the thousands of titles issued since the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 whether they had been issued as pastoral leases, mining leases, freehold land, or under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. He said that the High Court decision had cast doubt on the validity of those titles because there may have been people who would claim native title using the principles established by Mabo. Mr Perron said the Act contained the form of legislation that the Federal Parliament should enact to secure existing titles for all Territorians.

        By its very tenor and nature, that legislation will be passed to this Parliament for action. It is very important. In considering the legislation before us here today it is important that both of these Bills secure the support of all parties in this Parliament. I am pleased to note the support that the Australian Democrats have given to the coalition's amendment. The provisions relating to ATSIC should not be seen as an insult or a putting down of the increased aspirations of Aboriginal people. There are very important principles involved, and I think as part of the entire process this legislation is very much striking new ground.

         Although I do not normally speak on Bills relating to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, there are a few points in this Bill that I would like to address. The basic thrust of the legislation is to reduce the number of full-time commissioners and full-time regional councillors. The 1989 Act which established 60 regions and 60 commissioners has now been reduced to 36 regional councils and 17 full-time commissioners elected by the regional councils. All commissioners and regional council chairmen will be full time, which will lead to far more effectiveness.

         In my travels through the Aboriginal communities of the central desert of Western Australia—starting in Leonora, Laverton, Warburton, Wingelinna, Blackstone, Warakurna, Wiluna, Kalumburu, Turkey Creek, Christmas Creek and a few others that I do not remember—a commissioner from Kununurra impressed on me the efficiency the commissioners would have if they were employed on a full-time basis, even though there may be less of them. This particular gentleman in Kununurra told me of the amount of his own time he spends travelling to Canberra, Perth or Darwin. I welcome the Government's move to employ full-time commissioners and a full-time chairman, which will lead to more efficiency.

         The standards of the communities that I have visited over the years are mostly improving. That improvement can be seen when visiting the areas. I make special mention of Warburton, Turkey Creek, Warakurna, Wingelinna and Blackstone in Western Australia. I cannot say the same about the others. Unfortunately, some of them seem to be going backwards. I do not know whether the problem lies with the council, the commissioners or their advisers. I believe that Kalumburu has a long way to go and that that community should be looked at sooner rather than later with a view to improving those standards. The first time I visited Warburton, which was a long time prior to coming to this place, I thought it was hell on earth. I saw only one other place where I thought the Aborigines suffered badly, and that was at Oodnadatta in South Australia. I have not visited that place since, but visitors to Warburton will really see a big improvement.

         Another area of merit in this legislation is the mechanism whereby a ward system may be introduced at a later date. I would rather see that introduced earlier than later, because some minorities that tend to be pushed aside in such regional council areas may then get a fair hearing and a fair go when it comes to resources.

         I say this particularly because there is an unresolved dispute in the Kalgoorlie region, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) admitted this in answer to a question on notice some time back. This dispute is between the Wongi people and the Gubbrun people. The Gubbrun people are a minority group in that area, mainly made up of the Champion family, the Sambo family and I think the Donaldson family is the third one. Over the past three or four years they have been continually in contact with my office to complain about the treatment they get at the hands of the regional council. I have made various approaches to the Minister and asked questions in the estimates committee, but the problem goes on and on. I know that these three families are, to pardon the pun, champion people. I have known the Champion family all my life, and I have also known the Sambo family virtually all my life. Their cry for help or for a fair go seems to be falling on deaf ears.

         I believe the idea of a council representing a particular ward is a good one. I had a reasonable career in local government before I came to this place, and I found that local governments that did away with wards certainly fell down in their overall representation. Therefore, I certainly agree with that part of the legislation and would like to see it introduced as soon as possible so that those minority groups can be looked after.

         Senator Panizza raised the matter of stations in the north of Western Australia such as Coongan, Strelley, Lalla Rookh, Warralong and Callawa. Most of those stations—particularly, Coongan, Strelley and Warralong—are on river country that runs along the Coongan and DeGrey rivers. It is beautiful country. In better economic times, those stations have been excellent and particularly productive. But like many stations in the Pilbara and, to a lesser extent, the Kimberleys, they were bought by the Aboriginal community, presumably for the purpose of providing an economic base and an area where they could settle and which they could call their own.

         The tragedy is that those stations were bought at an enormous price. Most of them have been thoroughly destocked.

         As Senator Panizza said, it is as though that part of the government outlays which goes towards Aboriginal groups is unique in one way: it has the distinction of being above and beyond the scrutiny of the Parliament, committees of the Parliament or government departments. Anybody who is so presumptuous as to inquire whether the funds are delivered to those for whom they are intended to be received and whether they fulfil the objectives and purposes for which they are dedicated promptly becomes an inquisitorial racist.

It was run up onto the shore where for two years two magnificent large diesel engines in its base were, of course, totally destroyed as they lay immersed in salt water. But when I pursued that matter, I was told that was really a determination or decision of the community and not one which impinged upon government policy or contemplation.

         I raised the case of a Mr Peter Ross who has been—and I say this with no great credit to him necessarily—a long time Labor Party supporter in the Kimberley. He has been associated with a number of communities, including Marra Worra Worra, Wangkatjungka and, more recently, one or two others. He has been responsible for stealing money or misappropriating funds from the Aboriginal communities and using plant and equipment for purposes other than that for which it was dedicated. On each occasion I have been advised by the department that that is simply a matter of administration for the Aboriginal councils.

         There is a long list of matters raised by the auditor. One trivial matter was that Mr Ross had purchased, using an Aboriginal community cheque, 34 cartons of beer. When he was questioned by the auditor on that matter, he said the beer was for entertaining visiting government employees. Either the Aboriginal affairs department of Western Australia is full of drunks or Mr Ross was telling lies. That is just a modest but typical example of the cavalier way in which these people use taxpayers' money.

         We had the case of the power station using maximum levels of diesoline not in summertime but during wintertime, which is, of course, when one does not have air-conditioners on. It was very obvious to the auditor that the fuel was not being used in the generating plant; it was either not being delivered in the first place or it was being misappropriated for another cause. In the process of all that, we discovered that the person being paid a large salary as an engineer at the plant in fact had not lived out there for a number of years but had lived in town, and that the schoolteacher was being paid to do the job as well.

         Every time we raise these matters, we are told that it is really not a matter for the Parliament. There are countless cases which, in themselves, almost seem trivial because we have become used—almost immune—to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of dollars disappearing down a big black hole at the discretion of white advisers to these Aboriginal communities. But if an aberration of $10,000 were found in the Department of the Senate, we know that there would be a royal commission and enormous implications for the officers in charge.

         One can get a copy of the audited statements of almost every single Aboriginal community north of the 26th parallel in Western Australia and find, without exception, that they are qualified simply because there are no appropriate, suitable or proper books kept by the people who are paid. I think it was the Oombulgurri community that lost a large amount of money, the bookkeeper disappeared, he was never prosecuted and, to my knowledge, it was never pursued in a vigorous way by the department.

         One of the difficulties seems to be that we have what I might describe as the unfortunate circumstance whereby, because of historic factors, the Aboriginal counsellors are made up of fine Aboriginal leaders but who are illiterate and innumerate, and they have no proper way of scrutinising the conduct of the bookkeepers or the white advisers. Yet, when it is found through audits that the latter are conducting themselves in improper or illegal ways, the response from the Government has always been that they are employed by the council and not by the department and so nothing is to be done about it.

When I claimed a refund, I was told that it was not in the public domain, it was not a matter of public interest, and, therefore, I should not be refunded. Senator Tate saw the nonsense of that and ultimately the request was made in an appropriate way, and a suitable refund was obtained. But that seems to be the siege mentality that goes on.

         One could spend a little time, but one will not, on the matters of Strelley station. For instance, Senator Panizza raised the issue that the generating plant had been generating electricity for the houses and street lighting for 18 months after the place was abandoned. There might be some quaint notion attached to that, but it thoroughly escapes me. On Strelley station, if I remember rightly, there is a million-dollar school that has never had a child inside it and it is now abandoned. That was paid for by one of the churches which, in many respects, seem to have about as little accountability as do government departments.

         The tragedy is that while these Aboriginal communities continue to live in appalling circumstances, the very funding which is intended to be directed towards providing the delivery of services to them, and lifting standards and improving their prospects of health, education and wellbeing, is being dissipated in the most obscene way. Each time the matter is debated in this Parliament, it is set aside as though it is immune to criticism or analysis. I hope that this legislation may in some vague and obscure way impose greater discipline or scrutiny on the process of the outlays of funds through ATSIC.

         —It is doing it well. I think it is a logical nonsense that a body which the Government has established, with the support of everyone, which has now been running for three years as the major advisory body to the Government on Aboriginal affairs policy, which is administering this Budget—and everyone concedes that with some glitches it is doing it well—and which is supposed to be the representative body for Aboriginal opinion in Australia cannot have the right to elect its own leader and must have that leader appointed by government. That is why I say this is not a small thing for me—it is a big thing. I think it is very sad indeed that the opportunity for ATSIC to do that is being blocked this afternoon by the Senate.

         I want to express my strong personal objections to this. Senator Kernot knows that I have held this view for a long time. I expressed it in the ATSIC Committee, and I conceded that whilst it was in its teething stages perhaps we should have this transitory arrangement of a government-appointed Chair. Senator Kernot knows, and I concede, that Aboriginal people, whom I respect enormously—they are great Australians in fact—actually support this foreshadowed amendment and want it carried. But I have to state the obvious. I am not talking about them; I am talking about us. I am a member of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Kernot is also a member of a political organisation, the Australian Democrats, and this amendment is being moved by the coalition.

         With the greatest respect to Senator Kernot, I commend to the reading of anyone the speech delivered by Clyde Holding in the House of Representatives on this issue. I did not read it until just a minute ago—I will quote from it in a minute—and I agree with everything Clyde Holding said, not surprisingly, because he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs when the formative stages of this organisation were put together in his office. On its worst day ATSIC, with all of its commissioners in their most demented frame of mind, could not pick a bigger turkey to lead it than the coalition has succeeded in doing in re-electing John Hewson. That is a fact, Mr Acting Deputy President.

I do not believe he has a mortgage on sentiment about this debate, but to reduce the integrity of this debate by making odious comparisons and unpleasant reflections upon the Leader of the Opposition in my view adds nothing to the quality of this debate.

         Leaving that aside, I make this valid point. We often know the deficiencies and defects of leaders. None of them can be perfect. I am sure, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Holding, said, that all coalition members would like John Hewson to have all of the qualities of Robert Menzies. If he has not, it is sad. No-one can be perfect. That is why I think ATSIC should have the right to choose its own leader.

         —That is correct, but there will be a review. I think that this amendment which, regrettably, will be passed by the Senate this afternoon will prevent the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission from choosing its own leader, its own chairperson, after three years. One of the useful options that could be explored during that review is the possibility at a future time of the chairperson of ATSIC not necessarily being chosen by the commissioners themselves—and I am not proposing this; I would simply like to see it explored as an option—but being a popularly elected chairperson from the body of electors who vote, or perhaps from the regional council.

         Having dealt with that, I will conclude with one other matter. We are putting through some small but important matters in the land rights Bills that are before us this afternoon. They deal with the areas of Catfish Dreaming, Eva Valley Station and the area south-west of Tennant Creek. The reason this is significant is that the two areas to do with the area near Katherine are both there as a result of a successful negotiation between the operator of the Todd River Mine, Zapopan NL, the Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal people in the area.

         I have to say that the agreement—and it is an excellent agreement; I commend people to read the details of it—provides very detailed descriptions of the jobs that will be available for Aboriginal people. It realistically lays out the training programs that will be implemented in order to ensure that people will be trained for those jobs. I also add that a realistic number of jobs—not ridiculous claims of 50 or 60—are identified in the agreement. It is a superb document indeed.

         The reason I make that point is that the document was put together with the assistance of the Commonwealth, in terms of the facilitation processes, through the role played by two officers of the Office of Northern Development based in Darwin, Mr Bill Gray and Mr Neil Westbury. I am sure that there are honourable senators here who would remember Bill Gray, because I know that he was highly respected on both sides of this chamber in his former roles as a long-time senior officer of the then welfare department and of DAA and then as the executive officer of ATSIC. Bill Gray and Neil Westbury played an extremely important role in facilitating this Todd River agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth. These same two officers are currently engaged in facilitating what I hope will be an equally successful agreement in respect of MacArthur River on behalf of the Commonwealth.

         It simply shows what can be done. In a lot of ways the area near Tennant Creek is an even better example of an agreement. I think I mentioned that the Northern Territory Government was involved not only in that first agreement but also the second. This agreement was reached in order to secure the water supplies for the town of Tennant Creek. It was reached with the full agreement of the Aboriginal land owners and the Northern Territory Government in a successful negotiation.

         The reason I mention this is that there are a number of outstanding land claims that people are concerned about. In my view, the Northern Territory Government should follow its own example; that is, instead of wasting enormous sums of Northern Territory taxpayers' money—we cannot afford it—on fruitless legal actions in the High Court to try to prevent land claims, it could build on the example it has created near Tennant Creek and use the process that was used so successfully there in order to settle a lot of those outstanding land claims. I simply commend that suggestion to the Northern Territory Government.

         I want to conclude on the question of the Mabo decision. Again, I want to commend Clyde Holding's speech, particularly what he said about Mabo. I have heard a lot of discussion here this afternoon—which I have to say really gets right up my nose—about how Aboriginal people should not be using this decision as a precedent, a threat or a bribe. I am just astounded by that stuff. Of course, it would not occur to any citizen of Australia who was not black that beneficial use could be made of a court decision!

I was very glad to hear that Senator Kernot, on behalf of the Democrats, supported the Opposition's view in parallel language, giving additional substantial reasons why they supported the amendments. In moving the series of 10 amendments, I note that several of them are substantive and others are consequential, all relating to the elected and non-elected members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

         —The only reason for incorporating these draft amendments is that honourable senators can refer to the Opposition's original intention on this Bill. Let me pick up a couple of references the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Collins, made in his very sincere speech. He believes that the chairperson of ATSIC ought to be determined by the members of ATSIC. The Government proposes 17 commissioners and the Opposition proposes 19.

         I readily admit that one of my first reactions to the steering committee's report on the reform of ATSIC—which I referred to in my speech in the second reading debate—was to contemplate the commissioners electing their own chairperson. It was on further consideration that I, along with my colleagues, came to the view that we ought to proceed by way of the amendments which I have now moved.

         I place a great deal of weight on the principle that a responsible body, made up of elected representatives, should itself determine its chairperson and, indeed, its other officers. It will be observed that in this case, with what I believe will be the Senate amendment in place, we will still see a deputy chairperson elected in that fashion.

         What then are the more compelling reasons that lead the Opposition at this point to move these amendments? I have referred to these matters in my speech in the second reading debate, but I summarise them in three references. Firstly, there is the reinforcement of accountability, given ATSIC's direct responsibility for public moneys—an amount towards $1 billion if not now certainly very soon—quite apart from its commercial activities which may also involve public moneys.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This reinforcement of accountability is in line with the huge debate that took place in this Senate with regard to ATSIC's formation and with regard to certain specific accountability requirements that remain within the Act. I do not wish, in any way, to make light of the already existing accountability requirements for ATSIC, but that accountability will be reinforced by the Government, through the Minister, appointing the chairperson and by the Minister appointing two members of the commission.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, there is a greater flexibility for the determination of chairperson in the procedure that the Minister make such an appointment—such a choice. I urge the Minister of this Government and Ministers of future Liberal and National Party governments to consult carefully with the regions, the zones, the elected chairpersons and the commissioners, and to make a determination, taking into account not only the views of elected representatives through the ATSIC process, but also those of others holding positions of experience amongst the Aboriginal communities of Australia—and, indeed, wider than that.

         Senator Kernot referred to advice that she received that, in the minds of the elected commissioners and the Minister, the best person who has the abilities, the sense of dialogue and representativeness, and the skill to chair this important council and ensure that it is a success, could already be holding some other position within Australia and could well accept the invitation of the Minister to be appointed to the chair of this important council. That avenue ought to be available; it gives that degree of flexibility. It is to be understood that the Minister's choice now can include, through the Opposition's amendment, any of the commissioners who are elected in the ATSIC process.

         The third point relates to the question of particular qualifications and the two commissioners appointed by the Minister. It may be that between them the 17 commissioners elected through the ATSIC process have every required skill—any degree of accounting knowledge and experience, legal knowledge and experience, or other areas of knowledge and experience—but not to the extent that the commissioners themselves may wish. To have a member of the commission with particular qualifications gives the Minister an opportunity to consider those factors and to consult widely before appointing the two members of the commission.

         I conclude by referring to Mabo and the reconciliation process. The Liberal and National parties believe it is of the highest priority and significance for all Australians, especially the Aboriginal people, that there be a sound and reasonable determination of the full implications of the Mabo decision; and that there be a sound and successful outcome of the reconciliation process, to which a number of us have referred during our speeches on this Bill. I do not take lightly the Mabo decision of the High Court, nor the reconciliation process to which we have variously referred during this debate. I commend the 10 amendments circulated by me on behalf of the Opposition.

         I am very mindful of the fact that ATSIC has come into being following many raised expectations of indigenous Australians and many spectacular failures—not on their part, but on our part. We have not given them sufficient resources and we have put the concerns of indigenous Australians aside while we pursued other political agendas. I do not want to be part of anything which, however well-intentioned, sets up an opportunity for ATSIC to fail. I acknowledge that there will be an incredible amount of politics involved in the manoeuvring that is going to go on when a list of nominees for the appointed chairperson is put forward, but that is no different from manoeuvring to get into Prime Minister Keating's Cabinet; it is exactly the same thing.

         We have listened to many representations but they have not been exhaustive. I readily concede that as well. I expect that the next ATSIC elections will be very keenly fought because the activists who are opposed to the establishment of ATSIC now understand that, through the devolution of power to the regional councils, ATSIC does have real power over its budget. At the regional council level, indigenous Australians have the right to make important decisions as to their priorities for spending the funding that is available. We are arguing about the appointment of the chair; I would argue that the election of a regional councillor is very important as well.

In their administration of ATSIC I have been able to observe a commendable command of detail and an absolute commitment to the principles of accountability, not just because we imposed them but because they believe in them. I have seen Lois O'Donoghue make some incredibly tough decisions which have made her very unpopular with particular Aboriginal communities around Australia. She is a strong and effective chair of ATSIC and she will be hard to replace; there is no doubt about that.

For once, let the coalition say that it is prepared to take the same sorts of challenges as the Minister has accepted and accept the fact that although ATSIC is in many ways an imperfect instrument it is a major step forward. But it is no more an imperfect instrument than any of our own political parties. It is no more an imperfect political instrument than this Parliament itself. It seems to me to be an exercise of almost continuing patronage to say, `Yes, we think it is not a bad idea, but not now'. It is always for the coalition `not now'.

        I agree. Speaking of an imperfect point: recently in the Federal Court case that has been alluded to, in which I gave evidence, counsel for the applicant made some very disparaging remarks about the defects of parliament. I restrained myself and bit my tongue—I was very well behaved in court—but it did occur to me to say in response to counsel for the applicant that perhaps one of the reasons for the defect of parliament is the very large number of lawyers that constitutes our membership.

         —I think there should be more women in parliament. I was interested to note how many women there were in ATSIC and how successful that organisation has been in its three years of existence. Senator Kernot should have a look at how long this institution has existed—almost 100 years—and she should have a look at what has happened in ATSIC. The reason it is important—and I am going to get into trouble for saying this—in my personal view, after 26 years of working with Aboriginal people, is that in contemporary Australia the backbone and the strength of Aboriginal society are the women. In my personal observation, many communities would be lost without trace if it were not for the role that women are playing in those societies in taking a strong and an unpopular stand against substance abuse and alcohol abuse.

I am not singling out the men for bad attention, but a personal observation that I have made over the years is that some communities would be lost without the strength of purpose and the stand that the women in these communities, in trying to hold together their culture and hold together their families, are taking against the violence and domestic violence that now occurs in Aboriginal communities. An interesting point which I did not know until today is that 28 per cent of the total elected body of ATSIC are women. That is almost 30 per cent.

         I want to conclude with a point about the board—the one flaw in the argument. Senator Kernot has raised—and I say this with respect to her—the view of a number of Aboriginal people that this amendment should be supported because of their disagreement that ATSIC should elect its own chair at this time. I respect those views; they have been put to me, as Senator Kernot knows, by people I respect.

         Senator Kernot has read out what a particular person thinks of the current proposal, but those comments—and I say this with respect, and I am not trying to antagonise the Opposition—would pale by comparison if they were stood alongside the views that someone such as Senator Bronwyn Bishop would have and would express about the current leadership of the coalition. That is no state secret; it has been in all the papers. What I am saying is that there are disparate views in the organisation.

As Senator Crichton-Browne said earlier, and I agree with him, there are 500 views. But this proposal is the collective view of the board of ATSIC and Senator Kernot knows that. All of these debates have occurred in the board. All of these views have been canvassed and expressed in the board. What needs to be said at least once is that, despite that, it is the collective view of the board of ATSIC. It needs to be said that these amendments should not be carried here this afternoon.

         I include my own party in this, to a lesser extent at the moment because we are in government and not in opposition, but it is as logical to say that the leader of the coalition should not be Dr John Hewson because one or two coalition members express a view to the contrary as it is to say that Paul Keating should not be the leader of the Labor Party because one or two might express views about that.

But I say again very strongly that it should not be asserted by anyone that Aboriginal people are unreasonably threatening or bribing anybody by taking the same beneficial advantage of that court decision, not government policy, as any other citizen of this country is entitled to take advantage of a court decision until parliament decides that it might express a different view.

He has had access to whatever officers of the department he wished to speak to about it. His report, together with the papers that he has examined, will be tabled in this Parliament. The secretary to the department, Mr Evans, was to have attached to his report whatever further comments he wished to make about it.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill which is presently before the Senate is representative of the unseemly haste with which the Government nowadays processes a continuous stream of taxation Bills through this Parliament. The Bill before us is not really distinguishable from the Taxation Laws (Superannuation) Bill 1992 and is basically designed to give effect to the residual measures yet to be introduced from the statement entitled `Security in Retirement' made by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins).

         The number of amendments to superannuation law and the pace at which they pass through the Parliament can only make one wonder how coordinated and holistic is the Government's approach to superannuation. After all, we have had a substantive change to superannuation law roughly every three months over the past decade. Let me anticipate the response to this observation from the other side of this chamber by saying that it is tedious and self-deluding to argue that such a lawyers' feast of legislative changes is due to the real or perceived failure of the Fraser government, a government that has been out of power for a decade. Perhaps a more independent and cynical observer would say that the Government is plucking the goose that laid the golden eggs, in aggregate now over $1 billion.

         The ad hoc approach to superannuation policy apparently favoured by the Labor Government is interestingly reflected by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) in his speech in the second reading of the Bill in the House of Representatives. The honourable member said:

        The way that this Government tackles the superannuation agenda is to confront . . . problems as they arise and to solve them.
       </para>
       <para>
        To say that the Government solves all superannuation problems may seem to many people an unwarranted assumption. I draw attention to the admission that problems are only addressed once they have arisen. The Government cannot allow itself to be satisfied with waiting for superannuation issues to become problems before it reacts to them. The Government must learn to anticipate problems and seek to avoid them, and not wait for problems or inequities to appear and then try to solve them one by one, like animals going into the ark. Such action creates unwieldy and uncoordinated legislation and difficulty and confusion for both providers and beneficiaries of superannuation.

         The Government has been assisted by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation led by Senator Sherry. I commend the honourable Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Johns, for his interest in and commensurate responsibility for superannuation, but I urge him to put his enthusiasm for superannuation to work in providing a more ordered and easily followed approach to superannuation by the Government than that which the community presently has to suffer.

         I turn to consider each of the 12 measures contained in this Bill for a detailed comment. First, I refer to the continuously complying fixed interest approved deposit funds. This measure will allow certain approved deposit funds to maintain their statutory qualification as continuously complying approved deposit funds, and consequent exemption from tax, by including within the requisite 90 per cent of accessible income test the disposal of long term securities alongside the former solitary income component of interest. This scheme is achieved by a simple extension of the definition of fixed interest complying approved deposit fund under section 290A(4).

         This is an uncontroversial amendment in what it attempts to achieve, but I am disturbed by its retrospective effect so that it applies from 1 July 1988. I understand that the Government is acting in good faith and for good reason in making this amendment retrospective. However, one must ask why it has taken five years—from 25 May 1988 when the tax exemption concerned was first announced—to bring a normal income earning activity of an approved deposit funds within the policy intention of tax exemption.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I put it to the Senate that this failure to anticipate fully the requirements properly to fulfil the policy intention is not atypical of this Government. Then, upon realising that more work is required to remedy past legislative failures, the Government seeks to depurate its own laws by retrospective legislation. In other words, the Parliament and the community must suffer the use of a repugnant doctrine of retrospectivity so that the Government's failures may be corrected. The need for and the worth of corrections in this first measure should not be derogated by what I say. However, I urge that superannuation changes be given fuller consideration so that, for example, we need not find ourselves legislating retrospectively.

         I now turn to the second of the 12 matters, the notice requirements for superannuation funds. This previously unannounced amendment reverses the onus on the members of a superannuation fund who wish to claim a tax deduction for their personal contribution. The present situation is that a superannuation fund must include personal superannuation contributions in taxable contributions unless notice is received by the fund that the member is not entitled to a deduction from his assessable income for such contributions. In other words, contributions not covered by notices adverting to non-deductibility are deemed to be deductible contributions, whether they are in truth or not, and so taxable in the hands of the fund.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This arrangement was illogical because, as a general rule, those who receive contributions from an employer are not entitled to a deduction for any extra personal superannuation contributions they may choose to make. Obviously, the great majority of superannuation beneficiaries are really in this position. As such, it makes sense to reverse the present arrangement so that superannuation funds will now only include personal superannuation contributions in taxable contributions if they have received a notice stating the member's intention to claim a deduction for such a contribution. As the situation presently stands, notice must be given as to non-deductibility; under this Bill, notice must be given as to deductibility. To encourage people to give such notices, deductibility will not attach to personal superannuation contributions unless an acknowledgment of receipt of the notice of the fund is received by the member.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In summary, the nature of the notice is reversed and the result of the receipt of the notice is reversed. I view the amendment positively but note that it is to apply from 1 July 1992 and that as we are approaching the end of this financial year people must extensively be made aware of this important change. I ask that suitable notice be given in the press.

         I turn to the third matter, the death benefit eligible termination payments. The Bill alters the tax treatment of death benefit eligible termination payments in the hands of beneficiaries or trustees of the estate so that benefits paid to dependants will be exempt from tax, whereas benefits paid to non-dependants will be taxed as ordinary eligible termination payments. More specifically, the post-June 1983—which is the important cut-off date—component of such eligible termination payments will be taxed at 15 per cent if it is paid from a taxed source, that is, the 15 per cent contribution, basically, or 30 per cent if paid from an untaxed source. Any benefits in excess of the deceased's reasonable benefits limit entitlements will be taxed as an excessive component of an eligible termination payment.

         Whilst it may be feared that the taxation of the eligible termination payment when paid to a non-dependant is analogous to a death duty, I think it should be remembered that presently such payments are taxable in the same way as they would be in the hands of the deceased. Whether this is tantamount to a death duty is not new and so not appropriate for comment in review of this Bill. The tax treatment has not changed but has been rationalised and made more coherent in its application. These measures were part of the

         So whilst the obvious assumption is that this measure is simply designed to ensure that any excess from a death benefit is treated in the same way as excess ordinarily in the hands of a beneficiary member of a superannuation fund, I do not think it satisfactory that we must be left to speculate, no matter how reasonably, on policy motivations for measures that increase government revenue.

         The sixth point concerns allocated annuities. This sixth measure in the Bill introduces amendments that are sound in themselves. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1992 recognised allocated pensions and annuities for income tax purposes. However, these amendments did not ensure that the income derived by annuity providers—for example, life assurance companies—in respect of allocated annuity policies was exempt from tax. The amendments in this measure are necessary to ensure that income derived by an annuity provider in respect of allocated annuity policies is exempt from tax and that allocated annuities are not qualifying securities for division 16E purposes.

Briefly, the Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1992 sought to recognise allocated annuities and pensions as pensions and annuities for income tax purposes. These initial amendments failed to extend the intended tax exemption to life assurance companies and registered organisations for income derived in respect of allocated annuity policies.

         My concluding remarks are these. Overall, the Bill is uncontroversial. Nevertheless, the number of amendments here necessary to fulfil or correct incomplete past amendments prove that this Government's cavalier approach to tax legislation does create problems. Mistakes often necessitate the use of retrospective legislation to maintain consistent treatment. As parliamentarians, we should have a strong aversion to retrospective legislation because it is antipathetic to the rule of law. Parents are often wont to tell their children that, if they are going to do something, do it properly. The Government may do well to remember this little adage.

         Senator Watson never ceases to amaze me in how exciting he can make legislation such as this sound and in the wise advice he gives us from time to time. I am going to concentrate on the substance of the legislation before us, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1993. As Senator Watson said, the legislation proposes to implement many of the taxation measures announced in the `Security in Retirement' statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) last year. It proposes to implement from 1 July 1994 a new taxation regime for death benefits, that is, a new regime for taxing payments from superannuation funds when the fund member dies so as not to allow excessive benefits to be transferred to beneficiaries free of taxation. I was expecting a bit of an Opposition beat-up on this issue. I thought the Opposition was going to spot a de facto death duty but, under the calm influence of Senator Watson, the Opposition has been very restrained on this one.

         The changes outlined will ensure that any superannuation benefits received by a person from a deceased person will be assessed against the deceased person's reasonable benefits limit and not interfere with the RBLs of living persons receiving such benefits. The new rules will treat death benefits on a consistent basis irrespective of whether or not they are received through an estate. Where a non-excessive benefit is paid to a dependant, it will be totally tax-free. Where such a benefit is paid to a person who is not a dependant of the deceased, it is taxed at 15 per cent if paid from a taxed source, or 30 per cent if paid from an untaxed source. Benefits paid in excess of a deceased person's RBL will be taxed as an excessive component irrespective of whether or not they are paid to a dependant.

         The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill also deals with the taxation of excessive components of benefits. Currently, these are taxed at the member's marginal tax rate. The Bill proposes to increase the tax to the top marginal rate of 47 per cent plus the Medicare levy. We think this is a very progressive measure. It will assist the equity of the superannuation system markedly over time. However, as is so often the case, this supposedly simple change involves incredibly complex amendments to the rates Act. Both these measures to which I have referred start on 1 July 1994.

         The notice requirements concerning personal superannuation policies are also being revised to take into account the decision last year to eliminate the tax deduction for most employees contributing to these plans. I think we all remember this decision. This is where the Opposition, under Senator Alston's portfolio responsibilities, decided to out-GST Prime Minister Keating and said to people who held these superannuation policies, `We will not oppose this measure. If you want to get rid of it, you have to vote us into government'. Unfortunately, for the hundreds of thousands of people concerned, the Opposition did not win government. These people lost their tax break and, as I argued at the time, they lost the chance to top up what is essentially inadequate retirement income.

         —It might be the Opposition's policy, but the Opposition is not doing anything about it. The contributions are taxable, but only where a tax deduction has been allowed to the member. Prior to 1 July 1992, almost all contributions obtained a tax deduction and, hence, were presumed to be taxable contributions unless the taxpayer provided a notice saying that she was not going to claim a tax deduction. Under the new rules, most contributions are not tax deductible and, hence, no contributions tax is payable. Accordingly, the notice requirements have been reversed so that a member must now give notice to the fund if she is going to claim a deduction for the contribution. Although I did not agree to the change in the deduction rules, I do accept that this move should reduce substantially the administrative task of the funds. Hence, we support it.

         There is a technical amendment to the rules applying to continuously complying fixed interest approved deposit funds, or ADFs.

          Perhaps I could proffer some advice: they should seek professional advice because the tax consequences of failure are often pretty severe. The only comment that I wish to make is that before embarking on tax arrangements, whether in relation to a superannuation fund or to corporate income, people should proceed with the greatest of care—the penalties are pretty high if they get it wrong—and, preferably, seek the best professional advice around.

        The Bill will amend several laws including the income tax legislation and the Corporations Law. It contains the measures foreshadowed in the joint statement by the Treasurer and the former Attorney-General on 2 December 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Those measures included abolishing the existing priority of the Commissioner of Taxation for debts in relation to certain unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993. They also included measures to enable the Commissioner to recover the unremitted amounts more quickly through an estimation process and to encourage directors to face emerging problems as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these measures.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Removal of the Commissioner's priority
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commissioner's priority currently applies to amounts deducted by employers from the salary or wages of their employees, and deductions of a similar nature, where those deductions are not paid to the Commissioner. The Commissioner's priority ranks debts for those deductions above all other debts of a person or company in a bankruptcy or insolvency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will remove the Commissioner's priority for debts in respect of those deductions, as well as certain other deductions such as those made from prescribed payments under the prescribed payments system. The amendments will apply to unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result of the amendments, debts due to the Commissioner, arising because of a failure to remit amounts deducted, will be treated in a similar manner to debts payable to other unsecured creditors.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Estimation of unremitted amounts
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments proposed in the Bill will enable the Commissioner to recover unremitted amounts more quickly by estimating those amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993 and by commencing recovery action on the basis of the estimate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commissioner will only make an estimate of the unremitted deductions when the due date has passed and those deductions have not been paid. The main objective of the new regime is to recover the actual deductions made. Ample opportunity will be provided to the person who did not remit the deductions, as required under the tax legislation, to inform the Commissioner of the actual amount deducted.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Directors to be responsible for unremitted amounts
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will also make company directors liable for deductions made by their company and not remitted to the Commissioner. Currently, directors can be convicted in relation to their company's non payment of amounts deducted and can be ordered by a court to pay reparation equal to the deductions not remitted. This new measure will achieve this result more efficiently.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consistent with the theme of the recent amendments to the Corporations Law, this measure will ensure solvency problems are confronted earlier and the escalation of debts will be prevented. The amendments proposed will result in a company either meeting its obligations to pay amounts deducted to the Commissioner or going into voluntary administration or liquidation. Directors will only become liable for unremitted amounts when those options are not taken by their company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another feature of the arrangements will be a requirement on the Commissioner to notify directors who become liable for any unremitted amounts. He will be required to allow those directors a further period of 14 days, during which time the liability can be avoided if one of the options available is exercised.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill contains defences for directors in recovery proceedings by the Commissioner. For example, it will be a defence if a director can prove that because of illness, or some other reason, the director did not take part in the company's management when the company failed to take one of the options available to avoid liability.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill proposes to amend the Corporations Law. The amendments are relatively minor and technical and support the measures to be included in the taxation law. Broadly, they seek to put the Commissioner in the same position as other creditors so that the Commissioner has clear access to all the remedies enjoyed by other creditors. The amendments to the other Acts are purely technical and consequential.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The removal of the Commissioner's priority is essential to the smooth operation of the proposed scheme of voluntary administration under the new insolvency provisions of the Corporations Law due to commence in June this year.

        In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the amendments to the Corporations Law which are contained in the Bill and has approved their introduction into Parliament.

Together these Bills form a very important part of the taxation changes proposed by the Government and it is very difficult to deal with them seriously and comprehensively in the limited time that we have available.

        For those reasons I will be containing my remarks in this debate to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). My colleague Senator Watson will be dealing with other items included in the other Bill. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) seeks to implement the taxation proposals outlined in the Labor Party's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Investing in the nation
        </emphasis>
        statement of 9 February 1993, at the commencement of the last federal election campaign.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The main tax items in that statement and contained in this Bill are, firstly, the introduction of a 10 per cent general investment allowance, similar to the one introduced by the Fraser Government in the early 1980s and ended by Labor in the 1984 Budget. That allowance will apply to eligible equipment acquired between 8 February 1993 and 1 July 1994. The second item is a reduction of 6c in the dollar in the company tax rate from 39c to 33c and a reduction from 30 per cent to 25 per cent in the pooled development funds rate, both commencing on 1 July this year.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Thirdly, there will be the phased reintroduction of a quarterly tax instalment system for company tax payments with an advanced payment schedule, which effectively brings forward revenue to the Commonwealth. Fourthly, there will be an extension of the fringe benefit tax exemptions for booking payments made by employers for private child-care places for their employees' children. This brings the treatment of payments for private centre places into line with public ones.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The other measures contained in the Bill include some amendments to the taxation of foreign investment funds, which Senator Watson will be dealing with; an income tax exemption for defence force and federal police members undertaking activities in Somalia, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia; a re-writing of the gift provisions in section 78 to make them much easier to use, which is a welcome advance; and an amendment granting the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs access to tax information to be used for `the purpose of assisting in the locating of persons who are unlawfully in Australia'.

        That latter item, which involves access to confidential tax records, is a matter of some concern. While the coalition in no way wishes—nor will it—to sanction illegal immigrants in Australia, we also very much respect the privacy of individuals' confidential records. It is therefore obligatory on the Tax Office—and I hope it will take very careful note of this—and also on the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that this new power be used very sparingly indeed as a last resort, and only to identify the whereabouts of these people. It must not become a Trojan horse for access to financial and income details. We will be very carefully monitoring this access provision. Where necessary, we will raise concerns with the Privacy Commissioner, whom we would also expect will have an involvement in the operation of these measures.

        The item I mainly want to deal with relates to the reduction in the company tax rate from 39c in the dollar to 33c. That reduction would undoubtedly be welcome, as Australia seeks to move its tax rates closer to its Asian competitors, if it were responsibly funded. I will come back to that funding question later, but I point out that the irony in this measure is that just a week or so after the announcement of the reduction, Singapore announced a cut in its already lower than the Australian company tax rate. The problem is that under this Government we are only ever going part of the way some of the time. That is because of the Government's failure and unwillingness to undertake measures in other areas of its economic policy which would enable it to make the tax changes that would make us fully competitive with many of our competitors.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        There are a number of problems arising from this measure which I want to raise concerns about. Firstly, Australia's personal income tax rates are already way out of kilter with company tax rates. The existing company tax rate of 39 per cent is well less than the top marginal rate of, when we count in the Medicare levy, 48.4 per cent. This latest reduction will only widen the difference between the top personal rate and the company rate. That gap will inevitably lead to greater incorporation as businesses and individuals seek to take advantage of a lower tax rate.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        For those earning over $40,000—and that is about the figure at which the top marginal tax rate comes in, and that is not a high income overall—this gap will be worth, in tax rate terms, 15.4 per cent. Assurances by the Tax Office that it can deal with this gap and prevent tax leakage are difficult to accept. I hope that we will see some clearer evidence that this is a manageable issue.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        My second concern is that the reduction in the company tax rate will also have the secondary effect of devaluing the imputation credits attached to dividends paid to local investors. EPAC has calculated that the six per cent company tax rate cut is worth only 1.5 per cent to local investors, compared with 5.2 per cent for foreigners. In fact, the tax payable by local investors will actually be higher, at 31.8 per cent, than for foreigners, at 28.1 per cent. The result of this will be either lower Australian equity investment by individuals or increased dividend payouts by companies. The implications, in terms of investment, savings and the like, could be significant.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        My third concern is that this proposal will cost $1.8 billion, on the Government's costing. The Government simply does not have this sort of money to give away. The unfunded nature of this proposal is being met partly in the short-term by fiddling the timing of company tax instalments, which I will deal with separately. But in the end, it will be just another addition to the Budget deficit and to our public debt. That, of course, is already far too high. It will also lead to higher interest rates, and it staves off investment rather than encouraging it, as the Government claims.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        My fourth concern is that our indirect taxes, which add significantly to the costs of Australian business, are not being reduced. The Government may have reduced the tax on profits, but it has failed to address the competitiveness of sales. It continues to ignore the fundamental need to encourage the very income production which provides the tax base for company tax. Cost competitiveness is the key to individual company success—it is the key to income generation, profit generation and, therefore, to that tax base for individual companies—but it is also the key to Australia's success in export markets and import replacement. Whether a company is an individual company or is competing on the overseas market or the domestic market—either with or without import replacement—if it cannot gain a sale, then the rate of tax on profits is purely academic.

        —Yes, $20 billion. It also gave business a tax advantage of several billion dollars through improved depreciation arrangements, all of which were fully funded. The net benefit to firms and their relative competitiveness would have been greatly enhanced by such moves. In fact, the eventual need to pay for this Government's company tax rate measure will, in all likelihood, based on experience, lead to higher costs on business through wholesale sales taxes; a new energy tax, which is obviously being mooted; higher government charges; or reduced corporate tax deductions, for instance, on superannuation contributions. There is no way that the Government's figures add up at the moment. Some fundamental changes will have to be made by way of tax increases, unless there are necessary offsetting expenditure reductions, in order to even start moving towards a balancing of the books.

        It was distressing to hear Senator Evans in Question Time today, in response to my question, confirm that the Government is not to make any moves at all in the coming financial year to reduce the Budget deficit from its horrendous level of something like $16 billion. Heaven knows what that is going to do to confidence in the economy, investor confidence and confidence from overseas partners and investors; heaven knows what it is going to do to the dollar; and heaven knows what it is going to do to the whole structure of our debt situation.

        The reintroduction of quarterly company tax instalments, whilst a welcome move, is being implemented for all the wrong reasons; namely, to bring forward company tax collections simply to shore up the Government's Budget over the next few years. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the disastrous 85 per cent-15 per cent instalments were also introduced in 1988 to assist the Budget rather than business cash flows.

        The net effect of the present measure—in other words, to go back to the quarterly payments—will be to strip corporate Australia of $600 million next year, $1.6 billion in 1995-96 and a further $1.7 billion in 1996-97. That money which otherwise could have gone to purchasing new equipment or stock will now end up in the Treasury coffers to be spent elsewhere. The Government has robbed Peter to pay Paul within the corporate structure and, in doing so, it will add to business costs; almost certainly add to interest rate pressures; and, therefore, almost certainly reduce the competitiveness of Australian business.

        —As my friend Senator Watson says, it will make the cash flow situation more difficult for some businesses. What does the package as a whole mean? Taken in the context of the new Labor Government's enormous Budget deficit problems, and coming on top of the legislated personal income tax cuts, it means that the Commonwealth will have yet more unfunded measures to try to grapple with in the future. It means that the Government will add to its already significant borrowings over the next few years, which is the same thing as saying that the Government will run down our nation's savings. The Government is drawing down our national savings, whilst all the rhetoric of government is that it has, as a top priority, the building of the nation's savings. What it says in the fine rhetoric is totally contradicted by its performance and its actions.

        This need for extra revenue arises because the Government has presided over the worst deterioration in the Commonwealth's budgetary position since the Second World War. Over the last three years alone the Commonwealth's budgetary position has deteriorated by more than $30 billion on a cumulative basis. That figure is in excess of seven per cent of GDP. On current independent projections—they are not mine—it could mean the Commonwealth borrowing no less than another $60 billion in the next four years. That, of course, is $60 billion worth of savings, both national and foreign, which will add to our foreign debt and severely limit our national productive investment. With our very low national savings and, in fact, dissavings for the last seven quarters—unprecedented in our history and one of the most serious long-term problems that we have ever faced and will face in the future—that is $60 billion which Australia cannot afford now and in particular cannot afford in the future.

Whilst the coalition will not oppose the measures contained in this Bill, we will wait with great interest for the next couple of taxation amendment Bills in this Parliament. There can be little doubt that they will be jam-packed with proposals for new or expanded taxes. Before the Government rushes in to introduce those Bills, I would remind it that it should bear well in mind that the one thing for which this Government does not have a mandate is new taxes.

        —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill was introduced during the last session of Parliament but it lapsed because of the election. It has been reintroduced in the same form, except for one additional transitional measure concerning amendments to the capital gains tax. This is another omnibus Bill dealing with various income tax, capital gains tax, PAYE and fringe benefits tax matters.

        A technical amendment is proposed to deal with the problems of the unique nature of the leave conditions of waterfront employees. The employment practices in the industry mean that employees are unlikely to work for one employer for long enough to use their accrued leave, such as long service leave. So an employer makes payments on behalf of an employee to the person's new employer in respect of accrued leave. Under the current law an employer is only allowed a tax deduction when the leave payment goes to the employee.

        In stevedoring most employees do not remain with an employer for long enough to accrue the full amount of long service leave, so it is perfectly reasonable that the system make special provision for the particularities of a special industry. This Bill does so, and the Australian Democrats support this provision.

        The Bill, though, ignores the wider question of the appropriate tax treatment of provisions made by companies for accrued long service leave liabilities, indeed any leave liabilities. It is good business practice to set aside resources as and when liabilities accrue. Indeed, we now have a situation where some States are very concerned that this path has not been followed in the past with respect to superannuation.

        Unfortunately, the law does not recognise the setting aside of moneys to cover actual accrued liabilities as a tax deduction. Indeed, subsection 51(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act specifically precludes a deduction being granted to the employer until the leave is actually paid. The Democrats would argue that this provision is unfair in that it does not recognise the commercial reality of our industrial law. Once an employee's right to a benefit is fully vested, then there is no doubt that a liability has been incurred by the employer. Consequently, a deduction should be allowed to reflect that commercial reality.

        In the Nilsen Development Laboratories case it was held that a deduction was allowable in respect of accrued liabilities. The government of the day enacted the current subsection 51(3) to overcome this decision, although the commissioner subsequently won an appeal to the High Court. The rule is being adjusted to take into account the individual situation applying in the waterfront industry. This amendment would not have been necessary if the provision had been more commercially realistic in the first place.

        There will also be the rewriting of the motor vehicle cost price depreciation limit provisions. The new regime alters the basis of the system from one of tax years to one of financial years. Under the current rules a taxpayer with a substituted accounting period, that is, a year which does not match the financial year, may be entitled to a higher depreciation limit than a taxpayer with a normal accounting period, where the two people buy an identical motor vehicle and first use it on the same date. So there is a distortion, but it is a minor one and the new regime proposes to fix it. In the scheme of things it seems a strange priority, almost bordering on the trivial, but the Democrats will support it.

        Finally, the PAYE provisions are to be amended in two respects. Firstly, those young people employed under the landcare and environment action program known as LEAP—the environment corps which was established at the youth unemployment summit last year in a measure which the Australian Democrats wholeheartedly support—receive a taxable training allowance. Although it is taxable it is not within the definition of salary and wages and hence no instalments can be deducted each fortnight. This Bill will remedy this technical deficiency.

        The second Bill we are debating, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, is a further omnibus taxation Bill which proposes amendments in the area of income tax and fringe benefits tax. Apart from the company tax decision, which I will deal with last, the Bill proposes to introduce an investment allowance. One could say that this is a blatant political countermeasure to a virtually identical proposal floated in Fightback II. An investment allowance is an investment incentive which grants an extra deduction on top of the existing depreciation and development allowance arrangements on capital investment. It is an incentive to invest, but it is neutral in the sense that it applies to all sectors equally. The measure is for a short time—it applies to investments made between the date of the announcement, which was 9 February 1993, and 1 July 1994. It is budgeted to cost $130 million in the first year, $330 million in 1994-95, and $270 million in 1995-96. These costings have been questioned as being too conservative by some people. If they are, it means that investment has been underestimated, and I think that is one of the risks that we can live with.

I have spoken on this issue on many occasions in this place.

        Fringe benefits tax is a tax imposed on non-cash benefits paid to employees by employers. We have always said that it is a very fair tax. The system is designed so that all benefits are taxed unless they are specifically exempted. There are many exemptions, including some concerning child-care benefits. This Bill proposes to increase the existing exemptions for contributions for priority of access payments from only those made to an eligible child-care centre under the Child Care Act 1972 to include priority of access payments made in respect of family day care, care outside school hours or care in school vacations. What these terms actually embrace will be set out in the employer contribution guidelines which will be issued by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Community Services.

        The income tax law works on the basis of voluntary compliance. A key aspect of this is the fact that taxpayers can be confident that their tax records are completely secret when lodged with the Tax Office. Hence, there are very strict secrecy rules and very harsh penalties if these are broken. Recognising, though, that there are some circumstances where the public interest overrides the private interest of the taxpayer concerned, there are some circumstances where it is appropriate to disclose the information. Some examples are for law enforcement actions, royal commissions, fraud control with the Department of Social Security, et cetera. This Bill proposes to allow access to the department of immigration to ensure compliance with immigration law, especially visa conditions regarding employment.

Companies are separate legal entities from their shareholders and, as such, they earn income and pay tax on that income. Personal income tax, by comparison, is a multirate progressive tax. It has a tax free—that is, a zero percentage—ban and progressively higher marginal tax rates as income increases. This ensures that the average rate of tax payable increases as income increases.

In the uncertainty of those days leading up to the election there was obviously a political mileage too great to resist and the Government outbid the coalition by proposing to cut the tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent from 1 July 1993.

        A cut in the rate of company tax will benefit all profitable companies, and that is the point. Their contribution will be cut by about 20 per cent, and this represents about $1.7 billion per annum. This windfall will be recouped by the Commonwealth by bringing forward existing company tax payments into a current year quarterly system. Basically this is structured to make companies pay less tax earlier. After 1996-97—that means 1997-98 and beyond—this funding source will dry up and then there will be a permanent $1.7 billion increase in the deficit—a bit of tricky footwork there. The beneficiaries of this cut will be domestic shareholders whose shares will increase in value due to the reduced company tax.

Indeed, one does not get anything from this if one earns under $20,700 a year.

        The rhetoric being run is that this gives us a more competitive business tax system and will increase investment. It might be true, but the method is about the bluntest instrument to achieve such an outcome. It only benefits those companies which make a profit. Since in Australia at the moment we have double digit unemployment, surely the priority should be to help people find work but not to cut taxes for the very wealthy. This tax delivers a massive windfall to existing companies.

        —The Senate is debating cognately the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. Both Bills reflect the rapid change to tax law spearheaded by the Labor Government and its tax architect, the former Taxation Commissioner, Trevor Boucher. The new commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, now has the job of fitting in the missing pieces—details that should have been part and parcel of the earlier legislation.

        A number of measures in this Bill have caused the coalition some concern. For example, there are far too many elements of retrospectivity. Firstly, I refer to the amendments regarding accrued leave payments. This measure is concerned with payments made by a former employer to a current employer in respect of the accrued leave entitlements of employees whose services are being transferred.

        While the intention is that only a few industries will be affected by the provision, namely industries in which employees change employers so frequently that awards permit entitlements to leave to be based on total service with a number of employers, I believe that a literal reading may give this amendment a much wider and an unintended scope.

        It also concerns me that the drafting of the proposed legislation has created some unintended consequences. A literal reading of this section deems it to have effect since 1978. For practical purposes, the retrospective aspect would be four years. While the coalition has concerns about retrospectivity, in this case the retrospectivity provides some benefit to certain classes of taxpayers. However, the Senate must not overlook the fact that the other retrospective element within the same measure could create doubts about prior application of certain awards which many employers, other than those affected on the waterfront, may not know much about. Allowing this retrospectivity may encourage award changes in other industries to enable employers to pick up the liability when employees change jobs.

        The explanatory memorandum claims that in practice the retrospective character of the amendment will not disadvantage taxpayers because the amendment will give effect to the interpretation of the law which the Commissioner of Taxation has applied from the commencement of section 51(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act until 24 August 1989, when the commissioner changed his earlier interpretation as a result of the decision in the TNT Skypack case.

        For the record, I think it should be noted that the TNT Skypack case involved the sale of a business, whereas section 51(3), introduced in 1978, sought to deny deductions essentially for provisions for such things as long service leave and sick pay, and to allow the deduction only when the benefit was paid when the leave was taken or a benefit was derived by a beneficiary of the deceased person who derived the benefit.

        It is remarkable to consider that since 1978 section 51(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act has denied a deduction in respect of leave payments unless they are made to the employee or to his or her estate. Business is of the belief that the amendments should have been much more narrowly drafted so as to clearly confine their operation to the issue at hand and that the amendment should not be retrospective. We will have to consider the possibility of an amendment after hearing some explanations during the committee stage.

        Secondly, the coalition is concerned about the retrospective aspect contained in the depreciation broadbanding measures. The broadbanding legislation needed amending, and I have no doubt that this has occurred. A literal interpretation could have led to an item of plant at a higher rate than that intended by the drafter of the legislation. No-one would really be worried about an amendment to fix a mischief of that kind, but it is quite a different matter to legislate for the change to have a retrospective effect. Not only is retrospective legislation wrong in principle; in this instance it will mean that taxpayers who have been prepared and have lodged their returns based on the black letter of the law—and that is important—would now have to lodge amended returns. Unnecessary time, effort and money will be spent—all because of poor drafting.

I commend the Government for extending the provision to cover a situation in which a vehicle has to be modified to allow people with disabilities access through wheelchairs. This is consistent with the concessional treatment granted in sales tax legislation and is symmetrical. Therefore, I believe that it is important.

The changes introduced in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and which were not contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1992 should allow the maximum flexibility for assets to be transferred between companies within a wholly owned corporate group to both maximise economic efficiencies and reduce unnecessary compliance costs.

        This raises privacy provisions.

I ask the Government to act because we are seeing more and more extensions and liberalisations of the privacy provisions without adequate privacy protections. I think such a mechanism is needed in the interests of protecting the privacy of so-called innocent persons.

        I now turn to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. I do so quickly because I do not wish to canvass issues raised by Senator Kernot and by my colleague Senator Short, who made a very fine contribution. This Bill makes provision for a 10 per cent margin of error in estimating corporate income. I remind the Senate that that does not match up with a 15 per cent margin which applies to provisional taxpayers. The question arises as to why the Government believes that corporate officers have better foresight in estimating the income of corporate organisations than provisional taxpayers have in estimating theirs. I believe that this anomaly needs to be addressed.

        The company rate is to be reduced from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. The reduction in the corporate rate hopefully should  stimulate some new corporate investment. I acknowledge that, but it will not do much to lower the cost structure because most firms do not always take the tax component into account when calculating their costs. It is far better, as Fightback states, to lower the cost structure by taking those hidden taxes out of business costs.

        I refer to a report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council, which suggests that the reduction of the company tax rate will only deliver marginal benefits to local firms.

In comparison, the real cost to local investors will be reduced by only 1.5 per cent to 31.8 per cent.

        It is also interesting to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) informed the House of Representatives at Question Time that the reduction would mean a tax rate comparable with that of Singapore and about the average for countries in the Asian region. In other words, it is meant to give Australia an advantage. However, the Prime Minister seems to have either forgotten or does not know that Singapore has just reduced its company tax rate to 27 per cent and there are further plans for a reduction to 25 per cent. Thus, we are not comparable with Singapore and never will be because Singapore plans to undercut the advantage Australia was presumably to obtain by this measure.

        Concern has been expressed that, given the disparity between the top marginal rate of 48.4 per cent from 1 July, which includes the Medicare levy, and the proposed company tax rate of 33 per cent, incorporation may be a very attractive option for some classes of taxpayer. It is generally thought that certain taxpayers will incorporate despite the Australian Taxation Office and the Government saying that the anti-avoidance law is adequate to prevent such change.

Now suddenly the industry discovers without warning, according to statements made in the explanatory memorandum, the Government has effectively decided that because the company is owned by the policyholders all the funds held are in fact insurance funds and should be taxed accordingly.

        I turn now to the general investment allowance. I believe that this is a not unreasonable measure. But life assurance companies have been prejudiced from being able to claim the allowance on new plant and equipment that they purchase. This applied to the development allowance and, under this legislation, it will apply to the investment allowance. It applies in circumstances in which the companies are providers for beneficiaries who are annuitants and that proportion of tax in the life assurance company's hands, as such, is exempt. This creates some problems for the industry in that it tends to deny it access to both the development allowance passed last year and the investment allowance which we are debating at the moment.

        It is important to follow through the whole of subdivision B, the development allowance of part III of the Act. It is clear from section 82AA that the property to which the allowance is to be applied is that which is used by the taxpayer, wholly and exclusively in Australia, for the purpose of producing assessable income; that is, the end user of an eligible item must use that property for the above purpose. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the new allowance is to apply only to plant and equipment used wholly and exclusively for producing assessable income. This being so, life companies and superannuation funds will not be eligible for the deduction for equipment that they acquire for use in their businesses because of the apportionment of investment income to current pension and immediate annuity business.

It seems quite unfair that this group of people should be taxed at the rate of 39 per cent, the trustee rate, when the ordinary corporate rate is 33 per cent.

        I turn briefly to the reduction of company tax for most companies in Australia from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Senator Watson, in his very illuminating and excellent address to the chamber on the second reading, said that this was due to pressure from international competition. He indicated that company tax has not caught up with international competition, and I think he said the company tax rate in Singapore is 27 per cent. How far are we going to chase this rabbit?

It is unfortunate that we have only a very short time to debate these important matters, but it is very important to debate them as matters of principle. In my view, in recent times there has been a relatively greater reliance on the taxation of labour as opposed to taxation on capital or land. The pressure of international competition has seen company tax rates reduced to 33 per cent, and the granting of full imputation of company tax credits to shareholders to avoid double taxation of profit. The result of that was adverted to by Senator Kernot—

The gradual abandonment by the Commonwealth of the taxation of capital is understandable to a certain extent, as I have indicated, but that still leaves a choice to be made whether to tax land, which embraces all natural resources, or labour. Labour income, especially pay as you earn income, has borne the brunt of Commonwealth taxation in recent years. Those who have borne it most of all are the families. They are being discriminated against in comparison with companies. My view is that income should be taxed in the hands of the ultimate beneficial recipient of the income. The taxation principle ought to be that an income is taxed according to the number of dependants upon that income. That is not the case at the present moment.

        It is unjust that family income sharing is presumed by social security law and practice but denied under taxation law. For example, the Government's rationale for abolishing the junior unemployment benefit was that under-18-year-olds should be supported at home by their parents, but it gave no extra tax threshold to the parents paying for that budgetary saving. By contrast, the principle of tracing income to the ultimate beneficiary is well accepted in the taxation of ordinary trust, partnership and company income. The income of trusts or partnerships is not taxed in the hands of the trustee or partnership firm. It is quite correctly taxed in the hands of the trust beneficiaries or partners. Analogously, the income of companies, whilst originally taxed in the company's hands, now carries a credit to ensure that trading profits are taxed as much as if they were derived directly by shareholders.

        The principle is well accepted in the case of deceased estates and family law settlements where income out of family maintenance or testamentary trusts for children is taxed as the child's income and not as income of either the custodial or non-custodial parent. The principle is accepted in the social security system, which splits the income of a married pensioner couple and allows one partner's unused pensioner tax rebate to be transferred to the other. Yet the principle is rejected in the case of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers on the legal precept that the income of a wage or salary earner is his or hers alone. This precept has no regard to any obligation under common law or Family Law Act for a wage earner to share income with his or her spouse and children under his or her duty to maintain them.

        In any case, every statistical collection based on the household recognises the economic reality that a vast degree of income redistribution goes on in the household. The legalistic rejection of tax recognition of the economic reality of intra-family income sharing hits workers hard, especially those males and females trying to support a family on one income. They will be paying far more tax in percentage terms than the present 33 per cent that applies to company tax. It is a curious irony of our fiscal system that the tax treatment of the children of divorced or deceased millionaires can be more equitable than that of ordinary pay-as-you-earn workers and their families.

        I turn to the question of tax exemptions for child care and point to an anomaly in that area. This matter might also be raised at the meeting on Friday. I will certainly be raising it during the Committee of the Whole debate when this Bill comes back before the Senate next Monday or Tuesday. The Bill extends the exemption from fringe benefits tax for employer paid child care. Payments for family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care will now be tax-free if paid for by the employer. I question the equity of that arrangement.

        Under sections 47(2) and 47(8) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act, child care provided by an employer is an exempt fringe benefit provided that the child is being cared for by someone who is not a relative and is being cared for outside his or her home. The definition of `child-care facility' under section 136(1) of the Act expressly excludes a facility at the place of residence of any of the children being minded. So much for the Australian dream of a backyard for the kids to play in. Only a bureaucrat could invent a definition of `family day care' which excludes the care of a child at home. When one thinks about it, it is extraordinary.

        This discrimination against home-grown child care hardly seems to score on the Treasury's fabled level playing field. Does the Government think that the worst that can happen to a child would be for the child to be cared for at the child's own home? If not, why do we not amend the definition of child-care facility in section 136 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to read `a place or residence where a person minds, cares for or educates children' and remove the restriction in sections 47(2) and 47(8)? Why continue this ludicrous situation? I will be pursuing this inequity further in the committee stage.

        Why should the treatment of an employee's child-care expenses depend on whether he or she can find an employer willing to subsidise them? Equity would demand that all employees, regardless of their situation, have available a similar tax allowance for child care. I understand there is a need for some other business to be brought on. I will not seek to continue my remarks. I will leave it at that for the time being.

        The wool tax rebate is a mechanism of distributing surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC) funds that are not prudently required for debt management purposes. In calculating the amount of any surplus towards the end of each financial year, the AWRC considers several factors including the market outlook for the following year, the level of debt compared to the balances specified in the debt reduction schedule, and AWRC's performance to date in the particular financial year. Under the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, the AWRC then advises the Minister of the amount of surplus funds (if any) and the Minister, following consultations with the Wool Council of Australia, the Treasurer and Minister for Finance, then determines how any surplus is distributed.

        The 3.5 per cent rebate of wool tax for the 1992-93 wool selling season distributed the AWRC's surplus funds derived from its better than expected performance in 1991-92. For the 1993-94 season, I announced on 28 April that the Government considered there was no capacity to continue to provide a rebate beyond 30 June 1994, but in view of the current economic circumstances facing the industry, the total rate of the wool tax would be reduced to 8.5 per cent. This means that, subject to the normal statutory consultation process, the return to the prescribed level of tax will be postponed for one year.

        In order to avoid a situation in which the AWRC would be forced to sell wool from the stockpile into the depressed market in order to meet its debt repayment schedule (with negative impacts on woolgrowers' incomes), the Government has also decided to extend the repayment schedule by one year to eight years from 1991 and to introduce greater flexibility to the schedule, including the removal of the requirement for the Commission to repay any debt beyond the funds it currently holds for that purpose.
