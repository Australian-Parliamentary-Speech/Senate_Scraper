       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       But for a High Court decision narrowly favouring the Federal Government, 20,000 years old archaeological cave sites near the Franklin River, Tasmania, would have been destroyed, like a United Kingdom Government unable to stop a Wiltshire authority from clearing Stonehenge for a freeway. Constitutional protection for historical and environmental assets is needed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution so that the Federal Government has the bounden constitutional duty, which any citizen may legally require it to perform and a right superior to state and local governments, to set above the commercial advantage of one generation, protect and restore all we hold in trust for the future-including relics, sites, features, areas, wildlife, buildings or things of Aboriginal and other historical, cultural, architectural, scientific, aesthetic, ecological or environmental importance and-to care for the maintenance of the balance of nature, manage land, marine and atmospheric use so as to avoid their degradation and act nationally and internationally in any matter seen as related to these including-to prevent military and commercial use of uranium and derivatives, beach and related mining; to preserve Heritage Areas, The Great Barrier Reef Region at least as originally defined in the 1975 Act and extended into Torres Strait.

       An ID card numbering system for all Australians would give future governments tremendous power to collect sensitive information and use it against us.

      <para>
       Criminal elements could benefit by forging cards and documents needed to obtain them, or illegally accessing the data in the system. The dangers are much greater than with current systems such as Medicare, as the Australia Card number could link so many different confidential records.

       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. We reject in principle the need for a national ID card on the basis that it will be a gross violation of individual liberty.
      </para>

      <para>
       4. We believe as a matter of faith and judgment that the proposed legislation is anti-God and that its implementation will result in further attacks on individual freedom and responsibility, the family and the Church and that the real intent is the promotion of a powerful secular humanist ``big brother'' government.

       The petition of the undersigned expresses concern that some scientists in Australia are intent on undertaking destructive experimentation on human embryos. This subject was examined exhaustively by the 1985-86 Senate Select Committee on Senator Harradine's Human Embryo Experimentation Bill which received 270 submissions and more than 2,000 pages of evidence. The report of the Senate Committee recommended in October 1986 that the Commonwealth Government make unlawful any destructive experiment which frustrated the development of the human embryo.

       Pine Gap Defence Space Research Facility

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       We, the undersigned, call on the Federal Government to give notice to terminate the lease of the US base at Pine Gap before October 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       We believe that in the interests of world peace and the Australian people, this lease should be terminated and the base closed because Pine Gap is a spy base and a war base:
      </para>
      <para>
       Since it was opened in 1969, it has eavesdropped on Australian telephone and telex communications. Information obtained in this way was used by the CIA to destabilise the Whitlam Government in late 1975.
      </para>
      <para>
       It provides communication facilities for CIA activity in countries throughout the world, much of which is connected with overthrowing other country's governments. Last year it became clear Pine Gap was spying on Greece.
      </para>
      <para>
       The electronic and photographic information its satellites receive is used to select nuclear targets in the territory of the Soviet Union and its allies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many US military activities short of nuclear war are also co-ordinated by Pine Gap. These include the war against Vietnam and the invasion of Lebanon by US marines in 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       Pine Gap spends only a tiny percentage of its time monitoring arms control agreements, and even then the data gathered is so top-secret Australia has no access to it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Pine Gap's role will be expanded under Reagan's Star Wars scheme to extend the arms race to outer space, threatening the existence of our planet.

       </para>
       <para>
        These regulations retrospectively restored certain goods to eligibility for a Tariff Concession Order. A period of retrospectivity of 2 years was involved. The Committee sought an explanation for this extremely long period. The Minister has explained that an administrative oversight resulted in certain goods not being exempted from duty as was intended. The Minister decided to exempt these goods on a retrospective basis to the benefit of the relevant importers who will obtain a refund. The Committee takes a serious view of retrospectivity beyond 6 months and it has long been the Committee's policy to report to the Senate any restrospectivity beyond 2 years. In this case the Committee is satisfied that the retrospectivity will be beneficial. The Committee remains concerned about the use of legislative retrospectivity to correct administrative oversights. It should not be looked upon as a panacea for administrative mistakes. The Committee will continue to report retrospectivity to the Senate.

        Certain discretionary decisions did not appear to be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in circumstances where adverse decisions could cause hardship.

        The determination in question gave Departmental Secretaries power to take certain management decisions ``in the public interest''. The Committee thought this was a vague criterion more appropriate for Ministers. The Department has now agreed to replace it so that decisions will be taken ``in the interests of the [Public] Service''. Those interests will be expressly specified in terms of skills, costs, efficiency and related factors.

        Dear Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        At its meeting on 14 May 1987 the Committee considered the Customs Regulations (Amendment) being Statutory Rules 1987 No. 72 tabled in the Senate on 11 May 1987. It would be helpful if you would clarify a particular matter for the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Explanatory Statement indicates that, with retrospective effect to 1 July 1985, the Regulations restore rubber coated work gloves to eligibility for a Tariff Concession Order. The restoration is stated to be pursuant to a recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission in its recent report on the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industry in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you know the Committee carefully monitors the use of retrospectivity in delegated legislation to determine whether an unreasonably long period of retrospectivity is provided for, and to assess whether, in operation, the retrospectivity is prejudicial to the interests of any person. Where the expenditure of money is involved, the Committee's concern arises because of the need to balance the interests of fair treatment for individuals against the interests of parliamentary propriety when retrospective laws deny Parliament the opportunity to examine expenditure at the time and in the circumstances to which it relates. I recently made a statement to the Senate on the question of retrospectivity in delegated legislation which may be of interest to you (Senate Hansard, 12 April 1987, page 2628).
       </para>
       <para>
        In the present case, retrospectivity of almost 2 years is involved and there is a short explanation in the Explanatory Statement as to why such a lengthy period elapsed before the claims of rubber coated work gloves to potential tariff concession eligibility were once more recognised. It would, however, be very helpful for the Committee if you would explain in a little more detail than does the current Statement the background to the change in the Regulations, the general operation of Schedule 2 of the Principal Regulations and why 1 July 1985 came to be the date chosen for retrospective operation. Can you also assure the Committee that the retrospective effect of the Regulations will operate to the advantage of all relevant persons and not to the detriment of any persons other than the Commonwealth?
       </para>
       <para>
        Your advice on these questions would be very much appreciated by the Committee.

        I write with regard to your letters dated 26 May 1987 and 9 October 1987 regarding queries concerning amendments to the Customs Regulations made by Statutory Rules 1987 No. 72, which retrospectively restored the ability of rubber coated work gloves to receive Tariff Concession Orders.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Tariff Concession System succeeded the Commercial By-Law System and came into effect on 1 July 1985. The laws governing the administration of the System can be found in Part XVA of the Customs Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        To enhance the efficiency of tariff concession administration a provision (section 269d) was inserted into the Act to allow goods declared by Regulation to be goods in respect of which a Tariff Concession Order shall not be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule 2 to the Customs Regulations identifies the goods in respect of which a Tariff Concession Order may not be made. The original listing was introduced on 1 July 1985 to coincide with the commencement of the Tariff Concession System. Column 3 of the Schedule lists exceptions to the exclusions.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the original Schedule was being framed it was recognised that specialist apparel such as gloves, mittens and mitts of the work type could not be entirely supplied by Australian manufacturers and should be specified in Column 3 as exceptions to the goods in respect of which Tariff Concession Orders could not be made. Due to an oversight such goods classified to Item 60.06 of the Customs Tariff were not made exceptions to Item 10 of the Schedule.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following representations from an importer of industrial apparel and in view of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear industries regarding the Tariff Concession System exclusion schedule, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce agreed that the error should be corrected. The date chosen for retrospective operation to accord consistent treatment to all types of gloves, mittens and mitts of the work type was 1 July 1985, the date which was originally intended for concessional treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the amendment is to allow an application for a Tariff Concession Order for chemical resistant rubber work gloves to be considered. The application will only be approved if the Comptroller-General of Customs is satisfied that concessional entry would not be to the detriment of Australian industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Retrospective operation of any concession will allow all importers of such goods to obtain a refund of duties paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the retrospective effect for the Regulations will effectively confer a benefit.

        Dear Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        At its meeting on 14 May 1987 the Committee considered the Long Service Leave (Building and Construction Industry) (Amendment) Ordinance 1987, being A.C.T. Ordinance No. 16 of 1987 tabled in the Senate on 11 May 1987. Would you be good enough to assist the Committee with some questions it has concerning rights of review under the Ordinance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, the Committee noted that new section 57 of the Principal Ordinance provides for the method of calculation that is to be used to determine the amount of the payments to be made to an applicant in respect of long service leave. There appear to be certain discretionary elements in this otherwise mathematical process. Thus, in subparagraph 57 (1) (b) (ii), for the purposes of the calculation, the Building and Construction Industry Long Service Leave Board may determine a notional weekly average of the ordinary remuneration of the applicant in various circumstances. There appears to be no provision for review of disputed decisions made under this provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the Committee noted that under new subparagraph 56a (3) (d) (vi) the Board shall give advice as to whether or not the Board is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to payment for service in a reciprocating State or Territory. There appears to be no provision for review of the adverse exercise of this important discretion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the Committee noted the amendments being made to section 45 of the Principal Ordinance. Section 45 provides for removal of names from the Employees and Contractors Register and the subsequent re-registration of names in certain circumstances. These processes appear to contain important discretionary elements. Whether or not a person's name appears accurately in the Register impinges on the question of eligibility for payment under the scheme in the legislation. The adverse exercise of the discretions appears not to be subject to review.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee noted that the legislation does contain some important review rights. Thus, under paragraph 59 (1) (g) of the Principal Ordinance applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision by the Board ``refusing to make a payment to an applicant under section 55 or 56''. The Committee also noted that paragraph 28 (b) of the amendment Ordinance adds a new right to seek review of a discretionary decision refusing to authorise a payment to be made under section 56b (payments by a reciprocal authority on the Board's behalf).
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be that the present express right to review of an outright refusal to pay monies due, may not encompass a right to review the Board's agreement to pay a disputed sum determined by the calculation process referred to above. Equally if non-inclusion in the Register might result in the Board's refusal to pay, inclusion of errorous or misleading details might well result in the payment of a disputed sum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee is at present inclined to the view that because of their discretionary elements, and because of the serious affect which adverse decisions could have on employees' rights, decisions made by the Board under sections 45 and 57 and subparagraph 56a (3) (d) (iv) should perhaps be made reviewable by the AAT. Your comments and advice on this proposition would be very much appreciated by the Committee.

       </para>

        The Committee raised several matters relating to review of discretionary decisions by the Building and Construction Industry Long Service Leave Board under section 45, 56a and 57 of the Ordinance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Advice from the Attorney-General's Department has indicated that a review is appropriate in respect of discretions under section 45, 56a and 57 and, accordingly, I have requested that the Ordinance be amended to provide a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the case of sections 45 and 56a and 57. I have also asked that paragraph 57 (1) (b) (ii) be amended to clarify the nature of the Board's discretions.
       </para>
       <para>
        You should note that it will be some months before the necessary amendments can be drafted due to the extremely limited resources available to draft ACT legislation. You can be assured however that the necessary work will be completed as soon as practicable.

       <para>
        At its meeting on 28 May 1987 the Committee considered Public Service Board Determination No. 21 of 1987 dealing with aspects of the transfer of officers within the service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before detailing the nature of the Committee's interest in this legislation, it might be helpful if I briefly indicate the basis of the Committee's approach. When applying its scrutiny principles to legislative instruments designed to regulate managerial power and employment discretions in the public service, the defence forces and statutory authorities, the Committee is conscious of the need to strike a balance between, on the one hand, certain managerial imperatives, and on the other hand, the supervisory role of the Committee and of the Senate, in the reasonable protection of the various rights of all Australians. In its endeavours to strike this appropriate balance, the Committee is always appreciative of the advice of Ministers, statutory authority heads and Senators generally. Having said this, it would be very helpful for the Committee if you would clarify the use in Determination No. 21 of the concept ``the public interest'' in the context of Departmental Secretaries' powers to transfer officers for various reasons. Because of its wide import, national implications and lack of precision or settled meaning, the appearance in delegated legislation of the expression ``the public interest'' is examined by the Committee. It is a particularly difficult concept to define if one seeks to identify and properly limit its meaning and scope in the context of the management of the public service. In fact, it is an expression which is often seen to sit at large in order to encompass the widest possible range of influences which may impact on ministerial decisions, usually of national political significance. Thus, particular attention is paid by the Committee to examining this criterion of action where a person or authority other than a Minister is empowered to determine when the public interest shall be called in aid to justify or support administrative decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having examined the Determination in the light of advice, the Committee notes that the public interest concept is left very much to the relevant Secretary to determine. Thus, ``eligible transferred officer'' means, inter alia, an officer who, in accordance with new subclauses 1.2 (3), 1.2 (4) and 1.2 (5), is taken to be transferred in the public interest, or an employee whose transfer is certified by the relevant Secretary as being in the public interest. The expression ``taken to be transferred in the public interest'' in accordance with new subclause 1.2 (3) is elaborated on in that subclause but without further amplification of the content of the concept as certified by a Secretary. In subclause 1.2 (4), for an officer to be taken to be transferred in the public interest, the relevant Secretary must first be satisfied that the transfer is in the public interest having regard to various criteria, including the nature of proven misconduct, certain locality and cost considerations and any other relevant matters. Subclause 1.2 (5) deems an officer to be an ``eligible transferred officer'' if certified by the relevant Secretary to be an officer who is to be taken to be transferred in the public interest having regard to the exceptional circumstances under which the transfer occurs and the greater efficiency in the Department that would result from the transfer.
       </para>
       <para>
        It appears to the Committee that in none of the foregoing examples is the content of this overriding public interest criterion described. It may be that because of the implied ambit of the expression its scope cannot be delimited. Indeed, perhaps for this very reason it is a concept best left in the preserve of ministerial judgments which are called to account in Parliament. By contrast, assessment of matters pertaining to ``greater Departmental efficiency'' is, by definition, the primary, proper and indeed onerous role of Departmental heads. It would appear to be a more appropriate overriding test for a Secretary to apply than the elusive and more politically sensitive test of ``the public interest''.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making these points the Committee is conscious of the very considerable care and skill which your specialist officers devote to the preparation of Determinations. Nevertheless, the Committee does view it as appropriate that it should examine whether the public interest is an acceptable basis for decision-making in the context of this Determination. I should point out in passing that the Committee is not unaware of the use of the expression in other PSB Determinations, most recently PSB Determination 1987/4, clause 4.1, inserting a new subclause 2.3.20 (7) and the somewhat analogous new subclause 2.3.22 (1), into PSB Determination 1983/10 concerning leave for defence purposes.

        Dear Senator Collins
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the letter of 21 June 1987 concerning Public Service Board Determination 1987/21 which was sent from Senator Barney Cooney to Dr Wilenski. I apologise for the delay in responding.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before addressing the issue raised by Senator Cooney, I might first explain why the Department of Industrial Relations is now responding to this letter.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 14 July 1987 the Prime Minister announced major changes to the structure of Commonwealth administration, including the abolition of the Public Service Board (PSB). Following the Prime Minister's 14 July announcement, the Secretary of the Department of Industrial Relations was delegated all PSB powers to make Determinations under section 82d of the Public Service Act 1922. These powers were also subdelegated to the occupants of certain positions of the Department, including the position of First Assistant Commissioner, Working Environment and Conditions Division-this Division having policy responsibility for relocation expense entitlements for Australian Public Service (APS) staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Administrative Arrangements Act 1987 which gave effect to the Prime Minister's 14 July announcement received the Royal Assent on 18 September 1987. Under this Act it has not been necessary to issue new delegations following the PSB's formal abolition. Subsections 11 (2), (5) and (6) of the Act save those delegations, subdelegations and instruments made before 18 September 1987. Further legislation, formally transferring the former PSB powers under Section 82d, has been foreshadowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to the substance of Senator Cooney's letter, we accept the reservations he expresses about use of the term `public interest' in PSB Determination 1987/21. We will therefore be making an amending Determination to entirely remove this term from PSB Determination 1983/10 for the purpose of establishing APS staff relocation expense entitlements.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, whilst in this area of the Determination we accept that it is inappropriate to use the undefined term `public interest', we would prefer its replacement with `Service-wide interest' rather than `greater Departmental efficiency'. The Departmental criterion would in our view be too narrow given for example the need to effect inter-departmental transfers in the interests of the APS at large rather than on the more limited basis of a particular Department's requirements-recent developments in the Service associated with the transfer between Departments of potentially surplus staff, some of whom could have moved between different localities, provide a cogent example of why a Service-wide criterion is necessary. We also have reservations about restricting any relocation expense entitlement to `efficiency' as against a broader criterion that could for example take into account as necessary the personal circumstances of staff where these arose.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary therefore, we propose re-drafting the relevant sections of PSB Determination 1983/10 dealing with relocation expense entitlements in order that:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) all references to `public interest' are removed and replaced with `in the interests of the Service',
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) staff relocated under certain transfer authorities will automatically be entitled to have their transfer expenses met by the Commonwealth, ie:
       </para>
       <para>
        where a vacant position is advertised in the Commonwealth Gazette and a successful applicant is subsequently promoted (paragraph (a) under the definition of `eligible transferred officer' in sub-clause 1.2.1 (1) of the Determination presently refers);
       </para>
       <para>
        where transfer takes place on the grounds of illness or staff move to or from a prescribed remote locality (paragraph (c) under the definition of `eligible transferred officer' in sub-clause 1.2.1 (1) of the Determination presently refers),
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) where Departments have a discretion as to whether the relocation of APS staff is to be considered as having taken place `in the interests of the Service,' the exercise of this discretion will be subject to the following factors:
       </para>
       <para>
        departmental staffing requirements;
       </para>
       <para>
        transfer costs;
       </para>
       <para>
        the efficient utilisation of staff;
       </para>
       <para>
        the skills and abilities of staff relevant to the duties of the transfer position;
       </para>
       <para>
        the career development of staff;
       </para>
       <para>
        the employment history of staff;
       </para>
       <para>
        the personal circumstances of staff; and
       </para>
       <para>
        any other relevant factor(s),
       </para>
       <para>
        (iv) where staff relocate as a consequence of disciplinary action, Departments will continue to have a discretion as to whether relocation is `in the interests of the Service' (in lieu of being in the `public interest'), but the exercise of this discretion will remain subject to those factors presently prescribed at (a) to (f) of sub-clause 1.2.1 (4) of the Determination.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to any further views the Committee may have, we intend to proceed along these lines.

         —The Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee held its first meeting of the Thirty-fifth Parliament on 8 October 1987 and dealt with the very large volume of delegated legislation that had been made since Parliament was dissolved on 5 June 1987. We have had before us 355 separate instruments of legislation and considered 18 reports of legal advisers. We have sent 40 letters to various Ministers about aspects of this legislation which require further scrutiny in accordance with the Committee's technical principles. As honourable senators will know, the Committee's principles deal with personal rights and parliamentary proprieties. I have given notice of motion regarding 17 instruments, our scrutiny of which has caused us to look at some important issues. We are hopeful that in those matters where no protective notice of motion has been given explanations will also be received expeditiously. In keeping with the Committee's usual practice, these are protective notices of motion designed to protect the interests of the Committee while Ministers consider the issues we have put to them in correspondence.

        A most famous Chairman of this Committee, Senator Ian Wood, described the Committee as the most important committee in the Parliament as it scrutinises Executive law-making and protects the primacy of Parliament. The late Lionel Murphy, when a senator, said that those acquainted with the Committee knew it to be `the most effective committee of its kind in all the parliaments of the world'. My predecessor as Chairman, Senator Cooney, told the Senate in June 1987 that the Committee was in the business of setting standards of `wisdom, justice, fairness and restraint' in delegated legislation and, in doing so, would not be intimidated, even by powerful institutions.

        Members of the Committee will be in the business of acting, in a bipartisan way, to improve the quality of delegated legislation in order to protect the rights of individuals. It is my firm hope that, under my chairmanship and with the Deputy Chairman, Senator Bronwyn Bishop, the Committee as a whole will maintain its high standards in the interests of the people and the Parliament. In conclusion, I congratulate Senator Bishop on being the first woman to be Deputy Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I look forward to working with her and all members of the Committee in the bipartisan spirit that has been its hallmark for the past 55 years.

         —by leave-I congratulate Senator Collins on his appointment as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and on his first report to the Senate. As outgoing Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I would also like to add my congratulations to Senator Bishop on her appointment as Deputy Chairman. Senator Bishop's appointment is significant because, following changes to Standing Orders, the Committee no longer elects a Deputy Chairman; he or she is appointed personally by the Chairman of the Committee. I commend Senator Collins for continuing the tradition of the Committee having an Opposition Deputy Chairman. His mates in the Australian Labor Party might not approve, but I can assure him that the parliamentarians in this chamber approve of the appointment.

       <para>
        Unlike many of our colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I listened with interest to what Senator Collins said about the importance of the Committee and its bipartisan role. While Senator Collins is new to the Senate, he was, of course, a leading member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Subordinate Legislation and Papers Committee and he is very familiar with the non-political role of these watchdog committees. Many senators best placed to know have described the Committee as the most important committee in the Parliament because it looks at a form of law-making that might otherwise escape some kind of due parliamentary process. I wish Senator Collins well in his role on this Committee. The Committee has been described as a `parliamentary hairshirt' and a `self-denying ordinance' because it requires politicians in this place to assume the large and heavy mantle of being parliamentarians of whom there are far too few in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I mention the outgoing Chairman, Senator Cooney. His fairness as a chairman and his independent approach to scrutiny, to protect rights, have set a high standard for the new Committee. To my knowledge, there was never an occasion, in dealing with the affairs of this Committee, when Senator Cooney did not act in accordance with the highest parliamentary standards of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. He deserves our sincere praise for that.

        —The motion I have moved involves the reordering of business on Fridays to permit us to have Question Time between the hours of 12 midday and 1 p.m., leaving an hour and three-quarters in the afternoon for the possible bringing forward of a matter of public importance or urgency motion. This matter was discussed with the Australian Democrats, who had the unhappy experience of seeing Senator Sanders cut out of an urgency debate on the last Friday of sitting. It has caused, as you can imagine, Mr President, enormous distress on the Opposition benches. We decided that that should not be allowed to happen again. For that reason we have sought this extension of the time available to bring forward a matter of public importance or an urgency motion.
       </para>

      <para>
       In deference to the Government's concern at losing an hour of Government time, we have agreed to Question Time being between 12 midday and 1 p.m., which gives back 15 minutes. I also indicate to the Senate that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has put to the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and, for all I know, to Independent senators the possibility of a further revision of sittings for Fridays and the possibility of the Senate not sitting on Fridays. I simply indicate, in moving this motion, that the Opposition has not yet had a chance to consider the suggestions of the Manager of Government Business. We will do so next week and there will be further discussions. The terms of the motion vary the routine of business for Fridays generally. I think honourable senators should be aware that it is possible that the Government or the Opposition may bring forward further variations, subject to the discussions to be held in the coming weeks.

We are not totally mollified by the compassion that the Opposition has shown, with the Australian Democrats, in reducing that hour's loss to 45 minutes. However, we acknowledge, with a healthy sense of realism that is increasingly overcoming me standing in this position, that to contest the point at any length would not be productive in terms of the likely outcome of the result. There will be further discussions which, at the moment, are only at a very tentative, very preliminary stage. I would be delighted to talk to Senator Harradine about that and anything else he would like in the near future. On that basis we simply think it is appropriate that this motion go through and we pick up the pieces later.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to extend the life of the National Crime Authority by repealing section 63 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 which provides for the termination of the Authority on 30 June 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is urgent need for this legislation-First, to ensure the continuity of the most important work of the Authority, secondly to enable reasonable periods of engagement to be offered to members of the Authority and other staff and thirdly to provide security to those already engaged by the Authority and who have of necessity to consider their positions beyond 30 June 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the first issue, the reality is that the Authority currently has a tremendous workload. Confronted with the current sunset date of 30 June 1989 the Authority will be faced with the need-shortly I suggest-to close down its investigative activities to enable it to finalise matters and report before that date. The prospect that the Authority's war against major crime and bosses will need to cease is unthinkable and is to be deplored.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the need to appoint new members of the Authority. Mr Bingham's term expires in 2 1/2 months and under the terms of the Act he cannot be re-appointed. The question must be raised as to who would take such a senior position when there is no undertaking of employment beyond 18 months. In the case of Mr Justice Stewart, the Chairman of the Authority, his term expires on 30 June 1988, leaving only 12 months before the date on which the life of the authority is due to expire.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are, in the view of the Opposition, other changes which are required to improve the NCA Act, but in the short term ensuring the on-going activity of the Authority and introducing some stability to its management is so essential that this single issue Bill has been introduced at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has a strong commitment to the Authority's attack on organised crime. If the Government is like-minded it would support this Bill which is designed to ensure an on-going attack against organised crime. However, the Government's attitude towards the Authority must be seriously suspect. The opposition introduced a Bill similar to the current one as far back as February of this year. That Bill lapsed with the calling of the election. Nevertheless the Government has had at least ten months' notice of the problem and has failed to take any action to remedy it.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1985 to implement decisions made at the May 1987 premiers' conference relating to the level of financial assistance grants and identified health grants to be distributed among the states in 1987-88.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also incorporated amendments relating to the decision announced in the Budget requiring states to contribute to the costs of higher education superannuation schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of the agreements reached at the premiers' conference, the Bill seeks to fix the actual dollar amount of financial assistance grants and identified health grants in 1987-88 at levels estimated to be sufficient to maintain their value in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        These provisions modify the arrangements agreed at the May 1985 Premier's Conference. At that time, the Commonwealth and states agreed that, during the triennium beginning 1985-86, the level of financial assistance grants and identified health grants to be distributed among the states would be determined having regard to actual increases in the all groups consumer price index (CPI) in the year ending in the March quarter of each year. The level of grants was to be maintained in real terms in 1985-86 and increased by two per cent in real terms in each of the following two years.
       </para>
       <para>
        These arrangements, which were reflected in the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1985, applied in both 1985-86 and 1986-87. It is necessary, however, to amend them in respect of 1987-88. This decision constitutes part of the Government's policy of reducing the calls made by all levels of government on the nation's savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The May statement on initial Budget measures for 1987-88 announced various decisions designed to give effect to the Commonwealth's endeavours in this regard. That statement also indicated our intention to seek agreement, at the premiers' conference on 25 May 1987, to savings of $1000 million on the forward estimates of general purpose payments to the states and the Northern Territory in 1987-88.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the Premiers' Conference, the Commonwealth and state governments agreed to the level of financial assistance grants and identified health grants to be distributed among the states in 1987-88 being maintained in real terms. Specifically, it was agreed that the total pool of such payments to the states would be fixed at $13,539 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amount was calculated on the basis of the estimates at the time of the Premiers' Conference of the level of the grants in 1986-87, increased by 8 per cent representing the forecast rise in the CPI in the year to March 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to hold these grants and analogous grants to the Northern Territory at the same real level accounted for $285 million of the $1000 million savings against the forward estimates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The outcome of the Premiers' Conference reflected a general acceptance by the states and the Commonwealth of the need for all levels of government to cut back their borrowing and spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also covers matters dealing with the decision announced in the budget that, commencing on 1 January 1988, the Commonwealth will limit its contributions to state higher education superannuation schemes operated on an `emerging cost' basis. Greater detail on this decision is to be provided by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training as part of a separate statement on higher education.
       </para>
       <para>
        All states except Queensland will be affected. The Bill places an obligation on those states to make a payment to the Commonwealth covering their share of higher education superannuation costs. It does so by making the payment of financial assistance under the Act conditional on such a payment being received by the Commonwealth by 31 May 1988. The precise amount for each state will be determined by the Minister by 31 March 1988.
       </para>

        The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1985 so as to authorise payments in 1987-88 arising out of decisions, taken at the 25 May, 1987 Loan Council Meeting, which fall outside the provisions of the Financial Agreement Act 1928.

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 1970-71 a portion of the state governments' Loan Council Programs have been provided by the Commonwealth as interest free capital grants. The grants were introduced to help states finance works, such as schools and other capital works, from which debt charges are not normally recovered. The effect of these grants, therefore, is to relieve the states of those debt charges (ie, interest payments and sinking fund contributions) which they would otherwise have to pay, and the grants accordingly have a substantial beneficial effect on the overall financial positions of the states. In addition, there are no conditions attaching to the manner in which the grants are applied by the states.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the ten years prior to 1985-86 the grants represented one-third of the state Governments' Loan Council Programs. In 1985-86 and again in 1986-87 the portion of the programs provided as a capital grant was temporarily increased by 7 per cent to approximately 35.7 per cent, with the loan portion being reduced by an equivalent amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        For 1987-88 the Loan Council agreed that the grant component of the state governments' Loan Council programs and equivalent general purpose capital assistance to the Northern Territory as a whole should be one third. However, due to changes in the distribution between the States and the Northern Territory agreed at the loan council meeting, the proportion of the program provided as a capital grant will vary slightly from state to state. The total amount to be provided to the States as a capital grant is $176 million out of a total program of $533 million.

        The arrangements whereby the states and the Northern Territory are able to nominate part of the borrowing component of their Loan Council programs for public housing were introduced in 1982-83. The arrangements have contributed considerably to the financing of public housing in the states and the encouragement of the states to increase their own housing expenditures.

        As a condition of the payment of these funds, a State or the Northern Territory must be able to meet its matching requirements for the purposes of the Housing Assistance Act 1984. Subject to that, the nominated funds will be provided to the States and the Northern Territory at the loan terms and conditions set out in the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement, and hence will bear interest at the concessional rate of 4 1/2 per cent per annum and will be repayable over 53 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the Loan Council meeting on 25 May, 1987 it was agreed that the States and the Northern Territory would be allowed to nominate the whole of the borrowing component of their programs for public housing in 1987-88. This Bill seeks to give effect to those decisions. Should the States and Northern Territory nominate the maximum amounts allowed under this Bill, $414 million will be provided to them as loans on concessional terms for public housing.

        The Bill provides that the States and the Northern Territory will be required to provide the Commonwealth with certified financial statements detailing the expenditure of loan funds nominated for public housing.

       <para>
        Mr President, this Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Cash Bidding) Amendment Act 1985 which will improve the administration of petroleum exploration and development activities in Australian offshore waters, correct some anomalies in the legislation and ensure that the option is available to the Joint Authority in the future to use cash bidding as a means of awarding exploration permits over highly prospective acreage.
       </para>
       <para>
        In late 1985, the Government announced the outcome of its review on the 1979 Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS). The outcome was that the Government considered that the arrangements entered into by the Commonwealth with the States and the Northern Territory to administer activities in Australia's offshore waters were working satisfactorily, and the Government therefore decided not to take action to regain title over the Territorial Sea and coastal waters. The review of the OCS did, however, identify certain administrative functions in the Commonwealth's offshore petroleum legislation which require change. These changes are to repeal the special arrangement with Western Australia whereby disagreements in the Joint Authority (the Commonwealth and relevant State Minister) are resolved on a Premier/Prime Minister basis, and to allow those matters which were previously dealt with by the Joint Authority at the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister, to become automatically matters for Joint Authority decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's decision to abolish the special arrangement for resolving disagreements within the Western Australia Joint Authority reflects the Government's view that the treatment of the States and Northern Territory under the offshore petroleum legislation should be uniform. This Government rejects the claim upon which this special Western Australian arrangement is based-that is, that the economic importance of petroleum and related activity to Western Australia places that State in a unique position. Rather, the Government considers that the importance of offshore petroleum operations to Western Australia is no greater than that of other States or the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our experience has been that, where a Joint Authority has been involved in decisions, the consultative provisions of the offshore petroleum legislation which are generally applicable have proved entirely satisfactory. Under these general provisions, which are to be retained in the legislation, Joint Authority decisions are made after consultation between senior Ministers of the respective Governments, and the consultative process provides ample scope for full consideration of all factors relevant to the interests of the Commonwealth and to the States/NT, and the resolution of any differences of view. If, after consultation, disagreement remains within the Joint Authority, then, consistent with the Commonwealth's responsibilities, the Commonwealth Minister may decide the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second issue arising from the Government's OCS review also relates to Joint Authority decision making. Under present arrangements some matters (for example, the award of exploration permits) must be referred by the Designated Authority (the State/NT Minister) to the Joint Authority, while other matters (for example, inviting applications for the award of exploration permits) may be referred to the Joint Authority at the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister. Because decisions of the Designated Authority in the latter category have the potential to be referred to the Joint Authority, it has become practice for these matters to be dealt with administratively as if they must be decided by the Joint Authority. This practice has evolved in order to avoid the significant administrative delays which would otherwise occur if the Commonwealth Minister was to decide that a matter should be referred to the Joint Authority. The amendments contained principally in clauses 5 and 13 and in the Schedule of the Bill will formally make the Joint Authority automatically responsible for these matters. A further consideration in the Government's decision to refer all these matters to the Joint Authority has been the apparent confusion, particularly for new companies wishing to undertake offshore petroleum operations, about which authority is responsible for the decisions on such matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of other amendments contained in the Bill are, like those relating to the OCS arrangements, being introduced to improve administration of offshore petroleum activities and to remove some anomalies in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the current legislation, a location can only be declared over a petroleum discovery in an exploration permit if the location contains a block in which an exploratory well has been drilled and from which petroleum has been recovered. This has led to the situation where a discovery which straddles a permit boundary, and for which only one exploratory well has been drilled, cannot be fully developed. This arises because a location can only be declared in the permit in which the exploratory well has been drilled and, hence, subsequent production licences or retention leases cannot be granted over the whole discovery. While the problem could be overcome by drilling a second exploratory well in the other permit, this practice may not be justified economically or technically.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further difficulty with the current legislation is that the size of a location is generally set at nine blocks. In many instances this size is much larger than necessary to cover the discovery, though, on occasions the nine block location has been too small to cover some very large gas discoveries.
       </para>
       <para>
        To overcome these difficulties clause 9 of the Bill amends the current legislation to allow the Joint Authority to declare a location over any block from which the Joint Authority is satisfied petroleum can be recovered. The Joint Authority will also be able to declare a location over as many blocks as is necessary to cover the discovery. The Bill also provides for the expansion or reduction of a location area if further information indicates a change in the extent of the petroleum discovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 6, 8 and 10 of the Bill will repeal what are known as `over-the-counter' awards of permits and production licences. If, following the advertising of invitations for the grant of an exploration permit or production licence over an area, the Joint Authority decides not to grant a title or grants a title over part of the area then, under existing legislation, there is provision for the Joint Authority to accept applications for the award of a title over the area or any remaining part of the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that the most efficient approach to the award of offshore titles is by competitive tendering. Given this principle and the regular release of offshore petroleum acreage, the Government sees no need for `over-the-counter' awards of titles.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments contained in clause 11 of the Bill follow representations from petroleum companies. Under the existing legislation, applications to register a dealing affecting the interests in a title under section 81 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act must be accompanied by an instrument evidencing the dealing and an instrument prescribed in regulations (if any). The instrument evidencing the dealing is available for public inspection and, as these instruments can contain sensitive contractual information, a number of companies have sought protection for this confidential information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government shares the industry's concerns and the amendments seek to provide adequate protection for confidential information while safeguarding the public interest. This is achieved by providing companies with an option of submitting the prescribed instrument mentioned above. Where the prescribed instrument is lodged with a registration application then this instrument, rather than the instrument evidencing the dealing, will be available for public inspection. In the case where companies elect not to lodge a prescribed instrument, the existing legislative approach applies - that is, the instrument evidencing the dealing will be available for public inspection. In this way, it will be open to the companies to decide what documents should remain confidential, but it is expected that companies will only take advantage of the new arrangements where it is clear that the release of any confidential information contained in the document would be detrimental to the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The regulation which sets out the particulars of the prescribed instrument will ensure that, in the public interest, all necessary details are included. These details of the dealing include the parties to it, the title affected by it, the nature of the transaction and the value of the consideration upon which registration fees are based. Industry has objected to the inclusion of the value of the consideration of the dealing in the prescribed instrument, arguing that this information is commercially sensitive. However, given that the registration fee is based on the value of the consideration of the dealing, the Government believes, in the interests of public accountability, that the consideration should remain a requirement of the prescribed instrument.
       </para>
       <para>
        Industry has also argued that these amendments should be applied retrospectively to instruments evidencing dealings which have already been approved. This would have the effect of removing documents from public inspection. Because these documents have already been available for public inspection, the Government's view is that they no longer have a confidential status. In addition, a retrospective application of the amendments could impose a significant administrative burden on some Designated Authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 14 of the Bill relates to the 1985 amendments to section 118 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act which provided for the early release of basic data and interpretive information supplied by titleholders to government, subject to appeals provisions relating to the release of interpretive information after 5 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was the Government's intention that these amendments to section 118 should apply to data and information supplied both before and after the amendments were proclaimed on 22 July 1985. The amending legislation was, however, defective in that the new section 118 provisions do not apply to data and information supplied before the date of proclamation. As the early release of information facilitates a better understanding of the petroleum potential of offshore areas and, consequently, encourages further exploration activity, the Government wishes to rectify the situation and clause 14 amends the Act appropriately. Release of commercial sensitive would of course be subject to the usual appeals provisions set out in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following a recent review of procedures relating to the verification of royalty collections by the Australian Auditor-General's Office, it has become necessary for the Commonwealth to clarify its rights to obtain documents related to offshore petroleum operations. Under the current legislation the Commonwealth Minister is able to acquire copies of documents received by the Designated Authority, but is unable to direct the Designated Authority as to what Documents and records the producers should be required to keep and make available. The proposed amendment at clause 15 will correct this deficiency and thus ensure that the Commonwealth is able to obtain all documentation necessary to ensure that its responsibility in relation to the collection of royalties on petroleum production are met.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to the proclamation of the 1985 amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act, fees payable upon the registration of a transfer under section 78 or a dealing under section 81 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act were calculated on the basis of 1.5 per cent of the consideration or value of the title affected by the transaction or, if the transaction was related to a previous dealing for which the 1.5 per cent fee had already been paid, a flat $300 fee. An unintended transitional consequence of the 1985 amendments to the Fees Act has been that a dealing registered under the Principal Act prior to the proclamation of the above amendments (22 July 1985) may not be recognised as a related prior dealing for the purposes of reducing the fee payable. The clause 18 amendment will rectify this situation and will ensure that, where appropriate, the flat $300 fee will be charged.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Cash Bidding) Amendment Act 1985, which came into force on 22 November 1985, is currently subject to a two year sunset clause. If the Act is to continue in force, Parliament needs to re-endorse its support for the cash bidding system. The Government has completed a review of the effectiveness of cash bidding and proposes in clause 19 of this Bill to remove the sunset clause.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cash bidding system provides an alternative to the work program system as a means of awarding petroleum exploration permits in highly prospective areas. The Government's aim by introducing cash bidding was to provide an efficient and equitable system of permit award-an objective which on past experience was not being met by the work program system in circumstances where competition was intense.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the 2 year trial period, the use of cash bidding has been confined to the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands Adjacent Areas, consistent with the Government's agreement with the State and Northern Territory Governments that the use of cash bidding in other offshore adjacent areas would await the review of the operation of the system in the Territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Adjacent Area. In this way, it would be possible for an assessment to be made of the concerns that had been expressed by sections of the exploration industry and certain State Governments and the Northern Territory about the impact of the cash bidding system.
       </para>
       <para>
        These particular concerns were that the cash bidding system:
       </para>
       <para>
        would decrease exploration activity because of reduced funds and increased risks and costs;
       </para>
       <para>
        would disadvantage small to medium size Australian companies; and
       </para>
       <para>
        was inconsistent with the resource rent tax (RRT)
       </para>
       <para>
        The review has assessed these concerns in the light of experience of the first and, to date, only cash bidding release of off-shore petroleum exploration acreage in the Timor Sea region of the Territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Adjacent Area. Applications for five highly prospective areas in this region were invited on 25 November 1985 and closed on 28 February 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        A total of six eligible bids, from consortia, involving 16 companies, for four of the five areas were received. Three consortia were successful. Offers of permit award were made by the Joint Authority to these three successful consortia on 3 March 1986, with all three consortia accepting the offers within the allowable 30 days. The permits, AC/P5, AC/P6 and AC/P7, were formally granted on 4 April 1986 for a single six-year term. The successful bids totalled over $31.5m with all successful bids being at least $10m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given that applications for the above areas were invited just prior to the collapse in world oil prices, the results of this cash bid round were particularly pleasing. The size and number of bids clearly showed that companies saw good prospects for satisfactory commercial returns from the areas offered despite considerable uncertainty surrounding the world crude oil market outlook.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the award process represented a considerable streamlining of administrative effort. Applications were able to be assessed and permits awarded in a little over one month. This compares with the 3 to 4 months needed to process applications and award permits under the work program system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The criticism concerning the impact on exploration activity suggested that cash bids would adversely affect exploration activity either in other areas held by the companies or in the cash bid permits themselves. While the impact of the former cannot be assessed, the evidence suggests that the level of exploration activity in the cash bid permits is not significantly different from that in work program permits awarded in late 1985 and in 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The three cash bid permits have been in force for nearly 18 months, and in that time seismic surveys have been completed in AC/P5 (385 line kms), AC/P6 (550 line kms) and AC/P7 (1387 line kms). This work is expected to lead to drilling activity in the second year of the permits, activity which no doubt has been deferred because of the collapse in oil prices-a fact which has affected exploration activity world-wide.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another claim made at the time the legislation was introduced into Parliament was that cash bidding would increase the risks and costs of exploration. At the time, the Government argued that in assessing whether to lodge a cash bid, companies would take into account the expected risks and costs involved in exploring in a permit, and the size of their bid would reflect that calculation. The cash bid, in itself, would not affect the risks or the costs involved, rather it is the risks and costs which would influence the size of the bid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Government argued that it could be expected that the cash bidding system would reduce the risks and costs facing companies compared with the work program system. Under the cash bidding system, companies are free to undertake the most commercially viable exploration program consistent with the prevailing economic conditions and prospectivity assessments. Under the work program system, however, companies are committed to an exploration program designed up to three years in advance and must face the considerable risk that changing circumstances will make that exploration program uneconomic.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's arguments have been vindicated. The evidence is that companies involved in over 39 per cent of active work program permits have sought deferments of commitments following the collapse in oil prices at the beginning of 1986. This has involved considerable administrative effort on the part of Governments and companies. The companies in the cash bid permits have, on the other hand, been free to assess their position in the light of the dramatically changed world oil market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cash bidding was also criticised because it was expected that large, foreign companies would dominate the bidding.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has always acknowledged that it would be difficult for smaller companies to participate in off-shore exploration because of the costs and risks involved. Regardless of the award system for exploration permits the stronger companies could be expected to dominate. The Government did note, however, that it expected no change to the existing practice in the industry-namely, that consortia including Australian companies would be formed to bid for permits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first cash bid release has confirmed that Government judgment. Of the three successful consortia, each has Australian interests of 40 per cent or more-the average Australian ownership over the three permits being 62.7 per cent. Of the 11 companies involved in the successful consortia, 6 are Australian including some small to medium sized firms. Over the total bidding round, there were 16 companies of which 9 were Australian.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence, therefore, suggests that Australian companies are not being discriminated against in their attempts to explore in highly prospective areas because of the introduction of the cash bidding system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The claim that cash bidding is inconsistent with RRT cannot be established objectively but, rather, is a philosophical question. The Government views the RRT and cash bidding system of awarding exploration rights as complementary measures-namely, together they collect for the community a share of the economic rent resulting from the exploration for, and the exploitation of, Australia's petroleum resources. This is a view shared by a number of other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The review has, therefore, concluded that:
       </para>
       <para>
        the cash bidding system has met the Government's objective of providing a more efficient and less regulatory system of award and administration of exploration permits than the work program system;
       </para>
       <para>
        there is no evidence available to suggest that exploration activity has declined because of the use of cash bidding;
       </para>
       <para>
        there is sufficient evidence to suggest that Australian companies are not disadvantaged by the cash bidding system; and
       </para>
       <para>
        there is no justification for the claim that cash bidding is inconsistent with RRT.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the conclusions of this review and the demonstrated willingness of the industry to participate in the cash bidding system, the industry remains opposed to the system. Further, some States and the Northern Territory are not yet convinced of its merits although all are concerned that they should receive a share of any cash bids. The Government, however, is convinced that cash bidding is superior to the work program system as a means of permit award in circumstances where competition is expected to be intense because of the high prospectivity of the areas on offer. The Government supports the continued use of the cash bidding system and will maintain its commitment to the States and the Northern Territory to consult with them before permits in their adjacent areas are proposed for release under the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of the amendments, except for the repeal of the cash bidding sunset clause, are not expected to have any financial impact nor will any of the amendments increase regulation in the petroleum exploration and development industry. In the case of the cash bidding amendment, the level of revenue that might be raised by the award of permits under the cash bidding system cannot be estimated as it will depend on the number of areas released during each financial year and the industry's appraisal of and response to the acreage released.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the proposed amendments contained in this Bill have been the subject of consultation with the States, the Northern Territory, and the industry, and with a few exceptions the amendments have general support. The amendments are essential to the effective and efficient administration of the Commonwealth's offshore petroleum legislation and I commend the Bill to the House.

It is always, of course, a matter for judgment in all the circumstances of the case whether, even if there is a technical breach, action should be proceeded with. The Government has made its position perfectly clear, that we do not believe the bans are defensible and also that we believe that they are not likely to be productive in bringing about any change of heart by the Fijian authorities. It was all too readily apparent that alternative sources of supply became readily available for the commodity concerned when these bans were imposed last time round. It is equally apparent that the airline bans that were previously in place had no effect whatsoever in changing the course upon which the Fijian military authorities seemed determined to be pursuing. That is so in the absence of widespread international support for such bans of a kind that there has been in comparison with the case of South Africa. Mr Hayden, the Foreign Minister, referred yesterday in the House of Representatives to an ongoing course of consultation that he is engaged in with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, both personally and also with the Minister for Industrial Relations playing a role. The Government will continue that process of consultation in the hope that within a reasonable period not too distant the bans can be lifted and some normality returned.

         —I did hear the Opposition Leader whining again on the ABC last night. I suppose he was whining in typical fashion in other media outlets as well. The Senate will remember, of course, the grossly irresponsible shadow Budget that was presented by Mr Howard in the run-up to the last Federal election. Leaving aside the $2 1/2 billion of completely blue sky in unspecified expenditure cuts, had Mr Howard been in a position to implement that Budget, revenue in this financial year would have fallen by around $2 billion because Mr Howard was pledged to abolishing the tax reform measures which this Government has legislated for over the last couple of years-abolishing fringe benefits tax, abolishing capital gains tax and abolishing substantiation. That would have cost the revenue about $2 billion.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There was also some $900m of supply side voodoo flowing to revenue, according to Mr Howard, from the effects of cutting marginal tax rates. That, of course, was the theory upon which the Reagan Administration based its early Budgets. What happened under the Reagan Administration was that, instead of the revenue base expanding to the extent that more than offset the decline in the tax rate, the United States Budget deficit blew out and peaked in the last financial year at some $220 billion. Put in Australian terms-that is, as a proportion of gross domestic product-that is just over a $10 billion Budget deficit, which, of course, happens to be the same prospective Budget deficit as Mr Howard left behind him when he was Treasurer. According to Mr Howard, another $900m would come from the enhanced enforcement of the Income Tax Assessment Act. How that was going to be done while he was simultaneously cutting staff in the Commonwealth bureaucracy is a matter for wide-eyed conjecture.
       </para>
       <para>
        Returning to the supply side voodoo of the $900m which was supposed to flow, I was astonished to hear that President Reagan said yesterday, I think it was, that he would increase taxation revenue, but that one could not do that by increasing taxation rates; that the way to increase revenue was to reduce the rates. If he really believes that, one wonders why he has not done so already. Obviously, President Reagan is displaying that he does not possess the capacity that the higher anthropoids are supposed to have-that is, for trial and error learning. I wonder whether the Opposition has the capacity for trial and error learning or whether it also, like Reagan apparently, is committed to the supply side voodoo which asserts that if one cuts taxation rates, revenue actually increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        Had Mr Howard's shadow Budget been implemented, the revenue would have fallen by nearly $4 billion and the Budget deficit, of course, would have blown out accordingly. If, as I think one is perfectly entitled to do, one adds to the $4 billion revenue loss the $2 1/2 billion of totally unspecified expenditure cuts, the Budget deficit would have blown out to some $6 billion had his strategy been implemented. Of course, a deficit of something over $6 billion was his policy. He, of course, was a Bjelke-Petersen sycophant in the run-up to the election. He went up to Brisbane to grovel at the feet of the menace from the north.

         —There is a sense in which there is some identity of approach between the military regime in Fiji and the long-established white regime in South Africa. Both do involve, of course, a measure of institutionalised racism. Regrettably, that is also true of a number of other countries around the world where constitutions are written in such a way as to preserve communal rights, often at the expense of majority rights. I can think of at least one other example in our own region. The difference between the two countries, however, is still an extremely significant one in quantitative terms. The institutionalisation of racism in South Africa has been an endemic part of that whole country's latter day, modern existence. Blacks in that country are denied absolutely the right to vote; they are denied the right to participate at all-not only on a minority basis, but at all-in the governing institutions of that country. Blacks in South Africa are denied the most fundamental respect for human dignity in the way in which the apartheid laws operate to deny access to public facilities, institutions and things of that kind.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Mercifully, the institutionalisation of racism has not gone down that particular path in Fiji. The racism that exists and that is now institutionalised in Fiji is confined essentially to the political process, and participation in that process, to the extent that would be appropriate were democratic principles to be fully applied. We deplore the course that has been taken in Fiji. We have made that abundantly apparent. We hope that it will be changed. But it is a caricature of the situation-an indefensible caricature-to place the Fijian situation on all fours with the monstrous institutionalised racism involved in apartheid. Accordingly, we reject the approach that is implicit in Senator Baume's question.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the difference in the approach to sanctions, I think I made it clear that not only does some difference of approach follow from the answer I have just given about the different characters of the two regimes but, more importantly, I guess, it is based on a judgment of what might be able to be achieved. We have made the judgment in regard to the situation in Fiji, as I have already indicated in answer to an earlier question, that whatever the moral force or utility of sanctions might be thought to be in such a situation-and that is arguable-their practical effect is likely to be nil because of the ready availability of alternative sources of supply. Under those circumstances it would seem to be a counterproductive gesture as well as a futile one.

I would not be surprised if it were the case because Senator Colston has acted as a catalyst and, indeed, his private member's Bills have been a model for legislative initiatives in this area. However, in regard to the questions he asked, I am advised that an error was not made in the amending Act but that an error appeared in the 1984 reprint. The error occurred, I am told, in the publications section of the Australian Government Publishing Service. I am advised that this does not affect the Act, so the Act remains fully operative as originally amended. The error will be corrected in the next reprint. The timing of that will depend on the printing program. I believe that the Electoral Act is not high on the list, but the correction will be undertaken as soon as possible.

         —It is indeed true that local government has a very important role to play in the delivery of community services, and this role was recognised by the Prime Minister in his policy speech in July, when he gave a commitment for this Government to consider devolution of responsibilities undertaken at the Federal level back to local government authorities. It was his recognition of local government's crucial role in the delivery of community services that prompted that particular announcement. Over the next few months I expect to be talking in much more detail about those devolution proposals. Last Friday, I addressed the Community Services Association of Victoria and heard from it about a number of very exciting proposals that have been undertaken in that State, involving community service provision at the local government level. In my State and former city council of Townsville we were deeply involved in the provision of community services.

        The Commonwealth recognises the importance of local government's role in the planning and provision of services at the local government level. The Commonwealth continues to encourage and assist local government effectively to play its part in an efficient public sector capable of meeting community needs. For example, funds to local government for children's services are expected to grow by 27 per cent this year to $88m. Funding to local government under the home and community care program will be increased by 40 per cent in 1987-88, which is very significant in real terms. The home and community care program is one in which local government is particularly involved. In Victoria, local government has pioneered a great deal of work in the provision of Meals on Wheels services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth will be developing a response to the Local Government Ministers conference task force report on community development, human services and local government. It recommended a more planned approach to the development of human services and the adoption of policies to guide the relationships between State and Federal agencies and local government. The Commonwealth has sponsored two conferences. Mr President, I am rather concerned, and I am sure that listeners will be, that the Opposition has so little interest in the development of community services at the local government level that Opposition members seem to prefer talk during the detailing of this very important information that I have for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth has sponsored two conferences which, for the first time, brought local government community services practitioners together on a national basis. These have been critical in assisting local government to develop its role in community services and its relationships with other levels of government. The local government development program will continue to be used to strengthen the capacity of local government to plan, co-ordinate and deliver community services consistent with the national objectives. Last year, community services projects were one of the priority areas for funding, with 29 projects receiving some $600,000. In 1987-88 community services projects will continue to receive top priority.

In the first instance, it involves a desire that all the people of New Caledonia participate in an effective exercise in self-determination conducted in accordance with United Nations principles, not on the basis on which the present referendum was conducted, which referendum as a result was, understand- ably enough, boycotted by a very significant proportion of the New Caledonian people because no serious alternatives were put to the people involving, for example, the intermediate status of independence in association with France, an option which might well have satisfied a number of people's aspirations. There was no extended process of education about the various options and alternatives leading up to that referendum and the whole affair took place in the context of a most unhappy atmosphere as a result of the actions of the authorities concerned.

Statistics such as those do not please the Opposition because, apart from contradicting its own forecasts, the Opposition realises that they also further erode whatever limited chance it might have of getting into government one day. It is because of that that when something initiated overseas inevitably spills on to Australia, such as the recent decline in the stock market, it is greeted by the Opposition with ill-concealed delight and the probably forlorn hope that it will do some damage to the real economy as distinct from the casino activity which has been featured in stock markets over the last eight or nine months in particular.

         —We are well aware of the greater than forecast growth in air traffic movements in north Queensland, especially affecting Cairns Airport. A central and regional office task force was established some seven months ago and identified many areas to assist air traffic control at Cairns in carrying out its functions. The task force made approximately 30 recommendations which are presently being actioned. The Government announced in June this year that radar will be installed in Cairns as part of a program to enhance radar coverage along the Queensland coast. Tenders for this major program will be let during 1988 and installation at Cairns is anticipated to be completed by the end of 1990. Due to the procurement lead times for equipment of this complexity, it is impossible to have the facility operational any earlier than that.

        Close examination is being given to ensure that the current staff and procedures are adequate to meet the increasing air traffic demands at Cairns. New staffing proposals are currently under consideration within the Department. A number of further talks are proceeding on these issues. I simply make the point that there is no justification for the precipitate action and some of the more extravagant claims that have been made by some of the industrial interests concerned. The situation is completely manageable. Action has been taken to deal with it and full radar coverage is on its way.

These measures include a major review of the defence logistics organisation and the contracts organisation. In the contracts area, the Government is looking to make savings of the order of $8m in the first year of operation. Action has been taken to change the existing contracting arrangements in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, as Senator Sheil's question indicates. Discussions are taking place with relevant unions, State governments and industry associations about the new arrangements. It is intended to maintain small contract administration offices in those areas. I am assured by the Minister for Defence that the new arrangements will lead to greater efficiency in the contracting area.

        It is not necessarily a fact that, because the number of contract offices is reduced, the number of contracts in those States will in any way be reduced. But I might just add that it is impossible, if a government is trying to slash $2 billion-odd off government expenditure, that there not be reductions in some areas. It is not much good for the Opposition to say that we are reducing expenditure in this or that area when its basic philosophical position is to double the amount of expenditure cuts, always unspecified, when it comes to Budget time. We have to make some savings in the defence area so that we can concentrate defence expenditure on those areas of priority that I am sure we have a bipartisan approach to.

I have read the judgment delivered by the judge on 6 August 1987, as I undertook yesterday in the Senate to do. I took the opportunity last night to do so. Having read the judgment, one can see the sort of reasoning and the evidence before the judge which led to the sorts of conditions she attached to the foreshadowed award of custody to the mother. To that extent, whilst I am still of the view that the conditions deserve the description `extraordinary', there is a basis in the judgment for the conditions that were attached.

I further understand that Justice Evatt, the Chief Judge of the Family Court-this has been reported to me; I have not heard the radio broadcast-fortuitously was being interviewed on the radio this morning on other matters. She indicated that the fact that an appeal process was to be got under way very shortly should lead to there being no further discussion on the topic. Certainly, it is not my intention to exacerbate the situation. As I said, I have read the judgment and I understand better the context which led to the conditions being attached to the decision on custody. May I also say that I have not had an opportunity to read any transcript or judgment that might have been put down in the return of the matter before the judge. I recall that that was after a two-month adjournment. Apparently the matter was back in court in early October. I have not had an opportunity to read any of those proceedings.

         —I do not have any specific information on the promotional activities of the Wine and Brandy Corporation, although I assume that that Corporation is promoting Australian wine sales on a continuing basis overseas. However, I am very well aware of the export performance of the wine industry over the last 12 months. That has been one of the spectacular successes, in proportional terms, of Australian exports. I have with me the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) bulletin dated 11 September 1987. I am not sure whether there is a more recent bulletin but this one reports on the sales of Australian wine and brandy for the month of July 1987. It states that the total volume of exports of Australian wine for the year ended June 1987 was over 21 million litres, more than a 95 per cent increase in the volume of Australian wine exports for the year ended June. Admittedly, that was from a reasonably low base, but to see exports almost double in 12 months is a matter of great satisfaction to the Government and, I would have thought, to everybody associated with the wine industry. While I am on the subject of that ABS bulletin of 11 September, let me say that it also draws attention to some major quirks in the recorded statistics in recent times. It states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . previously recorded total wine sales-
       </para>
       <para>
        this is, total sales, not just exports-
       </para>
       <para>
        for the year ended June 1987 have now been revised upwards to 330.0 million litres which now represents a 1.5 per cent increase over the year ended June 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        More significantly, the bulletin reports that the total wine sales for July 1987 were 33.2 million litres, an increase of more than 38 per cent from the June figure and an increase of more than 8 per cent on the figure for July 1986. It is rather extraordinary that the recorded sales for July this year were 38 per cent higher than they were for June and less remarkable, I suppose, they were 8.2 per cent higher than they were for July 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        This statistic has an acknowledged history of being somewhat unreliable and is based on the reported sales from major wineries which raises the question whether the major wineries have been as diligent in reporting their sales as they ought to have been. If one has a more suspicious mind, it raises the question whether there was deliberate under-reporting for the month of June. If it happened they probably acted in collusion with the Opposition in trying to mount a political campaign regarding the sales tax on the industry. Returning to the question of profit, it is a matter of great satisfaction to Government, and it ought to be a matter of great satisfaction to the wine industry, that the export performance of the last 12 months has been so spectacularly successful.

        Last night I had a meeting with the Concerned Ladies Action Group (CLAG) from Ravenshoe; in fact, one of its members was a lady whose daughter had played the Last Post for me a couple of weeks ago. So impressed was I with CLAG that we resumed our discussions at breakfast this morning. That group has put in a submission encased in 1945 prime rainforest timber. Within that submission I think 100 individuals from Ravenshoe have written in with varying sorts of submissions. As far as the implications for the future are concerned, I hope that we will be in a position to finalise the boundary by the end of November. To that end a number of people are currently assessing those submissions. We have tried, as far as it is possible, to assess the submissions as they have been coming in. But given the huge rush in the last week, it will take some time. I am hopeful that by the end of November we will be in a position to announce a final boundary.

         —It is a little ironic that in Question Time Senator Walsh raised the failure of the Opposition to ask questions of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Willis), given the record of questioning in this place and the failure of the Minister for Industrial Relations to respond. I think it was in May of this year that Mr Willis suggested that the bans provisions in the industrial relations legislation are moribund. That word seems to have become part of the industrial relations dictionary. There is an appearance of the Minister being rather moribund himself with respect to responding to issues which are raised with him.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I ask the Government to look at the record of this Minister and to seek some better performance. It would appear that Senator Button's office has unsuccessfully tried to pursue answers. I wish to direct the attention of the Senate to the nature of the questions the Minister has failed to answer. On 23 September, about a month ago, I raised with the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations the demand by the Building Workers Industrial Union for the flow on to the Parliament House construction site of the $20 a week severance pay agreement reached with employers. Just prior to my asking that question Mr Justice Ludeke condemned the severance pay deals which had been done and said that they could not be justified under the wage fixing principles and that any further attempt to extend the payment was unacceptable. I asked on that date what steps the Government would take to ensure that the $20 severance payment would not be paid on the new Parliament House site unless it was a determination of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not surprisingly, the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations in this place was not able to answer that question. Senator Button said that he would refer the question to the Minister and obtain an answer. Since that time I have made regular requests to Senator Button's office for an answer. As that has produced nothing, I have made regular requests of Mr Willis's office and again there has been no response. Yet this is a matter in which the Minister has been directly involved in correspondence and in other activities and it must be a comparatively simple matter for the Government's attitude to be disclosed to this place and for the Minister to advise us whether the Government will take any action on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second issue that I raised was the industrial dispute on the North West Shelf. That question was raised on 8 October at the time when a lengthy industrial dispute had been settled apparently by an agreement being entered into involving agreement to pay additional wages apparently well outside the national wage principles of the Government and of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. In this matter again there was direct Commonwealth Government involvement with the State Commissioner being given authority to act as a Federal commissioner also. Senator Button undertook on 8 October to get an update on what had happened. At that stage he had a note from the Minister dated 6 October. Again, it has been impossible to get an answer from the Minister's office.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two possibilities in this matter. The first is that the Minister's office and his Department are simply incapable of getting an answer to a question where there is a clear Commonwealth involvement and a clear ability to provide an answer. It may be that there is just massive inefficiency within the Minister's Department which precludes these relatively straightforward requests from being answered. The other possibility, of course, is that in both cases the Government is simply embarrassed by the fact that the agreements entered into appear to be outside the wages guidelines which have the support of the Government and which are, of course, a matter of great contention at the moment, given that the national wage case has been postponed and there are very significant issues to be determined about what wages policies should be followed given the difficult and uncertain economic conditions we face.
       </para>
       <para>
        I raise the matter at this stage because the failure of the Minister to respond is making it more difficult for the Opposition, and indeed for the community, to make appropriate judgments on these issues. I do not regard it as vaguely acceptable that we should have to wait for more than four weeks for an answer to a straightforward question on a matter which is within the Government's knowledge and apparent competence and I express my concern. I think it is clear that that concern is not shared by Government Ministers. Senator Walsh, to whom I gave notice of this matter, has left the chamber and is obviously treating it as one which he can ignore. The other Ministers who are here are obviously not interested in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply wish to make public my dissatisfaction and the dissatisfaction of the Opposition at this attitude to Question Time. It is totally inappropriate that Ministers should adopt this cavalier attitude. I seek a response from the Government as to what attitude it has to the reasonably speedy answering of questions in this place. Since Senator Richardson is unable to answer questions even on his own portfolio I doubt that he will be able to give me much assistance on this matter. Given the contempt with which this matter has been treated, Mr President, I draw your attention to the state of the House.

         —I raise a matter which is of importance in my electorate, in particular the Belconnen area. It arises from a number of incidents of vandalism in the area of the Kippax shopping centre recently. It is not just in the shopping centre area; it is more widespread than that. The question really is: What police protection is there for the community in the area? It is certainly the impression of most people in that area that there are fewer police around than there have been in the past.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think it might be useful if the relevant Minister obtained the following information: how many police have been on duty in each shift in the area of the Belconnen police station, say, in the last three weeks; and how many cars have been used in each shift? When I say `on duty', I am not talking about the officers in the police station; I am talking about the number of police out in the area on patrol who are able to attend calls that are made by members of the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that a considerable amount of damage is being done and it is necessary that there be a greater degree of police protection to see that this is stopped. In the end the community pays for any damage that is done. As the Minister for the Environment and the Arts (Senator Richardson) would know, insurance claims add to the cost of this expensive item. Also, distress is caused to the people. But the question that needs to be answered is the extent to which police from the Belconnen police station are available to attend calls in the community in respect of incidents. The police need to be able to attend quickly enough to do something about those incidents and to apprehend the people who are causing the problems. As I said, many people in the Belconnen area have gained the impression that far fewer police are now on duty and out and about on patrol. I ask the Minister to bring the facts to the Senate so that we can assess whether the area is being adequately policed and looked after, whether there are fewer police in the area than there have been in the past and whether the present situation is reasonable.

         —I rise to speak on a matter which is of some personal concern to me. The Sydney International Piano Competition of Australia is an important competition which is conducted every four years throughout Australia. This competition gives young pianists the opportunity to compete with each other in Australia for the benefit of young Australian audiences in particular, as well as a more general audience. The competition, which began in 1978, has already achieved a huge status internationally. It is now regarded among the top five competitions of the world, including the Tchaikovsky competition, the Leeds and other well-known competitions. I am greatly concerned about the ideological stance which the Music Board of the Australia Council seems to take in this endeavour.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is important to note that the Sydney International Piano Competition of Australia will take place in the bicentennial year of 1988, one year earlier than would be normal so that it can fit in with the importance of this occasion. As I said, the Music Board has an ideological stance that somehow competitions are bad for artists. Generally, the Government seems to be quite pleased to see grants made available for sporting competitions and other fields of endeavour. It seems to me that its extraordinary attitude is disadvantaging young musicians in this country who are anxious to participate. It is important to note that we conduct overseas auditions to ensure that the best Australian artists compete. Places are always made available for Australian competitors to compete with the world's best.
       </para>
       <para>
        I raise this matter because I feel that the Music Board's attitude is really quite unacceptable. I do not know whether it is possible for competitors, because of their virtuosity in terms of fingering exercises on the piano keyboard, to get a grant under a sporting allocation. But it seems to me to be a wrong allocation of resources if competitions per se are not eligible simply because artists are made to compete against each other. As I said, this attitude has been evident over the life of the competition. We would be hopeful that, with the Bicentennial coming up, perhaps the Music Board might relent on this occasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a previous competition we obtained a grant which was used to commission three Australian works. Those works formed a compulsory part of the repertoire which the competitors played. This not only gave composers an opportunity to write fresh works but also, more importantly, gave the opportunity for those works to be performed before audiences who have a genuine interest and care for the piano.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, I raise this matter this morning because I think it is important. We have reached a standard of excellence in Australia through the efforts of private enterprise and private individuals who are involved with the competition. Indeed, we have enjoyed good State support in New South Wales. I think it is a matter of national importance that the national form of government should give recognition through the Music Board of the Australia Council. The organisers of the competition should not be forced, as they have been on other occasions, to find other means of funding. I think this is a legitimate cause to have raised during this adjournment debate.

In fact, I have received a number of representations on that question from some, as they say, prominent Australians. Allowing for the fact that the Australia Council makes its own decisions and that we have arm's-length funding, I am, nonetheless, writing to the Australia Council to see what can be done to clarify the position on competitions.
