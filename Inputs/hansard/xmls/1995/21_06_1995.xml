       The petition of certain residents of Australia respectfully showeth that the tax on selected building products, proposed in the May, 1995 Budget, will place an unwelcome burden on all Australians planning to build a new home, or carry out alterations and additions, or repairs/maintenance to existing homes. Moreover, it is considered that the tax is iniquitous in that, when introduced, it will apply retrospectively to people currently building homes, who had entered in good faith into "fixed price" building contracts.

I was incorrect in that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to the French government. Senator Evans made oral representations. The mistake that I made was solely my own and not that of Senator Evans's office. I regret it. The actual brief read that the Prime Minister wrote to Mr Chirac and that Senator Evans had made representations. I took that to be written representations; in fact, they were oral representations. I apologise to the Senate if I have in any way misled it.

        I refer to the following series of Civil Aviation Orders Part 105: AD/BEECH 33/32 Amdt 2; AD/BEECH 35/59 Amdt 2; AD/BEECH 36/31 Amdt 2; AD/BEECH 55/69 Amdt 2; AD/BEECH 56/27 Amdt 2; AD/BEECH 60/40 Amdt 2; AD/BEECH 65/62 Amdt 2; and AD/BEECH 90/78 Amdt 2. Each of these amends the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives in relation to a problem with rudder pedal arms.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, Civil Aviation Orders Part 105 AD/DHC-8/34 Amdt 1 amends the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives in relation to black thermal insulation on the fuselage and flight compartment of a specified kind of aircraft.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Directives in the first group contain a common compliance provision. This states that initial inspection should take place before the issue of the next maintenance release after 31 October 1987, with re-inspection to take place at intervals of no more than 12 months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The equivalent provision in Directive AD/DHC-8/34 Amdt 1 requires compliance prior to 3 September 1994, or as indicated in Part 1.D of the service bulletins listed in the Requirement Table (which seem to refer to July 1994).
       </para>

        In the case of the dates mentioned in all of the above Directives, it seems possible that someone may have inadvertently been in breach of the legislation. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to why such apparent retrospective prejudice cannot in fact occur.

        I refer to a number of recent amendments to certain Civil Aviation Orders which were considered by the Committee at its meeting on 23 March 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Civil Aviation Orders Part 105 AD/DAUPHIN/35 Amdt 2 deals with the Tail Rotor Kevlar Tie Bar of the DAUPHIN EUROCOPTER. While the amendment is effective from 30 March 1995, the compliance clause provides that, if not already accomplished, the Order must be complied with within 250 hours time in service after 15 September 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In similar terms, Civil Aviation Orders Part 105 AD/GBK117/6 Amdt 2 deals with the Main Rotor Blade of the EUROCOPTER BK117 helicopter. This amendment was made on 8 February 1995, but the compliance clause provides that, if not already accomplished, the amendment must be complied with within 5 hours time in service after 18 January 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Civil Aviation Orders Part 105 AD/JBK117/6 Amdt 1 deals with the Main Rotor Blade of the KAWASAKI BK117 helicopter. This amendment was made on 13 February 1995, but the compliance clause provides that, if not already accomplished, the amendment must be complied with within 5 hours time in service after 31 August 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In all three cases, there seems to be the potential for people to have retrospectively breached the Directive. For example, if a KAWASAKI helicopter had not already complied with the Order, and had undertaken 5 hours time in service between 31 August 1994 and 13 February 1995, it would seem that the operators would be retrospectively in breach of the Directive.

        Thank you for your recent correspondence to my Minister concerning possible retrospectivity associated with a number of Civil Aviation Orders (CAOS) prepared by the Civil Aviation Authority for the purpose of amending the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives.

        I trust that you will understand the delay in replying. The Minister has received a large volume of correspondence in recent months on a range of transport matters and it is taking us more than the usual time to work through replies to everyone.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        You have asked whether these amendments may have retrospective effect so as to be in breach of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 in relation to the retrospective operation of subordinate legislation. Since the reasons for perceived retrospectivity are similar in each case, I am responding to the three letters at the one time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have been advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that in none of the above cases was it intended that the amendments were to have retrospective effect. The apparent problem that you have drawn to my Minister's attention appears to be a direct result of the style used by the Authority to notify amendments of Airworthiness Directives. Although legislation in Australia is normally amended by textual amendment, a different system has be followed in relation to the amendment of Airworthiness Directives. Any change to a Directive is incorporated into the existing text of the Directive and the complete Directive is then promulgated. Therefore, when a Directive includes a date of effect (which may go back to the date on which the Directive was originally made) and the Directive is later amended, the later Directive may appear to have some form of retrospective operation when in fact no retrospectivity was involved nor intended.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have been further advised that the amendment of Airworthiness Directives in this form has been used for many years and the aviation industry is well aware of the system used. An operator or other person who has airworthiness responsibilities for an aircraft has the full text of a Directive to hand at all times. Thus it would appear that the present system has distinct benefits for the aviation industry. If amendments were distributed to the industry in the form of a textual amendment, the text presently in use would have to be amended by a hand-written notation or otherwise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In light of your comments, however, and to overcome the problem of perceived retrospectivity, the Authority has examined its procedures. It now proposes that in future all amendments of Airworthiness Directives be made as simple textual amendments with the date of effect clearly shown. Each amendment will be tabled in the Parliament however, it is proposed that industry be advised of amendments with the distribution of the full text of each Directive with the amendment included. The Authority also proposes to attach a copy of this full text to the Explanatory Statement relating to each amendment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since amendments prepared and made in this format will only state the precise changes being made to an Airworthiness Directive, it should overcome the Committee's concerns about the possibility of amendments being seen to have retrospective effect.

        I understand that officers of the Authority plan to discuss the above proposals with the Committee's staff in the near future.

        This appears to be at least the third Airworthiness Directive recevied by the Committee bearing this description and the accompanying title PROPELLORS—OVERHAUL. Previous Directives were dated 31 August 1994, 17 January 1995 and 8 February 1995. Yet another amendment, dated 14 November 1994, was titled AD/PROP/1—PROPELLORS—GENERAL.

        There is obviously a risk of confusion here that might possibly have serious consequences where the nature of these Directives is misinterpreted. Specifically, it is not clear whether the Directives are intended as substitutes for, or as supplements to, each other. In the case of other Directives, the practice seems to be to add "Amdt 1" to the title of the Directive where appropriate.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thank you for your letter dated 28 March 1995 to my Minister, concerning the identifying notation given to amendments to the CAOs. Advice on this matter has now been received from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
       </para>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The CAA has advised me that the amendments are raised frequently to AD/PROP/1 in order to accommodate new safety information. To facilitate economical amendment of this Airworthiness Directive (AD), the CAA does not re-issue the entire AD on each occasion that a change is required. Instead, the particular section of the AD (ie. manufacturer group) that requires amendment is re-issued as a partial amendment to AD/PROP/l. Its individual Amendment List number is printed opposite the manufacturer group sub-heading. As the entire AD is not replaced under these arrangements, the CAA does not consider it to be appropriate to add an amendment number to the AD.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The approach adopted by the CAA makes it clear when a change to the overhaul period for an affected propellor was made (eg 1/95, 8/71 etc).

        However, the CAA acknowledges that the format utilised printing the AD title "PROPELLORS—GENERAL" and headings for sections within the AD, such as the "PROPELLORS OVERHAUL" section, has not been consistent on all past amendments. To clarify the situation, the CAA will ensure that future amendments issued to CAO Part 107 will have both the AD title and AD section headings printed at the top of each page.

        I refer to your letter of 27 March 1995 requesting my advice in relation to matters contained in amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (the Regulations) effected by Statutory Rule No. 15 of 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Regulations contained in this Statutory Rule primarily deal with import controls with respect to firearms and parts for firearms. Under regulation 3 and item 24 of Schedule 1 of the Regulations, the importation into Australia of firearms other than exempt firearms is prohibited absolutely. Under regulation 3 and item 25 of Schedule 1, the importation of parts specifically for firearms other than exempt firearms is also prohibited absolutely.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        "Exempt firearm" is defined in subregulation 2(l) of the Regulations and includes firearms imported for official purposes and handguns in respect of which the importer holds a state or territory licence or authorisation to possess the handgun. The importation of exempt firearms is governed by subregulation 4(2) and Part 1 of Schedule 3 of the Regulations. In short, the importation of such firearms is prohibited unless the conditions, restrictions or requirements specified in that Schedule are complied with. At present, the only condition that applies to exempt firearms is that such firearms must satisfy the safety requirements specified in Part 2 of Schedule 3. Certain classes of exempt firearms have also been excluded from this condition.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Apart from the new import controls in respect of parts for certain exempt firearms inserted by Statutory Rule No. 15 1995, there are no other import controls on parts for exempt firearms. These new import controls in new regulation 4DB of the Regulations make the importation of parts for firearms imported for use in films or in the development of mountings for a laser target designator subject to the requirement that the Minister for Justice must give permission for their importation. The importation of such parts is subject to the further conditions that the parts must only be used for such firearms and that the parts, if not used, must be exported within 6 months of their importation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Regulations by Statutory Rule No. 15 introduced a new category of "exempt firearm" into subregulation 2(1), being firearms in respect of which the importer produces to the Collector a written permission under subregulation 4DA(l). New regulation 4DA allows the Minister for Justice to give permission for the importation of a firearm for use in the development of mountings for a laser target designator. As stated in the Explanatory Memorandum a laser target designator is a simulated firearm training system which is mounted onto a firearm. This category of exempt firearm was inserted into the Regulations to enable the importation of such firearms. These firearms are unavailable in Australia and, in order for effective and practical mountings to be developed, it was necessary to exempt them from the general import prohibition applying to firearms.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The method by which this new category of exempt firearm is effected is identical to an existing category of exempt firearms, being firearms for use in films in respect of which the importer produces a permission under subregulation 4D(1) for its importation. Under regulation 4D, the Minister for Justice may give permission for the importation of firearms if satisfied that the firearm is to be used in connection with the production of a film.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before the Minister for Justice may grant a permission under either subregulation 4D(1) or 4DA(1), he or she must be satisfied of three matters:

        If the Minister for Justice is not satisfied of all of these matters, he or she cannot grant the permission under either subregulation 4D(l) or 4DA(l).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If a permission is granted, under both regulation 4D and 4DA, the importation of a firearm in accordance with the permission is subject to the condition that firearm be re-exported within 6 months of its importation. Longer periods for re-exportation can be specified in the permission. A permission can also specify other conditions or requirements that must be complied with, such as requirements as to the secure storage of the firearm and accounting and reporting requirements.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A decision by the Minister for Justice to refuse to grant a permission to import a firearm under either subregulation 4D(1) or 4DA(1) is not subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The matters of which the Minister must be satisfied before he or she can grant a permission are based on high government policy considerations of public safety. First, the Minister must be satisfied of the limited use to which the firearms will be put. The fact that permission can only be granted in respect of limited use will ensure that the firearms the subject of the permission will not enter the general circulation of the national stock of firearms. The fact that the Minister must be satisfied of the limited use to which the firearms will be put is necessary because such firearms would otherwise be, without his or her permission, prohibited imports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, the Minister must be satisfied that the importer holds a licence or authorisation to possess the firearm in the relevant State or Territory in which the firearm is to be used. Again, in the interests of public safety, the Minister for Justice cannot grant a permission to import a firearm that an importer is not licensed or authorised to possess.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore, if the Minister is not satisfied of these matters, permission to import would not be granted and this refusal would be based on the high government policy ground of public safety. It is not considered desirable to have merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of refusals of permission when based on high government policy grounds such as this one, or national security and defence reasons of international treaty obligations. This has been acknowledged previously by the Committee and indeed is reflected in the position taken in respect of the controls on the importation of goods under regulation 4 (the importation of goods in Schedule 2), regulation 4AB (the importation of polychlorinated biphenyls), regulation 4C (the importation of coffee), regulations 4QA, 4QB and 4QC (the importation of goods from specified countries presently under United Nations sanctions) and regulation 4R (the importation of radioactive substances).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under these regulations, the refusal to grant permission to import is not subject to independent review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunals. As with regulations 4D and 4DA, however, the decision maker who might refuse an import permission is restricted to a Minister on the ground that the necessary corollary to the high government policy exception to the reviewability of decisions is that the decision is ultimately made by the Government's relevant policy Minister. This has equally been acknowledged in the past by the Committee as an appropriate control on the high government policy exception to the reviewability of decisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Regulations, the only decisions to refuse an import permission that are subject to independent review are decisions under the Health portfolio under regulations 5 (drugs), 5A (antibiotics) and 5H (goods in Schedule 8). While the refusal by the Attorney-General not to grant permission for the importation of objectionable goods under regulation 4A may be subject to independent review, this right may be restricted where the Attorney certifies that it would be in the public interest that he or she bears the responsibility for the refusal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Regulations contained in new regulation 4DB complement regulations 4D and 4DA and introduce the requirement for a permission to import parts for firearms imported in accordance with a permission granted under these regulations. This import control was introduced to address concerns relating to what would otherwise be the unrestricted importation of parts for such firearms. As referred to above, there are no import controls on parts for exempt firearms. There were concerns that an importer could import parts for firearms imported under regulation 4D or 4DA and then assemble in Australia what would otherwise be a prohibited firearm.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore, the refusal to grant permission to import parts for such firearms would be based on the same high government policy grounds of public safety as the refusal to grant a permission under regulation 4D or 4DA. The absolute prohibition on the importation of firearms for public safety reasons is only to be relaxed in certain limited circumstances where the Executive is satisfied the proposed use of the firearms comes within its interpretation of the nominated exceptions. It is considered that merits review by the non-elected Administrative Appeals Tribunal of refusals of permission when based on such high government policy grounds is inconsistent with the doctrine of Government responsibility in the Westminster system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I do concede, however, as the Commonwealth has noted, that other regulations under the Regulations do provide for independent merits review. This might indeed make an attempted distinction between the non-reviewability of decisions on the importation of firearms and parts for certain firearms (regulations 4D, 4DA and 4DB) and the reviewability of decisions refusing to grant permissions or licences to import drugs or antibiotics (regulations 5, 5A and 5HA) difficult. I note this will be considered in the Government's response to the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on the Customs and Excise legislation which is currently being settled, so that a consistent position on the reviewability of these types of decisions is forthcoming.

        This is, after all, the substantive issue. The issue is not whether our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) went to France; it is not whether he went with other Pacific island nations; it is not what was discussed; it is not how hard he hit the French minister over the back of the wrist with a wet noodle. The substantive issue is whether Australia is aiding and abetting the testing of nuclear weapons by France by supplying France with nuclear material.

         There is no place at all in a modern world for nuclear weapons. We have seen exactly what nuclear weapons can do. We know that nuclear weapons can never be used in time of war. The development of nuclear weapons and the testing of nuclear weapons depend ultimately on the supply of uranium which comes from mines in the ground, and much of that uranium comes from Australia. This is the link between the Australian exports and the French tests, and this is why this is precisely the action that Australia should be taking. We should be stopping those exports to France here and now. There is no need for us to export uranium to France.

There is not the enormous profits in the export of uranium to France, or to any other countries, that was anticipated in the 1970s. We have had to abolish the floor price.

         We heard last night that the United States, with the concurrence of our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, is suggesting that even after a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty they would like to continue with what they call `benchtop tests'. They are talking about several kilograms of nuclear material. Quite frankly, I do not think the bench would survive that. That is not what I would consider a benchtop test. France is saying that they will stop testing, but what they mean is that they want to continue testing up to several hundred kilograms of nuclear materials.

The urgency of this motion is highlighted by the ability of countries continuing to upgrade nuclear weaponry while being part of a so-called comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.

         Australia is blind to the consequences. We have continued to sell uranium to countries which either reprocess nuclear material or, in this case, produce nuclear weapons and, in France's case, test or are likely to test within our region. The urgency is that we should no longer be doing that. The urgency is that we should be debating this and not pretending that trade in this material is not somehow adding to the situation. We are either ethical or not ethical in our world trade in nuclear material. If we clearly know that we cannot control the use to which our nuclear material is put in the countries to which we sell it, it is no longer ethical that we export this material. That possibility does not make it more ethical that countries like Namibia would quickly fill the gap. That does not make it ethical.

         Australia permits the mining and export of uranium only under the most stringent safeguard conditions. The government has taken a view that Australia can contribute to international non-proliferation objectives by ensuring that a significant portion of the world's uranium trade is covered by stringent Australian conditions. Australia's commitment and involvement in international non-proliferation efforts are second to none. In the nuclear field, Australia has been able to project influence in non-proliferation forums because it has been prepared to establish itself as a reliable supplier of uranium, albeit one which attaches the strictest non-proliferation conditions.

         Australia decided to permit the mining and export of uranium only after an exhaustive series of public inquiries and national political debate. This was an issue that even Senator Coulter acknowledged in the Senate earlier this week. It is through such influence that Australia has been able to encourage wider acceptance of strict non-proliferation conditions. For example, at the recent Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference we were able, with a group of like-minded countries, to have a requirement accepted which puts in place full scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards as an essential condition for new nuclear supply. This was the culmination of a campaign which Australia has successfully prosecuted internationally over a number of years.

         In the case of France, Australia's uranium exports are governed by the provisions of the bilateral agreement concerning nuclear transfers between Australia and France. This agreement, like Australia's other nuclear safeguard agreements, contains binding international undertakings which give effect to Australia's stringent safeguard requirements on export of uranium including coverage by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.

         These arrangements provide assurance that Australian obligated uranium cannot end up in the nuclear weapons program of France, which in any event has its own sources of nuclear material not subject to the stringent conditions required by Australia. Current policy prohibits new contracts for sale of uranium to France until France becomes a party to the comprehensive test ban treaty. This issue has been debated exhaustively within the Australian community for the past 20 years and longer. We have dealt with this issue at times during the past week when at least some aspects of our approach to this issue were discussed. I have indicated that the government is opposed to the suspension of standing orders. We touched on some of the issues why we do not believe the matter needs to be dealt with today as an urgent matter. Before I conclude, I point out the urgency of the requirement to get some government legislation debated and passed. We have been doing precious little of that over the last few weeks.

         —In the absence of the shadow minister, the opposition will not be supporting the motion to suspend standing orders. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) has pointed out, bilateral safeguards are in place for countries purchasing uranium from Australia. They prohibit the purchasing nation from using Australian uranium to manufacture nuclear weapons. Other conditions such as the agreement that spent reactor fuel originally made from Australian uranium will not be reprocessed as plutonium are in place. We have these bilateral agreements. As the parliamentary secretary has said, we do not believe this is the time nor the place to debate this particular matter today.

These recommendations provide a more realistic minimum value for disclosure.

          The review of the registration arrangements did not attract a large response from senators, which the committee has interpreted as indicating that by and large senators accept the scheme as it stands and are reasonably satisfied with its operation. The committee has confirmed decisions it has made regarding the interpretation of the Senate's resolution, including application of the resolution to benefits received from frequent flyer schemes applied to official travel. These are set out in the report, and will be reflected in a revised explanatory memorandum to be issued by the committee. I commend the report to the Senate.

         When introducing the migration agents registration scheme, the then Minister, the Hon. Gerry Hand, MP, promised that the scheme would be reviewed two years after its commencement. In fulfilment of that commitment, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has just completed a year-long inquiry into the scheme. Our findings and recommendations are contained in the report which I am now tabling, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Protecting the Vulnerable? The Migration Agents Registration Scheme
         </emphasis>

          The report is a comprehensive analysis of the way in which the migration agents registration scheme has impacted on the providers and receivers of immigration advice in this country during the period of its short and uncertain existence. Shortly after the scheme was enacted, its validity was challenged in the High Court. The High Court's decision upholding the validity of the scheme, which was delivered during the course of the inquiry, settled the question of whether the scheme could continue to operate both legally and constitutionally.

          The committee's principal task was to determine whether the scheme should continue to operate and, if so, whether any improvements were necessary. The committee, in arriving at the conclusions contained in the report, took account of the evidence it received from all the major stakeholders in the scheme, including migration agents, legal bodies, immigration advice centres, community organisations, government departments, review tribunals, legal aid commissions and members of the public. I take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed to the inquiry by providing useful submissions and evidence at public hearings.

          While the scheme has not lived up to all of its expectations, evidence to the inquiry indicated that there is a continuing need for some form of regulation of the migration advice industry to ensure consumer protection. The committee rejected the notion of self-regulation at this stage because of the varied nature of the industry and the lack of a self-regulatory body with broad coverage of the industry.

          The committee considered that abolition of the scheme, or its substantial diminution, would send an inappropriate signal to the community about the government's commitment to the establishment of a competent and reputable migration advice industry in which the interests of those most in need of assistance are safeguarded. Indeed, the committee has proposed the continuation of the scheme for a further three years with suggestions to improve its effectiveness. At the same time, it has addressed concerns about the operation of the scheme raised in submissions.

          The committee heard many arguments about who should be included and who should be exempted from the requirement to register as a migration agent. Lawyers were among the most vocal opponents of the requirement for lawyers to register. They argued that the legal profession is already subject to its own disciplinary mechanisms and that these are adequate in controlling the conduct of lawyers who provide immigration assistance.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

          Evidence received from the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal suggested that, in proceedings before the tribunals, poor standards have been evident among lawyers and non-lawyers alike. In addition, it was evident to the committee that many consumers of immigration advice would have little knowledge of the intricacies of the legal profession's disciplinary mechanisms. As the government's original objective of raising professional standards within the migration advice industry has yet to be achieved, the committee concluded that lawyers should not be exempted from registration at this time.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another difficult issue was whether persons who provide immigration advice on a non-fee charging basis should be required to register as migration agents. Again, the committee concluded that, in general, the need to protect consumers warranted the inclusion of non-fee charging advisers in the scheme. To assist organisations in the non-fee charging sector which satisfy relevant standards, the committee has recommended a system of organisation based registrations. In addition, the committee has moved to plug the loopholes which have enabled some in the community to avoid the registration requirements. In particular, the committee has recommended that the scheme be expanded to include advice given to sponsors and nominators of migration applicants, as well as advice given to citizenship applicants.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As a principal objective of the scheme is to raise the standard of immigration advice, the committee also has proposed an ongoing education requirement for migration agents when renewing registrations. While some argued for tighter entry standards, the committee felt that it was inappropriate to establish more significant barriers to entry within the industry. The committee preferred to emphasise maintenance of standards through a continuing education points model.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           The committee has also proposed amendments to the Code of Conduct in order to strengthen consumer protection, including publication of an indicative guide on fees.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The committee has also recommended an expansion of the functions and powers of the Migration Agents Registration Board, which constitutes the operational base of the scheme. We suggest: a more pro-active role for the board in monitoring the activities of migration agents and in publicising its disciplinary actions; jurisdiction over unregistered practice; increased powers to refer the conduct of lawyers who are migration agents to the relevant legal bodies; increased powers to seek information from applicants for registration as migration agents; penalties for obstructing board investigations and adjudications; and an increased range of sanctions which can be applied by the board in disciplining migration agents, including the power to impose fines and order payment of compensation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Concerns about the administration of the scheme have also been addressed. One such concern related to the role of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs within the scheme. Currently, the secretary to the department, or the secretary's delegate, serves as chairperson of the board, approves straightforward registration applications, and also refers controversial applications to the board for its consideration. This has given rise to the perception that the scheme and the board which administers the scheme are linked too closely to one of the major stakeholders in the scheme.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In addressing this perception, and as a means of increasing public confidence in the scheme, the committee has recommended the appointment of an independent chairperson to the board who would have the additional power to initiate investigations of migration agents. This, we believe, will contribute to the standing of the board as an independent decision making body. It should also assist in improving the timeliness of board decision making processes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          When the scheme was established, a primary objective was that the scheme would be self-funding through the registration and renewal levies which migration agents are required to pay. That objective has not been achieved and, according to advice from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, is not likely to be achieved in the future if the registration levies are kept at existing levels. One of the major reasons is that a significantly higher proportion of agents currently pay a concessional levy than was intended when the parliament agreed to the existing levy structure.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          To overcome this problem, the committee has recommended limiting the availability of the concessional levy so that it is only available to those for whom the concession was originally established. This will bring additional revenue for the scheme. At the same time, the committee has proposed a 50 per cent reduction in the general registration and renewal fees to address concerns that the existing levies were perceived as a barrier to entry into the industry.

          In total, the committee has made 49 recommendations aimed at improving the operation and effectiveness of the migration agents registration scheme. The committee admits to having some lingering doubts about whether the scheme is capable of achieving its admirable objectives. The short time for which the scheme has been in existence, and the fact that for the majority of this time the very existence of the scheme was being challenged in the High Court, add to and reinforce these doubts. Notwithstanding this, the committee endorses a modified scheme and suggests that it be reviewed again in three years time.

          Before concluding, I take this opportunity to thank the deputy chairman, Senator Short, and my fellow committee members for their efforts throughout the inquiry. Their cooperation has resulted in a unanimous and what we believe to be a valuable report. The committee is grateful for the high quality and professional work undertaken by its secretariat, which was headed by the secretary, Mr Andres Lomp, and which at various points of the inquiry included Mr Stephen Boyd, Ms Sophia Konti, Mr Scott McClelland, Mrs Tu Pham and Mr Peter Tighe. Special thanks are also due to the committee's legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin, and to Mr Ian Branston, who was seconded from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to work on the inquiry. Their advice and assistance throughout the inquiry was extremely valuable. The department's cooperation in arranging this secondment is also appreciated greatly.

          I do not want to go over all the points of detail contained in the report or those already mentioned by Senator McKiernan in introducing the report. There are just two or three things that I want to say. I pick up the chairman's comments of a few moments ago that there are lingering doubts as to whether the scheme can ever achieve the admirable objectives that have been set for it. For that reason, the committee recommended that there be a three-year extension of the existing scheme, which is due to expire in September this year.

          There is a bill before the parliament to extend the life of the scheme for an additional year. We have recommended an additional three years, because we do not think there has been sufficient time to judge whether the scheme, as a long-term proposition, is what is the most desirable to meet what we all agree is the necessary objective of achieving a competent and efficient migration agents system within which the professionalism and integrity of the participants is of the highest priority. We are all agreed on that objective. The question is how best to get there.

          Whether this type of arrangement that is now in legislation in the form of the migration agents registration scheme is the best way of doing it is still an open question. Therefore, the jury is still out on it. To some extent, that is reflected in the committee's title of the report, which is
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Protecting the vulnerable?
          </emphasis>

          In that context, the committee agreed that self-regulation is not a viable option at this time, given the varied nature of the industry. Speaking personally, I hope that, in the course of time, self-regulation may prove to be a viable option. Industries and participants in industries, be they of this type or any other type, have a responsibility to keep their own house in order and to preserve and build the integrity of their industry or profession. In that context, self-regulation is idealistically the best way to go. Whether it can be achieved is another matter. That is something for another day in the light of what happens with our experience of the scheme over the next three years, if the government accepts the recommendation to extend the existing scheme for a further three years.

As the committee report points out, and as Senator McKiernan mentioned, for most of its history it has laboured under the shadow of a High Court challenge to its very existence. Only relatively recently has that challenge been decided by a very close margin. A four-three majority in the High Court upheld the validity of the scheme. The fact that it has had that shadow hanging over it during most of its existence to date has had an impact on the scheme. Now that that shadow has been removed, it will give us a better opportunity to see how the scheme can perform.

          For those reasons, I strongly urge the government to support the basic recommendation of the committee; namely, to extend the scheme for a period. Let us see whether it protects the vulnerable and provides all those other admirable objectives that have been set for the scheme. Allowing some breathing time to see how it works seems to us to be a commonsense and practical way to go. The fact that the government has foreshadowed in the legislation at least a one-year extension beyond the existing September 1995 deadline is an indication that it is probably thinking in a similar vein to us on that issue. Certainly if the coalition wins the next election we would be wanting to look at the future of the scheme in light of the very important findings and information that has come out in the course of the committee's inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         The subject of the committee's 11th report for 1995 concerns the redevelopment works for the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Gungahlin, ACT. The proposed works will include the replacement of existing temporary and substandard accommodation and the provision of additional facilities to meet expanded functions of the division. The new building complex will incorporate research laboratories and data collection areas, offices, stores, seminar rooms and staff amenities, and a central resource facility for graphics, information technology and library. The estimated cost of the proposal is $7 million at January 1995 prices.

          The Division of Wildlife and Ecology has occupied the Gungahlin site—a semi-rural site located on the Barton Highway, approximately seven kilometres north of Canberra's central business area—for over 40 years. The 36 buildings, which mainly occupy the eastern part of the site, are of diverse age, merit and condition. Three of the buildings and their surrounds have a heritage listing, including the Gungahlin Homestead, which was constructed in the 1860s.

          The need for redevelopment at the Gungahlin site results from a requirement to replace temporary and substandard accommodation and to provide increased facilities to meet expanded functional needs on the site. Overcrowding exists in some laboratories, leading to potentially unsafe working conditions and limitations for research usage. Many of the temporary buildings need to be replaced with permanent facilities more appropriate to the needs of the division, providing long-term flexibility, adaptability and ease of maintenance consistent with master plan principles.

          In submissions to the committee, the Australian Heritage Commission and the ACT division of the National Trust of Australia expressed considerable concern regarding the mass and scale of the proposed building A and its form and architectural detail, which were not seen as being sympathetic to the adjoining heritage listed Gungahlin Homestead. The placement of building A within the heritage precinct was also of concern. Given the ad hoc developments that have taken place on the site in the past, the Australian Heritage Commission believes that this proposal provides an excellent opportunity to establish a precedent for a more sympathetic design on the site.

          The subject of the committee's 12th report for 1995 is the provision of a replacement medical centre and associated medical facilities at RAAF base Richmond, New South Wales. The proposed works consist of a medical centre complex, an operational health support and training facility, and associated engineering services. The estimated cost of the project, when referred to the committee, was $11.4 million at July 1993 prices.

Defence assured the committee that the RAAF will occupy the base until at least the year 2015. The development of Badgerys Creek will require careful liaison between the RAAF and the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to airspace management.

          At the public hearing the committee sought advice from Defence regarding what appeared to be a very high usage rate of medical facilities at RAAF Richmond. There is something like 10,000 pharmacy uses per year. It works out roughly that defence force personnel use either the pharmacy or outpatient facility at least once a week, which we thought was a quite high usage rate.

          Defence advised that the usage rate resulted from a combination of factors which stemmed from the fact that military activities are essentially significantly different from those of civilian life. Service personnel are required to present early with their conditions so that their fitness for operational service can be maintained. Because of the fundamental requirement that service personnel become physically fit, a great deal of the outpatient usage results from sporting injuries. In fact, the physiotherapy unit was probably the most used. Also, as a significant number of single people live on base in barrack accommodation there is a very high incidence of common colds and upper respiratory tract infections.

        This bill seeks to amend the Child Care Act 1972, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to facilitate the Government's Budget 1995 commitment to improve the focus of the Children's Services Program. This will be achieved through two initiatives. Firstly, the Government will improve the targeting of financial assistance for families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force. And secondly, the Government will create a more equitable availability of occasional care for families with one or both parents at home.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These amendments change the eligibility for Childcare Assistance for occasional care in long day child care services to 12 hours per week for all families excepting those using childcare for work-related purposes and other exceptional circumstances.

        This Government recognises the important contribution to society and the economy of the unpaid work undertaken by women caring for their children at home.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These days, many parents will spend some time at home when their children are young and some time in the paid workforce.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        And under this Government's policies, work-related child care is an economic issue and is an integral part of the Government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable work force. The expansion of child care over the past decade has been a major achievement of the Government and has made the return to the work force a real option for many parents, particularly women.

        Work-related child care is required by parents who are working, studying, training or looking for work. The Government has a commitment to meet the anticipated demand for work-related care by the year 2001 and is well on the way to meeting the target of 354,000 work-related places by  2001, with an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97.

        The Government also assists families with the cost of child care through Commonwealth Childcare Assistance. Childcare Assistance is available to families using approved long day care services. About 76 per cent of families using these services receive some assistance with their child care fees, with over 40 per cent receiving full Childcare Assistance.

        However, at present, 25 per cent of Childcare Assistance is paid to families with one or both parents not in the work force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This proportion is increasing by about 2 per cent each year due to the increasing use of substantial periods of occasional care in the long day care sector by families with a parent outside the work force. Occasional care makes up about 20 per cent of all hours of care in the long day care sector.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recent surveys indicate that many working families cannot gain access to the care they need. The surveys also show that some families use substantial amounts of occasional care, while many others have no access to child care at all.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's clearer targeting of Childcare Assistance will ensure that families who need child care to enable work force participation get priority to places. The amendments contained in this bill will assist by revising Childcare Assistance arrangements consistent with the work-related focus of the Program.

        In the 1995 Budget, the Government also announced that the assessment of a family's eligibility for Childcare Assistance and Family Payments will be streamlined. This will be achieved by having the Department of Social Security assess eligibility for both payments at the same time each year using a common definition of income from October 1995. This initiative is designed to make the assessment process easier for families by enabling families to provide information applicable to both schemes on the same application form at the same time.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill serves to make various portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. Taken together, the amendments amount to a significant further step in moulding a responsive and accountable social security system for the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill introduces a series of initiatives that recognise the importance of further education and training in equipping people currently in the social security system for their future roles in the workforce.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recipients of job search or newstart allowance may currently continue to be paid that allowance for up to three weeks if they start a course that lasts for longer than six months. This payment is made while their entitlement to AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY is being assessed. The scheme is to be made simpler for all concerned by continuing the payment for a standard three weeks, rather than up to three weeks. The scheme is also to be extended to certain people who start courses that last for less than six months and who, as a result, lose qualification for their allowance. Currently, a person in this situation would lose the allowance if the course is one that is not approved for the purposes of the activity test or an activity agreement. Furthermore, special beneficiaries will now also be able to take advantage of these improved rules.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also makes an education entry payment available to recipients of job search, newstart or youth training allowance who start a full-time course that lasts for less than six months. This will apply as long as the course is one that they were required to start under the activity test or an activity agreement. Therefore, these people will join the longer term unemployed customers who already have access to this important payment that can make all the difference with the unavoidable up-front costs involved in starting an educational course.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An inconsistency is also being eliminated in the treatment of AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY for the purposes of whether social security allowance or benefit recipients qualify for bereavement payments on the death of their partners. In the past, bereavement payments have been paid only if the person was a long-term social security recipient, that is, they have been receiving a relevant social security payment for at least 52 weeks. Periods on AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY will now count towards that period. This will reduce any disadvantage to people who undertake study during an extended period on social security payments compared to those who do not.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill will exclude as income under the act loans made to AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY recipients under the Student Financial Supplement Scheme. The amendment ensures that a person in this situation will not be excluded from qualification for a Health Care Card on the basis of Student Financial Supplement Scheme loan payments being included in their income.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Two amendments are also being made to the waiting and deferment period provisions for job search, newstart and sickness allowance. There is a current rule that reduces the education leavers waiting period for a person who does some full-time study during the waiting period and reclaims allowance within four weeks of starting the course. To improve the incentives for people to attempt a return to education, this concession will now apply if the person reclaims allowance within 12 months of starting the course.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is also being clarified that the part of the waiting or deferment period that may be waived if a person undertakes approved vocational training during the period is only that part of the waiting or deferment period that overlaps with the vocational training. In other words, it is not the whole waiting or deferment period.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also contains a number of useful enhancements to the social security disability programs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mobility allowance is generally available to people with disabilities who are engaged in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary work or job search activities, to help them with their special transport costs. Period of grace payments of six weeks' worth of mobility allowance are paid to people who cease some of these qualifying activities. This bill provides that all mobility allowance recipients will generally receive these period of grace payments when they stop any kind of qualifying activity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A further amendment relates to telephone allowance. Telephone allowance will continue to be paid to people who lose their entitlement to disability wage supplement when they return to work, as long as they continue to qualify for fringe benefits. Also, it is being clarified that, to be entitled to an employment entry payment, disability wage supplement recipients must claim the payment within a reasonable time of returning to work in the supported wage system. The time limit will be 28 days. These amendments bring disability wage supplement recipients into line with disability support pensioners whose payments are similar in nature.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also modifies the meaning of the term "continuing inability to work" which is one of the qualification criteria for disability support pension and disability wage supplement. In response to the unanticipated outcome in the AAT case of Loknar, the amendment puts beyond doubt that the necessary assessment must be whether the person is fit for any work, whether skilled or unskilled, that he or she could do without needing preparatory training. Alternatively, if such training were necessary, it would have to be likely to equip the person to do the job within two years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In a further amendment affecting disability support pension and disability wage supplement, the qualification provisions will address a trend emanating from several recent SSAT and AAT decisions. The amendment will make sure that the person's continuing inability to work is directly caused by an impairment of 20 per cent or more under the act's Impairment Tables. Factors that are consequences of the impairment, such as attitude and lack of motivation to work, may not be taken into account.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has assessed the legal impact of the assets test in the Social Security Act on successful native title claims. In general, a person's native title right or interest would be regarded as akin to a life interest because of the restrictions on saleability of native title land. All life interests, unless created by the person or their partner, are exempt under the assets test. Government policy on this issue is clear; the assets test should not apply. The Government wishes to make this policy explicit and this bill does that by exempting as assets under the act any native title rights or interests of a person, or of any community or group of which the person is a member.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The compensation recovery provisions of the act protect the social security system from "double dippers", that is, those who might receive social security payments, as well as compensation, for the same period. Several measures contained in this bill build on this comprehensive package of provisions. First, the provisions will clearly apply to superseded payment types. In other words, they will apply (as was always intended) to the forerunners of the payment types that are already specified in the current provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, a trend in compensation settlements highlighted by the AAT case of Kilinc needs to be overcome. This trend has meant that the compensation recovery provisions have been avoided by splitting compensation settlements into two or more payments, only one of which (usually relatively small) is expressed to represent lost earnings or earning capacity and is therefore caught by the provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thirdly, the provisions will apply to claimants as well as recipients of certain social security payments. This will free claimants as well as the Department of the need to go through a time consuming and often costly qualification assessment exercise when the compensation recovery provisions might well already preclude payment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Lastly, compensation payments will be clearly included in income for the purposes of the Disadvantaged Persons Health Scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The relaxed residence requirements for refugees were introduced last year. These basically allowed the payment of certain pensions to refugees without their needing to satisfy the usual qualifying residence requirements. This bill refines certain aspects of that legislation. The amendments make sure that a person continues to be regarded as a refugee for social security purposes, and therefore retains the residence concession, even if they cease to be the current holder of a refugee-type visa because of certain incidental effects of the immigration visa system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The loan fringe benefit provisions apply under the family payment income test and the parental means test for young allowance recipients. How this operates is that, if an employee receives a loan from an employer, the employee has a loan fringe benefit. The value of the loan fringe benefit is calculated having regard to a notional interest rate that should reflect market rates. However, it is in fact well below those rates at present. This amendment both raises the rate to a reasonable market rate and sets in place an automatic mechanism for its adjustment each year. The rate will be the lowest available rate from any one of four major banks specified by the Minister.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Provisions also being amended are those that govern the date of effect of determinations to cancel, suspend, increase or decrease a person's job search, newstart or partner allowance. The amendments provide that where the information that results in the determination to vary, cancel or suspend the allowance is provided on a recipient statement notice, the determination will take effect on the day of the event or change. A recipient statement notice is the form that persons receiving these payments are required to submit to the Department regularly declaring their circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Lastly, the bill makes minor technical and consequential amendments, including to provisions in the areas of the qualifying age for the seniors health card, the income test and related matters, superannuation pensions, debt recovery, data-matching.

         Can I say, before turning to the amendments, that what we are building in Australia is an export culture. That is to say that Australian business thinks internationally, thinks about market opportunity overseas and works to claim Australian presence in those overseas markets and to extend them. What we have seen over the last several years, and indeed borne out in the OECD report figures that came out last night, is a growth of exporting from Australia. We are now part of a global economy. We are a successful exporting nation. As I have said in this chamber many times, the export of manufactured goods in particular—a poor performer when measured in the past against the exports of mineral commodities and agricultural products—has boomed over recent years and now, in total value, manufactured exports outweigh the total value of agricultural exports from Australia. In short, we are becoming a more sophisticated economy and a more sophisticated exporting nation.

         The export market development grants are aimed at helping businesses establish themselves in the export market. The grants are provided across-the-board. They are in grant form, which is to say that, if a business qualifies under the criteria, it gets the grant. That means that the configuration of the grants are not capped, that they are open ended and that as many businesses which apply and meet the criteria succeed. We are in the active business of encouraging many more Australian companies to export. Therefore, taxpayers' money diverted to export market development grants in order to build an export economy has been working dramatically well for us. This bill is appropriate in extending that provision for another five years and in putting around it certain conditions which safeguard the best use of taxpayers' money when we have a scheme based on grants which is open ended like this.

         The amendments that have been proposed are related in the main to changes to the conditions of export market development grants. When we come to the committee stage, I will rely on the fact essentially that the conditions that we have imposed are conditions that have been, if you like, refereed externally. Professor Helen Hughes has done a study which recommends that the conditions be applied in the manner in which we have applied them.

         But, importantly, given that this is an open-ended grant scheme, conditions of this type are necessary to safeguard proper use of taxpayers' funds. As a consequence, we will be rejecting the amendments proposed by the opposition and by the Australian Democrats, and rejecting them with respect. We do appreciate what moves their spirit in bringing these amendments forward to make this a more widely accessible scheme, but our broad view—given the reports we have in front of us—is that that enthusiasm to broaden the scheme transgresses against prudent management of the scheme and proper safeguarding of taxpayers' interests. So, for those reasons, we will be essentially rejecting these amendments.

         However, these amendments may be carried because of the joint support for them by the Australian Democrats and the coalition. I do not propose that we will make a spectacle of this. In other words, we will not divide on each of these amendments; I will take the vote on the voices. Doing it this way ought to speed the proceedings, but it should not be interpreted in any way as a less forceful advocacy of the government's position than if we took the issue to a division. But, in the prudent expedition of this bill, it is an appropriate measure for us to take. Nonetheless, I want to record that we feel strongly about our position. That may well mean that the vote is carried against the government's wishes. The bill will then return to the House of Representatives. It is for the house to decide what it does, but I imagine it will support the bill and the bill will come back here for further consideration in the Senate.

         In addition to that there is a government amendment, which of course we support. We ask the house to join us in supporting it. The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, made a statement to the parliament on Monday of this week pointing to an administrative oversight in the tabling of a disallowance instrument relating to export market development grants. This change is to accommodate that oversight. It is in the best interests of all of us who are committed to this scheme to rectify that administrative flaw that has arisen. I seek support for that.

So I thank all senators for their contribution. However, as I said, the amendments are not acceptable. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Austrade has advised the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), and through him me, that, since it took over operation or carriage of the EMDG legislative process in late 1991, measures have been put in place to ensure that such an oversight does not recur. All guidelines in the form of disallowable instruments since then have been tabled, and Austrade has met its obligations to the parliament.

         In simple terms, everyone thought this was the binding law and acted accordingly. People who got adverse decisions and wanted to exercise their appeal rights did so. Two of those are still broadly within time. Your question is similar in character to that of Senator Spindler—whether there is a time limitation on such appeals. I refer to section 40A of the Export Market Development Grants Act, entitled `Review of decisions of the Commission'. Subsection 40A(2) reads:

        When I was referring to being out of time, I was referring to subsection 40A(2) and that provision of a 30-day limitation. In this case, `the Commission' means the Australian Trade Commission, which is Austrade for short.

         The legal matter on foot over research and development is a matter for an Administrative Appeals Tribunal appeal. My answers are related to decisions of Austrade. On the secondary question of Senator Spindler as to what happens now, can they come back on substantive matters? The answer, in view of all this, is that, yes, they can. What might be the rights, vis a vis appealing a commission decision to the AAT, is another matter. I have a nod from the advisers.

People acting as they thought the law was—and, hopefully, will now be confirmed to be—acted consistently all the way through on that belief. One imagines that if you were knocked out under the previous situation, if there is consistency of treatment, you ought to be knocked out in the future.

         However, the concern is—I take it as being embedded in your question to me—that people were knocked out but were they validly knocked out; and have they now got a right to come back? As I recall the reading of 40A(2), in the first instance the commission has a 30-day limit on appeals but, in the second instance, the commission has the right to extend the appeal time. What Austrade is saying is, `If you feel badly done by under those guidelines, if you thought we had inappropriately interpreted the guidelines or you have some substantial matters to put, come back and see us and we will sort it out.' That, effectively, is the signal being flagged by Austrade. I do not see how, reasonably, it could do anything else.

         —I take the opportunity to outline to the minister another concern I have which I think has been met by his undertaking, but let me explain it first so that he can see the crux of the matter. It is this. Under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, where a delegated instrument is invalidly made or, as in this case, has not been tabled, what happens is that the instrument is valid from the day of making until it becomes invalid by virtue of an omission. The problem then is that thereafter it is invalid.

         The difficulty that arises is this. The government cannot rely on a provision of an invalid regulation after that date to the detriment of somebody who seeks to make a claim. I think what the legislative amendment does—and there has been some broad agreement on the thrust of it—is effectively take away certain rights because after the date on which the delegated instrument became invalid the government really had no right to turn people down, other than existing statutory rights. So the legislation reinstates what people thought the law was. In reality, what they thought the law was, after the invalidity of that delegated instrument, was not correct. The law was, in fact, a nullity. So it reinstates it.

       </para>
       <para>
        This initial amendment deals with samples. Samples are eligible from the point of view of calculating costs of exports in respect of every other export industry. This means that, where people wish to export products made in Australia, they are taken overseas and given as samples to prospective buyers. That is fair and legitimate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With regard to tourism, that is impossible. It is required that tourism operators have no option but to bring people such as Japanese wholesalers, tourism journalists and any other industry representatives to Australia to see what the tourism services are and what can be offered to potential tourists to Australia from throughout the world. For example, one of the popular things in my state of Far North Queensland—it is a popular and niche market—is the market of ecotourism. One group of people that has a great interest in it comes from Europe. I believe that the vast majority of people who visit Far North Queensland for ecotourism purposes come from Germany. This means that the wholesalers—the people marketing the product—must come and look.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is not permissible under the existing act in the calculation of the costs, in getting to the $30,000 expenditure for export market development grants. So it really is bringing into line the great tourism industry—an industry that both Senator Cook and Senator McMullan have praised a number of times because of its growth. There is no option. You cannot take the product to the overseas buyer; you must bring the overseas buyer to the product—hence the reason for moving this amendment.

         It is also true that this scheme provides a situation where no industry sector, irrespective of what it is, is allowed to claim free samples given away in Australia. This would, in fact, distort the scheme, were we to make an exception to this particular industry. To allow this amendment would be to give preferential treatment to the tourism industry over other industry sectors. That may sound to be a rather direct judgment but, nonetheless, it is an appropriate one when you consider it against some other balancing facts too. For example, the Australian Tourist Commission already funds these types of promotional visits—which are felt to be in the interest of the national tourism industries—and that is an appropriate way.

         We are not saying that no other circumstances apply; we are saying that this scheme is designed to establish new markets. It needs to be seen alongside the array of other schemes that apply in particular industry sectors. The role of the Australian Tourist Commission—its success in building a popular tourist destination image for Australia in foreign markets—has been outstanding. Under its funding, it does provide promotional visits of the sort that would be, if you like, defined as free samples in Australia under the opposition's amendment.

         Finally, the government has serious concerns about the accountability of free samples for this industry sector. How do you define it? What is one? What is just a junket? We are talking about expending public moneys under a particular scheme for people to visit and have a so-called free sample of the Australian tourist industry. Defining and operating that, if we were to agree to it, would be a terribly difficult task in itself. So, for that reason as well, we oppose the amendment.

         —The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Parer. The minister's point that an avenue of funding is already available through the Tourist Commission means that, if that happens, the tourist operators would not be able to claim the cost of such trips as expenditure. This provides a second avenue for tourist operators to provide the opportunity for overseas agents to assess the tourism destination, namely, Australia, and what it has to offer to overseas tourists. As such, it is an essential promotional strategy.

         —As I mentioned in the seconding reading debate, tourism is probably one of the most competitive industries in the world—and I do not think the minister would disagree with that. Every country in the world would like to maximise the number of tourists which come to visit, and also to maximise their stay when they are there. It is also an industry which has an awful lot of potential benefits to Australia, in that those people who come leave foreign exchange in this country. They also do it in a way that supports the regions in which they spend the money. It is a very effective way of keeping money within regions. It is probably a more effective way of redistributing income than is already done in some of the government's schemes.

         The minister raised a point about the ATC, and quite rightly. There is a program, called the ATE, under which, for the past two years, people have come to Darling Harbour in Sydney to promote their products. The ATC certainly encourages people, mainly journalists, as well as overseas buyers, to come along. Journalists are important to the industry because it is through them that its products are promoted. However, irrespective of the ATC, the people who spend the most on promoting tourism in this country are those in the private sector. In fact, of the total budget of the ATC, about 30 per cent is provided by the private sector. You could argue that it is paying for that aspect of the ATC's operation.

         In my experience, by far the biggest promoter is the industry itself. It is all very well to have a particular facility—be it ecotourism, the vineyards of the Yarra Valley in Victoria, or the Sydney Opera House—but it is up to those people to go overseas and do their own promotion, whether as individuals or as representatives of a region. With a new market, in particular, you cannot send the product overseas to be sampled; you must bring the prospective buyers or promoters to the product. I would just like to reinforce that as the reason we have moved this amendment.

         —I believe the amendment should be passed for the simple reason that familiarisations—or `famils', as they are known in the tourism industry—are an essential part of marketing a product. One reason for some tourist enterprises failing and other tourist enterprises succeeding is the simple fact that it is not good enough to just build a facility and hope that the people will come. It is not like that baseball movie, where the guy kept being told, `Build it and they will come.' The Australian tourism industry is littered with operations that were set up but never properly marketed. Everybody would know of one or two examples of that.

         If we are going to wholesale holidays in this country to the international market, it is absolutely crucial that there be some proper recognition of and assistance with that process. That is what this amendment seeks to do. It is not fair to say that there will be a certain cost involved. An immense amount is recuperated in revenue, not just for the industry but also for the government, by virtue of the success of familiarisations. But if you do not do them, you do not get people, particularly from overseas.

         Increasingly, people are being booked on package tours. It is therefore important that the wholesaler, or the retailer at the other end, knows what options are available to prospective visitors when they go to the tourism retailer's establishment to book a holiday. People go in and effectively buy from a catalogue, so it helps if the people helping them make a decision have been there and can say that they have been to a certain hotel, or on a certain cruise, or have done a certain safari, and can give a personal view of the experience. We have to remember that when we are selling tourism we are not selling a destination—we are not selling the sights of Sydney Harbour—we are selling a tourism experience. People buy that tourism experience on the basis of what they are told when they walk into the office of the booking clerk.

That is more effective than the government giving money to consultants in order to determine whether an area has tourism potential.

         By supporting joint ventures we would attract more tourists to different areas of Australia. Single operators could not afford the money to market their product overseas. This measure gives an opportunity for one, two, three, four or five operators to join together as a group and market their product to the overseas wholesalers and retailers. That is the purpose behind the amendment. We believe that this measure will promote those areas of Australia which otherwise may not receive the benefits of tourism.

Towns in Queensland, and elsewhere in regional Australia, are being told that if they want assistance in marketing tourism they must get together and create a regional tourism board or some sort of confederation of different towns in the area and seek grants on a regional basis. What Senator Parer is doing is entirely consistent with that approach. This amendment seeks to extend the EMDG mechanism to those regional bodies.

         It is much more practical. I will give a first-hand example. The Gulf Country in Queensland is very interesting country and is different from the rest of Australia. There is no point in Burketown trying to market itself to the world; nor is there any point in Karumba trying to market itself to the world. But if, for example, the Gulf local authority development association or some other regional body put together a comprehensive package to take in all the experiences that the Gulf has to offer—from the Undara lava tubes to Escott Lodge at Burketown—it could be successful.

Firstly, the cost is estimated to be initially $2 million to $3 million, but may rapidly escalate. Secondly, large tourism operators currently excluded because of the $25 million export earnings upper limit would be able to gain access to this scheme through this facility. The scheme should promote things that otherwise would not occur. Fundamentally, tourism operates through this joint promotion anyway and the existing provisions of the act encourage this.

         The aggregation of three or more tourism amenities would qualify the group for a 50 per cent grant rate, thereby providing a means of circumventing the application of the 25 per cent rate to single service providers. Because inbound tour operators operate larger on a joint basis with providers, there is potential under the current rules for them to receive multiple grants for joint ventures for different components of the same promotion. These are the main reasons why the government is opposing this amendment.

         I note the estimated cost given by the minister, but the tourism industry is a classic economic industry. It is one into which very few other industries in the world fit. It is an industry in which, if the money is spent, there is a return made. An estimate has been made that for every dollar spent on the promotion of tourism—and this is not my estimate; I think it is the estimate of a learned man from Monash University or somewhere—there is a $32 return to this country, which is an incredible amount. So we cannot really weigh it up in the way the minister has.

         Another point I want to make is that, if they are successful in attracting tourists, for every 17 tourists that come into this country another Australian is employed. Another interesting fact is that every tourist who comes to Australia spends something like $400 on indirect taxes to government. So the potential benefits to this country are great. It is a massive marketing exercise. Under this amendment—as I mentioned earlier, and as supported by Senator O'Chee and Senator Spindler—this is just another way in which operators who would not normally have the ability to participate in encouraging people from around the world to come and visit our country and see what it has to offer will now be able to do so.

        This amendment, as I indicated before in my speech during the second reading debate, seeks to reduce the threshold amount from the current $30,000 to $15,000. The threshold has been increased progressively over the years and clearly it establishes a very significant barrier for small business operators who wish to break into export markets. We have seen items in the newspapers just in the last few days saying that only a small percentage of small business operators are entering export markets and that the potential is very much greater.

         The government, aided and abetted by the opposition, actually puts barriers in front of small business to access this particular scheme which, if not the only one, is one of the really interventionist schemes that the government is pursuing—one that is successful and one that the Democrats support. All we are asking is that small business operators be given access to it.

         As a person who has spent many years working in export promotion around the world, I would have to say that the suggestion is difficult to justify. One of the concerns that we had is that of cost and—this is no reflection on the small business sector with which I have a close affinity—the possibility for those who are not terribly interested in the promotion of exports being able to use the system for their own particular needs to travel overseas.

         As I have indicated on many occasions, if one is serious in the export market it is not cheap—it is expensive. I think I mentioned earlier that the production of a brochure could cost as much as $20,000. Over a number of years we have seen the value of our dollar collapse to half the value of the US dollar and, going back far enough in time when there were 440 or 400 yen to the dollar, it is now 60 yen to the dollar. In fact, two or three trips to Japan will come to $20,000 very rapidly.

         There must be a cap put on it. In this day and age with the Australian dollar at such a low value—others often call it the peso because of the actions of this government in doing what it has done to the economy—the amount of money spent must have a cap. My belief is that $30,000 is a reasonable cap, whereas the $15,000 would open it up. I would not like to hazard a guess at the cost and the amount of bureaucratic work involved in determining whether grants were eligible or not with a figure as low as $15,000.

         A higher threshold results in greater success, but may have less influence over the company's behaviour. Whereas a lower threshold raises the likelihood of failure but probably has a greater influence over behaviour. Subsequent evaluation supports this linkage. The thresholds have not changed in line with inflation since that time and the thresholds were considered to be appropriate by an independent evaluation of the scheme which concluded in April 1994. So, for those reasons, the government is not persuaded to support this amendment.

        The purpose of this amendment is to allow tourism operators exactly the same facilities as are available to every other exporter in this country. It is worth pointing out that in 1993 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology unanimously concluded that not only was it inequitable to have one sector of industry eligible for assistance through the export market development scheme and others not but it was inequitable that exporters of manufactured goods and other services were eligible for assistance while certain exporters were not. It went on to recommend that tourism be given full access to the scheme.

         There seems to be a slow realisation by the Labor Party in this country that tourism is now one of our major industries. It is in the same league as mining, primary industry and manufacturing. If one looks at what the tourism industry in a very sustainable way brings into Australia, one will see that it is different from other industries because, under the normal export procedures widgets and so on, goods have to be produced. In my own industry, from years gone by, products had to be mined, processed, sent overseas and, in return, dollars came into Australia.

         Tourism is a different animal altogether in that it promotes Australia internationally as a destination. It means that people come here, they are accommodated, they eat and they look at things without anything having to go out of Australia—the foreign exchange stays here. I would have thought that, since we are looking at a $27 billion current account deficit in the current budget and are realising the effect this will have on our foreign borrowings, every incentive would have been given to promote an industry that brings in close to $12 billion worth of foreign exchange, employs over 500,000 people and has the potential to make a big dent in the unemployment levels in Australia, particularly among young people—that is where the opportunity arises.

As I have indicated at other times in this debate, this is an industry which is tied up with promotion: if you do not promote the industry, it will not survive.

         I am pleased to see the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) in the chamber. Only a little time ago, on 2 March 1995, he put out a media release in which he lauded—quite correctly—the exports of Australian services to the world and said that they had increased by more than 11 per cent. He said:

         The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) in his closing remarks in the second reading debate talked about the growth of the manufacturing industry. The manufacturing industry has grown, but nothing has grown like the tourism industry. Tourism is the most competitive industry in the world. I have often made the remark in years gone by that, if it were not for tourism, places like London, Rome and Paris may not exist. Promotion is done mainly by the individual operators, certainly with the support of the Australian Tourist Commission—which does a first-class job. And the people who promote their industry most are those who have got most to lose—for example, the individual operators, the resorts and the regions.

         There is no justification whatsoever in singling out the tourism industry for a lower export market development grant than other industries. In fact, it shows that the government is just paying lip-service to this particular industry. The government does not recognise it as being the major industry that it is and an industry that is competing fiercely with every other country in the world. I know the government will argue that this is going to cost $7 million—that is the estimate I have—but that takes no account of a number of factors. First, under the export market development grants scheme, supposing one is profitable and following the last budget, 36 per cent will go back to the government in tax because it is added to the taxable income.

         Second—and I have said this prior to Senator McMullan coming in here—this is the classic industry where, if you want to earn money, you have to spend it. If you do not spend money on promotion, you will not earn it. Senator McMullan knows that as well as I. There are certain similarities between this industry and other industries. You have to have a good product and give a good service but you must promote it. Promotion is a major item. Without the first two factors, it is no good promoting to your heart's content. We have a good product, we give a very good service, we have excellent accommodation and other facilities, but it must be promoted. Once that promotion falls away, the industry itself will not grow. On all the information we have, for every $1 spent on promotion, $32 will come back into this country by way of revenue to Australia. There is no justification and it is highly inequitable that this particular industry should be treated adversely compared to any other industries doing their best to promote and market Australia or Australian products overseas.

We believe that the Australian tourism industry is an important industry for Australia and that it should not be singled out for disadvantageous treatment, which is the effect of the government's legislation. It is difficult to understand, because tourism is one of the growth industries and an industry in which we perform well. As has been said by others, it needs to be promoted. It has a chance to grow, it has a chance to provide us with employment and with many other benefits that derive from interchanges with people from other countries.

It is one of the most successful interventionist schemes—and one of the few—which the government still has in existence.

         The evidence shows that a large part of the overseas promotion for Australian tourism, which is what is covered by EMDG matters, and what determines whether people choose Australia, Hawaii or Europe, is money already provided by the Australian government. That is not true when people are choosing to buy steel, coal or other products, but in this circumstance it is. There is a large amount of Australian government money that says, `They make the choice for Australia.' The subsequent advertising is `competition within Australia'. Much of the promotion that is done is about whether they go to Cairns or Townsville and then within Cairns, Townsville, Melbourne or whenever, which place they go. There is nothing wrong with people doing that—it is a perfectly proper commercial activity—but that is not adding to our exports.

There is no other industry that has that first and critical decision so significantly influenced by government outlays. That is not just some assertion.

It is not in the same circumstance as every other. Therefore, treating them the same will not give the equivalent budget support—taxpayer support—to the various industries.

        I forewarn the chair that when Senator Alston returns to the chamber we will deal very briefly with the return to order on which he and I are scheduled to speak. There are some things I would like to have said in the summing up of the second reading debate. I know that Senator Cook covered most of them and I alluded to them in my response to the final amendments. I thank my ministerial colleagues for covering for me for the period in which I could not be here to deal with this bill for which I am responsible.

         What I wanted to draw attention to is the critical consideration the Senate will need to give to the amendments it has just proposed when, as I suspect, this bill comes back from the House of Representatives with many of those amendments rejected. This measure has as its core the proposal to continue this important EMDG legislation for, essentially, the rest of this decade. With the exception of the Greens, that is a proposal everybody in the Senate agrees with. That is a crunch point we will have to face very soon.

         I want to take this opportunity to say that I expect the government in the House of Representatives to reject virtually all those amendments. There are one or two that are procedural and technical and I do not think we will be dealing with those in that way but we will have to give them a bit more consideration. Those amendments which have budgetary or policy considerations I think will be rejected and the Senate will need to give that serious consideration. I commend the third reading to the Senate.

In fact, the difference between us is narrow but it is one of certain underlying assumptions. This is not a question of whether this is a document which should be public or not. That is an agreed view by, I think, everybody in the chamber. It is a question of when it should be public, and we are not even disagreeing about a very long period. If this motion referred to next Wednesday, 28 June, then probably the government could agree to it, although I might find myself in an embarrassing position next Wednesday, but probably not.

          The report of the Australian Broadcasting Authority is a report the nature of which we would normally expect to be made public, and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has indicated his intention to do so. But it is a matter bound up with and part of a submission which the minister is making to the cabinet and the cabinet is scheduled to deal with next Tuesday. Once the cabinet has made its decision, we will release the document. The minister has indicated, I think publicly, but he has certainly authorised me to say to the Senate and to Senator Alston that we will then release it. If it has not been said publicly, I say on his behalf that it will be made public soon in conjunction with the announcement of the cabinet decision, and I expect that to be Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.

This is only about timing. It is about the role of this document as a part of the executive government's decision making process, as against its role as part of the public debate about the issue. I accept, and I think Senator Alston accepts, that there are arguments on both sides. It is not an easy judgment to make, but I and any one who has been in executive government or who aspires to it will accept that I am bound to the point that this is a document currently categorised cabinet-in-confidence.

I think there is a 90 per cent chance we can comply with that date, but I cannot give a guarantee. I will seek to do so and the minister has indicated that he will seek to do so.

          I understand perfectly that the government may well decide it simply does not want a debate on this matter until the election campaign. Well, good luck to it. But the point remains that this has been a matter of immense public controversy. The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, has stated in the media that his preferred option was 20 per cent. Now we have had this report, he is saying he wants 15 per cent. The public ought to be able to have their say. It simply ought not be debated in private by the government at a time to suit its political convenience. The matter ought to be on the table publicly so that not just political parties but all those interested in the community can have an input. Therefore, I think it is in everyone's interests—perhaps not the government's political interests but everyone else's interests—to ensure there is the maximum possible input into a very contentious issue as soon as possible.

          —The Greens have expressed concern on a number of occasions about the types of categories of documents that the government says are not available. It is getting to the ridiculous kind of statement that the only things the Senate can ask for are those things which normally would be available under freedom of information. Because of this concern that there is this closing-in on the kind of information that the democratic parliamentary process can have access to in order to make proper decisions, we would certainly support this reasonable request from the opposition to have this document made available and not at some politically convenient time for the government.

         —I wish to concentrate my remarks in this debate in respect of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995 on the manner of financing our health system arrangements in this country. At the outset, I note that there is much to be proud of in the current health system arrangements. The coalition, as has already been announced, endorses these aspects and will ensure that they continue under the next government.

         Bulk-billing and community rating will be features of the coalition's health care system. No member of the community need be in any way concerned that bulk-billing might be lost if a coalition government is elected. As I have said, there is much in the current health arrangements about which Australians can be proud. However, there are also features of the current arrangements which the government must acknowledge are indefensible and must act to remedy.

         I do not, however, wish to examine those issues today. I highlight the degree to which Australians are being forced into a collective system of health care, where those who are financially able to contribute to their own health care arrangements are able to ride on the back of average Australians and compete with them for places in the public hospital system.

         This is not an equitable health system. This is not egalitarian: it is socialist; it is ideological; and, most certainly, it is inefficient. Until Australians with the financial capacity to take responsibility for their own health care are encouraged to do so by utilising the private health care system, we will continue to waste resources and we will continue to see waiting queues grow. As I said earlier, I would particularly like to take the opportunity to consider the method of financing the Medicare health system.

         When Chris Hurford, a former Minister for Housing and Construction and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, introduced the Income Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy) Bill into the House of Representatives on 6 September 1983, he said that he did so with pride and with pleasure. The bill introduced a surcharge, an add-on, a levy, a tax—a tax of one per cent on taxable income for people residing in Australia—to finance the implementation of the government's universal Medicare system. That was back in September 1983—almost 12 years ago.

         Of course, the government claimed that this was no tax: it was a levy—a contribution by Australian taxpayers. Even though the levy was to be collected by the Australian Taxation Office, and employers had to deduct the levy from the workers' salaries, the government continued to claim that this was no tax.

This is a free, democratic and multicultural society; it should be kept that way. Many people in Australia take a view of things widely different from mine.

         In spite of ours being a free, democratic and multicultural society, we impose criminal penalties on people who rape, assault, steal, take part in unlawful assemblies, act offensively in public places, illegally use uniforms and, in some circumstances, go on strike. Murder is an activity that is punished in all societies of which I know. It seems to be universal policy amongst law makers to punish murderers. There are differences from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to whether a particular act constitutes murder but, whatever makes up the deed is declared a crime.

         The Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory has declared certain acts by medical practitioners which were previously declared murderous acts no longer so.

         If euthanasia is a good thing, why are there so many people denied it who, on the basis of the thinking behind it, seem entitled to its benefits? Why is a person who is suffering from a treatable clinical depression not able to enjoy the good that euthanasia brings? Why is the same true of someone who is 17 years of age, or who has not considered the implications of his or her decision for his or her family, or who is of unsound mind, or who is living in an area where only one doctor is available, or where no interpreter can be got to the bedside? Why are they not able to make use of this good? In other words, why is this act so capricious?

         If euthanasia is as good as it is contended to be in the Northern Territory, why is it made available to so few people? Is it that at the back of the minds of the people who passed this law there is a fear that, in the end, a killing in the circumstances which they have approved is so near what is still considered murder in the Northern Territory? Is it that they fear going to the point which the logic of the situation compels?

         On what principle are people denied a merciful death? Why should it be murder if a doctor kills them but not if a doctor disposes of people from a very narrow group? In other words, why is the group identified in this act—those who are entitled to be killed in such a way that the doctor does not become liable—so narrow if this procedure of euthanasia is so good? The logical result of all this is for future legislation to widen the coverage of the act, and legislation creep—or legislation gallop—is likely to take place.

         The number of authorities that can now make legal use of telephone interceptions has increased apace since ASIO was first allowed to employ them. The tax file number was to have had a most confined use when parliament first approved its establishment, but that use has widened amazingly in the meantime. The powers that this legislature has given to investigative agents have expanded mightily over the last decade. Precedent creates a logic for its own development. Making some kinds of killing lawful makes it almost inevitable that more and more types will be brought within the law.

         If killing is allowed in the circumstances provided for in the Northern Territory act it is almost impossible not to see that there must be an extension to people who are under 17 years of age; to people who are of unsound mind; and to people who have not taken into account the effect that this might have on their families. We have a situation where what is now murder becomes an act of kindness and compassion within a few years. Acts which were of a murderous kind last year have now become acts of compassion within the meaning of the act. Some dreadful things can be done to people, some dreadful crimes can be committed, but murder is still the most heinous.

         Many provisions in the act constitute a code that doctors must follow before they commit themselves to killing someone so that the killing is lawful within the meaning of the act. The opportunity for mistake along the way is mind-boggling. The ability of the Northern Territory police to investigate whether a killing is murder is going to be made incredibly difficult. The way out for the police is not to investigate killings if two doctors have been involved in sending the person to his or her grave or to the crematorium.

         There is provision in the act to punish people who give a reward to doctors above and beyond what is proper. Section 6 of the act reads as follows:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A person shall not give or promise any reward or advantage (other than a reasonable payment for medical services), or by any means cause or threaten to cause any disadvantage, to a medical practitioner or other person for refusing to assist, or for the purpose of compelling or persuading the medical practitioner or other person to assist or refuse to assist, in the termination of a patient's life under this act.

       <para>
        That very provision contemplates that there will be people who will try to use this act for murder and not as a means of alleviating someone's pain. That underlines the difficulties that this legislation presents. The penalty provided is $10,000. If you want to get rid of someone and you give an inducement to a doctor, the most that can happen is that you will be fined up to $10,000.

         The other thing I want to turn my mind to is that the people who will be doing the killing under this act will be doctors. Doctors take a Hippocratic oath to protect life. If we are going to have the sort of thing that is contemplated under this act, wouldn't it be better to leave doctors out and to train up, as it were, licensed killers so that the culture of medicine was not perverted by the culture of death? That is what we ought to be looking for. Perhaps we can have a TAFE course that educates people in the putting down of terminally ill patients so that we have, as it were, a sort of 007 number. That would save the culture of the doctors in this country from being tainted. Speaking for myself, it is a very bad business to expect doctors to put people down.

         I have an emotional reaction to this. I have probably got a bit weak in this respect. I have an emotional reaction to seeing anything put down. I remember Dulcify, a great thoroughbred, being put down in the straight at Flemington. A canvas covering was put around the horse and it was put down. I would hate to see a doctor required to do that to people. If we are going to put a canvas covering around people and put them down when they feel under the pressure of extreme pain that they want to depart this life, why shouldn't we have, as it were, a band of people specially trained for the purpose? That way, the profession, which I have a daughter studying for now, will be kept clean of this necessity—and it will become a necessity for her in years to come if this develops the way some people hope. She will be expected to join in on this sort of thing.

         Let us be clear about it: if this is going to be a democratic provision, then it should be available to everybody, no matter where they are. If there are only two doctors in a town, why shouldn't a person who wants to be put down under this act be put down with the compliance of those two people? If we do not expect them to do it, what sort of democracy is behind this? Is this an act of parliament that is providing for people in big towns only, only if they are suffering certain conditions, only if they can find two doctors to do it and, in certain circumstances, only if there is an interpreter present?

         This is talked about as being a free and democratic act. Even if we take the principles of people who approve of this act, have honourable senators ever seen anything so confined, so undemocratic and so perverted almost that it applies only to certain people and to certain people who are able to get two doctors to go through a list of things that are provided for? It is an act that is difficult to justify under any principle that we, as a democratic society, would see as appropriate.

         In the end it comes down to this: certainly legislation can change from time to time in relation to acts that constitute murder. But surely to goodness if the whole world, except the Northern Territory, considers that the acts it now takes out of the category of murderous acts should still be in a category of murderous acts, then we have something to worry about. Even given that the Northern Territory is no doubt one of the most outstanding, astute and intellectually attuned legislatures in the world, it is just so strange that no other legislature throughout this universe has gone down the same path. Perhaps I would be forgiven for concluding that we, as policy makers, ought to preserve the situation as it now is—in my view, always—but, even as legislators, we should at least preserve the situation until a lot more evidence and learning is brought forward into public debate.

         —I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate and I congratulate Senator Cooney for his contribution. Euthanasia is currently a popular topic for discussion and, as a result, there is a need to inject a degree of maturity, sensitivity and intellect into this matter which concentrates on the ethics rather than simple slogans. We need definition and we need full extrapolation of the potential consequences of any change. We also need to define the value of human life and, indeed, its very meaning. In short, the topic is very deep.

         Firstly, what does euthanasia mean? The
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Macquarie Dictionary
         </emphasis>
         tells me that it means a painless death. I am sure that only a sadist would disagree with such a sentiment. But the debate is not only about a painless death. The dictionary also tells me that active euthanasia means `the deliberate bringing about of the death of the person suffering from an incurable disease or condition, as by administering a lethal drug or withdrawing of existing life-supporting treatments.' I believe that those definitions are wrong in their current usage because it has always been the right of a person to reject medical treatment and, in a discussion of euthanasia, I do not think it is proper to introduce that aspect. Everybody has that right and there is no difficulty in exercising that right.

         However, as the community is now discussing euthanasia, I believe that it is commonly defined as the intentional taking of life of a person who requests it for compassionate motives. Some would seek to define euthanasia on a broader basis, others on a narrower basis. Until there is a specific definition, we will vary as to what we are actually talking about. Some naively define euthanasia as providing medical help to a peaceful death. Whilst possibly technically correct, from the Greek basis of the word euthanasia, I do not believe it defines the topic of the debate. I have no opposition to a practice of providing medical help to assist somebody to a peaceful death. But I do not view medical help as meaning intentionally killing the person. There is a substantial difference between medical help and intentionally killing a person, and I echo the sentiments of Senator Cooney in that regard.

         When we talk about the meaning of life, and things of that nature, one's personal faith and views on life clearly come into play. I make no apology or retreat in any way from the fact that my faith convicts me that human life is intrinsically valuable. It is a gift from God. It is His creation and I believe in the sanctity of human life. It is my view that in His wisdom He determines when life commences and ends for each one of us. To involve ourselves in that process is to embrace a most onerous responsibility. Sometimes we must make those difficult judgments; for example, in times of war or in self-defence, where a judgment has to be made. But just because those judgments have to be made, and sometimes acted upon, that of itself does not devalue human life or somehow make it expendable. The concept of human life being worthless or expendable is anathema to every instinct within me, hence my opposition to the death penalty, abortion on demand and euthanasia as killing the dying, as it is commonly called.

         Whilst I accept that not all my fellow Australians would necessarily share my particular faith or beliefs, I believe that my values in this area would be generally embraced. As I understand it, every major religion in the world places value on human life. Indeed, our own indigenous people give human life a great degree of sanctity. I refer people who may be interested to the excellent contribution of my colleague Senator Boswell in this debate last week where he quoted certain Aboriginal elders and communities in relation to this matter.

         For the purposes of today's debate, I will consider euthanasia as meaning the intentional taking of the life of a person who requests it and who is terminally ill. I acknowledge that that definition may not necessarily be accepted by everybody but I believe that in general terms it defines what the discussion is all about. I think it is a pretty narrow definition when we listen to some of the contributions that have been made. But even with this narrow definition, there are very real problems. The definition has three elements. The first two are the preconditions for the third, or the act of killing. Firstly, one needs the person's request or agreement; secondly, one needs the confirmation that someone is terminally ill. If those two preconditions are in existence, one can then move to terminate that person's life.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Those two preconditions require definition in themselves. How do we define a request? What if the person changes their mind but is unable to communicate the change? What if the request is the product of a mentally ill or depressed mind? Terminally ill people are often also clinically depressed. What if people are only clinically depressed and want to be relieved of life? If somebody stands on top of the Tasman Bridge, for example, in my home state of Tasmania and says, `Please help me to commit suicide,' only on the basis of a mental illness or a desire to be relieved from the tragedy of life, do I then assist and say that I was assisting this person to exercise their democratic right? Do I help someone commit suicide? I would like to think that in a civilised society I would not do so.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We then move to the other precondition. How do we define `terminally ill'? As I understand it, in the Northern Territory legislation one needs two doctors to make that finding. But what is terminally ill? Does a person have only six months to live, three months to live or 24 hours to live? What is a terminal illness? Often we do not know. The only thing we can be sure of is that from the day of our birth we are afflicted with the certainty of death, but when it will come upon us none of us know. I know that as a lawyer I exercise my best judgment from time to time and try to advise my clients. I have been in situations where I have advised a client of a certain course of action. In one case, we then moved to the registrar of the court who in fact had the same view that I had privately advised my client of. So we had two legal opinions saying to somebody, `This is going to be the outcome if you proceed to court.' Because of the insistence of my client, we in fact went to court and, to a certain extent to my embarrassment but also to my delight, we won the case. The judge had a different opinion from me and the registrar.

         I was sharing that view with Senator Cooney and others at a committee hearing the other day and Senator Cooney was gracious enough to provide a similar example from his legal career which highlighted the same point. He said to somebody, `Look, you've got no hope of winning.' The client insisted that they went to the High Court and they won. The best judgment of two doctors may well be wrong. I believe it would be a great mistake to allow two people to make such a determination.

         Doctors are committed to life and they allegedly subscribe to the Hippocratic oath to which Senator Cooney refers. A section of the oath says:

        These words are very powerful. As doctors and as people in the field of medicine, doctors should not be engaged in activities which are clearly a breach of the Hippocratic oath. If doctors do engage in these activities they will undermine the culture of the medical profession for centuries and centuries. The decision of a person to refuse medical intervention is an appropriate decision which each and every person is entitled to make, but such a decision is a red herring in relation to this debate. In public debate, we frequently hear about the rights and the choices of the individual and it is said that these considerations are somehow paramount. Personal autonomy is an important consideration and it is one to which I am overwhelmingly committed. However, I also accept that the principle of personal autonomy, while worthy of support, must be appropriately balanced if we are to protect the moral structure of our society.

         The sloganeering of autonomy, choice and rights without corollary and without countervailing responsibilities results in a self-centred perspective and in the ultimate destruction of a shared future and a view of society. For example, to exercise our autonomy by driving on the wrong side of the road impinges on the rights of others. Similarly, we as a society need to make a positive choice in favour of protecting the interests of the vulnerable members of society, even if this action has the unfortunate result of limiting the freedom of others. Whilst I submit that it is acceptable for a patient to exercise his or her right to refuse medical treatment, it must remain unacceptable for a patient to request to have his or her life intentionally terminated. There are two reasons which spring to mind. Firstly, exercising the patient's autonomy may well impinge on the autonomy of a doctor who may not wish to carry out that request. Secondly, there is the culture of doctors that they should provide such medical treatment as requested by patients. What about that culture?

A civilised society should do nothing to make the elderly, sick and disabled feel unwanted.

         In rejecting so-called euthanasia, we must enhance the need to fully provide for the adequate development and growth of palliative care services in hospices, hospitals and in the community. I am reminded by an article in the

The greatness of her witness and her compassionate work is not that she goes around with a lethal injection saying, `You poor person. Your life is no longer worth living. I will put you out of your misery.' The greatness of her witness and her compassionate work is that she provides succour and comfort to these people and that she allows them to die with dignity and on the basis of knowing that their life, no matter how socially or economically deprived it may have been, was worth living.

         Firstly, I address the issue of choice. One of the key phrases in this debate is the phrase `dying with dignity'. This is a very important issue. Let me suggest what dying with dignity means. It does mean not to have life prolonged mechanically and unnecessarily. It does mean managing pain so that a person's quality of life is not so diminished as to be unbearable. It does mean providing the kind of care which enables a person who is dying to know that they are part of a loving concerned community.

         Let me now examine these meanings in terms of this debate and against the background of any proposed legislation. I believe that the mechanical prolonging of life is not an issue in this debate. Legislation would not clarify that for us at all. The community accepts that life should not be prolonged artificially and that normally is the practice. I think it is overstated and so often used to illustrate that, somehow or other, the projection is that there are hundreds of instances of life being prolonged artificially. That is not normally what happens. The choice not to prolong life artificially is already available to us. In fact, I believe legislation would take away that choice or at least lessen it.

         On the issue of pain and care for people who are dying, let me suggest that to legislate to provide for euthanasia would mean that the community would no longer need to provide care or seek to relieve pain because legislation would provide an easy way out. We would simply terminate the person's life. There is no incentive to provide palliative care if, in fact, it is much simpler to terminate the life of the person.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I understand that this is one of the issues in the Northern Territory. The very lack of palliative care in the Northern Territory is one of the incentives, I believe, for having this legislation passed. The problems of funding and of providing places where such care could be provided seem more simply solved by legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another issue in terms of choice is the whole issue of the right to choose. We must ask ourselves what we mean by that. What is the cut-off point in terms of the right to choose? We usually debate euthanasia in terms of the aged and in terms of their pain and suffering, but it is the same principle when we talk about euthanasia for a person who is 10, 20 or 30. We are horrified at the thought that people of that age may have the right to choose because, quite rightly, we would say that is not euthanasia, it is suicide.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         By and large, this community rightly prohibits suicide, but if we want to talk about the right to choose then that is the principle we are really debating. We often avoid that by projecting euthanasia as being about aged people dying with care, but the principle of the right to choose is a principle about suicide and we need to put that very squarely in this debate. If the age category is taken away then the principle we are debating is our attitude to suicide.

         Let me talk a little about the effect of such legislation. Senator Cooney and Senator Abetz probably dealt with this more ably than I can, because of their legal background, but I think it is worth reinforcing what they said nevertheless. I understand that in the Netherlands the practice has far exceeded the narrow limits of the legislation, and that is the problem of any legislation. So often, legislation extends the limits of community permission. Once we legislate, the practice goes far beyond the point at which we would want to say, `That is as far as we can go.' An example of this is the debate about consumption of alcohol. I can remember when the minimum age for alcohol consumption was 21, and the community was worried that 18- and 19-year-olds were abusing alcohol. The problem is that having lowered the minimum age for the consumption of alcohol to 18, we are now having a debate about 15- and 16-year-olds abusing alcohol. From that, we can see what happens when we legislate; and I believe that analogy applies in this instance as well.

         There is the practice of treating pain with morphine, which all GPs know about. Occasionally they administer more than is necessary to treat the person, perhaps in order to hasten death; but let me say that practice is in the context of treatment, not as a means as taking life, and I believe that there is a big difference in principle in that. Also, it is without the legislative incentive.

         Another issue in this whole debate is the balance that there always needs to be between community pressure and the human rights of the individual. I know that we usually say that euthanasia is about the right of the individual to choose, and that sounds reasonable. I want to ask the Senate and the people of Australia: is it really about the right of the individual to choose?

         Let me suggest that an individual in the situation which we usually project in this debate is in a very inferior and vulnerable position, and that in the end it is not a choice for the individual at all. What do old people do if they are told, and constantly made to feel, that they are a burden to the family or to nursing staff? Surely their ability to choose in that situation hardly exists at all. What happens to old people in cases where relatives want to get their hands on the estate? Before people say that would never happen, let me say that there are recorded cases of pressure being put upon persons and pressure being put upon doctors to terminate life simply because of the greed of family members.

         And what happens when there is a pressure on hospital and nursing beds? That pressure is becoming more and more acute. What will happen to that pressure when euthanasia is legalised? Will it not then simply become a part of the management practice to facilitate the flow-through of patients in hospitals and nursing homes? What starts as a human right of the individual to choose will become the right of others to manage their institution efficiently.

         The final issue in the whole debate about euthanasia is the brutalisation of the community. Once the human rights of one person are threatened, the rights of all are threatened. I disagree with some details of the Pope's recent encyclical, but not with the theme. He is right when he says that there is a culture of death abroad in our world. There are many pressures and many things which contribute to that culture of death. A culture in which human beings are simply expendable for all kinds of reasons is alive and well, and to make euthanasia legal would simply reinforce that culture of death.

         Today I am pleased to be standing with my colleagues here in the Senate representing all sides of parliament, all parties and representing the great spectrum of Australian community. I believe this is an indication of the cross-community resistance to legalised killing, whether that killing results from a compassionate motive or a belief in an individual autonomous right. Euthanasia is not simply a state issue, its scope and nature demand a response from the federal parliamentarians and other community leaders. In addition, the Commonwealth Medicare program would be involved in euthanasia death, as confirmed by Senator Crowley in responding to my question some time ago. Medicare funding agreements, rebates and pharmaceutical benefits would subsidise the killings.

         A roadworthiness certificate has more formal signing requirements than a request to end a human life. Firstly, a roadworthiness certificate has a unique number. The approved examiner has a licence number which must be quoted. It is dated all over the place and the address is clearly stated, together with its own approval number. Moreover, the approved examiner must certify that the provisions of the relevant act have been complied with. The euthanasia schedule demands no such certification from the patient's medical practitioner. The second medical practitioner is required merely to be `satisfied that the conditions of section 7 of the act have or will be complied with'. Surely the disposal of human life demands more formal procedures than the disposal of a used motor vehicle!

         I cannot believe that such a document will stand up in a court of law. Witnessing officers to a mortgage document must provide a signature, print their full names and describe their qualifications and the date of the document. Where a will is typed on more than one sheet of paper, it is a usual and desirable practice to have the foot of each page signed by the testator and the witnesses to counter a fraudulent attempt to interpolate pages into the document. Unless the request to end life is supervised by a solicitor, will this practice be followed, and will there be careful checking of signatures and dates?

         I understand the Northern Territory's desire to simplify a form for an ill patient, but it is life we are talking about and that demands the utmost care, scrutiny, safeguards and formal witnessing procedures. John K. De Groot's

         advises that `for future identification purposes, if necessary, both witnesses should print their names, occupations, and addresses after their signatures.' There is nothing on the request to end life form which would suggest the witnesses do this. The request form is integral to the euthanasia practice. No matter what else is said and done in the act or anywhere else, it is this form that is at the centre. If it fails to withstand legal scrutiny, then the act will be fatally flawed.

I am not a lawyer. There were two lawyers in this debate and there are many here in the parliament.

         I want to say to the 13 politicians in the Northern Territory, `What have you done?' Those 13 politicians in the Northern Territory have, for the first time, legalised by act of parliament the deliberate and intentional killing of one innocent human being by another. That is a first; that is a world first. Stripped of all its euphemism, euthanasia occurs, in the medical context, when the doctor and not the illness kills the patient. Those 13 politicians, by their decision, have legalised the lethal injection. At a time when civilised country after civilised country is abolishing the death penalty, when those of us in Amnesty are trying to get others to abolish the death penalty, those politicians have installed in the law a licence to kill. At a time when political, medical and community concern about suicide abounds, they have legalised assisted suicide and thus promoted a culture of death.

Oh, yes, they set up a committee in February of this year to receive submissions and that committee reported in May of this year, a mere three months later—with the Easter break intervening, of course. And what did that committee report? It merely reported the views of those who made the submissions—no, not the detailed House of Lords report, nothing like that; instead, something, in my view, done in indecent haste.

         No-one has the copyright on compassion. Compassion really does mean suffering with a person, not putting a person to death. In this utilitarian, excessively individualist and hedonistic society which appears to be descending upon us the value of suffering for personal growth and for the opportunity to love and serve is ignored. Anyone whose wife has died in his arms of cancer and whose mother, an Alzheimer's sufferer some years later, also died in his arms realises the importance of suffering with a person. Sometimes that realisation comes too late. But what you do know when that happens is that the person with whom life and love have been intimately shared your life does not go out of existence—does not die like a dog. That person who has shared abstract thoughts and ideas not associated in any way with corruptible matter does not die like a dog.

I believe it will be the marginalised, the sick,  frail aged and those who have lost self-esteem or whose society does not affirm their esteem. A recent study of clinical trials of new drugs has shown that most of the human subjects of the trials are those very persons. It does not address the question of fear of death and the need to inculcate the importance of experiencing death as part of life.

Obviously, this legislation will not be implemented in a social vacuum, free from social pressures or familial pressures or from the financial pressures that were described by Senator Woodley. It is important to have educative programs in which persons can understand the difference between euthanasia and the treatment for pain and palliative care. Palliative care, as Senator Woodley said, is going to be the loser. There should be education of doctors and, more particularly, of families as to what morphine and other drugs might do, but this has to be handled extremely carefully.

On that inviolability rests the equality and dignity of each human being and the edifice of law which protects that life and advances that person's benefit. From that inviolability flows the human solidarity needed to achieve justice for all human beings—the reverse of the legislation whereby the value of life is eclipsed and a culture of death is inculcated.

         The Universal Declaration of Human Rights makes two rights inviolable: the right to life and the right to liberty. The state will not condone people selling themselves as slaves. The cornerstone of any body politic is to ensure that the right to life is inviolable. The real purpose of civil law is to guarantee an ordered social coexistence in true justice. The principal function of a law-maker is to safeguard the inviolable right to life of the human person and to facilitate the performance of his or her duties. I believe that those 13 members of the Northern Territory parliament have done great disservice to the body politic.

Senator Hill has deliberately in his question tried to distort that report by selectively extracting one negative feature and does not like the fact that Senator Cook is going to outline all the positive elements. Nevertheless, the proper understanding of the point which he has made requires recognition of all the others.

Those things are recognised by the OECD as positive things. Indeed, if you read the report, the OECD counsels the rest of the world to do those things. Australia leads in taking those measures.

         But what else do we find in the OECD report? Australia has the highest level of economic growth in the OECD. It stands to reason, given the inheritance we got when we came into power, that we needed to open the economy, encourage greater international competitiveness by Australian industry and engage in a broadening of the base of our exports, that we would go through a period of transition as we internationalised the economy.

         If you do not do that, if you want to turn this budget from being in surplus to in deficit by unmaking the budget bills and if you want to remove the downward pressure we have placed on interest rates by creating uncertainty, you will be responsible for undermining the Australian economy. It is an exercise in gross hypocrisy for the coalition—in fact, it is an exercise in misleading the Australian community—to wax lyrical about concerns never in context and never realistically or accurately expressed but, when it comes to action, to have no policies and engage in what amounts to a sabotage of an attempt by the government to correct the current account deficit and have a level of national savings and a budget surplus which would reassure the markets in the appropriate way. To some extent, the answer to this problem lies with the opposition in backing the government's move to lower the current account deficit.

Senator McMullan invites me to refer to other aspects of the economy as reported upon by the OECD. Minister, isn't it the case that the OECD has now, from last month, revised down Australia's growth forecast, revised up Australia's inflation expectation and revised upward our unemployment expectations? And aren't we back on the same old roller-coaster: growth, recession—as we have seen in the past—excessive spending, unsustainable growth, a blow-out in the current account deficit, rising interest rates and rising unemployment?

The OECD forecasts are calendar year forecasts, and if you take account of calendar year forecasts and compare them to our budget forecast, which is a financial year forecast, the truth is that both levels of forecast are broadly similar. In our budget forecast, we have said that growth this year is moderating—moderating from a high level to a more sustainable level so we can have a regular, consistent and sustainable level of economic growth and reduce unemployment in this country.

         I can say a lot more about the OECD forecast based on scenarios, rather than forecasts, in terms of unemployment, and not take into account other factors that are important to that subject. But in the end what we have had from Senator Hill is a trotting out of `you wish' scenarios by the opposition, which fundamentally believes that if it undermines the Australian economy, its electoral stocks will increase. The response of Australians to that will be to not vote for the saboteurs.

The act enabled the boundaries of the largest marine park in the world to be declared. It also established the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which began the process of developing zoning and management plans which have become models for the management of marine protected areas world wide.

         The act banned mining and oil exploration within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and enabled the marine park to be zoned and managed for ecologically sustainable use. The Great Barrier Reef was inscribed in the world heritage list in 1981 in recognition of its universal, cultural and natural value. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has provided for the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Reef, with a major focus on working cooperatively with the Queensland government, other government agencies, interest groups and the wider Australian community to ensure the active commitment of all stakeholders to the sustainable use of the reef. An active and comprehensive program of public participation, which is recognised in the act, is a key feature of the marine park authority's planning and management approach. This effective public involvement in the planning processes has resulted in a higher level of community acceptance of management decisions.

         Understanding and commitment of reef users to ecologically sustainable use of the Great Barrier Reef continues to be the most effective means of ensuring that the reef remains the best example of a multiuse marine protected area. The reef contributes more than $1 billion per year to the Australian economy through activities such as tourism and commercial fishing. Use of the reef is expected to increase considerably, as is the economic benefit that is generated by this use. The marine park authority is addressing the issue of the resulting increase in environmental impact through its current management practices and forward looking plans. Last year the visionary 25-year strategic plan for the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area was launched by the Prime Minister and is now being implemented by the various stakeholder groups.

The strategic plan is acknowledged as a world first in participative regional planning. I think it is fair to say to Senator Reynolds in response to her question that we celebrate 20 years of partnership in managing the Great Barrier Reef. I think we can also be confident that the Great Barrier Reef will be protected for the benefit of future generations.

         The OECD considers that the economic situation in most member countries remains good, although the OECD is now projecting a marginally lower recovery in the OECD region than expected six months ago.

         First, it should be noted that the OECD forecasts are consistent with the budget forecasts. The former are on a calendar year basis while our budget is based, of course, on the Australian financial year. Real GDP growth estimates for 1995 and 1996 are 3.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. This is above expected growth of the total OECD, which is 2.7 per cent for both years. So Australia is enjoying among the highest growth rates in the OECD.

         As for employment, in 1994 Australia's employment creation was more than three times stronger than the employment growth achieved by the whole OECD. For 1995 and 1996 employment growth is expected to be more than twice as fast in Australia as in the OECD as a whole. That means 225,000 new jobs in 1995—almost the number John Howard achieved over five years—five very long years!

         Yesterday I talked about the strength of business investment in Australia. The international comparisons make that performance look even more outstanding. The actual outcomes for 1994 show that Australia's business investment grew by 17 per cent compared to the OECD average of 5.2 per cent. In 1995 the forecast for Australia is for 14 per cent growth compared to the OECD forecast average of 9.1 per cent.

         I note that some commentators today have picked up on the implications of strong output, employment and inflation growth for inflation. It is worth setting out what the OECD `s actual analysis was. The report states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An important factor underpinning the high growth in domestic demand during the past year has been the strength of business investment, which grew by around 17 per cent in 1994 and was fuelled by high and rising rates of capacity utilisation and improved balance sheet positions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The analysis then points out that strong growth has reduced spare capacity in the economy and there is considerable uncertainty about how much spare capacity now remains. It then says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As spare capacity of both capital and labour is used up, continued strong growth would tend to create inflationary pressures.
       </para>
       <para>
        But—and this is the critical point—the report acknowledges that the government and the Reserve Bank have acted to forestall the risk of overheating by tightening monetary policy and by delivering a significant improvement in the budget balance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government believes there is still considerable extra supply capacity in the economy and that micro-economic reform has increased the efficiency of current capital. The import figures yesterday point to continuing import of capital equipment which is continuing to expand our capital capacity. On the human resources side, the government has implemented an unprecedented program of skill development in Working Nation which is actively adding to the supply of skilled labour in the economy. So I think we can say that in the proper context, set against the rest of the peer group economies to which we compare ourselves, the Australian economy is performing better than most.

Based on your last answer, do you agree that the higher inflation predicted by the survey for next year will also lead to higher interest rates? Don't we already have the highest interest rates in the OECD because of the government's failure to address recurring current account problems over the last 10 years?

I commend it to you, Senator Kernot, and to the opposition. We do not have the highest interest rates in the OECD. That is exhibit 1, as proof of that. The OECD suggests some further tightening of monetary policy may be needed because the OECD's estimate of the output gap suggests that little or no slack remains in the economy. With unemployment at about 8 1/2 per cent and continuing solid investment growth, the government believes there is considerable extra supply capacity in the economy.

         The OECD's output gap measure, like other static measures of excess capacity, also does not take account of the dynamic influences which can affect the amount of spare capacity in the economy. For example, in Australia a decade of micro-economic reform has improved the way in which we use labour and capital resources and therefore the responsiveness with which the supply capacity in the economy can respond to increasing demand.

         Nevertheless, the government and the Reserve Bank remain ready to act decisively if necessary to address excessive inflationary pressures as growth continues. Monetary policy is not set in a mechanical way in response to any one indicator such as capacity utilisation. The Reserve Bank and the government set monetary policy in a forward looking way, taking into account a wide range of indicators of future inflationary pressures. The government has been very successful in reducing inflation and business and consumer inflation expectations from the high levels seen over the past two decades.

         The underlying inflation rate of 1.9 per cent through the year to the March quarter 1995 continues to show there is a lack of generalised inflationary pressures in the economy. Monetary policy will remain on guard to ensure that any future rise in inflationary pressures does not become entrenched in rising inflationary expectations.

         So in snapshot, let me conclude by saying that we do not accept necessarily that view of the OECD because it does not take account of the extra facility and the extra efficiencies with which we utilise the resources we have by virtue of the micro-economic reform and the labour market reform programs in which we have engaged. If you go from that point, I think you will agree, Senator Kernot, that the rest of your question falls to the ground. Having corrected the last part of it, on the question of interest rates, the whole of the question, with the greatest respect to you, should fall to the ground as well.

Let me answer it by saying that what the market which deals with interest rates is pleased to see is a government which has moved its budget into surplus, which has a medium-term national savings plan and which is addressing these problems. What you are trying to do is cover yourself with an alibi that you will not be responsible if you remove the downward pressure on interest rates placed on interest rates by our budget. If you interfere with the budget, wreck the budget, remove that downward pressure on interest rates, I have to tell you, Senator Kernot, that you and John Howard will both be responsible for an interest rate rise on Australian home loans. That is what you will be responsible for. No amount of alibis by you will escape that fact. According to the principles of the OECD in its report, this budget has in place the right mechanisms to reduce that pressure.

         today, because his support for the priority of this policy is a clear indication to the Australian public and the Australian business community of how important this policy is and the priority that Australia gives to the question of trade policy. I do not pretend that trade policy will by itself be a medium-term strategy to resolve the current account deficit. It needs the other three elements that Senator Cook related to: the macro policy, micro policy and industry policy elements. Those four elements need to come together. This is an important fourth element. Therefore, I am very pleased that it has come out today.

         This is a key element of dealing with the current account deficit in the medium term. People prattle about it, but those who think about it know that the decisions which affect the status of next year's current account deficit to a great extent have already been made. These things change very slowly, and necessarily so. Taking new investment on stream takes a long time. The import replacement proposals take a long time, as do changes in demand. A lot of the capital equipment that will come in next year has already been ordered. So the flows of imports and exports will not be changed dramatically over the next 12 months. Over the rest of this decade there is a chance to make a substantial change to it.

         I would like to talk about some of the more particular short-term initiatives to help Australian businesses succeed in their international efforts. For example, there is the proposal of Austrade to enhance and streamline its client service policy. The private sector continues to tell me that it believes the reformed Austrade is a great asset to it in its export capacity. In fact, many opposition as well as government senators who travel overseas come back with positive reports about the role of Austrade in the posts which they visit. That is correct. We are trying to improve the services that we supply and make better use of taxpayers' money. We want to target it particularly to the new and potential exporters and the small and medium enterprises that we are trying to attract into export.

         was the extent to which small business, particularly in the outlying states—Tasmania and Western Australia—but also in Victoria and Queensland, raised a concern about the problems of the supply of air freight; that it was not available reliably and at a competitive price. With the changing pattern of Australian exports and the capacity to export into niche markets, particularly in overnight products like fresh foods, et cetera, air freight becomes particularly important.

         We have asked for an inquiry—there will be one—into air freight. We want to know whether there are any systemic deficiencies in the supply of it—for example, whether the way that passenger air services are regulated is contributing in some way to the supply problems in air freight. That is an important initiative that will be welcomed by many in small business. They are particularly concerned. There is a proposal for an export barriers reporting scheme, which many businesses asked us for.

I refer to Attorney-General Lavarch's commitment to fund Ms Carmen Lawrence's costs of challenging the validity of the Western Australian royal commission into the Penny Easton tragedy. As the royal commission is inquiring into an incident prior—I repeat the word `prior'—to Dr Lawrence's becoming a member of federal parliament, let alone a minister, is there any precedent for funding on this basis? Given that Dr Lawrence said that she was prepared to take this matter as far as the High Court at the possible cost of hundreds of thousands of Australian taxpayer dollars, has any limit been placed on how much the Commonwealth is prepared to spend? If so, how much is it?

He is being asked how much, and he is being asked about precedents for funding when the matter did not arise in relation to federal duties. They are very specific and narrow matters.

In terms of the amount, I will take that question to the Attorney-General to see whether anything has been contemplated in that respect, but my understanding is that when assistance is given in these sorts of actions it is for a purpose rather than an amount.

         Commonwealth attorneys-general from time to time have always got involved in matters that raise questions of constitutional importance. In fact, it was only in 1993 that the federal government got involved in the matter of Stephens and Theophanous, which dealt with whether the defamation laws of a state were subject to an implied constitutional right of political speech. They were matters arising from state law. There have been other matters before; there have been other matters since.

Secondly, if there were no constitutional issues raised, matters like this would probably not have given Mr Court the footing on which to base this inquiry. I say to Senator Panizza once again: listen to the words of Hendy Cowan, the deputy premier of Western Australia, when he says that this is an exercise in politics and for that reason the inquiry should be damned before it starts.

That means that with increasing access to new technology and more efficient ways of managing change there is downward pressure on employment numbers in the Commonwealth. That is appropriate because Australian taxpayers clearly do not want to pay for inefficient government delivery of services and inefficient provision of programs.

         Therefore, this Commonwealth government has always been concerned at finding the most productive way of delivering those services. I will check these figures because I want to be absolutely sure in giving Senator Harradine an answer, but as I understand it in terms of the Commonwealth public service the result has been not to put people out of work but, rather, to not to fill positions when they become vacant and thus shrink the size of the public sector in comparison with that of the rest of the economy.

         Surprisingly, I saw one headline in a reputable national paper which sort of suggested that he had said `upward pressure on interest rates'. If you actually look at what he said, you will see that that is not what he said at all. While the headline blared that, the body of the article did not actually report that and the specialist commentary in a box in italics alongside that article by the economics writer did not support it either. So one has to be very careful to actually read exactly what he says and understand the gravity of his meaning.

It just so happens that I have some figures of comparison here. Comparing the coalition to the government, when Mr Howard, who was Treasurer for most of the period of the Fraser government, left office, the bank housing loan rate was at 12.5 per cent. What is the current bank housing loan rate? It is 10.5 per cent. How do we compare with the coalition? A damn sight better!

         When Mr Howard was Treasurer and left office, the prime rate was 15.75 per cent. The current prime interest rate is 10.7 per cent.

        This question has been with the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) for some considerable period of time now. The minister refers to `complex questions'. They simply are not complex, they are not detailed and they are matters which ought to be available very easily.

         The first question was: what is the name, designation, office location and remuneration of each member of staff for the Ministerial Media Group and the National Media Liaison Service as at 13 March 1995? I would have thought that at least that part of the answer could have been provided without any difficulty whatsoever. The second question was: which staff members are permanent public servants and what was each person's level prior to taking up their present position? I would not have thought that is exactly a complex question requiring a complex answer. I would have thought that the minister and the department would have been able to provide a response very quickly to that one as well.

         The third question was: what is the entitlement of each staff member for telephone or car allowance, Commonwealth car for personal uses, and any other entitlements? I would have thought that that answer also would have been readily available to the department and to the minister. The fourth question I asked was: in relation to ex-ministerial staff members who have been employed with either the National Media Liaison Service or the Ministerial Media Group since January 1 1990, what was their name, ministerial designation, remuneration—including overtime allowances, Public Service status and termination payment received on termination of ministerial employment—and what was their designation, office location, remuneration, et cetera?

So the research for seven names of seven people has taken the government some considerable period of time. It is quite clear that each time the opposition asks any questions whatsoever about the National Media Liaison Service, the government seeks to delay and seeks to obfuscate and is most anxious that the truth is not obtained.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question asked by Senator Hill this day, relating to an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report concerning the Australian economy.

       <para>
        I asked the minister why it is that, after 13 years of Labor government, Australia has the worst current account performance in the Western world. Firstly, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) started to talk about the future and said, `We are taking steps to remedy the situation,' which rather avoids the fact that his government has been there for near enough 13 years and is responsible for that situation. So there was no attempt to explain how the economy could be in such a poor state under its control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, Senator Cook blamed the opposition. In some way it was our fault, even though we had been out of government for about 13 years. This issue is critical because the Australian people have every right to judge the government on its performance over such a long period of time. The sad fact is that, when we look at these very serious aspects of the Australian economy, we see that the government's performance has been dismal. We had an estimate in the budget of a $27 billion deficit for next year, on top of a $27 billion deficit for this year. With a current account running at that level, the government will have no alternative but to keep the value of the dollar up. To do that, it will have to keep interest rates up. Whereas they might drop in the short term because of the crash in the housing market, in the longer term there is no other alternative under this set of economic policies than a result of high interest rates. That will be the continuing record of this government.

         As was pointed out in a subsequent question, real interest rates under this government are among the highest in the Western world. Its record of real interest rates is double that of our government's record when last in office. So it is a high interest rate government. The consequence of high interest rates is that it makes it more and more difficult for Australian business to be profitable or to be competitive. That is starting to show up in the OECD report already. We are now seeing a forecast of reducing growth.

         This government told us that to reduce unemployment—and there are still over three-quarters of a million Australians out of work under this government—it would need growth of at least 4.5 per cent a year. In its own budget this year the government forecast growth coming down to 3.75 per cent. When we look at this OECD report, confirmed by the Treasurer, we see that the OECD is now talking about growth of 3.5 per cent. Under this government we have high interest rates, business which is less profitable, growth which is starting to fall and, sadly, later this year, with no alternative to these policies, unemployment which will start to rise again.

         The boom-bust cycle that we have under Labor reminds me of what Professor Sloan warned us of some time ago; that is, as we move through each cycle of recession, when we start moving into the next downturn, we start with an unemployment level much higher than it was at the same point in the last cycle. Sadly, in this instance we are starting in that part of the cycle with over three-quarters of a million Australians still out of work. That is the record of this Labor government.

         To make it worse, the OECD report tells us that inflation is starting to rise again. All the ingredients are there for a deteriorating economic position later this year. Interest rates are rising as a result of these unsustainable current account deficits, inflation is starting to rise, profitability is starting to fall and unemployment is sadly again on the rise. That is the record upon which this government will be judged at the next election, and it is an appalling record. The Australian people will have every right on that performance to throw the government out of office.

         Even today, five years after the onset of the induced recession by then Treasurer Keating—the recession we all say in the popular language of today that Mr Keating said we had to have—we should never let Australians forget that it was the recession that we should never have had to have. The only reason we had that recession was the gross incompetence and mismanagement of the government, of which Mr Keating was the prime economic architect. He was the self-adulatory puller of the levers, the person who had the Treasury and the Reserve Bank in his pocket and the person who said that leadership in Australia was all about having these people in his pocket and pulling levers. He did all of that; he self-admitted it.

         The tragedy today is that five years after the Treasurer pulled those levers in 1990 the number of people in full-time employment in Australia is still less than it was when those levers were first pulled. For half a decade there has been great tragedy and hardship thrust upon the Australian people because of lack of work. We still have not returned to the time when we had full-time employment a long and hard five years ago. We have had pain, pain, pain and no gain.

         The situation, as Senator Hill said, is worse than it was when this government came to office in terms of the starting point for the recovery and the putting of the economy right that is so essential. Unemployment is one, but the other killer—it reflects on our lack of competitiveness—is the foreign debt. We have a situation today where we are still as uncompetitive as we were a decade ago but we have a foreign debt level seven or eight times what it was then. We have a situation where the current account deficit is six per cent of GDP. That is the same level as it was when Mr Keating made his infamous banana republic statement at almost this time in 1986. In that time nothing at all has been done to solve the critical restraining problem that we have in terms of the growth potential of this economy.

         There is an enormous amount that should have been done by proper government policies. As a result of them not happening, we now have—regardless of what Senator Cook tries to thrust down our throats—virtually the highest real interest rates in the world. I am not sure that Senator Cook knows what real interest rates mean, but we do have the highest real interest rates in the world, we have the highest foreign debt in the world and we have every problem and prospect of inflationary pressures, balance of payments pressures and falling exchange rates putting more pressure on interest rates, upward interest rates, recessed growth, back to the old cycle of rising unemployment and a great loss of opportunity to capitalise on the great potential that we have in this country.

        I asked a very simple question at question time today. My basic question was: was there ever a precedent for the federal government to fund a federal minister—or a member for that matter, but in this case I refer to a federal minister—to commence an action to challenge the validity of the WA royal commission into the tragic Penny Easton affair, where we lost a very innocent life?

         I am not talking about something that happened to ministers, members or senators while in this place; it was a prior event. What did I get when I asked the question? I got total abuse. That is the old trick. People do it now and again in this place and elsewhere when they do not have an answer: they start abusing the questioner. That was the only defence Senator Bolkus had today; he abused me because I asked the question. I point out to Senator Bolkus, in his absence—in case he and other members of this chamber did not hear me when I told him this in question time—that I am no-one's lackey. He said today in an interjection about me that Senator Hill was writing questions for his lackey.

         The only defence Senator Bolkus could use, apart from abuse, was Hendy Cowan's statement, a statement he was supposed to have made at some time, that this inquiry was a total waste of time.

I will give Senator Bolkus and both governments a solution: for Dr Carmen Lawrence to come clean on the matter and admit what she did. That is all she has to do. Mr Richard Court said that for well in excess of a fortnight before he called a royal commission. He asked her to come clean and she did not do so, so he went ahead. I say to you, Madam Deputy President, let her come clean on what action she took which cost the life of a very innocent woman who was far removed from politics, who had nothing to do with politics.

I think that there is a principle involved which is of wide application and concern to all senators, in fact to all members of parliament; that is, just how far the government of the day will go in assisting any member or senator in embarking on legal action which might involve the public interest. It seems to be on that basis that the government has made a commitment to undertake to meet Ms Lawrence's legal costs in challenging the validity of the Western Australian royal commission.

         Senator Panizza made a valid point when he said that this was the funding of the commencement of proceedings. It is not as if Carmen Lawrence is being sued or charged in any way; quite the reverse. Senator Bolkus cited the case of Theophanous as a precedent where the government provided funding. That, too, involved a member of parliament taking action about statements that had been made about him in the press. That was an action of defamation. The government, according to Senator Bolkus, saw fit to underwrite those legal costs as well.

         It is quite appropriate in these circumstances for the coalition opposition to question the government as to what guidelines are applied, by what process the government arrived at this decision to spend taxpayers' money in this manner. If there is a policy that ministers and members of parliament are funded in this way, then it should apply equally to members of the opposition and members of other parties. It is not a fund or principle or policy that applies only to ministers or government members; it is something which should apply universally. Therefore, the government should come clean and say, `In this instance we are funding Carmen Lawrence. We will also, in the appropriate circumstances, fund any member from the opposition or the minor parties who finds themselves in the same situation.' We did not get that answer from Senator Bolkus.

         Really, it has little to do with the Penny Easton inquiry. Even if that inquiry was not justified, the government still has to turn its mind to how it is going to address the circumstances in which members of parliament find themselves in these situations. I might add that Carmen Lawrence was not a member of the other place when this whole matter arose. In fact, it was prior to her coming to federal parliament. That is something that I would like the government to address as well when applying this policy or these guidelines. Will it also fund instances where a member of parliament has to answer for something which he or she did prior to coming into parliament?

The taxpayers have a right to know in these instances how their money is going to be applied, how these decisions are going to be arrived at. As well, the Senate and the other place need to know just what the government will do in any given situation. That is the crucial aspect.

In other words, I think consideration should be given to assisting people who, because of their political work, are sued, and that should go right across the board.

         Senator Panizza has raised a very important point. Senator McKiernan took him up on a point which I do not think Senator Panizza intended to come out in the way it did. Where taxpayers' money goes to paying for a commission such as the Marks commission in Western Australia, where taxpayers' money goes to erecting a commission against a person who sits in this parliament, there is a good basis for this parliament replying to that by paying the costs of the person who is put in that position—in this case, the member for Fremantle, Dr Lawrence. But I agree with Senator Ellison that that principle should be applied across the chamber and should apply to every party. If a member of parliament—I have said this before, as has Senator Ellison—is put in this position, consideration ought to be given to paying the costs of that person.

         I wish to say a few words in light of what Senator Panizza said. He said that Dr Lawrence should be frank about the matter. But the only answer that would satisfy him and Mr Court is for her to admit what she is accused by the government of doing. Of course, that is the whole point—she denies that position and it is for that reason that the royal commission has been set up. Why do Mr Court and Senator Panizza not accept what Dr Lawrence says? She says that there was nothing to this. Why does the Liberal Party in Western Australia, represented by Mr Court, not accept what Dr Lawrence says? Then you would not need to have this commission. The very fact that she has made this denial has led to this publicly funded commission.

         If political action is taken against her which is publicly funded, why is it wrong for her to resist that with public funds? If Mr Court had financed this action himself, I would be the first to say that Dr Lawrence should finance her defence herself. But once a political action is taken which is publicly funded, then public funds should follow right through. That is consistent with what Senator Ellison said. So what I say is, yes, there is a lot of merit in what Senator Panizza says, but he must apply the principles that he has put forward not only to Dr Lawrence but to Mr Court. Let us be fair and consistent. We are not being consistent by giving public funds to a political prosecution and not giving public funds for a political defence.

         —I will continue my remarks on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995. I contend that this levy not only looks like a tax; it operates like a tax and has all the characteristics of a tax, other than the name given to it by this government. This levy takes money from the pockets of Australians to pay for a government program. It is a tax, and it is appropriate that it should be debated jointly with the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995.

         The government claimed that the Medicare tax was introduced to offset the government's expenditure on Medicare. Even from day one, this tax could not offset the cost of Medicare. In fact, it could not go anywhere near covering that cost. It still does not. I note from the budget papers that the levy is expected to bring in $3.6 billion next year—up $560 million from this current financial year. We should compare that with the total expenditure by the Commonwealth on health of $18.4 billion.

         A former minister, Dr Blewett, claimed in 1983 that Medicare would be substantially self-funding through the one per cent levy. By August 1986, however, the government moved to increase the levy by 25 per cent to 1.25 per cent. At the time, it was claimed that this increase was the most equitable way of dealing with the increasing costs of the health system, even though the government also argued that the cost of health outlays had increased only in line with inflation.

         We were therefore in a situation in 1986 of this Labor government continuing to urge the view that the Medicare system would be self-funded provided the rate at which we were required to contribute to the scheme via taxes was increased by 25 per cent. At that time we were again told there would be no need to increase the rate further. In fact, during the period 1983 to 1986, the community was told ad nauseam that there would be no need to raise the rate of the Medicare tax.

         We all now know that the rate did go up again. In 1993, after the federal election, and after the people thought they were voting for a Medicare tax of 1.25 per cent, this government raised the tax to 1.4 per cent. We had heard all the denials before the election about this rate going up. Only under the coalition, it was said by the Labor Party, would health care costs increase. Fear and deception were the Labor Party's principles in February 1993.

         Nevertheless, when the economic mismanagement of the government left the cupboard bare, it reached for the only fiscal lever the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, really understands. It increased taxes on the people of Australia. In the process, it raised the Medicare tax.

         That was two years ago. Today, we are debating a bill that will see the Medicare tax increased again and, along with it, the rate of the fringe benefits tax. Not unexpectedly, and almost naturally, Australians have heard over the past 12 months the very highest acolytes of the Labor Party deny that there would need to be an increase in the Medicare tax. On 19 June last year, the recently installed Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), with a passion, declared:

         What Australian's may have forgotten is that this was a pledge by a minister in the government of Paul Keating. As a consequence, this was a pledge made for and on behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Sadly, as all Australians now know, any pledge, any promise, any commitment from Mr Keating is worth less than the Australian dollar, is as likely to occur as a French nuclear test ban, and is as valuable as shares in a Christopher Skase enterprise.

         Why should the people of Australia be concerned about this decision? The Labor Party would say that this merely shows that the government is prepared to make the really hard decisions when it is necessary to do so. In fact, the government has not made any really hard decisions whatsoever. It has failed to address the fundamental instabilities in the health care system. It has failed to address its fiscal imbalance. It has failed to seriously cut expenditure through proper analysis of the priorities of the current expenditure programs.

Last week we saw him in Tasmania demonstrating his versatility: a softly spoken conservationist in the countryside near Hobart; a witless thespian in the city of Launceston; and a mealy-mouthed politician in the midst of his Labor Party comrades.

That is why the coalition opposes this tax grab. That is why the coalition argues that the Senate should take a stand now to require governments to abide by their commitments. The only guarantee in the reign of this government is that no matter what it says, no matter how firm its commitment, no matter how often the promise is repeated, the word of this government and the word of the current Prime Minister cannot be relied on. The coalition opposes these bills and urges all non-government senators to take a stand here and now to obtain responsible parliamentary government for Australia.

         When the initial increase was announced we certainly had some misgivings, although the Australian Democrats have been calling for some time for an increase in the Medicare levy: indeed, a larger increase than we see now. We argued that a 0.2 per cent increase would have been about what was needed to make up for the shortfall in our public health system. However, when we initially looked at the government's proposed increase we were concerned that there was no clear indication from government as to exactly where this additional revenue was going. We wanted an assurance that it was going into the health budget. We wanted to make sure that it would not simply be syphoned off into a range of other programs.

         As well as reading very carefully the budget documents which had lists of expenditure increases as well as considerable numbers of different bits and pieces of cuts, we decided to seek further clarification from the minister. We eventually received that clarification and, while we are not all that happy with the way in which the Medicare levy operates, it is clear that the increase is more than justified. I will shortly indicate why we believe that.

         The Commonwealth government currently spends more than $17 billion on health each year. Roughly $7 billion of that is spent on medical services, the cost of which is increasing. About $5 billion is spent on hospital services. The Commonwealth has in fact been reducing the amount it forwards through to our public hospitals—as have many states. Australians are beginning to see the consequences of this. Some $2 billion goes on pharmaceuticals, and those bills are increasing as well. Some $2 billion goes to nursing homes and hostels. The coalition and the Democrats have been arguing that not enough is going into our nursing homes. We are seeing a situation where many nursing homes cannot even refurbish adequately.

We need to put greater effort into the immunisation program as well as our national drug program.

         This represents a cost per head of population of around $950 a year. By 1999 the Commonwealth expects to be spending $21 billion on health care each year. The two biggest growth areas are going to be medical services and pharmaceutical services unless we make some substantial cuts in those areas. I am not sure that any political party is about selling those. We are seeing a drift to more expensive medical services and more expensive drugs. As we have an aging population, each of us is gradually using up more and more of the health dollars. Each of us is gradually seeing the medical practitioner just that extra day or so a year. It all adds up.

         Our total health budget is now around $35 billion a year. The Commonwealth meets about 48 per cent of that; the states provide about 25 per cent; private health insurance contributes about 11 per cent; and individuals, via the extra out-of-pocket expenses that they have to meet, contribute 16 per cent. The Medicare levy currently raises around $3 billion per year. As has been noted, that is expected to rise to $3.6 billion. In the overall context, that is a pretty small contribution—about 17 per cent—to Commonwealth outlays on health. It is also a relatively small contribution—about 24 per cent—to the actual Medicare outlays themselves.

         When we look at this year's budget, we see that the health outlays in 1995-96 are expected to grow by 3.1 per cent in real terms and a lower growth rate—about 1.8 per cent—is expected over the next four years. As this growth is equal to roughly $1 billion per year over the next four years, there is certainly some justification in the argument that the increase in the Medicare levy is not even fully covering the cost of natural growth within the health portfolio.

         However, there are also significant funding reductions across the health portfolio over the next four years, including a $540 million reduction from changes to indexation arrangements, $54 million from a two per cent reduction in running costs and $100 million is planned to be gained from increasing the PBS threshold up to $600. Furthermore, real outlays for hospital services will decline in real terms by 0.7 of one per cent in 1995-96.

         Some health organisations have argued that these reductions offset more than one half of the additional revenue raised by the increase in the levy. But the flip side of that argument is that there are also several new or additional programs planned in 1995-96. So, although the revenue from the levy increase goes into consolidated revenue, it is reasonable to argue that there is an overall increase of more than $4 billion in the health portfolio over the next four years, and this certainly more than covers the increase in the Medicare levy that we are talking about today. Therefore, in these circumstances, the Democrats believe it is reasonable to support the Medicare increase, as it will be going into the health portfolio.

         In effect, although it is not spelt out anywhere, the increase is about ensuring that Medicare levy receipts make a greater contribution to the cost of the government's health programs. I have to say, however, that we remain far from satisfied with the way in which the Medicare levy actually works. As I said earlier, the levy falls a long way short of meeting the cost of publicly funded health care. In reality, irrespective of how the government likes to portray it, the Medicare levy really is very little more than a symbol rather than a substitute funding mechanism.

         Mind you, I think some of the argument around this point is largely symbolic and semantic and I find it very annoying and a little pathetic that these issues are trotted out time and time again to oppose an increase in the levy. We could overcome these arguments and the problem of the levy not being hypothecated towards health costs by moving to spell out on the tax returns of all Australians exactly how much they are paying out each year through Commonwealth taxation for our public health system. To do that we would need to combine the Medicare levy with what is actually now being paid through general tax revenue and put the figure on the tax returns of all Australians. We can call this figure whatever we like. We can call it a levy. We can call it a public health insurance fee, a public health premium or whatever. I believe that Australians are entitled to see the actual contribution they are making to their health system.

         When we consider what people get for their private health insurance premiums, and they average about $1,200 a year, many Australians would be pretty pleased to find out that they are paying less than $1,000 a year for access to what remains one of the best health systems in the world, as well as to all the other bits and pieces we talked about before—from medical research, to immunisation programs and through to all the other various things that this money goes to in the health budget.

         We can see from recent surveys that satisfaction with Medicare is high. The community does support the system—a fact noted by the OECD's latest economic survey. It is also a fact which has not escaped the attention of the coalition. It is very pleasing to see that the coalition has made some attempts to pull back from its previous opposition to Medicare and from its plans to dismantle key elements of it, and that it is now basically in support of it. However, it is unfortunate, when it comes to the crunch, that the coalition still cannot accept the reality and the popularity of Medicare and therefore back appropriate funding of it.

We have an aging population. We are all using more high-tech services. It is becoming essential, if we are to really look after the health of this country, to look at how we pay for services.

         On this occasion in particular, I believe that the Commonwealth government is neglecting its responsibilities to our public hospital system and that a very strong case can be made for specific targeting of increased funds into the public hospital system. The Commonwealth also needs to make a much better effort to prevent further state government expenditure slashing in the health area; in particular, in Victoria and South Australia. Far too many health programs, issues and services are falling between the cracks because of the state government cutbacks. We need to decide once and for all who is ultimately responsible for Australia's public health system.

         The Democrats hold the view that if we want a decent health system, we are going to have to pay for it. The fairest way to pay for it is through the taxation system, a system based on one's income. That does not mean that the government of the day should not be alert to ways of reigning in health costs and becoming more efficient, and oblivious to ways of delivering more effective services. But, at the end of the day, if we want to make sure all Australians have access to a good standard of basic health care, then we have to pay for it through our tax system. As far as we are concerned, access to basic health care is a fundamental human right—a right that we have to all share in paying for through our universal system which guarantees that right. Access to quality health care should not be a privilege that you get only if you can afford to pay for it. That is not the Democrats' view of a just society.

         This budget, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 9 May, has as its key theme putting the budget into surplus as well as a major key theme of developing a level of national savings, which is code or economic jargon for ensuring that Australians save more money than they spend. The method in the budget of doing this is, basically, through further superannuation contributions, which will mean that we will become a nation over time which borrows from itself rather than from the world and repays itself and, therefore, has a stronger internal economy. But the first element of our approach is, of course, to put the budget in surplus and that is a necessary housekeeping move. Not many similar developed economies in the world are in surplus; we are one of the few.

         The OECD, in surveying the developed countries of the world, in essence is saying to us all that these steps are necessary. Without explicitly referring to us in general, although referring to us approvingly in particular when it comes to the country analysis for Australia, the OECD survey says that the fiscal tightening and the medium-term savings plan in which we have engaged are very positive steps that other countries, too, should engage in.

         So when we turn to the fiscal tightening dimension, it is obvious that the government needs to go through, and has been through, a whole process of finding savings in its outlays, in its expenditure, which do not compromise its social justice goals, which work to ensure better program delivery, but which impose a lesser burden on taxpayers for the cost of government than otherwise would be the case. In that context, obviously, in a logical list of areas for examination, one would look at the Medicare levy. The proposal is that the rate will be increased to 1.5 per cent from 1.4 per cent and that the increase will be from 1 July 1995. The Medicare levy as it now stands only pays for 27 per cent of the cost of public health care in Australia. The rest is paid for by other means through government outlays.

         But the Medicare levy only recoups 27 per cent of the cost of public health care. It is appropriate at a time when we need to exercise some budget stringency to look at a charge such as this and to have it bear a greater load than that, because the cost of public health has been escalating as people have been shifting out of private health care and relying more on Medicare. The increase in the Medicare levy will simply maintain the existing level of cost recovery. The increase in the Medicare levy will not affect single people earning up to about $13,000 and single income families with two children earning up to about $27,000.

         Because we are making the adjustment to the Medicare levy, it is also appropriate for us to have regard to the fringe benefits tax because its settings have always been on the basis of the top marginal rate plus Medicare, so it is necessary to consequentially make a change to the fringe benefits tax. That is the measure that is before the Senate.

         This is a very simple, almost one-line amending bill which affects one important component, but obviously many senators have chosen to use the vehicle of the Medicare levy—I do not criticise honourable senators for doing this—to address a range of issues relating to Medicare that they see as important. I note and will refer to the Minister for Health and Human Services (Dr Lawrence) any comments that have been made.

         I think this is an important measure and one that is necessary for the government's economic strategy—an economic strategy that falls within the advice the OECD is contemporaneously offering and one that is quite sensible from a government strategy point of view for securing the longer term economic viability of the economy and for Australians to look forward to a better quality of life with a proper level of health care. I commend the bills to the Senate.

        Amendment of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Industry Research and Development Act 1986 is the legislative basis for a number of Government programs which encourage research and development in industry. The 150% tax concession is the cornerstone of this suite of programs, and it encourages companies to be more internationally competitive by:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        increasing companies' investment in research and development;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        encouraging better use of Australia's research infrastructure;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        improving conditions for commercialising new technologies; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        developing a greater capacity for the adoption of foreign technology.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1987 this program was augmented by the introduction of syndication, which allows two or more eligible companies to register jointly for the concession. This development meant that the concession became available for those projects which were too large or too risky for a single company to undertake.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The great strength of the tax concession is that it runs on self assessment principles which allows industry to respond to changes in the market as they occur. A company simply invests in the research and development it needs to pursue, and claims back 150% of the cost of the eligible activities when it lodges its next tax return. This reduces the after tax cost of research and development to around 50 cents in the dollar.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since the concession was introduced in 1985, business expenditure on research and development has doubled in real terms. The Government remains committed to the 150% tax concession as an integral part of building a nation that is more competitive in the international arena.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To help companies and other bodies use the concession effectively, the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 currently requires the Industry Research and Development Board to make guidelines addressing five key areas of the tax concession. These guidelines are:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Adequate Australian Content;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Registered Research Agencies;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Finance Schemes;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Commercial Government Bodies; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Research and Development Activities Carried on Outside Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These guidelines are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretations Act 1901, which means that they must be gazetted and laid before both Houses of Parliament within a prescribed period of time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Until this year, guidelines covering the first four of these key areas—Adequate Australian Content, Registered Research Agencies, Finance Schemes and Commercial Government Bodies—were gazetted, but not laid before Parliament. As a result, the guidelines lapsed 15 sitting days after the guidelines were made. This was not brought to light until recently, and as a consequence, the Industry Research and Development Board has been making decisions using these lapsed guidelines in the belief that they were valid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This discovery has caused an understandable amount of uncertainty in the business and research and development communities. In recognition of this, the Government has acted quickly by indicating its intention to proceed immediately with legislation to overcome the problem and give a clear signal that this Government continues to support innovation in Australian companies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amending legislation before you seeks to reinstate certainty and continuity for users of the tax concession. The guidelines were well understood within industry and are widely considered fair and effective.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This amending legislation retrospectively validates the lapsed guidelines, and the decisions made on the basis of these guidelines. This means that the decisions made by the Industry Research and Development Board and accepted by industry on the basis of the lapsed guidelines will have full legal force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amending legislation also provides that secondary decisions made on the basis of the guidelines, such as actions taken by the Commissioner of Taxation in response to certificates from the Industry Research and Development Board, are made valid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me reassure you, that this validity provided by the amending legislation only extends to decisions and actions in as much as they relate to the lapsed guidelines. If some other component of a decision or action renders it invalid, then the amending legislation has no jurisdiction to change that. This legislation purely addresses those doubts caused by the failure to lay the guidelines before Parliament as required by law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This validation of the lapsed guidelines does not in any way affect the power of Parliament to disallow the four sets of guidelines before the Senate at the moment, nor does it inhibit the power of Parliament to disallow any guidelines to be tabled in the future.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is now widely recognised that developing an innovative culture which continually creates new areas of competitiveness, enhances efficiency and achieves greater productivity is a key factor in securing Australia's future. The 150% tax concession program is an important way of achieving these goals, and the amending legislation is essential for the continued success of this program. This action by the Government has the support of the major financial promoters of syndicated research and development.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment bill also incorporates a time extension into the provisions covering the new grant approvals under the Industry Research and Development Act. The sunset clause amendment addresses the fact that the Industry Research and Development Board cannot enter into new grant agreements after 31 December 1995. The 1995-96 Budget initiatives for the Industry, Science and Technology portfolio included a commitment that the program would be extended to 30 June 1996 to allow the Government sufficient time to respond to the Industry Commission Inquiry into Research and Development. This is an extension of time only, and does not represent an increase in the appropriation.

         —Today we are debating the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Air Services Bill 1995. These bills affect the most important organisational change to aviation regulations since 1988. The package of bills would divide the Civil Aviation Authority into two separate organisations—the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, will look after the safety and regulation of aircraft, whereas Airservices Australia will be responsible for the commercial operations of the previous Civil Aviation Authority, that being air traffic controllers, firefighters and so on.

         The government established the Civil Aviation Authority in 1988 as part of its deregulation of the domestic aviation industry. The authority's unitary structure, which combined safety regulation and airways management into one organisation, was inspired by the British Civil Aviation Authority. The minister at the time stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the task of regulating aviation safety must be regarded as an integrated system in which all elements are coordinated to achieve maximum reliability and effectiveness.

         The operation of air traffic control and the flight advisory service is as much a part of safety regulation as the regulation of an aircraft and its crew.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        The government and the Civil Aviation Authority have steadily moved away from that arrangement as its deficiencies became apparent. Unfortunately, the government did not take any action until we had two tragic accidents. Ralph Nader and Wesley Smith have described this sort of approach to safety regulation as the `tombstone imperative'.

         The deficiencies in the air safety regulation system first began to emerge in 1993, when the Civil Aviation Authority commissioned the Terrell report into the operation of the then Safety Regulation and Standards Division. The steering committee set up to oversee the implementation of the report argued that the division structure did not adequately highlight the CAA's primary responsibility for safety regulation. The Safety Regulation and Standards Division was renamed and restructured as the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation.

         The government, however, did not accept the need for radical change to the Civil Aviation Authority until the tragic air accident that occurred outside Young on a dark night in June 1993. On 11 June 1993, a Monarch Piper Chieftain slammed into a hill near the Young aerodrome. All of the seven people on board were killed, although one passenger—a little girl—suffered shocking injuries for another 10 hours. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report into the accident was scathing of the authority. In its findings, the bureau asserted that there were a range of organisational failures within the CAA. The government responded—a sort of knee-jerk reaction—with a poorly thought-out half measure that involved renaming the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation as the Aviation Safety Agency. It would have had discrete financial and accounting arrangements, but its head would have reported to the CAA's chief executive officer. The decision would have been a bureaucratic mess.

         Then there was another accident, the Seaview crash, which revealed even more deficiencies than the CAA's operating procedures. The details of what happened on the Seaview crash are still emerging, but the many investigations into the accident have already revealed considerable managerial failures within the CAA. It was only after this second accident that the government announced that aviation safety regulation would be the responsibility of a completely separate agency.

         The Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill establishes the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as Australia's air safety regulator and includes a wide range of transitional provisions to split the CAA's assets and staff between CASA and Airservices Australia. The bill would require CASA to regard the safety of air navigation as its most important consideration. It would completely restructure part 3 of the act which deals with the regulation of civil aviation. The part would be restructured into four divisions, each dealing with a specific area of aviation safety.

         Division 2, which deals with air operator certificates, is of particular interest. AOCs are the primary tool for regulating the safety of commercial air operations in Australia. Commercial air operators cannot fly without an AOC. At the moment the rules relating to AOCs are scattered between the act, the regulations and the civil aviation orders. The bill seeks to consolidate all of those provisions into the act. That move in the direction of simplification by putting such issues all into the one place is very welcomed.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill will also add a new subsection 28(2) to the act which would enable CASA to take into account the financial position of an applicant in satisfying itself of the applicant's ability to comply with aviation laws. This new subsection is a direct result of the Monarch crash. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation pointed out in its report that Monarch had consistent financial problems. The company had significant difficulties in meeting its financial commitments as they became due. If the CAA had been alerted to these difficulties, it would have been able to monitor its operations more closely.

         There has been some concern expressed to me about this particular provision in the act. However, I think what is there is satisfactory because it uses the word `may'. It does not use the word `shall' with regard to financial viability. The point about the Monarch crash was that the Civil Aviation Authority knew that Monarch was in trouble because it had not paid the bills for six or 12 months. That in itself should have waved a red signal that something was very wrong.

         Subsequently, it became known—if one reads the BASI report on Monarch—that this company was not even able to pay its fuel bills in some areas and was carrying loads of fuel from Sydney for the return trip because it could not get credit in the rural provincial areas of New South Wales. I personally have no problems with the fact that CASA will be able, if it sees that there are serious financial problems, to see short cuts which could be a potential danger to fare paying passengers on these sorts of aircraft.

         The Air Services Bill would set up Airservices Australia as a government business enterprise to operate Australia's airways system. Like CASA, Airservices Australia would be required to regard the safety of air navigation as its prime concern. The coalition strongly supports the dividing of CAA into two separate bodies—a specialist air safety regulator and an airways management authority.

         We support the bills but do not support them uncritically. The government's original version of the bill proposed to insert a 238-word section into the Civil Aviation Act which would have set out its objectives. The House of Representatives inquiry into the bill pointed out that the clause was overly detailed. I would have thought that might have been an understatement by the committee. The inquiry proposed significant amendments to the objects clause. Its version would have read:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation in an effective and economical way, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents whilst recognising the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government's redraft of the clause is broadly in line with the committee's recommendation but it omits the words `effective and economical' and the words `the need for more people to benefit from aviation'. The government redraft is a considerable improvement over the original version of 238 words, but the clause proposed by the committee is better. It has to be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to argue against the proposition that the regulation of civil aviation should be efficient and economical. Those words have been taken out by the government. It is difficult to argue against the proposition that more people should be able to benefit from civil aviation, the safest form of transport we have in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A further concern we have is that the Civil Aviation Authority has a history of imposing regulations on the industry without taking into account the costs of complying with them. Its public service culture is often incomprehensible to the operators it regulates, as Senator Collins, sitting opposite, would know. Civil Aviation Authority officers generally have a public service or military background. That in itself is not a criticism; it is a fact. In the main, general aviation operators are small business people.

         The coalition believes that CASA should be required to perform its functions in a way that promotes and fosters aviation. A requirement of this sort would be broadly comparable to the American requirement that says that the federal aviation administration must adopt a policy of `the promotion, encouragement and development of civil aeronautics'. I point out that it is not the intent in the amendments we foreshadow in the committee stage of the bill that these organisations should develop a special section within their departments to promote it. We are saying that there has to be a change of culture and a change of attitude so that there is a cooperative attitude between those people within CASA and the industry itself in the promotion of safety and aviation.

         In the House of Representatives the government argued that our suggestions would blur CASA's focus on air safety. I am not suggesting, and never would suggest, that CASA should adopt lower safety standards. I am suggesting that it should ensure that the regulatory requirements are straightforward and it should enforce them with the utmost attention to procedural fairness. CASA will not have and will not gain the respect of the industry until it does that. It is an industry where there is more than one player. It is not just the CAA, CASA or AA; it is the industry itself, and they have to work cooperatively.

         The two bills would update the provisions relating to ministerial directions to bring them into line with current practice and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. In doing so, they would considerably reduce the minister's accountability to the parliament and the people for his or her decisions. Section 96 of the Civil Aviation Act currently requires that all ministerial directions to the authority be gazetted within 15 days. The bills will remove that section. Ministerial directions will be reported in the annual reports of the two bodies but nowhere else. This means we will have to wait for up to 12 months to find out what those ministerial directions are.

         The House of Representatives inquiry partially recognised the lack of ministerial accountability in the bills. The committee recommends that the minister be required to table the final version of CASA's and AA's corporate plans. The government has accepted the committee's recommendations with respect to CASA but not with respect to Airservices Australia on the grounds that its corporate plan would be commercially confidential. In my view, the government's assertion in respect of this is absurd. I know that it is a general rule in respect of GBEs, but Airservices Australia could not in any sense be described as a commercial organisation. It is a monopoly; it has no competitors. It receives substantial sums of money through the budget. It received $27.6 million in 1995-96. Parliament surely should have the right to know what Airservices Australia plans to do with what money. It was pointed out that this will appear in the annual report, again 12 months later. There is a big lag effect.

         We have all received a vast amount of correspondence from the aviation industry regarding section 20A of the act. Section 20A states that it is an offence for a pilot of an aircraft, recklessly or negligently, to endanger the life of a person. The offence carries a penalty of up to five years in gaol. The section also states that it is an offence for a pilot to cause danger to any person or property. The penalty is up to two years in gaol. The government decided to amend section 20A to make it easier for the CAA and the Director of Public Prosecutions to obtain convictions for these offences. The section originally said that a pilot's activities had to be likely to cause a danger. The government wanted to amend the section so that a pilot could be convicted if his or her actions had the potential to cause danger, not just the pilot but even an instructor.

         According to an eminent Queens Counsel whom I consulted, the government's amendment could technically have made all forms of aviation illegal. After all, every form of flying has the potential to endanger someone, even if that someone is the pilot. I immediately put out a press release saying that we would block these amendments if the minister did not change them himself. Hundreds of pilots throughout Australia contacted his office to point out the flaw. After procrastinating for a week, the minister announced that he was abandoning the proposals and said he would refer the clause to the House of Representatives Morris committee.

         The industry put forward an alternative version of section 20A which would encourage CASA to concentrate its scrutiny on pilots who endanger third parties rather than those who endanger only themselves.

         A number of government members in the other place have suggested that the only industry organisation opposed to their position on this issue is the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. You can tell that those members are not on top of their mail. AOPA's proposal is supported by just about every aviation industry organisation in Australia, including the Sport Aviation Association and the International Air Pilots Association. In fact, a very strong release was put out by the International Air Pilots Association saying that if the clause had gone through, its pilots would have stopped flying into Australia.

         The establishment of CASA and Airservices Australia is an opportunity for Australia to move away from the confusion and turmoil that has characterised the last few years of aviation regulation. It has an opportunity to end the faction fighting that has crippled the CAA. Difficulties are already emerging. Some people are quite apparently white-anting the new authority from within, before it even commences to operate. I am concerned that, in a few years, we may end up going through this sorry process again.

More importantly, there has to be a restoration of confidence within the industry, within the minds of the general public and between the various sectors in the industry, including the new authorities to be set up. The coalition supports the bills but, as foreshadowed, I will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage.

         Initially some attention was paid by the government to section 20AA. I understand that the government did not proceed with its intentions, due to overwhelming response from the industry. Section 20AA of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 provides in subsection (1):

        The concerns in these two subsections are twofold. In relation to subsection (1), the manner of flying or operation has to be either reckless or negligent. Furthermore, it has to be a manner which is likely to endanger life. This means that a pilot will commit an offence if he so operates an aircraft and his is the only life which is likely to be in danger. The manner of flying or operation has to be such that it is likely to endanger life. That is a more hypothetical test than that which is contained in the convention mentioned by Senator Parer, namely the International Civil Aviation Organisation Convention, which says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        An aircraft shall not be operated in a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger life. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That is entirely different wording. That looks at the action which endangers life as such, not what we have at the moment which is that the manner is likely to endanger life. So the test we have at the moment in the Civil Aviation Act is perhaps one step removed and somewhat hypothetical. The amendment proposed by the coalition is more precise, more proximate and more definite; that is, that the manner of flying has to be such as to endanger life.

         The United States regulation 91.13 has identical wording to that proposed by the coalition. I fail to see that there would be any problem with prosecuting the offences outlined by the coalition because I understand that, in America, that regulation in similar wording involves 70 to 80 per cent of air regulations prosecutions in that country.

         There is also another aspect: at the moment, the legislation refers to any action that is likely to endanger life. That means any life, including the pilot's. In Australia we have stock mustering where there is a solo pilot, aerobatic flying with a single pilot and people in sporting clubs who fly on their own. For instance, a pilot flying over an empty wasteland on his or her own could engage in flying which could infringe this section. The same thing could occur with stock mustering out in the bush where there is no-one involved other than the pilot. There would just be the vast expanse of land below the aircraft and the stock being mustered.

         I once saw an aerobatics exhibition where solo pilots would fly vertically towards the ground, then, at the last minute, pull out of the descent. That could be looked upon as being likely to endanger the life of the pilot. So the industry is very concerned that should the section remain as it is, the civil aviation authorities would concern themselves with these various scenarios that I have illustrated to the Senate. A good deal of time could be taken up in air safety investigations.

         I am advised that some 27 per cent of the Civil Aviation Authority's time is taken up in regulating and investigating the sorts of situations I have outlined to the Senate.

That would include passengers both in a private and commercial sense.

         For that offence there is a penalty of five years imprisonment. According to subsection (2), the aircraft must not be flown or operated in such a manner or in such circumstances as will or is likely to cause danger to any person or property. Again, the test is somewhat hypothetical: is it likely to cause danger to any person or property? That is a somewhat remote question to ask. It is not as proximate or definite as the coalition amendment which would propose simply that no person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger property or another person.

         So there are two variations: firstly, that the property has to belong to another; and, secondly, that the person must be someone other than the pilot. Again, that distinguishes between the situations I mentioned earlier of a solo pilot in a remote situation or where there is absolutely no possibility of injuring someone else's property or person. The current section, as stated, contains that somewhat hypothetical test; that is, that it is likely to endanger the person or property. When a court has to ask itself that when trying a pilot—bearing in mind the penalty of two years imprisonment, a heavy penalty indeed—it could well say that virtually anything a pilot does is likely to endanger property. Flying over houses could well be said to be likely to endanger them. How long do you draw the bow? How wide a test is it?

         Whenever you deal with a criminal sanction, you must be very careful when framing legislation to make sure that the behaviour which it is intended to address is treated in a specific fashion and that the causation of events is strictly related, so that you do not just cast the net wide and say that anything which flows from this action attracts criminal sanction. You might do that in the common law with negligence, but you certainly do not do it in the criminal jurisdiction.

If you widen the scope of liability, then you widen the burden on the regulating authorities.

Whenever you say to the citizens in the country, `This is illegal; this will attach a criminal sanction,' then the elements of the offence must be explicitly set out and the actions which flow from the person's illegal behaviour must be clearly identified as being criminal. You cannot say that something which happens three steps removed from your actions can still warrant your being prosecuted for a criminal offence. For instance, if you do something in your daily life which causes something else to happen, which in turn causes something else to happen, it is starting to get a bit removed from your own actions, and it is generally only those direct consequences of your actions which the criminal law recognises as being attributable to your will, to your intention. To talk about anything which is likely to endanger property or a person is really casting the net a bit too wide.

I do not need to rehearse the broad thrust of this legislation, which we also will be supporting. But, like Senator Ellison, I would draw attention to section 20A, which many people have found offensive, and draw essentially the same point. That is that, while the government seeks to leave this as it is and refer the matter to a committee, which committee, as Senator Ellison pointed out, may not report before there is an election, we see no reason why the section should not be amended and the wording, as in the American federal aviation regulations, be put in there and that that be the basis of the wording which the committee reviews.

That activity would then be caught under the government's proposal. The very act of getting into an aircraft and starting a propeller turning could be argued to carry a potential risk. A few short years ago somebody walked into a propeller and lost an arm. So, clearly, starting an engine has the potential to cause harm.

        Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Senator Olive Zakharov. Coming from different sections of the Victorian Labor movement, I did not have a personal acquaintance with Olive, but her work towards achieving social justice for several disadvantaged groups was well known and well respected. Olive did not seek reward in high profile other than in pursuing the issues she saw as important to Australians. She was, however, well known, liked and respected amongst the many people associated with this place and within the Australian Labor Party. Not a day has gone by in recent times without my receiving a reminder of the challenge I face in following her work.

        Recent commentary on income distribution has focused upon the extent of inequality within Australian society. Most recently, the opposition appears to believe it can gain the confidence of the Aussie battler as representing their interests towards a more just society. But let us look at the facts. As indicated in the Economic Planning Advisory Council income distribution survey released recently—and I quote:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Changes in the distribution of earnings in the 1980s and into the 1990s have been a concern both in Australia and overseas, with an increase in measured inequality in most developed countries.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Nevertheless, despite the increase in inequality shown by the figures, the dispersion in earnings in Australia has not been marked by international standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent studies have demonstrated that this government's policies are having the desired impact of reducing inequality amongst Australian families. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has confirmed that the distributional impact of social wage measures significantly narrows the gap between rich and poor.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        This government has improved the social wage, with measures such as: a 12 per cent increase in the real value of the base pension; a doubling in the real value of family payments to low income families and an extension to low income working families; the introduction and the maintenance of Medicare; a doubling in the proportion of the population with superannuation coverage; an enormous increase in child-care provision; child maintenance measures through the Child Support Agency; expanded labour market programs; more than doubling the proportion of young people completing secondary education; and expanded assistance with housing and rental assistance.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Such measures mean that the average incomes of the top 20 per cent of Australian families fall from 13 times to only four times those in the bottom 20 per cent once the benefits of government expenditure on social wage are included. But the government has not viewed these indications as grounds for complacency. As indicated in the EPAC report:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The extent of income disparities are such that questions arise whether the social and economic needs of the disadvantaged are being met and whether the economy is operating as efficiently and as equitably as it might.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent initiatives have focused on ensuring that these issues continue to be addressed—for instance, those under the government's employment white paper, Working Nation, last year, that is, the jobs compact, the parenting allowance due to operate from 1 July this year, and also the current budget initiatives of the maternity allowance, expanded child-care initiatives and increases in the guardians allowance and rental assistance.

        Non-cash benefits are strongly redistributive and act to reduce income inequality. Increases in the social wage strongly suggest that focusing on cash incomes only exaggerates the extent of inequality. Yet the opposition would focus upon cash incomes. For the conservatives, equality and social justice seem secondary to the efficiency of the free marketplace. Their promises of tax cuts would be funded by cuts to government spending in those very areas which make Australia a more equitable place in which to live.

His career has demonstrated a strong and selfless commitment to improving the lives of ordinary workers. Jim Maher has been a significant force in the modernisation of the trade union movement. His leadership of the shop assistants union saw it grow manyfold to a membership of over 200,000.

        —Order! I want to make a brief report and present two draft codes of conduct for the consideration of senators. Senators will be aware that a working group chaired by Mr Speaker and me and including representatives of both houses and all sides of politics has been considering a code of conduct for members of parliament. The membership of the group was Senators Bourne, Chamarette, McKiernan, Ray, Reid and Tambling, and Mr Mack, Mr Price, Mr Scott and the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. Mr Speaker and I thank all members for their contribution to the group.

        The working group grew out of a similar group in the previous parliament and was convened on the initiative of the Senate as part of the response to the resignation of the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly. The working group was asked to consider a code of conduct both for ordinary members and for ministers. It drew on existing documents, including the constitution, Remuneration Tribunal determinations, the Bowen committee report, the work of the Electoral and Administrative Review Committee in Queensland and various guides to ministers issued over the years.

        Discussion within the group ranged widely—like another contemporary debate—basically polarising between maximalist and minimalist positions. Should the document seek to be all-embracing and detailed, or a short statement of principles? The majority of the group favoured the minimalist approach but accepted that two documents were required: one for members and another for ministers, presiding officers and parliamentary secretaries.

As to the stated intention of the government to also introduce separate legislation to increase the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's capacity to conduct what it describes as `more sophisticated, systematic investigations and analysis', we certainly await that legislation with interest and the opportunity to comment upon it.

         The CAA has been described as having `a cowboy approach to life', being `out of control' and acting `according to its own agenda' and `clandestinely in the name of what it thought were its corporate responsibilities'. Those comments were not made from this side of the chamber; they were made from a member of the government, who also stated that the CAA `deliberately set out to mislead the public' and was involved in `serious breaches' of its duty. The CAA has also been described as `unusual', `poorly administered', `bureaucratic', `expensive', `inward-looking', `self-defensive' and a `complete shambles'.

I suspect there are some startling parallels to be drawn between the cultural problems experienced within the CAA and those which we have witnessed recently and which, to some extent, are still occurring within CSIRO and have been highlighted by recent investigations of the Senate Economics Committee.

         In his second reading speech on this bill, the parliamentary secretary to the minister stated that these bills `will provide a much clearer focus on aviation safety regulation and ensure there is no conflict with the more commercial goals of the service provider'. This is to be achieved by placing the aviation safety regulatory function with the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the provision of airway services with Airservices Australia, which will be established as a government business enterprise.

         CASA's functions will include standard setting, safety surveillance of the industry and enforcement of standards, entry control, and licensing. It was stated in the second reading speech that the minister has issued a direction to the CAA to establish a formal system to trigger an automatic increase in safety surveillance of any operator found to be in financial default. This is in line with the recommendation of the Council of the Australian Division of the Royal Aeronautical Society in its review of the safety of general aviation in Australia. In its position paper issued in December 1994, the council recommended:
        </tab>

        The second reading speech notes that the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 provides that CASA has a safety regulatory role, but does not provide CASA with the powers of an economic regulator. It goes on to say that the bill:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        nevertheless allows CASA to take into account information about financial viability [and] empowers CASA to have regard to information about the financial viability of a particular operator in deciding whether or not to conduct a detailed safety audit of the operator.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a somewhat contradictory statement, however, the difference in interpretation is based on the mandatory nature of CASA's responsibility to apply the financial viability test, and whether or not that would interfere with CASA's responsibilities as a safety regulator. Given the convoluted and contradictory explanation provided in the second reading speech, one might wonder whether overseeing the financial viability of aircraft operators will improve relations between the safety authority and the industry or, indeed, exacerbate existing problems.

         Certainly the explanation given by the minister is not too convincing. This is an important point, given the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's report on the Monarch Air Piper Chieftain fatal crash in June 1993, which was released in July 1994. It stated:

        It is clear that the government has good intentions in this regard. Its response to the BASI report was to establish an inquiry into air safety for the commuter and general aviation safety sectors, which I mentioned earlier. It went further with its reactions to the Seaview air accident by appointing a new director of aviation safety, announcing the establishment of the Civil Aviation Safety Agency, announcing a judicial inquiry into the operations of the CAA, and increasing surveillance of low capacity passenger and charter operations. Significantly, it also allowed for an increase of 57 staff in the safety regulation area of the CAA.

         This is a consistent approach for the Liberal and National parties, and acknowledges in part the significant and substantial role that general aviation plays in the training of the industry's pilots.

         I should also mention another group that operates with the assistance of privately funded general aviation—the Air Training Corps and the Australian Air League. The valuable service to the country provided by these two organisations is frequently overlooked, as is the fact that many of the cadets, who have subsequently joined the armed forces or assumed commercial aviation careers, had their initial passion for aviation fostered by the individuals who comprise this dedicated group of volunteers. Many sacrifice their annual leave and donate many hours of private time to conduct training camps and to pass on their skills to the youth of Australia. It is sad that we saw the demise, some years ago, of the various university squadrons of the Air Force Reserve which had operated for many years and also provided an initiation to aviation for many young people.

         There is another reason. Australia enjoys a uniquely favourable environment for pilot training. Weather conditions are generally fair, which assists with navigation training. The sheer size of the Australian land mass, together with its large tracts of flat terrain, offers extended uninterrupted flight in safe conditions—not over water nor with the risk of infringing foreign airspace. A stable political climate provides that aircraft, certainly training aircraft, are not used as terrorist targets.

         Parallels have been drawn with some other recreational activities to support a sport aviation category of flying. With some reservations, I support this proposition, although I must say that I draw the line at comparing aerobatics with abseiling, as has been suggested in some quarters. Frankly, apart from both requiring coordinated motor skills, that is about where the comparison ends. The level of skill varies considerably, not least in the degree of training required, and some very specific physical factors also distinguish the two.

I understand that occasional flying can be dangerous. Therefore, those who engage in recreational flying must ensure that their skills are maintained and adequate. With those comments in regard to the legislation and some of the issues that relate to aviation safety, I join with Senator Parer and others on the opposition side of the Senate in supporting the legislation, subject to the amendments that we will be moving in the committee stage.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, before speaking to this Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Air Services Bill 1995, I table a correction to the revised explanatory memorandum. I do not pretend to have had enough time in the last 12 months, with an obvious preoccupation with my own portfolio, to have followed closely the development of this issue—the establishment of these two bodies—nor, in particular, the opposition's principal amendment foreshadowed by Senator Parer. In fact, I only came down to the chamber this evening because I was on chamber duty at the time this debate was about to proceed. That is when I picked up the opposition's principal amendment to the government's proposal and read it with total disbelief.

         I cannot believe this, Senator Parer. Over the last six months or so, the government has talked about the blinding hypocrisy of this coalition. Just the other day we canvassed in here the revelations of the shadow minister for regional development about a leaked draft document. That revealed the extent of the opposition's hypocrisy. But nothing, Senator Parer, can touch this backflip.

         But there was a problem identified with that restructuring; a problem that resulted, as Senator Parer quite correctly said, with the Terrell report. Captain Alan Terrell, as the Senate has been previously told, was deliberately appointed to the board of the Civil Aviation Authority to correct that problem. What was the identified problem? The identified problem was the dual responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority.

         The question of splitting the organisation into two completely separate and identifiable arms—one a commercial arm and one a regulatory arm—had been canvassed on a number of occasions previously. It was decided at that time not to proceed with it. But it was obvious that the identified problem was just that. The Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, to his credit, acted decisively and with the support of the opposition, as I understood it, and split the organisation into those two bodies, each one with a clearly identified role.

         In other words, the dual responsibility was finished. There was a commercial arm to the operation and an unblushingly and unequivocal safety arm to the operation. I thought, considering everything that the opposition has said in the last 12 months, that that would win the support and, indeed, the plaudits of the opposition. I have never seen a backflip of these proportions—and we have seen a few in here!

There is a pile of this stuff two inches thick. I am not going to keep the Senate here for ages while I read them all, but I will just read the flavour of it. The shadow minister for transport in the House of Representatives, Mr Sharp, said on 20 October 1994, `The very core issue of this whole problem, the unholy relationship between the CAA, the policeman of our airlines, and the airline operators themselves.

         I refer to two press statements, but there are many more, as Senator Parer knows. In April 1994 Mr Sharp said, `The attitude that prevails within the Civil Aviation Authority gives greater priority to commercial concerns of air operators rather than the safety of passengers.' We have another press statement from Mr Sharp which says this, `Mr Sharp said that the report'—that is the Monarch report—`had pointed the finger at the CAA's placement of commercial considerations above its primary function of the regulation of air safety as identified in the act.' You cannot get it much clearer than that. So, what does the minister for aviation do? The minister for aviation, Mr Brereton—

         The phrase `efficient and effective' in the government's proposals has been put there deliberately and is well understood by the bureaucracy and by this parliament. I will give the Senate the Finance Department's definitions of `efficient' and `effective'. `Efficient' is defined by the Department of Finance to mean the extent to which program inputs are minimised for a given level of program outputs or program outputs are maximised for a given level of inputs. `Effective' is defined as the extent to which a program's outcomes achieve its stated objectives—clear-cut, precise and supportable.

         I am an ordinary user of the English language. The word `economical' has a clear inference of affordable safety—the very concept that the opposition has been bucketing for a year and a half. The opposition wants to put it back in the CASA legislation. CASA is the organisation that is not concerned with the commercial arm of the operation but unblushingly has a mandate for safety. The opposition wants to turn it back and reverse everything it has said in the past year and a half. That is an astonishing piece of blatant hypocrisy. In sheer policy terms it must have everybody in the aviation industry scratching their heads and wondering just where these people come from on any given day on any particular issue.

These are based on similar provisions of the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. It is a fact that the current provisions of the dual role of the regulator in the United States—that is, having a role of regulating and fostering the industry at the same time; the very intent of the amendments that the opposition is moving here this afternoon—are under great scrutiny.

Minister Brereton reacted only after two air crashes—tragic that they were. It was a knee-jerk reaction.

         But there was one recommendation of the Morris committee which the government rejected. And this happens with committee reports from time to time—governments do this, as do parliaments, the House of Representatives and the Senate because committees are creatures of these chambers. It is finally the houses of parliament that determine the final result. The Morris committee report was a good piece of work, as you would expect from the former transport minister. Most of the recommendations were accorded the respect that they deserve. But the one that was emphatically rejected by the government, and rightly so, was this one. This particular amendment, in all the reliance that Senator Parer is placing on the Morris committee, has to be read with the even more crucial amendments that the opposition are about to move, because all we are talking about doing at the moment is amending the objects of the act.

Find this in the Morris committee report or anything like it! Because this is not ambiguous; this is unblushingly dual function—the very thing that Ralph Nader is preaching against in the United States and which the opposition, and I have quoted just three examples of it, are saying should not happen.

         In respect of your furphies about accountability, as the second reading speech of the minister explained, the government decided that the industry's legitimate concerns about doing it properly, effectively and efficiently would be best addressed if the relevant provisions in the legislative instruments bill were brought forward in their application to CASA. These provide for full public consultation and cost benefit analysis of regulatory changes and they represent a clear and unqualified means of taking costs into account in developing safety regulations. The second reading speech has given a commitment by the minister that he will issue a direction to this effect immediately CASA is established.

         What puzzled me most was the wording. Senator MacGibbon, perhaps I could refer it to you—I do not know whether you left a few words out. I was quite open about the fact that I was not even familiar with these amendments until I walked into the chamber. The curious wording—and it is very curious; more so than `economical'—is this tag on the end of the objectives: `more people to benefit from civil aviation'. What does that mean precisely? Why don't you at least say, `We will not be supporting these objectives. We will support the government's objectives'? But to make it clear that safety is indeed the main priority of the safety side of the organisation, as well it being efficient and effective in paying for it, why don't you say something like `more people to benefit from a safe system of civil aviation'? The words there trail off into midair.

         —If the nub of the concern of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) is the word `economic', I should perhaps take the time to explain that we are concerned that the new authority directs its activities in an efficient way where those efforts ought to be applied. One of the great criticisms of the present regulatory arm of the Civil Aviation Authority is that it misdirects the resources it has and, because of the misdirection, it does not have enough people in the relevant areas. Something like 24 per cent or higher—I forget the figures—of airworthiness surveillance is directed towards the private sector, where the risk to the travelling public is minimal.

         It is this misdirection within the Civil Aviation Authority which is at the heart of the opposition's point on this. If the Civil Aviation Authority has a direction to do some sort of analysis as to where it puts its efforts—because its efforts in turn are related to the costs of the operation—we will be very happy. But, at the moment, we see a very inefficient organisation as a consequence of the legislation that is on the books at the present time. In that light, I am sure that the minister would agree with the amendment.

        As Senator Collins mentioned earlier, this amendment is a functions clause. It says that CASA must exercise its powers subject to subsection 1. That is very important. Subsection 1 relates to safety being the priority. Subject to safety being the priority, CASA must exercise its powers and perform its functions in a manner that, as far as is practicable, is economical and effective and that promotes and fosters civil aviation.

         The CAA has a history of imposing regulations on the industry, without taking into account the cost of complying with them. Its perceived culture is often incomprehensible to the operators that it regulates. Senator Collins would know that from his own Darwin background. The coalition believes CASA should be required to perform its functions in a way that promotes and fosters civil aviation. To clarify that, there is no intention that the department should set up a separate organisation to go around promoting and fostering. In the exercising of its powers, which are very important in controlling safety, it should take on board the fact that the industry itself needs to be promoted and fostered.

         The amendment is not identical to the American requirement, but it is constructed so that the safety of air navigation remains the authority's principal responsibility. There is no doubt about that. The `promote and foster' clause is subject to subsection 9A(2), where CASA must regard the safety of air navigation as its most important consideration. Interestingly enough, subsection 9A(2), a government subsection, states that CASA must perform its functions so that the environment is protected. If the government's argument about my amendment is correct, its argument must also apply to subsection 9A(2), which states that CASA should take the environment into account. All we are saying is that CASA should be economical and effective and that it should promote and foster civil aviation.

We find them even more objectionable than changing the objects of the act because they go one step further. This is the heart of the bill, the heart of the separate organisation that will now unblushingly concentrate on air safety and not on commercialism. The amendments, which do not relate to anything in the Morris committee recommendations, go further than saying that CASA has to be economical and effective. They say that CASA has to have the dual role of promoting and fostering civil aviation.

The concern that Mr Sharp had was that CAA officers were more concerned about maintaining the viability of a particular airline, and these were the border line operators.

By way of explanation, I should say that the government altered the program today and I did not know this bill was coming on, otherwise I would have had quite a deal to say at the second reading stage. Somewhat late in the debate, I want to make a contribution to support Senator Parer's excellent amendment that he has moved on behalf of the opposition.

         It really is not valid for the minister to hold the Morris committee report up as some sort of guide of best practice in aviation. It is an interesting report but in no sense does it incorporate all that needs to be done for the benefit of aviation in this country. With respect, the minister is still missing the point when he argues that because there is a requirement in the amendment for CASA to operate in an economic and effective manner, that means keeping airlines in the air that are unsafe. With the best will in the world, there is no logical connection between what Senator Parer and I are saying and the interpretation the minister is putting on it. I presume that the minister must be overtired or something.

         We want the civil aviation regulatory authority to operate in an efficient and economical way for those in the aviation industry. Anyone who has ever operated, owned and maintained an aeroplane knows the often illogical constraints that are put on them from a modification point of view by the Civil Aviation Authority, allegedly in the interests of safety. I think of one of many instances that have happened to me in the last 30 years. One of them relates to the mandatory changing of hoses in the engine compartment of the aircraft I own. The particular manufacturer's hoses that were fitted to my aircraft were Dunlop hoses that had a wall thickness of about one inch. Because they were more than five years old—the hoses that I had fitted were actually new; they had been in service for about 12 months, but they had been manufactured outside the five-year period—I had to remove them at very considerable expense and replace them with an American aeroquip type hose.

         Forgetting about the cost that I had to bear for the hose, the point was that there was a degradation in safety and there is a degradation in safety in my aeroplane at present as a consequence of that dogmatic requirement that the hose had to be changed. The hose that was changed would have survived a fire to a far higher temperature for a matter of hours. The approved hose that it is now fitted with, which keeps the Civil Aviation Authority very happy, is a hose that will withstand a much lower temperature for minutes, whereas the hose that was perfectly satisfactory in its place would have survived a far higher temperature for a matter of hours. There are numerous examples of that nature. It is perfectly proper for the opposition to require the regulatory authority to operate in an economical and effective manner, subject of course to the overriding requirement of safety as the primary concern of the authority.

         There is a far more intangible and important reason behind this amendment than the minister recognises. Sadly, what we have in Australia is a regulatory authority which is openly antagonistic to the aviation industry. As someone who moves around the world quite a bit and has had a very long interest in aviation, I know of no other country where the regulatory authority has daggers drawn for the aviation industry.

         The real message behind this amendment that Senator Parer is moving to promote and foster civil aviation in Australia is to engender some feeling of cooperation between the regulatory authority and the industry that it should regulate—to have an amicable partnership between the two. Unless you have that, I do not care how many laws you pass through the parliament and I do not care how draconian the penalties that the regulatory authority has, you simply cannot make the rules work without the cooperation of those you are trying to rule.

         It is important that there is a change in the atmosphere—the way the civil aviation regulatory authority approaches the aviation industry in this country. It relates very much to safety because when you have this antagonistic adversarial attitude where you have surveyors and field investigators who quite openly boast in public that one should never trust a pilot because pilots always lie, it just shows the extent of the poisonous atmosphere between the regulatory authority and the aviation industry in Australia. That has a very direct impact on safety. Regrettably, at present we have reached a situation where the aviation industry as a matter of policy restricts all contact with the regulatory authority. It does not want to talk to it unless it is forced to. There is a degree of deception in the industry because it is very hard out there.

         As a consequence of the economic policies of this government, it is hard to earn a living. People like the third level and commuter operators, to say nothing of the major airlines, are extremely cost conscious and they are not talking to the Civil Aviation Authority when they have problems. They are not saying that they have these defects and are finding these failures with equipment or operational procedures. They are going their own way and they are concealing things because of the intense antipathy between the industry and the authority. That is wrong. You can never promote safety while that exists. There must be a cooperative partnership between the regulatory authority and the industry.

        It is in the interests of the Senate that we treat these amendments cognately. The first two amendments refer to a person not operating an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another person. The third of these amendments relates to the CASA bill. Regrettably, we are not yet in a position to move to the Air Services Bill.

        Some 26 treaties subject to ratification are being tabled. However, when one has regard to the other international instruments which are listed in the annexure to the red today, one sees a total of 117 international instruments. Of those instruments, some are conventions, some are ILO conventions, some are amendments to treaties and some are amendments to conventions. They are all instruments which are capable of having effect under the external affairs power in section 51(xxix) of the constitution, yet we do not have those available to us. I inform the Senate that my office requested copies of all those instruments. The only ones that my office has been able to obtain so far are the 26 treaties subject to ratification. I note that Senator Kemp, Senator Abetz and Senator Woodley have had the same experience.

         Recently, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said on a number of occasions that the tabling of treaties and international instruments every six months was a satisfactory way to inform the parliament, to inform the Senate, of the treaties and conventions that Australia was considering or had signed up to. This is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. In fact, tonight I have only five minutes in which to comment on any one of these international instruments listed here—all 117 of them.

         There is remarkable diversity contained in this document—the Conference on Disarmament, the test ban treaty, agricultural research, ILO conventions, the Antarctic, plants in the Pacific, genetic breeding, world intellectual property, international atomic energy, just to name a few. There are conventions dealing with human rights and discrimination against women, the rights of the child, and various amendments to that dealing with child labour and the like. So an extremely diverse area is covered by these international instruments and we have them all lobbed on us, as it were, in one bundle—all 117 of them—and this is the chance we get to comment on them.

         This is evidence as to why there is disquiet in the community at large in relation to the whole treaty signing process, the whole negotiation process but, more importantly, the lack of scrutiny as to how we sign up to international instruments. This is what the representatives of the Australian people get—five minutes in which to comment on 117 international instruments on the diverse subjects that I have mentioned. I think it is entirely unsatisfactory and the government must rethink how it deals with this.

         —I was not planning to intervene in the debate tonight but I was very much taken by the comments of my colleague Senator Ellison, who drew our attention to the fact that over 110 international instruments and treaties have been brought to the attention of the Senate today. This shows what a total farce the current system is. Of the ones which the government has apparently decided to ratify, we at least get one page which tells us what is included in the particular treaty. But there is no explanation for the rest of them—we have a heading and a contact number. If ever there was a demonstration of the need to get some proper process in the consideration of treaties, the tabling today of over 110 international instruments demonstrates that fact.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, you have taken a great interest in the treaty making activities of this parliament. I have noted the contributions you have made on this important issue, the concern you have expressed about the complaints that this government has allowed Australians to take to UN committees and your concern about the composition and procedures of those committees. It seems to me, looking through the information which has been given to us, that a number of other UN committees may well be able to receive complaints regarding Australian domestic disputes. It only looks to me this way; I have not received any advice on it. In fact, it is impossible in the short time available to ascertain precisely what this government is doing.

         It is interesting that it was regarded as an enormous initiative and leap forward that the government decided nine to 12 months ago to tell the parliament what particular treaties it was planning to negotiate. This was the great leap forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, in allowing greater scrutiny by the Senate—they would actually inform us of current treaty negotiations under way. I have five minutes in which to address over 110 instruments which have now been notified to the Senate. Of course that is an utterly impossible process.

         I bring once again to the attention of the parliament the fact that this process is a total farce. Explanations are not even given to this parliament for the very wide range of treaties that are being negotiated, some of which are of great importance. I suspect that quite a number of them may well enjoy very strong support in this parliament. Some of them may be regarded as controversial. Nonetheless, the explanations are simply not there. Again, as I have urged before, something has to be done to ensure that we establish a proper process in this parliament so that we can see what Senator Evans and his colleagues are doing in the international forum.

Treaty making under this government is undermining the sovereignty of this country, undermining the legislative role of the parliament and subverting the constitutional division of powers in this country between the Commonwealth and the states. It is in desperate need of reform. There must be much more public and parliamentary scrutiny of the treaty making processes in this country.

         The disaster that is occurring is that the parliament is  being made quite irrelevant to the treaty making process. That is important, because the treaty making process is one of law making. That is what was demonstrated in the Teoh case just recently. Great notice was served upon this government that, unbeknownst to it, it was now required to operate in its executive actions according to the 900 treaties that it has signed. It has caused absolute chaos in the law of Australia.

         The establishment of a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments will be an important reform of the next coalition government. There will be the implementation of domestic legislation prior to the ratification of treaties; a joint house treaties committee; and, most importantly—I am very pleased to see that this was put forward by the shadow foreign affairs minister—the parliamentary ratification of treaties. As a former foreign affairs officer, Mr Downer has paid respect to the proper role of government in this area. But, because of the actions of the government over the last 12 years, he has been brought to the view that it is now important that there be a proper process of the parliament ratifying treaties. That has been amply demonstrated by the consequences of the Teoh case.

         The current treaty making processes involve dictatorial behaviour of the worst kind. We really have a situation where the laws of this country are changed simply by the stroke of a ministerial pen. For the government to be running its whole republican agenda on the issue of sovereignty is absolutely and utterly laughable when we see the sovereignty of this country being stripped away by the whole treaty making process. The coalition will, upon its entry to government, restore the parliament to its proper role in the processes of law making in this country.

The reason they did not is that they have not quite kept up with the pace that the Legal and Constitutional Committee is setting.

That was not put aside, but it was stated that there is a lot of work in doing what was done here today in the listing of these treaties.

         I do not think this is an area where, as it were, there is great opposition to giving parliament a greater role. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have been mentioned in this context. That is not the situation; it is not that they oppose reform. The reality is that in foreign affairs there is a tradition that that role is conducted by the executive. Historically, the parliament had to approve the expenditure by government of sixpence, but the king could take the country to war. Certainly that situation has changed and ought to have changed. But it is proper to point out that it is not as though the executive has usurped the power that parliament used to have. It is rather a question of parliament taking on its duties in the light of changing conditions.

         —The tabling today in the Senate of 26 treaties which are currently subject to ratification serves to highlight the need for better mechanisms for parliamentary scrutiny of these treaties which the Australian government enters into. The Senate currently has before it legislation which would enable more adequate and meaningful scrutiny to be given to any of these treaties. It was recently introduced by my Democrat colleague Senator Vicki Bourne. I believe such a mechanism is very much needed, and I urge the Senate to give its support to Senator Bourne's bill at the earliest opportunity.

         A quick glimpse at just a few of these treaties shows that they are substantial documents and they are dealing with what, to some, may seem minor subjects, but which are not. For example, among the various treaties tabled, there is an agreement between Australia and Japan relating to Japanese tuna long-line fishing in Australian waters. It is only a subsidiary agreement to a previous agreement, but it is 10 pages in length. A question on notice I recently asked of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) established that tuna long-line fishing kills a huge number of albatross each year and is driving such albatross species close to extinction. I do not know whether or not this agreement addresses this issue at all. It may add to the problem, or it might help alleviate it. I simply do not know.

If we believe there is a problem of any sort with this treaty or any of the other treaties tabled today, there is nothing we can do about it. In effect, on each and every one, the government is saying to the Senate and to the people of Australia, `Trust us.' Given the enormous potential implications of many treaties for Australia and the globe's environment, economy and overall security, it is ridiculous that they are all implemented without any form of scrutiny.

         I am not opposed to the adoption of international agreements. On the contrary, the Democrats believe it is crucial that issues be considered on a global scale, and Australia should be involved in the consideration of these issues at a national government level. I am not even suggesting that the Senate knows better than the government what should be in such agreements, but what the Democrats are saying is that there should be a role for the parliament, particularly for the Senate as a house of review. This is the purpose for which the Senate was established—as an elected chamber which would serve as a check on government. This is why the Senate should support Senator Bourne's bill, for it provides a mechanism for scrutiny of the actions and decisions of government on issues which are of national and global importance.

        My desire was to talk in relation to both matters but, of course, time does not allow me to do so. We have had a very shoddy treatment of the Senate today by the government's tabling of documents. First of all, we had the 26 treaties which have been referred to by Senator Margetts and other speakers. Now I turn to item 5 on the red, which deals with `Multilateral Treaties Under Negotiation or Under Consideration for Australian Government Signature or Adherence (see pages 13—19)'. We are dealing, literally, with six pages of fairly tightly typewritten treaties and multilateral agreements to which Australia is already a signatory but to which alterations are being sought.

         I was interested in some of those, so I sought from the Table Office advice in relation to some of these to get those documents. I was unable to do so. My office literally spent hours this afternoon pursuing these treaties and the changes that were being proposed. Indeed, it was as a result of all the phone calls—I think 20 in all—that my staff made that Senator Sherry came into the chamber to indicate that there was an error in relation to the government's agenda for the day in relation to this matter and that really what should have been tabled was, in fact, the document of the six pages that were attached to today's agenda or what is called `the government's red'.

I still do not know in relation to those six pages, dealing literally with tens of treaties, exactly what is being proposed, why it is being proposed, and why it is important that these alterations be made. Standing in this place as a representative of not only the people of Tasmania but also the people of Australia, I believe I have a right to know, and I ought to be able to get that information without the need for my staff to make 20 phone calls during the afternoon and still be no better off.

         I happen to have, for better or worse, the status of a senator. What on earth would the average person in the street do, after having made those 20 phone calls and been given the run around from the Table Office—and I do not blame them—and then to the various departments and ministerial offices, only to be given information which was deliberately removed from some of this documentation; namely, the telephone numbers and contact persons in relation to some of these treaties? The document we have has had those removed, but Foreign Affairs was able to fax it to our office finally, indicating all the contact persons that we could talk to about this. It really is indicative of the high-handed way this government deals with treaties.

Along with other environmentalists, the Australian Democrats have raised concerns about the major threat being posed to, amongst other species, the mahogany glider—already recognised as a highly endangered species—by the clearing of some of the glider's few remaining habitat areas. Despite some belated action by the Queensland government, this threat to the glider has not been removed. Excessive or inappropriate land clearing can cause major danger, not just to the mahogany glider, but to a wide variety of other animals and to the quality of the land and water upon which we all depend.

I ask any farmer who is thinking of engaging in indiscriminate tree-felling to think about the value of the vegetation and of the negative environmental and economic consequences which may occur down the track. Farming land covers vast and important parts of Queensland and is important not just for agricultural productivity but also for environmental productivity. Both of these aims need to be kept in balance. The Democrats call on the Queensland government to act responsibly in protecting the land and the significant species habitat in that state.

Whilst I would agree that in Tasmania too many trees are woodchipped and not enough go to the sawmills, it is certainly not true that 90 per cent of timber is woodchipped. It is ridiculous to claim the contrary. Further down there is a subheading which reads `Woodchipping hurts our economy'. The article continues:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Woodchip companies and sawmills pay Forestry Tasmania money (royalties) for the wood they take. But the money the logging companies pay for our wood falls well short of covering the cost of growing back and managing the forests.

       <para>
        That is simply not true. Since Forestry Tasmania has been incorporated it has returned a dividend to the state. Under the heading `Woodchipping destroys jobs' the article goes on to say:

None of those members has ever lobbied anybody for the purposes of seeing woodchips produced. What the members lobbied for—and rightly so—was to protect some of the jobs in the sawmilling industry.

         Whether the Wilderness Society likes it or not, it is a fact that the sawmilling industry needs to access some of its resources from native forests. This is an important debate within the community and it ought to be run on a factual basis. I encourage the Wilderness Society and other conservation groups to campaign on facts. At the end of the day it is true that our forests are a finite resource and we need to protect as much of them as possible.

         —Mr President, I rise with some regret to have to respond to the most scurrilous, filthy and crude allegation that could possibly be made against a member of the federal parliament. Could I read to you, with the indulgence of the Senate, a question that was asked today by Mr Kobelke, the shadow minister for police, in the Western Australian parliament? The question was addressed to Mr Wiese, the Minister for Police in the Western Australian government. The question was as follows:

        What action does the Minister intend to take following the Federal Police interview conducted with the Premier's political mentor Senator Crichton-Browne in Perth last Friday in relation to very serious criminal allegations that Senator Crichton-Browne had made threatening and obscene telephone calls to a federal Liberal politician in Perth and Canberra, including death threats?

I know that a number of the 120 who signed the original statement of concern, plus a number of others who have since indicated to me that they would have liked to have signed it before it went off—but these things are invariably done in a rush and it is difficult to get around to everybody—will be concerned. I hope the 119 other parliamentarians who did sign the statement and other parliamentarians will take whatever action they deem is appropriate.

         —Tonight I wish to submit to the Senate that the Income Tax Assessment Act is a deterrent to all best practice for most of Australian businesses operating under this regime. Not only does it impose extraordinarily high compliance costs on taxpayers, particularly on businesses, but many of the notions are outdated—dating back to 1936—and revenue driven. To start with, taxable income is not the same as net profit. This indeed is unfortunate. Rather than the gap between the two concepts of income narrowing, we find that recent government amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act result in a widening of that gap between those two concepts of income. That scenario is not good news for Australian business.

Tonight, I submit that a more fundamental or in-depth review is necessary. I would therefore wish to take some time of the Senate to outline just a few of the areas that need further review and examination.

         A recent feature of tax legislation has been the bringing forward of the receipt of moneys to account as assessable income or capital gains whilst at the same time denying or extending over time the allowability of deductions. An example of the former is the grouping of corporations into small, medium and large companies with lodgment and payment schedules causing work scheduling problems for accountants and tax agents, particularly in the first group, and cash flow financing problems for the medium sized corporations.

The result is that to the net operating profit has to be added the various provisions, minus the cash payments in respect of some of those provisions—provisions which were raised often many years ago—in order to arrive at a taxable income.

         It offends my sense of justice if the "proximity" rule is correct. If it is, that means that a wealthy person who at the point of closure of his business has the resources to satisfy all liabilities arising from that business gets all potential tax deductions, with a consequent reduction in tax liability. Yet his neighbour, for want of immediate resources, may have his tax liability increased because he has to toil for years to generate the funds to discharge his obligations.

         Also in the third tranche of legislative amendments affecting overseas income, known as the FIF regime, there are further examples of anomalies. Firstly, double taxation can arise where investors hold investments through managed investment funds. This is clearly unacceptable and it is up to the government to introduce appropriate amending legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Secondly, while the FIF scheme extends to options, convertible notes and similar instruments, there is no entitlement under the regime. These are all entitlements to acquire an interest in shares of a foreign company, but the FIF exemption extends only to shares and not to options, convertible notes and other instruments. Hence this drafting oversight falls into the category of a technical deficiency of part XI of the Income Tax Assessment Act and also needs amendment.

         The tax structure that a taxpayer chooses can also determine the bottom line of tax payable. A few examples include: salaries may be paid to principals of small companies and trusts, but partners and sole traders are subject to provisional tax. Secondly, retirement benefits paid to principals are deductible to companies and trusts, but there is no similar provision for sole traders and partners. Thirdly, superannuation for principals is largely deductible to companies and trusts whereas individuals and partners are only entitled to claim $3,000 plus 75 per cent of the excess over $3,000.

        (6) It has not been possible to access a copy of the report by Sir Henry Bland to the Prime Minister in 1976, but in his report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, the Hon. Mr Justice AE Woodward quoted the Bland Committee as finding the problem of overlapping State and Federal inspection systems to be intractable and the then existing dual system to be unsatisfactory. The Kelly Committee in 1980 recommended the formation of an independent national inspection service. The recommendations of the Report of the Royal Commission in 1982 allude to joint Commonwealth and State authorities for the administration of meat inspection. Prior to the 1980's there were dual meat inspection systems under which both the Commonwealth and States supplied meat inspection services at export registered premises with the Commonwealth exercising control over export meat and the States control over domestic meat. Mr Justice Woodward concluded that there was a compelling case for a single inspection service, but no simple solution for its achievement. He suggested as an interim arrangement in most States a joint meat inspection authority between the Commonwealth Government and the government of each State.

        (7) &amp; (8), (9) &amp; (10) The Government's primary objective in implementing full recovery of user attributable costs for meat inspection from 1991 was to give effect to its general policy that the beneficiaries of such services should pay for them. There were no associated implications for food safety, since no reduction in standards under the administration of AQIS was intended or anticipated. The introduction by AQIS of measures under which industry assumed greater direct responsibility for ensuring the safety of its products commenced in 1986 with the establishment of operational hygiene requirements under a code of practice. Subsequently AQIS has progressively introduced options for regulatory objectives to be achieved under quality assurance arrangements. Adoption by industry of officially sanctioned quality assurance under AQIS auditing has been subject to the criterion that the performance of systems under such an arrangement must be at least as good as under traditional inspection methods.

        (1) No. The Commission received a letter from a A J Hosken and Co, Barristers and Solicitors on September 21 1993, but it contained no reference to ss 11(f), 20 and 29 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The matter was registered as an inquiry, not a complaint. A reply to the letter was sent on the date in question, November 26 1993, in which the Commission advised Hosken and Co that the matters raised in their letter of September 21 1993 did not fall within the Commission's jurisdiction and recommended that assistance be sought from the West Australian Ombudsman. The file was then closed.

        (2) The Commission received a letter dated April 27 1994 referring to this matter. It contained the first reference of which the Commission is aware to ss 11(f), 20 and 29 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, and indicated that the Commission's letter of November 26 1993 had been received. The Commission has no correspondence relating to this matter dated October 11 1994.

        (3) The response of the Commission that it had no power to investigate the complaint was conveyed to A J Hosken and Co in the Commission's letter of November 26 1993. Mr Hosken advised in his letter of April 27 1994 that he had obtained legal advice to the effect that the Commission could investigate his complaint but he did not provide that advice to the Commission. Telephone contact was made with Mr Hosken on May 9 1994, but no further information was subsequently received in support of his complaint. Consequently no further action was taken. A letter reconfirming the Commission's view of the issues was sent to Mr Hosken on 18 May 1995.

        (5) The Commission is currently considering a number of matters relating to sexual preference, but none relating to alleged police harassment of gay men or gender discrepancies in the State or Territory Criminal Codes as to permissible age limits for certain sexual practices. Any such requests for action or advice would be declined as being outside the Commission's jurisdiction or they would be referred to an appropriate State agency for investigation.
