I remind the minister that, when last week's figures showed 740,000 Australians out of work and the position getting worse, Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, said `the economy is in a very nice position'. On what basis did the Prime Minister make those comments, when we have the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world, the second highest real interest rate in the same community and the second highest inflation rate—except for the last three months, when it was the worst in the OECD? What comfort is there for people struggling to deal with rising prices, rising unemployment and uncertainty about their mortgage rates?

         —The opposition continues in the role of being a serial assassin on the economy: talking down the Australian economy and undermining confidence. Fortunately, though, for the real economy—not the one that the opposition talks about in here, but the one that actually operates in the Australian community—we see, in terms of the indicators on business confidence and the indicators on consumer confidence, that, while certainly they have dipped a little from a very high spike, nonetheless in historic terms the levels of business confidence in the Australian economy and the levels of confidence exhibited in this economy by consumers remain very high. That may not encourage the opposition, which wants of course to talk down the economy. Nonetheless, the people out there who invest money and the consumers who purchase goods regard the economy as strong and, indeed, the economy is on a sustainable growth path.

         It is true that the underlying inflation rate has risen a little over the last six months, but it remains at extremely low levels—certainly at extremely low levels compared to the economy that Mr Howard presided over when he was Treasurer in which inflation was at 11.4 per cent, as I recall. Certainly we have broken the back of that. We are combining a solid growth performance with a moderate inflation performance and, for the first time in a generation, have got the levels of growth and inflation under control.

         The pick-up in inflation which we have seen comes on the back of four years of sustained economic growth in this country.

         The other part of this question focused on employment. The recent moderation in employment growth is not unexpected. It follows six months of extraordinary growth in employment.

Now that the economy has slowed and we have sustainable growth, we expect employment to grow.

Because the economy has been growing so strongly, it cannot generate sufficient product within the domestic economy and is sucking in goods from outside. That is one of the reasons why we have a high current account deficit. That is not because the economy is weak; that is because the economy is strong, Senator Hill. Maybe you do not know that.

         What has given rise to continuing anxiety and concern for the Western Australian business community is that the Premier of Western Australia, Dick Court, said at the time in which he withdrew these changes that he was doing so in order to force his legislation through by the end of the year. The industrial relations minister in Western Australia, Mr Graham Keirath, has countermanded that. In the weekend press, the Premier has come out and agreed with Mr Keirath that in fact the real reason why the Western Australian government has done a somersault on its industrial relations legislation is nothing at all to do with its own legislative program but is to do with the federal election.

         We have a situation in which the federal coalition and no doubt Mr Howard have prevailed upon the Western Australian government to remove their second wave of legislation and to therefore reduce the provocation to the workers of Western Australia, the consequential disruption to the economy and the consequential loss of faith in the Western Australian economy by investors, both domestic and foreign. They have done so for simply electoral purposes. This is not a clear signal of real intent; it is a signal of deceit—deceit that the changes that have now been withdrawn by the Western Australian government may be held back and then brought forward following a federal election in this country.

This man, who is increasingly seen as an ideologue with nothing more than militant intent to impose his ideology on the community, has created widespread discord in Western Australia.

The Australian business community is aware that the Western Australian industrial legislation is a trial horse for the Howard-Reith industrial legislation that they would visit nationally on Australia should they, unfortunately, win elective office in this country. The business community, which has recognised and valued the industrial calm and harmony created by this government—a government which has emphasised cooperation in the work place, not confrontation—appreciates that we are now going through a time during which we are enjoying the lowest level of industrial disputation since the war and since the industrial dispute figures have been collected. They are worried about the intent of the opposition in this case.

         The government has set up an industrial relations system in Australia which has decentralised wage fixing from a highly centralised system to one which is enterprise based. In the context of enterprise bargaining in the building sector—or in any other sector—claims will be served which are ambit in nature and which will be supported by the unions and rejected by employers. One hopes in all of those cases that the two parties can get together to amicably negotiate an outcome to which they both feel bound, and productivity grows as a consequence.

The opposition says it has a safety net in place. It is a very narrow safety net. If you were a trapeze artist, it would be like trying to fall onto a tightrope. Our safety net is a very broad one which protects real workers, and their real interests, and enables them to bargain with some dignity with their employers. If the opposition wants to escape the perception of the Australian people about its policies, one of the things it has to do is adopt our principles in terms of award protection and worker protection by having a dinkum safety net to protect individual workers.

And, once again, I am the wrong minister to ask these questions of because I do not come here with a brief from the Minister for Industrial Relations. If you want to ask him those questions, ask him. But I suspect that he would say something like this: unlike the coalition, we as government are not going to insert ourselves in every industrial dispute between the parties, and we are not going to judge the competing arguments that the parties put forward. What we are going to do is create a framework for the parties to negotiate successfully, basically on the grounds of growing productivity to fund wage increases, and do so without taking sides in that in order that the outcome of those negotiations can be the property of both parties, affirmed by them and therefore supported and carried through by them. That is our policy. We do not want to put the government in every workplace in Australia, like you do.

         Whether the coalition likes it or not—and obviously it doesn't very much—the need for international cooperation on the environment is increasing rather than diminishing. And this government does take its responsibility as a good international citizen seriously. We also take very seriously our responsibility to protect the environment, using such constitutional mechanisms as are reasonably available to us. The difficulty about the opposition is that it is caught in a time warp between, on the one hand, the hairy-chested posturing to those it has tried to convince that the government is misusing the external affairs power and, on the other hand, the green constituency that it is belatedly—and now incompetently—trying to woo.

         So let us look at where we did use the external affairs power during the 1980s when he said that it was misconceived. The facts are that it was used by us in a way that the opposition hated then and continues to hate now to protect the Franklin River, to stop logging in the Wet Tropics, to stop the building of the Quaid Road, just north of Cairns, and to stop logging in the Lemonthyme and the southern forests of Tasmania. I ask the opposition: which of those uses of the external affairs power in the 1980s was inappropriate? Which was inappropriate then? Which would be inappropriate now?

         Moreover, the government has much more recently used the external affairs power at Hinchinbrook to prevent the Great Barrier Reef from an inappropriate development which we all know about. Senator Kemp was asked his views about this. He simply did not know what to say. He stumbled and fumbled, and he said that the use of powers came under an act of parliament. Of course it came under an act of parliament. One would have thought that after eight months in the job he would have worked out that the act which was used, the act of parliament which was at issue here to protect the Great Barrier Reef, was exactly the same act of parliament enacted in reliance on the external affairs power that was used to save the Franklin and the rainforests of North Queensland.

         The point about that act of parliament was not that it was an act of parliament but that it was an act of parliament built in reliance on the external affairs power. It was an act to implement the World Heritage Convention. It was introduced by the Labor government in 1983, and we remain very proud indeed of that particular piece of legislation and never make any apology for it.

         The particular issue, finally, of forests is one on which the opposition was left conspicuously stumbling yesterday. Senator Kemp was asked what he thought the opposition's view was on the government's endeavour to protect additional forests. The government, of course, supports the world-class 15 per cent reserve criteria. The opposition did not answer the question: does it support that 15 per cent criteria? Does it support the much weaker 10 per cent criteria proposed by the Liberal state government? You did not tell us yesterday. You cannot tell us. You made a goose of yourself.

I just want to point out to Senator Campbell: the most recent ABS data indicates that, over the year to October 1995, the teenage unemployment rate increased in seasonally adjusted terms from 28.3 per cent to 29 per cent, and the number of full-time unemployed teenagers showed a slight increase of 200 to 95,600. Over the year to September 1995, however, the latest ABS data shows that, in original terms, the unemployment rate of the 20- to 24-year-old group fell from 12.6 per cent to 11.6 per cent.

         The government acknowledges, of course, that youth unemployment continues to be a serious problem. It has introduced a range of measures, including Austudy, Working Nation's youth training initiative, and the recently announced jobs pathway guarantee program. These initiatives are delivering more opportunities than ever before for young people to participate in education and training which will, of course, lead to full-time employment.

         I want to point out to the opposition that the training initiative and the Working Nation initiatives, which over a four-year period run into several billion dollars of expenditure, are aimed at improving particularly the opportunities for young people to get training and to get jobs through the subsidy schemes to employers. If you care to go and talk to a range of employers around Australia, like those of us in the government have been doing, you will find they are very well received.

There has not been a suggestion anywhere of what you would do for youth unemployment.

         The last time we heard anything from the opposition about youth unemployment—and it has never been commented further upon, revoked or whatever—was the suggestion that the youth wage in Australia should be reduced to $3 per hour. That is the last time you people made a comment about policy objectives for youth unemployment. That was over three years ago. Since then, you have been utterly silent. So it is extraordinary hypocrisy for you to come in here and weep crocodile tears about youth unemployment when you do nothing but attack the Working Nation initiatives.

Firstly, as I understand it, rent of at least $2 million per annum will be paid. Secondly, as I identified earlier in answer to your question, there will be the generation of 615 jobs directly or indirectly, and that is not a bad start.

The point I was making is that, for example, the Western Australian government would argue that it is contributing to micro-economic reform by its labour market deregulation, yet we all know that the provocative nature of that labour market deregulation has in fact created anxiety for workers, led to industrial disputation, broken down Australia's industrial harmony, created bad figures on strikes per 1,000 employees in Australia and shaken business confidence in Australia. I do not believe that that is micro-economic reform. Nonetheless, some conservative governments trumpet around Australia that things that they do that follow their own ideological bent are micro-economic reform. They give micro-economic reform a bad name.

         What this government is concerned about—I think this comes close to what Senator Harradine was referring to—is the Hilmer report into competition policy. We and the states jointly sponsored that report. It finds that a range of initiatives should be taken at Commonwealth and state level to introduce competition to public sector monopolies in order that, through competition, the price of the service delivered by those public sector monopolies is reduced and efficiencies are found to do that.

         Obviously, this has to be seen in the context of the overall reform agenda of the Australian government. We have opened up the Australian economy and reduced tariff protection at a speed and in a way that has not burned off Australian industry—we have allowed it to face international competition and grow stronger—and we are now exporting many more manufactured goods, particularly higher value added manufactured goods, than ever before. That is a positive response to the opening up of the economy. But, if only the trade exposed sector of the economy bears the brunt of reform and you do not reform the non-trade exposed area of the economy, in the end Australia will lose its competitive edge and Australian companies in the trade exposed sector will be overwhelmed by international competition. Therefore, our thrust as government has been to push for opening up the economy, internationalising it through tariff change and the removal of non-tariff barriers, while at the same time engaging in a bold program of micro-economic reform. In this context I mean true reform and not the sorts of ideological things given the name of reform that some state governments wish to pursue. I would not describe as classic micro-economic reform what a number of state governments do; it is not aimed at finding greater efficiencies.

         When efficiencies are found, input costs to business are cheaper, the level of competitiveness of those businesses grows, our share of the international economy grows and jobs are created in Australia.

         One of the other classics, and one that I have talked about in this chamber fairly frequently, is the decision of the South Australian government to outsource the state's water management facilities and not allow a single Australian company to bid for the management of that process.

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I happen to agree with the minister that the Western Australian government's amendments to the industrial relations legislation are certainly not micro-economic reform in the true sense. But from your response can I take it that what you are really saying is that the micro-economic reform involving the privatisation of utilities that I have mentioned has not benefited workers? How has it benefited workers, particularly workers with families? Their power bills are going up. It is a user pays situation. They are going to be charged extra for landing taxes and the like. Can you describe how people are likely to benefit, because I believe that you are admitting that they will not benefit.

         —The airports will generate further ongoing capital investment in the airport industry—particularly the Badgerys Creek airport—and open up the gateway to New South Wales. That is a very positive change. The essential principle I am getting at is that, if you create greater efficiencies and reduce input costs to private sector business, you reduce their costs and increase their ability to compete in the international market. That creates jobs for Australians. That is the sort of reform that we are about. Some of the states are more concerned about things other than that—and where they are, I have criticised them. What are the advantages to workers? If they have cheaper electricity, cheaper water and cheaper everything else, it is an advantage to their living standards.

The decision to ground the Nomads a year ago was due to a particular mechanical problem that had to be rectified in Nomads throughout the world.

         My presumption is that the hiring of a civilian Nomad was still within the envelope in which the Nomads are quite useful. Taking the absolute coverage of what we require of such a fixed-wing plane, its utility is no longer there. That is not to say that the plane per se is bad. It is not to say that the plane's safety record is necessarily worse than many other equivalent planes. A lot of the figures have been done.

We hire a number of fixed-wing planes to do the job that military Nomads once did, and we will continue to do so. What I will do for you, though, is check to make sure that the method of using that particular civilian Nomad in no way trespassed the envelope in which they were required to fly.

In my view it would never have proceeded at all. There has been considerable success overseas with the suppression and eradication of this particular fly by using a bait which is in fact very safe. It is a sexual attractant bait which attracts the male flies. After they are attracted in pursuit of the sex bait, they die in the attempt.

         For the senator's information, bait spraying and the methyl eugenol male annihilation strategy will commence this week in Mossman, Mareeba and outlying infestations to suppress the suspected breeding populations prior to the wet season. During this initial phase, intensive information gathering on the spread of the fly will proceed to assist decisions on whether a full-scale eradication program will be feasible. I expect that a decision on whether a full-scale eradication program will be feasible will be available around mid-December after technical, economic, environmental and public health issues are considered.

         —Further to an answer I gave Senator Sandy Macdonald about hepatitis C and Interferon, I have some information for the senator. The Commonwealth is committed to providing funding to meet the drug costs of Interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C outpatients of public hospitals in all states and territories. Comprehensive details of nominated treatment centres may be obtained from state and territory health departments.

          Section 100 of the National Health Act provides for the Commonwealth to make grant payments to states  and territories for the provision of highly specialised drugs for community based hospital patients. Interferon is one such drug subsidised under these arrangements since 1 October 1994.

         While the government will meet the drug costs for eligible patients on the program, the decision to provide therapy and other associated services is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. The provision of services and drugs for hospital in-patients is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. Although the relatively recent availability of Interferon treatment has placed pressures on some specialist hospital clinics, the location of treatment centres and the prioritisation of patient waiting lists for Interferon treatment are issues for state and territory governments.

         At the same time, it is understood that some patients may be referred inappropriately early to these specialist services because some general practitioners are uncertain of how to treat hepatitis C. In response, the NHMRC is currently developing appropriate and accurate laboratory, clinical and treatment guidelines, particularly targeting GPs who have an important ongoing role in the management of people with hepatitis C. It is anticipated that these guidelines will shortly be available for a second stage public consultation.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Parer this day, relating to industrial relations and a wage claim in the building industry.

       <para>
        A 15 per cent across-the-board wage claim is being pursued by the building workers union and supported by the ACTU president, Jennie George. One can only deduce from Senator Cook's answer today that the government has abandoned, at least in the lead-up to the election, their position with regard to enterprise bargaining and productivity based increases as far as wages are concerned for the building industry. Apart from the metal trades unions, the building industry unions are the strongest in this country. They also have a record of taking industrial action to pursue their claims. The minister knew that.

        It is in this section of the industry that the union enjoy a monopolistic control of the supply of labour.

        Today the minister, in handling his portfolio, had the opportunity to comment on Senator Parer's question that this claim would lead to increased inflationary pressures and the loss of 20,000 jobs on top—I underline `on top'—of the 80,000 it is predicted will be shed as a result of the collapse of the home building industry.

         With this claim and with what is occurring with the collapse of the home building industry, we are looking at a loss of some 100,000 jobs. Not only does it indicate a very significant change of position in terms of what the government is doing as far as its wages policy is concerned, but it also indicates a very significant change with the advent of Jennie George, following Martin Ferguson, as President of the ACTU.

         The question that I want answered by the government is: is this an election ploy in the lead-up to the election or is this a fundamental change in their policy positions in terms of dealing with enterprise bargaining and productivity wage increases? When we look around Australia there is much evidence of companies that have moved on productivity based enterprise agreements and there have been significant improvements in the performance of those businesses and also the take-home pay of the employees. I particularly refer to some of the major mining operations in Western Australia. For example, Hamersley Iron increased productivity and has increased the take-home pay of the employees who work there.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is a very backward step of the government in this particular case and in this particular answer from Senator Cook not to come out quite clearly and make the point that they did not support the position adopted by the building industry unions in this case and the President of the ACTU, Jennie George. One can only conclude that that major shift is an election ploy to placate to the masters who control this government when it comes to matters of this nature and will lead to a further loss of jobs, further breakdown in the housing industry and further breakdown in the commercial and industrial sectors of the building industry.

         The worst aspect of the changed position is that it will flow, as do decisions involved in the metal trades industry, through other industries. This government is taking us back to the bad old days when it was the strong who extracted the most out of the workplace and showed little concern for the required productivity growth and the required purpose of keeping people in work and in a job.

         —I am curious about this motion to take note of the answer given by Senator Cook, but I think it is beginning to highlight where the opposition is coming from with regard to industrial relations. To the best of my knowledge, the government has not changed its position on industrial relations. We entered into an agreement, known as the Accord, with the trade union movement that set down two principal things: firstly, an agreement with regard to across-the-board safety net wage increases; and, secondly, an agreement with regard to the creation of employment. That is more than anything that the opposition has ever done. But that does not mean that the government will intervene, as Senator Cook rightly outlined to the opposition, in the negotiations that may occur between unions or workers and employers. That is their right. That has been a traditional right since we have been in power—we have enabled negotiation.

         The opposition would say that enterprise bargaining is the way to go, and they support that. It is a bit odd when, shock horror, somebody has put in a claim for 15 per cent across a period of two years and you want the government to come the heavy thump on them. That is a very enlightening position to take because it does point true to what you will do if you happen to win government with regard to industrial relations.

It sets down two very important things—the ACTU is very committed to that—with regard to both wage increases and employment creation. That is what it is really about. You people really need to stand up and put your proposal on the table so that it can be considered by the Australian workers.

I think that is a very important point and I think Senator Cook rightly pointed out that it is not the government's role to get involved in every single negotiation, whether it be with the metal trades industry unions or the building unions. It is their right, either collectively or individually—and I have heard your leader say this—to put up a proposal to negotiate. That is exactly what I would say the unions have done. If I were the employer, I would be negotiating some form of arrangement for the future. That is what enterprise bargaining, collective or individual, is all about.

Senator Cook talks about going out and speaking to the community.

         The facts of life are these. Those enterprise bargaining agreements are a mirror image of one another. They are like Chairman Mao's tunics. In my question to Senator Cook, which he did not respond to, I referred to the Master Builders Association. There was mention of an across-the-board 15 per cent increase, which has nothing to do with productivity increases. I have spoken to the master builders, and they are worried, particularly in south-east Queensland and New South Wales, with just cause. One of the points they made to me—and they told me the same thing though different people are involved: the CFMEU in Queensland and Senator Cook's union, the BWIU, in Western Australia—is that in the south-east corner of Queensland there are some 100 or so enterprise agreements on the table for employers to sign.

In south-east Queensland there is something like 14 months of housing stock. Is it any wonder that the building industry has collapsed? We have zero growth. It is no good the government people and the labour people turning around, as they are at the moment, and trying to blame coalition-run states. In my own state of Queensland we have the highest unemployment rate in Australia, with the Goss Labor government.

         When talking about enterprise bargaining, my mind is brought back to a comment that was made by the National Party candidate for Capricornia, Mr Paul Marek, who is not only a former vice-president of the metalworkers union but a union member still. He basically said that the problem with much of the enterprise bargaining these days is caused not by the grassroots of the union movement—the shop committees—but by the ACTU coming in over the top and saying, `Irrespective of what you or your members want to do to create jobs, to create productivity and to create opportunities, we're not going to allow you to agree to anything—not one single thing—which might be contrary to some of the award conditions.'

         This is most clearly borne out in what has happened at the AMH works in Rockhampton. In this dispute, the union on the shop floor had been prevailed upon by its members in the workplace to enter into an agreement with the company. What subsequently happened was that ACTU officials were sent up from Melbourne to tell the union members on the shop floor that they could not enter into this sort of agreement because it was contrary to the basic principles of the award.

         The problem is that we have a government which has imposed legislation which entrenches the power of monolithic union dinosaurs like the ACTU. That is the problem. Senator Murphy can come into the chamber—in all good conscience, I am sure—and say, `This government does not want to get involved in individual disputes,' and that is a very convenient thing for the government to say.

         But the point is this: the government does not need to get involved in individual disputes on behalf of its client, the ACTU, because it has written the legislation in such a way as to give the ACTU enormous power—power to intervene in disputes, even though the people in the work place are quite happy to enter into an agreement with their employers. The real battle here is a battle to give the workers a say in their future. This is recognised by the workers, it is recognised by the people on the shop floor—and that is why the government is so terribly scared about the monster they have created. Ordinary workers are starting to understand that they are being overridden by the ACTU, by the powerbrokers in Melbourne.

The government is creating a bogeyman out there to justify the legislation, which it has created, which takes away from ordinary workers their rights to enter into an agreement of their choosing.

         The government is saying all of this to entrench the power of its mates in the union hierarchy of the ACTU. Mr Marek, the National Party candidate for Capricornia, has it absolutely spot on when he says the real problem is that the ACTU has become unrepresentative of the aspirations of ordinary workers, in the same way as their political representatives, the Labor Party, have lost sight of the aspirations of ordinary working men and women.

However, I would first answer the interjection which was just made by Senator Murphy—a very lonely sight on the Labor side, along with Senators Kernot and Gareth Evans who are engaged in a private conversation. But other than Senator Evans, Senator Murphy is the only one left trying to defend Senator Cook. But on this side we have a good half dozen or more people. Of course, only one of us is needed against all of them, so it is very unfair for all of us to contribute to this debate against Senator Murphy. The only correct comment that Senator Murphy made during his contribution to this debate was that he would try to extricate himself from this `ridiculous situation'—he, of course, being the perpetrator of the ridiculous situation in which he found himself.

         The simple fact is that industrial relations in this country is being run by a government that is beholden to the trade union movement. If you have a look through the ranks of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Murphy is a classic example: former union hack or official I suppose would be more parliamentary. These people use the trade union movement to get onto the gravy train to get into parliament and try to enjoy themselves. Some of us have made a financial sacrifice to enter this parliament to serve the people of Australia because we see that as our calling.

         The building workers union have just pursued a 15 per cent across-the-board wage claim. The ACTU President, Jennie George, supports that. The simple question is: does the government support that? Senator Cook went around and around and never came to the point to answer whether or not the government supports a 15 per cent wage increase. Does Senator Murphy support the 15 per cent wage increase? Tell us: do you or don't you? Senator Murphy, like Senator Cook, remains silent on that specific issue.

Let him go public and I hope he issues a media release to tell the world he supports it because what that means is a loss of an extra 20,000 jobs, according to the Master Builders Association. Whilst Senator Murphy might be parading around in this parliament saying he is concerned about the workers, their conditions, their wages and their lifestyle, what sort of wages will they be paid and what sort of lifestyle will they enjoy if they are denied the right to a job? Eight hundred thousand plus are currently denied a job because of Senator Murphy and the Labor government policies that have been inflicted upon this country.

         What the Labor Party is seeking to do in the run up to the election is set up these straw people—I will not say straw men because that is sexist these days—to knock them down. Those opposite go around scaremongering about things which in fact are not part of our policy. What I can tell Senator Murphy is that our policy is about choice for workers. If they want to join a trade union they can, but they will not be denied a right to a living because they do not want to join a trade union—something which has been fundamental to the Labor Party's philosophy and to its funding.

         Secondly, we are against compulsory trade union fees being used for political donations to the Australian Labor Party—another clear policy that the workers of this country are rejoicing about. They support those policy stances. You know they do and that is why you are so concerned. If we get into government, workers might actually be given a choice as to who they want to represent them in industrial matters. They will have a choice as to whether their trade union fee, if they want to pay one, will actually find its way to the Labor Party. That is the clear distinction. We have policies and we will be supported by the working people of this country.

         —As my colleagues have said, particularly Senator Abetz, it is alarming that the government should let the opportunity go by to distance itself from an across the board wage claim being pursued by the Building Workers Union, which will have the result of seeing possibly tens of thousands of Australians, particularly young Australians, forced out of the labour market. This comes only days after it has been announced that the youth unemployment rate has actually risen by one per cent over the last quarter. It has gone up from 28.1 per cent at the time the Working Nation statement commenced to just over 29 per cent, which was the figure released last weak.

         I am alarmed at this because, having spoken to a number of young building workers in various parts of Australia over recent months and just recently in south-east Queensland—the home state of Senator Parer, who has contributed to this debate already—I know they are very, very scared about their futures. They just want to have a job—a well paid job, good working conditions and the protection that the industrial relations system can deliver them. But the main thing they are worried about is keeping their job. They are very scared, Senator Murphy, as you would know. I presume you talk to these people as well.

         The other thing Senator Cook said in response to the question during question time is that if you speak to the people in industry generally they are scared about our industrial relations system. I have to say that Senator Cook is talking to different people from those we are talking to. From discussions I have had with both small business people and large employers, the one thing they are most concerned about in industrial relations at the moment is the unfair dismissal provisions. They are very concerned about those provisions which are acting as a disincentive to business going out and employing people.

Even as a young man after the war of 1948, he was involved in negotiations separating the forces, as well as having been involved in the fighting. He was a hero in every major event in Israel's survival thereafter. His life as a warrior, diplomat, politician and statesman was of a piece . . .

        Prime Minister Rabin's vision was for an Israel living free from conflict with its Arab neighbours. He well understood the force of that very wise statement by David Ben-Gurion back in the 1940s at the time of the foundation of Israel that the new country could be Jewish, it could be democratic and it could occupy the whole of the biblical land of Israel, but it could not be all three. Yitzhak Rabin recognised that peace on the principle of land for peace was the only way forward for Israel. He dedicated his political energies to advancing the peace process.

         During his second term as Prime Minister from 1992, he did make an historic contribution—and it is now universally acknowledged—to the achievement of progress in the Middle East peace process, a contribution for which, with his colleague Shimon Peres and his negotiating partner, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, he was very appropriately awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

That commitment was known, respected and indeed admired throughout the Middle East and also, I am sure, among some of the most hard-headed and hard-nosed of his opponents, or negotiating partners as it is perhaps preferable to call them.

         Born in Jerusalem in 1922 of Ukrainian parents who migrated to Palestine at the end of the First World War, Mr Rabin was for much of his life a career soldier. He undertook agricultural studies at workers' school but this was forgone as he embarked on his military career when he joined the Palmarch, an underground commando unit. Mr Rabin was a brigade commander during the Israeli war of independence in 1948. In 1963 he had risen to the most senior of military ranks when he became Israel's military chief of staff. Israel's victory in the six-day war against Egypt, Syria and Jordan was directly attributable to his military strategies and leadership.

         History will undoubtedly record that the leadership shown by Yitzhak Rabin was instrumental in securing the peace process in the Middle East. In reaching out to Israel's traditional enemies, and more particularly to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Mr Yasser Arafat, Mr Rabin went much further than anyone might have imagined possible. His vision and commitment to the peace process were all the more remarkable given his own background as a former army general. Yet it was probably because of this background as a military man and the credibility he had built up over the years on security issues that Yitzhak Rabin was able to convince so many of his fellow Israelis to follow his government down the road to peace.

The best way to ensure this, I think, is for the international community to do everything it can to ensure that a just and lasting peace is set in place in the Middle East and that this peace will survive any challenges that are thrown at it, including those that come from the extremist elements that unfortunately can fester in such circumstances.

         I heard most keenly the reference that the widow of Prime Minister Rabin made to the environment for extremism, which is made possible if there is less than full responsibility by each member of the community in any nation and by the members of the opposition. If the spectrum of rhetoric gives any room for an evil act, it makes that evil act more possible. I do not know how to evaluate the environment of the rhetoric that the opposition, Likud, has contributed in Israel. I only hear the words of the widow, Mrs Rabin.

One of the messages that comes to me from this terrible act is that we in all nations should give no room for extremism or for violence.

Those senators who have visited my room—many of you have—particularly in the year following 25 September 1993, will have noticed that there was a photograph of Prime Minister Rabin, Chairman Arafat and President Clinton in the famous handshake which marked the conclusion of the peace process. Senators know that I have been involved through all my years in the Senate in foreign affairs matters. I regarded the end of the Cold War as one of the great victories of my time in this place. It has been contributed to from all over the world. The other great victory was this five-year peace process being launched by that famous handshake. All of us in this chamber metaphorically stood around Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat as they came together in this creative and unique way, a way that we welcomed.

In speaking today, I wish to mention some quotes from Prime Minister Rabin in his own growing realisation of this fact. In the early 1990s Prime Minister Rabin became convinced that it was time for Israel to try in earnest to conclude a political settlement with its increasingly discontented Palestinian population and its Arab neighbours. This was in response to what was seen by many people as a world break-out of peace in areas which would never conceivably happen at the end of the Cold War. Prime Minister Rabin said:

        It was seen to be a concern that Israel not be left behind with the changing international climate. There are many facets to security which cannot be secured by guns or bombs.

         Yitzhak Rabin was very aware of the need for an integrated approach to peace which realised that the mistrust and insecurity of neighbouring countries must be addressed at its source—the desire for a homeland, for an economic base, for self-determination and, of course, for peace. Unfortunately, it is all too easy for the peace between countries to be replaced by conflict within countries, especially as the new internationalism may help to accentuate the gap between rich and poor and associated differences in access to resources. Yitzhak Rabin's own statements in November 1993 recognise that there were many elements in creating peace. He recognised that there was a real need for self-determination in Palestine. He said:

        What he was doing was a very brave thing to do. The legacy of all peacemakers is to work towards building real security, an absence of fear, an equitable society which recognises that desperation can lead to desperate measures. I ask today that we should all work as peacemakers in our own region—to recognise the need for real and lasting security and, as Prime Minister Rabin has done, to build peace and maintain it as a precious gift.

         Throughout many of his 73 years, Yitzhak Rabin was at the centre of nearly every major event in his nation's history, and collectively it was in a whole range of areas. For much of his career, he was a military figure and a military leader. He was also a diplomat, being the Israeli Ambassador to the United States for five years. His political life stretched over more than 20 years as a member of the Knesset. He was elected to the Knesset in December 1973 and became Prime Minister for the first time four or five months later than that—I think in April 1974.

         He was also the defence minister for almost seven years, during which time many advances towards peace were made and the security of Israel's defence situation was reached. He capped a distinguished career as a peacemaker, in terms of the recognition of it, with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. That was seen throughout the world as recognition which was extremely well deserved. He worked for many years to achieve peace in the Middle East, to bring a closer relationship and understanding between Israel and its Middle East neighbours. Very importantly, it was his efforts and that of others—Yasser Arafat and his colleague Shimon Peres—that led to the 1993 accord with the PLO on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank. That was followed by a long series of negotiations with other Israeli neighbours, culminating in the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan just 12 months ago, in October 1994. Since then, there have been further developments along the path of the peace process. There is still a long way to go. But due to his efforts, very importantly, that peace process has proceeded down the path towards eventual success.

It was a state which was still trying to consolidate its position in the area; a state which had no social intercourse with any of its neighbours—the only way of getting into Israel was, as Senator Baume mentioned, through the Mandelbaum Gate crossing no-man's-land, which I remember vividly as well.

         Certainly Prime Minister Rabin had a remarkable political life in Israel—a person who was born there in the 1920s, was a fighter for Israel's independence through all those wars, became Prime Minister in the 1970s, lost office and then returned nearly 20 years later to become Prime Minister again. He then became the leader for the peace movement and the establishment of the dialogue and now, what we all hope for, a permanent settlement with the Palestinian people.

         There is no doubt that, in any terms of history, very few people in any country will play such a role as Prime Minister Rabin played in his country through his whole life. Clearly, he has been a remarkable figure in this century in terms of human events.

         —I rise to support this motion and at the outset offer my condolences to the family of Yitzhak Rabin, and particularly to the people in the state of Israel and the members of the Jewish community in Australia. I came across a quote the other day in relation to this matter which I thought was rather interesting. It is entitled `Soldier of peace'. It states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The soldier lived to become a man of peace, yet the man of peace met the death of a soldier, his body torn by bullets. Perhaps there is no contradiction in the first part of the statement, only a paradox. We justify war by saying that it begets peace, that through death we bring life, and so on. By this logic, the Yitzhak Rabin who led Israel's army to triumph in the Six Day War shares everything but tactics with the Yitzhak Rabin who shook the hand of Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn. The warrior and the conciliator formed two  sides of the same soul, seeking one result.

        And so it was that on the weekend, at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, we remembered the sacrifices made by people who fought for this country in the endeavour to find peace. I believe that one can draw a comparison with that when one looks at the life of Yitzhak Rabin. Not only was he involved in fighting for his country in the 1940s and in the Arab-Israeli war in 1948 and in the Six-Day War, in which he played such a crucial role, but also he was involved in securing the state of Israel's security in the years after that.

         Of course, he himself stated that the time had come to stop war, to stop the bloodshed and to endeavour to resolve the matter. In fact, in the same speech Senator Short quoted from—it was to be his last speech, to 100,000 or so people gathered for a peace rally—he said:

         As we once took up our role in war, we must now work to find a solution to the most complex issue of the Israeli-Arab conflict, the Israeli-Palestinians conflict. It is not easy, it is painful, but there is no alternative.

        Unfortunately, it takes great men—and there are very few of them—like Yitzhak Rabin to realise when there has been too much war, when there has been too much bloodshed, and when the time has come for the killing to stop. Unfortunately, as frail human beings we seem to have a history of going through a cycle of war and killing and then peace. It seems to be a never-ending cycle in the history of man.

         But always at the crossroads there are remarkable men like Yitzhak Rabin who say to their fellow human beings, `Enough is enough. There is no alternative. We must now seek peace. The end to all this killing has come.' But, of course, usually in such cases those people pay the ultimate price. One has only to look through history to see where great men and women have paid the ultimate price. So it was that he paid the ultimate price after that speech to that peace rally.

         I think we have to reflect on the times we now face, which are very different to the times Yitzhak Rabin faced in the 1960s, 1970s and perhaps the early 1980s. We do have a very different world today. We have a world without a Berlin Wall, we have a world where eastern Europe has changed dramatically and we even have a situation where there are endeavours for peace in Ireland.

         So hopefully the time has come when we are entering into a new era of peace in this world although, unfortunately, that does not exist in Bosnia. I think it is incumbent on us as leaders of our country to endeavour to keep the fight for peace going. I think Yitzhak Rabin's contribution in this regard should be upheld and maintained and perhaps his death used as a marker for good. Perhaps we can use that as a rallying point, a focal point, to keep alive the peace prospects in the Middle East and, more importantly, the endeavours for peace worldwide.

         When I heard of Mr Rabin's death, I wrote a letter to the ambassador expressing, on my own behalf as a senator for Tasmania, my condolences. I expressed those condolences also on behalf of my family and indeed I expressed a hope that peace would prevail. To those who hope for peace, Mr Rabin's assassination was a great shock, particularly so for those who pray daily for peace. That was evident at our local parish church on the morning after the assassination when the celebrant and the congregation offered prayers for Mr Rabin, for the people of Israel and for all the people living in the Middle East, and particularly for peace.

         I visited Israel in April this year as a guest of the Knesset and, together with the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, hosted a dinner for Prime Minister Rabin at the famous King David Hotel in Jerusalem. Also, because I was sitting next to her, I had a very long discussion with the Prime Minister's wife, Leah, and I must say I was impressed with her knowledge of Australia, with her very deep knowledge of Australian art and with her fondness for Australia—particularly for the city of Melbourne, but for Australia as a whole.

         I found both of them to be extremely engaging people. Mr Rabin was, above all, a realist who had seen the limits of what could be gained from war and knew that, if there were to be any lasting peace, real changes would have to be made. His land for peace policies were based on pragmatic confidence building measures designed to lock Palestinians into ever increasing responsibilities for the peace process. He could do this because the majority of Israelis knew him to be tough in ensuring their own security yet willing to try a new path to peace. He had seen how the intifada had broadened the scope of the conflict and how the policies of the past had alarmed even those close friends of Israel. He was aware of the risks from those who believed might would always be right. But he did not waiver in his determination.

         However, it must have been extremely hurtful to him to have been called a Nazi by some Jews, knowing how offensive that association is to all Jews. Yet he carried on. As others have already said, I can only hope that his untimely death continues to unify the people of Israel and that they press ahead with the peace program. As has already been alluded to, polls yesterday showed that the vast majority of Israelis want this to happen. It would be a fitting tribute if his death were a catalyst in some sort of existentialist way, if that is not in conflict with Judaism, for real peace in the Middle East.

         The Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing was established by resolution of the Senate on 2 September 1993. On 27 October 1993 the Senate referred to the committee for inquiry and report the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1993, a private senator's bill.

         The committee received 125 submissions and 12 supplementary submissions, in addition to a number of written responses to evidence and submissions. It took oral evidence at public hearings over 7 hearing days in November 1993 and January and March in 1994. The report of the committee was tabled in the Senate on 30 August 1994. An interim government response was tabled on 29 November 1994. The interim response stated that the government would endeavour to present a comprehensive response in February 1995. However, the government response was deferred to await the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the protection of confidential and third party information, the report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the government response to the public service act review group.

         I wish to express my thanks to the committee for its efforts. The subject of whistleblowing has been increasingly an issue on the national agenda. It is likely that the committee's report signifies the beginning of a new attitude to the general subject of whistleblowing. That state of affairs is consistent with the now well established philosophy of this government to develop modern, responsible managerial practices in public administration, which serve as a guide to the whole community.

         The government has decided to give `in principle' approval to the development of whistleblower legislation that will strengthen the position of public spirited citizens within our modern managerial framework.

These reports raise issues of direct relevance to any proposed whistleblowing scheme, and it is appropriate to consider the detail of a whistleblowing scheme in the light of the recommendations contained within these reports.

         The government understands the term whistleblowing to refer to the disclosure, in the public interest, of information which indicates wrongdoing. The public interest is in the fair and independent investigation of such allegations of wrongdoing, and the protection of a whistleblower from recrimination in the course of his or her employment following his or her disclosure of information.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government intends to introduce into parliament legislation for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations. In the Commonwealth sphere whistleblowing is hindered by provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 prohibiting the disclosure of official information. In December 1991 the Gibbs committee, in its review of Commonwealth criminal law, made certain recommendations for the reform of the laws on the disclosure of official information. The public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Security Intelligence Service also recommended the introduction of whistleblowing legislation. It will be appropriate to introduce laws on whistleblowing both as a part of the government's implementation of the Gibbs committee's recommendations and as part of the government's response to the recommendations of the Samuels committee's inquiry into ASIS.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The scheme will be based upon a two stage process: whistleblowing disclosure within a department or agency, then to an independent agency. This process is identical to the basis of the committee's proposed scheme, and parallels arrangements that have been successful in other contexts, such as police complaints. The legislation will apply to Commonwealth officers and contractors. It will encourage them to use internal reporting mechanisms in the first instance in the form of an officer authorised to receive whistleblowing disclosures. The legislation will also provide for the use of existing independent reporting agencies—the Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (the IGIS)—to ensure that disclosures are received and investigated. The government anticipates that access to the MPRA will ensure that whistleblowers who are Commonwealth officers are protected from retaliation in the course of their employment. Government contractors and their employees will receive similar protection from recrimination by Commonwealth officers through the ombudsman or the IGIS, as appropriate. Consequential amendments will be made to the relevant legislation to ensure that these independent agencies have the jurisdiction and powers appropriate to ensuring that the objectives of the proposed whistleblowing scheme are achieved.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The committee emphasised that potential whistleblowers need to be reassured that their disclosures will be fully and properly investigated by an appropriate independent agency that is accountable for its activities. The Ombudsman will be required to oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme and prepare information for inclusion in his or her annual report. The IGIS will oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme in the intelligence and security agencies.

         The government proposes that an authorised officer, who represents the internal reporting mechanism, will be required to notify the Ombudsman of receipt of the whistleblower's complaint. The Ombudsman will have certain discretionary powers which may be exercised over the authorised officer's investigation of the disclosure. The authorised officer's decision to investigate the matter or not, to refer the matter to the Ombudsman or IGIS for investigation, or the result of the investigation, will be communicated to the whistleblower. If the whistleblower is dissatisfied with the authorised officer's decision not to investigate or with the result of the investigation, the whistleblower may take the matter to the Ombudsman or IGIS.

         The Ombudsman or IGIS will have a range of powers to investigate a whistleblower's allegations, including the power to refuse to do so.

         The government does not consider it appropriate for a whistleblower to make public disclosures either before using the whistleblowing scheme or before a final determination has been made on the allegations. Whistleblowing allegations are serious matters requiring careful investigation. The information available to a whistleblower may not be complete. Nor is the whistleblower usually in a position to make an independent assessment of the public interest considerations. The Ombudsman and the IGIS, on the other hand, are disinterested third parties who have powers and expertise to conduct full investigations, to assess the allegations in their full context and to make judgements about the action required. Both the Ombudsman and the IGIS have the public interest as their primary concern.

         The public interest in creating a whistleblowing scheme is in the fair and independent investigation of allegations made by whistleblowers. Public disclosures may impair any investigation into the allegation. Whistleblowers who publicly disclose material after an investigation is complete will need to ensure that any such disclosure does not breach existing secrecy and privacy laws or the limits of their authorisation to disclose information. The Ombudsman will have a discretion to make public statements about whistleblowing matters as is appropriate. The Ombudsman will also include information about whistleblowing in his or her annual report. Existing powers to make special reports to the Prime Minister or parliament by the Ombudsman or the MPRA will apply to whistleblowing matters.

        In the attachment to this letter we set out the Government's Response to your Committee's Report entitled "Australia's Participation in Peace Keeping", which was tabled in Parliament on 8 December last year. In doing so, we wish to make a number of general points on behalf of the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government finds the Report to be a useful document which focuses public attention on the increasing importance and complexity of peace keeping operations. The Report also draws attention to Australia's increased participation in peace keeping, and the multi-dimensional nature of that participation. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has contributed in varying ways to more than 20 of the 33 United Nations peace keeping operations undertaken since World War II. The ADF has demonstrated a high degree of adaptability in being able to provide individuals, groups of specialists and formed military units for the complex political and military operations which epitomise contemporary multi dimensional peace keeping. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has also had a long history of involvement in the law and order aspects of peace keeping operations, but as the United Nations operations in Cambodia, Mozambique and Haiti indicate, the AFP has acquired much broader responsibilities such as investigating human rights violations, training local police officers to rebuild or create the local police force, verifications of local elections and a range of humanitarian tasks. As the nature of peace operations has expanded, so too has the need for the services of other non-military Government agencies, such as the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). The AEC's involvement in providing international electoral assistance within the context of United Nations peace keeping operations began in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia (UNTAG) in late 1989 and continued in the Western Sahara, Cambodia and Mozambique.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The multidimensional nature of Australia's participation in peace keeping operations was demonstrated in the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in which the ADF, the AFP and the AEC all made significant contributions. In the current international environment, it seems likely that the specialist capabilities and experience of Australian military and civilian agencies will continue to be keenly sought after in peace operations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result, we are particularly encouraged by the fact that the Committee's Report generally endorses the Government's approach to multinational peace keeping operations and its efforts to make constructive contributions to the process of improving United Nations peace keeping.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the last few years, the increasing number of highly ambitious United Nations operations have clearly tested the ability of the international community to respond to crises which in turn has highlighted the need to reconsider the way we conduct peace operations. Many of the recommendations made by your Committee correspond to reforms of processes and resource allocations which have recently begun to be addressed by the United Nations and are being pursued by the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Inevitably, the expansion of United Nations peace keeping operations has increased the level of risk to the safety of United Nations personnel. In this context, one particularly important reform in which the Government has been actively involved, is the establishment of an international legal regime to protect United Nations personnel. Australia negotiated and co-sponsored the "Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel", adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1994. The Government is currently working to ensure early adherence to the Convention through signature and ratification in order to send a clear message that the international community will not tolerate attacks on United Nations personnel.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia has also made a substantial contribution to a number of informal groups dedicated to reforming peace keeping operations including three working groups established after the Ottawa Conference in April 1994, which dealt with the political direction and support of peace keeping operations, command and control issues, and training. Another positive development in the international effort to strengthen United Nations peace keeping was a Presidential Statement by the United Nations Security Council which announced that measures would be put in place to enhance consultation arrangements between the Security Council, the United Nations Secretariat and troop-contributing nations. Australia has also contributed to the debate on improving the UN's rapid deployment capability.

        When the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, launched his book, "Cooperating For Peace" at the forty eighth United Nations General Assembly, one of its key aims was to develop an agreed vocabulary for the range of possible responses to international security problems. Significant progress has been made in this respect but a degree of confusion regarding terminology still persists and as United Nations peace operations continue to increase in number and complexity, the need to clarify this confusion has never been greater. "Cooperating for Peace" has provided a useful basis for agreed terminology within the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Common terminology is also addressed in a number of documents produced by the Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre. This terminology is largely in accordance with current United Nations practice which in turn now largely coincides with the "Cooperating for Peace" terminology. The Government will continue to develop agreed national terminology and draw on the doctrinal assets of the Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre.

        In recent years, United Nations peace keeping operations have become increasingly multidimensional and have included a wide range of civilian functions such as civilian policing, electoral assistance, civil administration, public information, human rights monitoring, refugee repatriation and humanitarian assistance. The level of involvement of Australians, both from relevant Government agencies and private individuals, has been increasing throughout this period and there is scope, in terms of expertise and experience, to further that level of involvement. The Government is currently pursuing a strategy to place Australian nationals in key positions throughout the United Nations system, including agencies involved in United Nations peace keeping operations.

        The extent of commitment of the warring parties to the operation is one of the key criteria examined in the planning process. It is difficult, however, to predict with any certainty whether peace and stability will or will not follow the commencement of any peace operation. There are obvious risks associated with any peace operation and these are factors which have to be fully considered before commitment of Australian personnel. Where such risks are involved, plans are made for the withdrawal of the Australian contingent in an emergency.

        Australia currently provides seven military officers to United Nations Headquarters (UNHQ), New York, in the Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO), filling a number of key staff appointments in the operations, planning and logistics fields. These postings are seen as a valuable contribution to the enhanced efficiency of the DPKO and to the development of its peace keeping operations doctrine. This number is disproportionately high in relation to our total peace operation contribution, reflecting the United Nations' considerable regard for the quality of Australian Defence Force personnel. However, Australia is not regarded as a major or medium level contributor to peace operations and cannot be expected to be given a leading reformist's role while that is the case. Australia will continue to consider requests to provide staff to UNHQ on a case by case basis.

        In theory, early involvement in operational level planning by a force commander (FC) and his staff can significantly contribute to the effective insertion of a United Nations force, provided the advice of the FC-designate is taken by UNHQ.

        The United Nations Secretariat functions as the strategic headquarters for United Nations operations, and the staff of the DPKO performs similar functions to a General Staff. We recognise that the current arrangements in the DPKO are inadequate to deal with the range of peace keeping operations. That is why Australia will continue to urge that the UNHQ military staff develop a sound organisational and manning framework to enable the efficient mounting of peace operations, particularly in the areas of logistics and contingency/future planning.

        Australia continues to actively encourage United Nations to reform its command and control of peace keeping operations especially in developing better mechanisms for providing strategic military advice to the Security Council. The Government is receptive to proposals from Member States, such as the current Canadian Study for improving the United Nations' rapid reaction capability, to increase overall effectiveness. It should be noted that there have been a number of organisational changes in the Secretariat and recent structural changes in DPKO which will, when fully implemented, bring about some of the integration proposed in the recommendation. A Situation Centre has been established within DPKO, manned by military and civilian officers, and is responsible for the day to day monitoring of United Nations operations. This centre provides daily reports on each United Nations mission to Permanent Missions in New York. The Australian Defence Force has an officer posted to this centre. The location of dedicated Mission Liaison officers within the Situation Centre would, in practice, prove inefficient and would duplicate existing lines of communication between Force Commanders and military and political officers in the United Nations in New York.

        Where agreed by Government, the Department of Defence is currently provided with full supplementation for the additional costs it incurs in undertaking peace operations. There will, however, be other circumstances where supplementation would not normally be provided; for example, where the commitment of Department of Defence resources to a peace operation will only involve minor additional costs, or where participation in the peace operation is in the direct interests of the defence of Australia.

        It is not agreed that the consideration of the provision of supplementation for the additional costs of peace operations be limited to those instances where overseas deployments are involved.

Provision exists within this structure to invite non-Government participants. For example, during preparation for the Australian Defence Force deployment to Rwanda, non-Government organisations were consulted during initial planning, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development and the Attorney General's Department (for Status of Forces Agreement considerations).

        Based on an Australian Defence Force agreed list of available assets, Australia responds to requests for assistance on a case by case basis. It is normal for Australia, in common with other developed nations, to be invited to contribute specialist units to peace operations. Australian Federal Police and Australian Electoral Commission activities in Cambodia have also led to them being requested by the United Nations and provided by Australia for service in areas such as Mozambique and Haiti. The Australian Federal Police and the Australian Electoral Commission should continue to contribute to peace keeping operations where they will have a meaningful role to play.

        The requirements of the particular operation and the availability of units determine which elements we contribute to peace operations. We do not establish special units or earmark elements within the Australian Defence Force for peace operations. The United Nations requires different types of units for different operations. If we tried to predict United Nations needs we could restrict our flexibility to provide elements from our wide range of capabilities to meet the requirements of specific operations. The Australian Defence Force is structured for defending Australia, but the versatility in such a force ensures it can contribute to peace operations.

        Currently, as advised in the 1994 Defence White Paper, "Defending Australia", the Government is developing the basis for the protection of Reserves' interests on call-out, and one of the topics for consideration is a guarantee for the return to their civilian employment after call-out ceases. Employment protection is part of this issue and will require wide consultation before suitable policy and legislation can be developed. This is currently being undertaken by an Implementation Team within Australian Defence Force Headquarters.

        Restoring law and order, and the infrastructure needed to support it, is often vital to the success of peace keeping operations and "justice packages" can be developed to ensure viable local legal systems. The reasons why the rule of law and infrastructure break down, are invariably complex. Such "justice packages" must draw upon universal principles and local personnel should be trained to take over their own systems. However, while "justice packages" are an important component in the restoration of law and order and the rehabilitation of government institutions, they are only one of a number of issues that must be addressed in developing sustainable solutions to complex emergencies. The Government supports the United Nations efforts aimed at comprehensive responses to international emergencies and, through cooperation between agencies, the development of strategies to facilitate the transition from relief to rehabilitation and development.

Attaching an officer of the Australian Federal Police to the Australian Mission to the United Nations in New York might achieve a more stable, selective, timely, and effective UNCIVPOL participation by the Australian Federal Police in United Nations sponsored peace keeping operations.

        Where it can, the Australian Federal Police contributes to United Nations sponsored seminars. Recently it responded to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights' request to provide a trainer to instruct on international standards for human rights to the Brazilian Military Police in Rio de Janeiro and to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Police in Skopje. The development of regional CIVPOL training is also an achievable objective. Informal discussions with some of our regional neighbours' police forces, who regularly participate in peace keeping missions, confirm that there is a willingness to participate in regional training initiatives, including regular interchange of relevant personnel between regional nations, the conduct of regular multi-national training courses and seminars, the establishment of a permanent UNCIVPOL Regional Training School and in appropriate circumstances, the deployment of multi-national regional contingents.

In mission areas, close liaison exists between deployed Australian Defence Force contingents and Australian NGOs.

Therefore, close liaison between the Australian Defence Force contingents and Australian NGOs needs to be mindful of Force policy and procedures.

        As recently stated in the 1994 Defence White Paper, "Defending Australia", participation in United Nations peace operations also complements Australia's regional and alliance interests. Our participation in peace operations in Cambodia provided a constructive basis to increase cooperation with regional countries. We are making opportunities available to regional countries to undertake peace operations training with Australia, primarily through encouraging regional attendance at the Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre, and are seeking ways of expanding this type of cooperative activity, including through regional discussions such as the ARF. By developing closer cooperation in peace operations with regional countries, we build confidence and contribute to cooperative regional security arrangements. For Australia to continue to play a leading role, we will need to retain both the perception that we are committed to supporting peace operations, and the knowledge and standing flowing from first-hand experience of these operations.

        The Government recognises the multi-dimensional nature of peace keeping operations and already takes an integrated approach to the training and preparation of all civilian and military personnel for deployment in peace keeping operations. The academic study of peace keeping is already well covered by Australian academic institutions. The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence currently provide significant funds to four academic institutions, which support research and publications on peace keeping. The Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre at Williamtown provides training for multidimensional peace keeping operations, primarily for the Australian Defence Force, and is responsible for the development of the essential doctrine for the Australian Defence Force's involvement in peace keeping operations. The Centre also seeks to include other relevant Government Departments and NGOs in its training courses and development of doctrine. The Centre also provides training opportunities for regional countries, which is a concrete example of regional security cooperation. Although there may be scope to further develop the multi-dimensional and inter-disciplinary approaches taken by the Centre, the arguments in favour of a new institution and the issue of its location within Australian Defence Studies Centre have not been adequately substantiated, and the Government considers that a feasibility study is not warranted at this stage.

Priority goals for 1995 have been the promotion of Australia's preventive diplomacy draft resolution and progress towards establishing a more representative Security Council. Australia worked in the annual session in April of the UN Special Committee on Peace Keeping Operations to bring greater clarity in defining the objectives and mandates of United Nations operations, and to strengthen the United Nations' capacity to plan operations. Australia also circulated amongst Special Committee members the conclusions of the April Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) seminar on the use of force in peace operations and contributed to the debate on improving the United Nation's rapid deployment capacity. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade presented a paper on the division of labour between the United Nations and regional organisations for a major international conference at La Trobe University in July and is also working on a joint paper with the Dutch on improving the effectiveness of sanctions regimes.

        Australia is assessing how to pursue its proposals for improving peace keeping financing procedures; which were partly adopted by the United Nations Fifth Committee in December 1994, although the greater focus this year is likely to be on reviewing the scale of assessments for peace keeping payments. Australia will remain a leading advocate of introducing incentives to promote prompt payment of regular budget and peace keeping payments, and will be participating in efforts through the Geneva Group to identify areas for savings in United Nations programs that can be redeployed into priority areas. The United Nations mission in New York plans to develop proposals for the review of the major United Nations financial oversight bodies as a Canada Australia and New Zealand (CANZ) group exercise.

        As stated by officers of my Department in public hearings before the Committee, it was always intended that the new test for indirect discrimination, proposed in clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the Bill, would recognise that the "group element" is a central aspect of any definition of indirect discrimination.

       <para font-size="-=2">

        As the Committee recognises, the proposed section 7D aims to protect measures that have, as one of their purposes, the aim of achieving "substantive equality". It always has been the Government's intention that section 7D refer to real or substantive equality.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I agree that the provision may not make this point as clearly as possible. The Government will therefore move an amendment to Clause 10 to clarify what is intended by inserting "substantive" before "equality" in section 7D. As noted by Ms Morgan (Submission No 18), "substantive equality" is synonymous with the idea of "equality of outcomes", but the Government's preference is to amend the provision to refer to substantive equality. This is more in keeping with the intended focus on achieving real equality.

        The immunity of parliamentary proceedings from impeachment or question in courts or other tribunals depends ultimately on article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1688 [9], which is part of the law applying to the Australian Houses by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution.

        While the Act provides a wide definition of "impeached or questioned", it does not exhaust the meaning of that phrase, and the definition of "tribunal" does not exhaust the category of bodies before which parliamentary proceedings must not be impeached or questioned.

        The bill proposes amendments to Division 19A of Part IIIA which operates to prevent the creation of capital losses, or reduction of capital gains realised on the disposal of shares or loans in a company. Losses can be created (or gains reduced) by shifting value out of the shares or loans through the transfer of assets to commonly owned companies for low or nil consideration. Where a value shift is taken to have occurred, the cost bases of shares and loans in the transferor company are reduced to reflect the transferred value. The proposed amendments will generally operate to reduce the costs for taxpayers in complying with Division 19A, and to rectify certain anomalies in its current operation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Compliance costs will be reduced by enabling companies to transfer depreciable assets generally at their written down value without the need to make cost base adjustments provided that the market value of the assets is not substantially greater.

Accordingly, the franking credits arising from the payment of the additional company tax assessed as a result of the transfer pricing adjustments can be used to frank profit distributions that would not otherwise be franked dividends and subject to the relevant tax relief measures.

These measures are proposed in this bill. The bill provides that a demutualisation may occur under a specified method and then describes the taxation consequences of certain transactions which may occur in the course of the demutualisation.

        This bill amends the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in the 1995-96 budget and to provide for cost supplementation of grants for 1995 and 1996 in accordance with established policy.

        The bill proposes an extension of the early literacy program to 1996. This program provides grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. Some $6.666 million is to be made available to government schools and $2.208 million to non-government schools in the year. As in 1995, there will be special emphasis on children disadvantaged by low socio-economic circumstances.

        Another budget initiative reflected in the bill is a proposal for a new program of grants to non-government special schools to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream school education or pursue further training or employment.

       </para>

        The final budget decision reflected in the bill is the cessation of new projects in 1996 under the gender equity program, the gifted and talented children program and for staff training, development and community liaison under the hostels for rural school students program. These initiatives have either served their purpose or are now more appropriately the responsibility of other bodies.

        BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill is an omnibus measure proposing the validation of certain Ministerial declarations and the amendment of three Bounty Acts; namely, the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 (the Computer Bounty Act), the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985 (the Machine Tools and Robots Act) and the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994 (the Fuel Ethanol Act).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are three major elements proposed in this bill. The first relates to the validation of certain untabled Ministerial declarations made under the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act. The non-tabling of these declarations was discovered as a result of an investigation into the status of all legal instruments administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology that was instigated by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology after the discovery of a similar administrative oversight in relation to guidelines under the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. The Minister made a statement in the Senate on 26 June 1995 concerning the bounty legislation problem and the validation element of this bill is designed to address that issue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Both the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act have a declaration facility by which the Minister can vary the classes of equipment eligible for bounty so that new technologies can be brought into the schemes as they arise. The facility is designed to allow the schemes to cater for the rapid technological advances which are a feature of these industry sectors. In order to maintain Parliamentary scrutiny of the classes of equipment eligible for bounty, the Ministerial declarations are subject to the same tabling and disallowance procedures applicable to other forms of subsidiary legislation by the express application of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The failure to table 20 declarations under the Computer Bounty Act and a further 12 under the Machine Tools and Robots Act has resulted in each declaration being invalidated after 15 sitting days of its making. A consequence of the legal invalidity of the declarations is that all decisions and acts or things done in reliance on those declarations (including applications claiming bounty, assessments of claims and decisions to pay or refuse bounty), are also invalid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clauses 5 and 6 of the bill propose to address the invalidity problems by validating the declarations, and any decisions made, or acts or things done, in reliance on those declarations, from the time of their commencement as notified in the Gazette, until the Royal Assent commencement of this bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 7 of the bill expressly extinguishes the Commonwealth's right to recover any amounts paid on the production of goods purportedly made bountiable under the declaration facility of both acts. This will overcome the situation of Commonwealth officers having a duty to recover what have become unauthorised payments out of Consolidated Revenue and is appropriate given the fact that the various payments that have been made in reliance on the declarations over the years were always intended to be made.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second element of the bill involves the incorporation of the effect of the 3 valid current declarations into the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act. Schedules 2 and 3 to the bill incorporate into each of the acts the various classes of goods which are presently bountiable via the declaration facility.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The goods to be inserted under the relevant definitions of "bountiable equipment" have been the subject of new declarations Gazetted in August and September 1995 and have been tabled in each House of Parliament as required of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. These 3 declarations remade the effect of 7 of the invalid declarations and were made so that bounty payments relating to claims on hand could be processed during the time between the discovery of the invalidity and the passage of this validating bill. The remaining invalid declarations were not remade as their effect had already been incorporated into the Principal acts by various Bounty Legislation Amendment Bills or they had become redundant because the technology to which they related has been superseded.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The incorporation of the effect of these current valid declarations into the Principal acts is intended to bring all the goods which are currently eligible for bounty under the one piece of principal legislation, as opposed to a mixture of Legislation plus disparate declarations. I consider that periodically incorporating future declarations into the Principal acts will also help to ensure their legal correctness and legal drafting in a way that has not always been the case in the past. This should obviate the need for repeating this exercise in the future by better aligning the declaration facility with the express parliamentary controls in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The final element of the bill implements the Government's 1995-96 Budget decision in relation to the Fuel Ethanol Act. The Fuel Ethanol Act  gives effect to a scheme to assist in the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. The three year scheme, which commenced on 1 July 1994, provides for the payment of a bounty of 18 cents for each litre of fuel ethanol produced, providing certain criteria are met. One of these criteria is that bounty should only be paid on `new production' of fuel ethanol, which effectively imposed an extra production requirement on pre-1 July 1994 producers by only making bountiable that production in excess of the average of fuel ethanol produced in 1992 and 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the eligibility criteria under the Fuel Ethanol Act in Schedule 1 to the bill are to give effect to the 1995 Budget decision to ensure all eligible fuel ethanol producers can claim bounty on the same production criteria, irrespective of whether they were engaged in production prior to the 1 July 1994 commencement of the Fuel Ethanol Act.

         —Last week the advocates of Queensland's largest meat processors launched a scathing attack on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has urged AMH to withdraw an application for a non-union enterprise flexibility agreement at its Rockhampton plant and has urged that the plant operate on a trial agreement with the union for three months to allow enterprise bargaining negotiations to continue at other AMH plants. AMH has viciously attacked the commission for challenging its rights to threaten and intimidate its workers in its bid to drive down wages and conditions in Queensland.

         A fortnight ago a question was raised in the House of Representatives concerning the Rockhampton plant of Australia Meat Holdings and some rather dubious industrial tactics used by the employers to achieve non-union enterprise flexibility agreements. Mr Brereton revealed that AMH used a good deal of outside assistance and outside influence at its Rockhampton plant to persuade workers to accept the EFA. The minister revealed that Mr Bruce Townsend and a team of 14 people had been secretly employed to act as agents provocateurs and to bust the AMIEU in Queensland.

         Information has been provided to me that Mr Bruce Studley Townsend has been employed as a strikebreaker by Mr Keith Lawson, managing director of AMH, Mr Les Parker, manager of the Rockhampton Meatworks, and Mr John Hughes, a senior industrial officer at AMH. I am informed that up to 15 strikebreakers have been employed at $800 per week cash in hand and that Mr Townsend himself has received $3,000 per week cash in hand. Mr Townsend was paid by  the  Ipswich office  of  AMH.  Mr Townsend's duties included phone tapping union members, videotaping union meetings through the boot of a car, intimidating workers, and persuading workers to cross picket lines.

         Given the voracity of Mr Townsend and his team for taping and recording, it might not be surprising to learn that the arbitration commission has moved its hearings from the plant to the local courthouse. Other members of Mr Townsend's Rockhampton team include an ex-prison officer and an ex-police officer. It seems that the job of these people is to act as heavies and to persuade people involved in the industrial dispute at the Rockhampton plant with violence if necessary.

         Mr Bruce Townsend is a resident of Tasmania and is managing director of the firm Australian Security and Investigation. He is registered in Tasmania as a licensed security agent and process server. However, Mr Townsend has a long record of strikebreaking in Tasmania, such as at APM, and he is well known to the timberworkers' union. He has also appeared previously in Queensland where he worked with Mr Graham Haycroft of Troubleshooters Available.

         Troubleshooters Available has also specialised in strikebreaking in Tasmania and Victoria, mainly in the building industry but in the meat industry as well. Troubleshooters Available supplied unskilled contract labour for the Camperdown abattoir in Victoria some four years ago, enabling the employers to lock out the local meatworkers who were members of the union and who were not prepared to work for wages and conditions well below the award.

         Mr Townsend says he is a consultant and is not registered to operate in Queensland as an investigator or as a security agent. He says his main function at the Rockhampton meatworks is to `advise on enterprise bargaining agreements and prepare precedence reports'. This, of course, reflects the growing trend within AMH towards the Americanisation of its industrial relations. This is brought about by the employment of strikebreakers and union busters. Mr Townsend is no ordinary worker. His job is clearly to antagonise and intimidate union members. The company, AMH, provides strikebreakers with false payroll slips to make them look like genuine workers.

         Mr Townsend was engaged by senior management of Conagra in Queensland who happen to be closely identified with the Liberal Party in that state. In other words, senior Liberal Party members have been directly involved in these unseemly events. Senior Liberal Party figures also figured during the meatworkers' dispute at Camperdown in Victoria during 1991-92. The local meatworkers set up a picket line outside the Camperdown abattoir and an agent provocateur appeared on the scene. His name was Warwick Leeson. He employed rather crude tactics of verbal abuse, throwing rocks and eggs at picketers, and even driving his car into one of the unionists. Later, some of his associates were involved in even more violent acts including the bashing of three unionists with shovels and iron bars.

         Mr Leeson, a private investigator, was hired by the law firm of Kroger and Kroger to gather information for a damages action against the AMIEU. Leeson had to provoke and try and incite violence and disruption by the picketers in order to make a case for Kroger and Kroger in its prosecution of the AMIEU. At that time Mr Kroger was president of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party and a long-time associate of Mr Costello, the current Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party.

         Mr Warwick Leeson was himself a Liberal Party member and in fact served as a branch president. It is widely rumoured that Mr Michael Kroger first used Mr Leeson's sleazy investigative techniques to dig up dirt on the wets or moderates in Victoria during the great purge of the Liberal Party under Mr Kroger's presidency. Mr Kroger, along with several senior Liberal Party members of parliament, attended an hysterical meeting at the Camperdown race track in support of the anti-union contractors.

         Mr Kroger and Mr Costello have long shared a vision of a brave new world of industrial relations—one where workers would have no organised representation and where employers can determine wages and conditions at whim. Powerless workers have two choices: take it or have no job. They talk about negotiation and cooperation but, in reality, we have the Warwick Leesons and the Bruce Townsends running around with tape-recorders, with rotten eggs, and even with weapons, to coerce, intimidate and frighten workers into submission.

         Is this the sort of industrial relations the Liberal Party stands for? Is this the sort of thuggery they are prepared to tolerate: stooges paid by employers to bust up union meetings, hired guns used to get contractors in place to reduce wages and conditions? As Minister Brereton has made clear, there is no place in Australian industrial relations for professional strike breakers and secret surveillance and the taping of picket lines, union meetings or anything else. A Labor government in my view remains committed to ensuring that enterprise bargaining is pursued in an environment free from coercion.

        Mr Titelius left the file on the counter while he photocopied the restraining order. The time the file was left on the counter, either accidentally or by design was sufficient for Mr Viner to rummage through the file and make further hand written notes.

On the basis of a series of facts which are being put by Senator Crichton-Browne—which basically are that various documents were improperly obtained, circulated and so forth—anyone listening to that statement is invited by the statement to draw conclusions as to the motive; it must always follow from a set of facts. Surely you determine from the chair whether he is imputing the motive—whether the circumstances lead to a conclusion that that is the motive. In other words, you listen to the facts and from that you draw a conclusion as to the motive. If the logical conclusion is that the facts are to impute improper motives, which I argue that it is, then under standing order 193 that is improper. That is the point I have been seeking to make.

          —Mr President, on the point of order: I have been listening to this and have been reluctant to get involved. However, it is quite clear that what is happening is an allegation is being developed against an honourable senator on the basis of some circumstantial evidence. But the purpose of the allegation is to impute or to allege either improper conduct or an improper motive. That is quite clear from the preceding statement that Senator Crichton-Browne made in relation to the availability of material. That is the prelude to the argument which is now being developed, which is an argument which is quite clearly leading to the origin of the material contained in the second envelope. I believe that is quite clearly contrary to standing orders. Mr President, I believe it is quite clear that you should instruct Senator Crichton-Browne accordingly and instruct him either to desist with this or to move on to something else.

          Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus affecting up to 200,000 Australians. It is estimated that up to 9,000 people are newly affected each year. Eighty per cent of those exposed to the virus will become carriers, 25 per cent will develop chronic liver disease and up to 10 per cent will die as a result. The virus attacks the liver and over the past year it has become the most common cause for liver transplants. There are many unknowns about hepatitis C and that is why I raised it with Senator Crowley a couple of weeks ago. Drug users and former drug addicts could be unknown carriers. It is speculated that tattoos and body piercing, or even the shared use of razors or toothbrushes, may contribute to the spread of the virus.

          A report released in October by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council showed that the government has done virtually nothing to implement a national strategy on hepatitis C a year after its adoption. The report also showed that the government has skimped on the resources for the strategy and less than $4 million has been spent over two years to fund the prevention and education of the virus. Education is very important. I understand that guidelines for GPs and others will be published shortly in line with the strategy that was drawn up over a year ago. This $4 million that has been spent compares very unfavourably with funding for other medical programs. Just for interest, over the next two years $110 million has been earmarked for HIV and AIDS research.

          The low priority given by the government demonstrates that the government simply is not serious about or does not understand the hepatitis C crisis we are facing. It is a matter of urgency. The government has not allocated enough of its resources or time to education programs or giving sufferers access to treatment they need. I understand that the drug interferon alpha 2B is the only treatment available for hepatitis C, and each day sees the queues for interferon growing larger—as with the queues of people waiting to have their conditions assessed. Interferon has been subsidised by the federal government since 1 October 1994, but I understand that the states and territories cannot comply with a national action plan because of funding constraints from the federal government. An expert on hepatitis, Professor Geoff Farrell, was quoted in the

         —Frequent changes to both tax and superannuation law are confusing, not only to the public but also to the experts who are obliged to keep up with all the amendments passed by this parliament. A good example was a recent case in the Federal Court of Australia. The Queensland Registry, General Division, was called upon to adjudicate between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the applicant, and Wayne Cyril Hiscock, as trustee for Osborne Fruit Drinks Superannuation Fund, the respondent. The judgment highlights the complex process of present day law making. This case illustrates very vividly that, if administrative decision makers such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal find it hard to know the law as expressed by the parliament, it must be even harder for the trustees and their advisers.

         The case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was a provision of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987—which has now been superseded by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act—as it stood following an amendment which had not been drawn to the attention of the tribunal. Relevant provisions were section 12(3A) of the act and section 49 of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1993. These provisions deal with the ISC's discretion regarding a breach of, in this case, the in-house assets rule.The intent of section 49 was to limit the discretion available to the ISC. The fund in question was affected only if section 49 was found to have a retrospective effect.

         Section 7(2H) of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act provides that standards may be prescribed with respect to investment of assets of superannuation funds. If there is compliance with those standards, the trustees of the fund receive a notice from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner under section 12 which entitles the fund to concessional rates of taxation, which are currently to a maximum of 15 per cent.

         The problem for the Osborne Fruit Drinks superannuation fund was that it did not comply with those standards during the income year ended 30 June 1991. The trustee sought the exercise of the commissioner's discretion under section 13(1) of the act, which provided that trustees might satisfy the commissioner that because of special circumstances that existed it was reasonable for the commissioner to treat the fund as if it had satisfied those standards.

         Before coming to its decision, the court noted that section 12(3A) had been inserted by an amending act, No. 92 of 1992, taking effect on 1 July 1992. That provided that, in the making of a decision under section 12(3) as to whether a fund satisfied the conditions, the commissioner was obliged to disregard a breach of the superannuation fund if certain conditions were present. The reference to a breach was not further qualified as to its nature or as to the time when it was to have occurred.

         Later on 24 October 1994 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal substituted a decision. The fund satisfied the conditions in relation to the income year ended 30 June 1991.

It noted in particular that there were no transitional provisions relating to the amendment in question and nothing else to suggest that its ordinary meaning could not be given effect to.

         The second issue that I wish to raise in the Senate tonight concerns an overview of the 1985 tax summit. That overview was provided by an eminent practitioner, Mr Richard Buchanan, a former president of the Tax Institute of Australia and a current partner of KPMG in Melbourne. He presented a paper to the University of New South Wales entitled `ATAX Tax Summit' on 20 September this year. The thrust of Mr Buchanan's speech was that, while the income tax system may generally be fairer, there was a significant increase in the additional cost of compliance and complexity.

         Mr Buchanan states that, while the 1985 summit was intended to benefit the Australian people, there were a number of goals at that summit that were not achieved. He said that the system was still biased against the honest, the productive, the worker and the saver. More importantly, he said that the system was biased against the exporter and the home producer. It is this bias which costs Australian jobs, Australian investment and Australian exports. Australia has paid and continues to pay a very high price for this. One of the aims of the 1985 summit was to attack the black economy. However, after scrapping option C—the consumption tax—little has been achieved in overcoming the problems of the black economy, and both cash and barter transactions continue to thrive.

         The percentage of total federal taxation revenue—that is, individual income tax—raised 55 per cent in 1984-85. Ten years later, if FBT is included, it raises 54.9 per cent, which effectively means that there has been no change. However, in that time the burden on Australian taxpayers, particularly business taxpayers, to collect and account for tax has placed a significant hidden cost on those businesses. For example, the income tax legislation has become a lot weightier. John Howard referred to this when responding to the budget earlier this year. The CCH published act in 1985 weighed 2.1 kilos, whereas it now weighs 5.1 kilos. It does point out, however, that whilst the Australian taxation system over 10 years may be a lot fairer it is certainly a lot costlier for business to comply with. While the change to introduce the imputation system of taxation of corporate profits was a material and worthwhile change, it did not shift the emphasis and reliance on the taxation of savings to consumption, and consumption remains a relatively lowly tax by comparison with savings.

         Mr Buchanan, of course, does draw on research undertaken by Mr Phillip Holt, who is the Chief Executive of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. Mr Phillip Holt indicates that, if indirect taxes could be removed from the costs of exports, Australia could boost exports by $3.9 billion by the year 2000, as our products would be more competitive on world markets.

Therefore, I ask: what chance does the ordinary John or Mary Citizen have of understanding and complying with this act when the experts cannot get it right and when the costs of compliance are just so high?

         —On this evening of 12 November 1995, I rise to mark the fourth anniversary of the Dili massacre. Yesterday I attended a memorial service at All Saints Chapel in Perth, Western Australia, to commemorate the event. I must say that the rally which took place afterwards was a credit to the people who organised it. There were those who felt, and feel, quite emotional about this matter—and quite understandably so. They had called upon the organisers to burn an Indonesian flag, and I note that they exercised constraint in not doing so. For that, I compliment them because I do believe that a good deal can be achieved by constructive criticism and constructive debate.

         I was in Lisbon earlier this year when there was an international conference on the question of East Timor, and I believe that there was constructive debate at that conference. Shortly after that there was in Austria, I understand, a meeting between most of the parties concerned—and, hopefully, something will come of this.

         But I do note, with great disappointment, that the Indonesian authorities refused admission into East Timor to a group of international observers. One was Senator David Norris from Ireland, whom I met at the conference I mentioned previously; another was Bishop Soma, a Catholic bishop of Japan; and another was an Anglican minister, Ann Baten, of New Zealand. I also note that in that group there was Mr Paul Stewart, an Australian musician and the brother of a journalist who was killed in East Timor some 20 years ago; he also wanted to go to East Timor to mark the anniversary of the Dili massacre.

         I can only say that, when protesters exercise the constraint that these did, the Indonesian authorities do not advance matters by refusing the admission of such international observers. As I say, I have met Senator David Norris from Ireland. He is not, I believe, a security risk. He is not the sort of person who would go around making trouble. I can only urge the Indonesian authorities to open up East Timor so that people of this sort, of this standing, can visit East Timor and that perhaps some progress can be made in resolving the problem there.

         I notice that the Pacific Conference of Catholic Archbishops expressed a great deal of concern about the interference there is with the freedom to practise the Catholic religion in East Timor by East Timorese people and, indeed, the freedom to speak their own language and to engage in their own culture. Any such restraint must be the subject of great criticism by Australia. This is something which is happening on our doorstep, several hundred kilometres from the northern border of the state which I represent. This sort of action and the actions of disallowing the people that I have mentioned entrance into East Timor on the occasion of this anniversary does not do anything to advance the resolution of this matter.

         The proposal by Indonesia to have Mr Mantiri act as that country's ambassador was met with widespread criticism. I can only say that I commend the Indonesian government for its decision not to push through with that decision because to do so would have been a highly provocative act. I am pleased to see that was not done.

         We have a strong relationship with Indonesia, thankfully so, but when friends have a difference of opinion they express that in a very frank manner and they do not hold back. They can talk freely with each other because that is the basis of any strong relationship, of any relationship based on friendship. Therefore, I take it that the Indonesian authorities will not take what I say the wrong way and, hopefully, will look at it in a constructive manner and appreciate that, in my state in Western Australia, the people who attended that rally did so with a good deal of constraint and that they specifically took measures to avoid offending the Indonesian government by the burning of that country's flag.

         In return, I ask the Indonesian authorities to behave similarly and to appreciate that there are people who have an interest in the matter in East Timor and that there are East Timorese who certainly would like a more open approach to this problem. I have couched my address today in rather restrained terms because I believe that adopting a radical stance does not achieve anything.

         Earlier today we moved a condolence motion for the death of Yitzhak Rabin. We heard in this very chamber how he had expressed that the killing had to stop, that the time for war was over and that constructive measures were needed if a peaceful resolution was to be obtained in the Middle East. I would put to the Senate that the situation in East Timor is the same. It is a situation where radical measures on either side will not help, but firm constructive dialogue and action will succeed.

         I recall the motion that was moved by His Honour Mr Justice Michael Kirby at the conference in Lisbon whereby he set out some specific steps which could be taken to promote a resolution in East Timor. I commend those steps. One of them was to open up East Timor more to visits by members of foreign parliaments and to increase the presence of bodies like the Red Cross. I can see no prejudice to the Indonesian authorities in allowing this. I can see no breach in security in allowing this. I can only question what their motives must be in such an over-reaction in not allowing people of the sort I have described admission into East Timor.

         Therefore, I bring to the Senate's attention, on the fourth anniversary of the Dili massacre, the unfortunate actions which occurred. We must not forget that that was a situation which involved the death of unarmed civilians in a non-violent demonstration—deaths which were caused by the military. This is not denied by the Indonesian authorities, which they themselves commissioned an inquiry into.

         I think it is appropriate that, whilst we work towards strengthening our ties with Indonesia, we do not forget things such as the Dili massacre, we do not forget the deaths of the Australian journalists concerned. To do otherwise would be a sham. It would be an affront to any strengthening of the relationship with Indonesia. This is a matter which should be addressed front on and discussed frankly with the Indonesia authorities.

        (b) Yes. The table was prepared by one of ANSTO's senior scientists. The information in it is based on published data, principally from the document `Sources and Effects of Ionising Radiation', published in 1993 by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and the limits under the Australian Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances 1990. The Australian Radiation Laboratory was consulted in the course of the preparation of the table and is in agreement with the data in it.

        (c) The purpose of the table was to explain to members of the public how doses that might be received by people in proximity of the waste compared with doses from other activities. The doses were not specified in microsieverts because that would have added nothing to the explanation.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (b) The question is unclear. If Senator Margetts' question relates to a person standing two metres from a container for 18 days, then the data in the table means that the dose would have been 432 times one hour's background radiation dose. This amounts to about 100 microsieverts, or 5 per cent of the annual dose from background radiation.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (3) No. When the trucks were loaded, the drivers' cabins were about six metres in front of the freight containers and the packages of waste were positioned inside the containers in such a way as to minimise the dose rates in the cabins. Moreover, new drivers took over about half way through the trip. There were only very brief opportunities for anyone to stand at a distance of two metres from a container during the journey.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (4) The figure of 20 microsieverts per hour in the Department of Defence's Notice of Intention (NOI) for dose rates in truck cabins was an estimate, based on the information available at the time the NOI was prepared. In the event, the measured dose rates in truck cabins during the trip to the Rangehead were much lower.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (5)(a) The actual doses from the activities listed in the table can be obtained by multiplying the relative doses by 100 microsieverts. Thus, the dose rate at the surface of the container is derived from the table as 10x100 microsieverts per hour, which equates to 1,000 microsieverts per hour as stated in the NOI. The data in the table do not refer to the dose to drivers.

        Subsequently, the Victorian Government sought matching funding of $2.55m from the Commonwealth for 1995-96 to fund construction of Stage 3 of the pipeline project. This funding was sought from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) as a drought regional initiative under the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS). However, in view of support also being given by the Greater Green Triangle Region Association (GGT) for the project under the Regional Development Program (RDP), it was agreed that the $2.55m Commonwealth contribution should appropriately be split equally between the RAS and RDP programs.

The Commission supported the validity of a quota on overseas trained doctors stating in its determination: "We are not persuaded that the Health Ministers acted unreasonably in determining that a quota was necessary nor in fixing it at 200 each year" and "We should observe that we reject the argument advanced for the complainant that any form of quota imposed on the admission of overseas trained doctors to registration for general practise in Australia would be discriminatory".

        (1) (a) The Public Service Act, section 7(1) identifies as an EEO designated group "persons who have migrated to Australia and whose first language is a language other than English and the children of such persons". Accordingly, the Department's recently-completed Equal Employment Opportunity Program for 1995-98 sets out performance indicators for employees of non-English speaking background (which includes first and second generation), but does not have separate categories for those who are "overseas born" or those "who can speak one or more languages other than English". The Department does not have `targets' for its officers from a non-English speaking background, but does have a "quality control" mechanism in the form of performance `indicators' based on the benchmark APS figures on current representation and expectations in relation to each of the EEO groups. There are no targets or performance indicators relating to agency board and other consultative committees' members. In addition, individual membership of some of these committees is not subject to Government influence. (i) no target (ii) yes—performance indicator (iii) no.

        (b) In relation to (ii) above, the Department's EEO Program has set the following quantitative performance indicator for employees of non-English speaking background : "Maintain a level of NESB people at least consistent with their community representation of 15%". AusAID also pursues the APS-wide EEO performance indicator of increasing the number of its employees from a non-English Speaking Background (NESB) to 15% by the Year 2000.

        (2) Figures provided in answer to question 2 are drawn from PERSPECT personnel system, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (based on nominal, permanent, including inoperative staff). Both the overall DFAT and AusAID figures for the NESB category are based on employees who have volunteered EEO data. Details of languages spoken other than English are only recorded where the language skills have been tested and recognised by the Department, as this is the only data which is reliable enough to be used for operational purposes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many NESB officers may not have had their language skills tested by the Department.
