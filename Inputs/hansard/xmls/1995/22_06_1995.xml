         —My question is directed to Senator Gareth Evans. Why didn't you, as foreign minister, act immediately after the French presidential victory to seek to dissuade the new administration from its election commitment to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific? Why didn't you lead a delegation at that time rather than after the public announcement when you knew it would be much more difficult to influence a change? And, after the announcement, why did you play down the decision with your statement that it was not as bad as it might have been, which you knew was code for telling the French that you were simply going through the motions of protest? How did you get it all so wrong?

         —We did act to dissuade the French as best we possibly could. In the period immediately after the election and before an announcement was made on nuclear tests, the Prime Minister wrote to President Chirac in very explicit terms; I wrote to Juppe, the former foreign minister, now Prime Minister; and it was made very clear to them what our position on the basic issues of principle was.

         When it came to the decision actually being made, there was no question as to the reality of the feeling of both me and the Australian government in this respect. I have to say that, personally, I was extremely upset at the way in which the French government had breached faith with the international community in the context of the NPT negotiations. Only one month previously, in one of the hardest fought diplomatic exercises that Australia has ever mounted, we managed to get international support for the indefinite extension of that treaty. We did so, among other things, on the basis of the nuclear weapons states agreeing to exercise the utmost restraint so far as nuclear tests were concerned, and the French government, within barely a month after that, manifestly acted in breach of that commitment.

         Secondly, I was extremely upset at the implications of this for the CTBT, the comprehensive test ban negotiations, because of the implications, again, of the French decision for the course of those negotiations, which has been a very long, hard-fought-for Australian policy position. The dangers of polarising the environment in Geneva, the dangers of creating an impossible negotiating situation in relation to some of those outstanding sensitive issues, are very real.

          Thirdly, I and the government generally, like the Australian people, were deeply upset with that aspect of the French decision, which involved once again, with supreme and contemptuous disregard for the interests of the people of the South Pacific region—

         The question was: how was that anger, which was very real and very genuine, to be translated into a diplomatically effective response? That is the particular problem that we have been wrestling with. It is very easy in this kind of context to express yourself in extremely voluble, over-the-top terms without regard to the implications of that for a capacity to actually change the situation for the better in the longer run.

         What we in the government decided upon was a controlled response building up over time, with these following elements. Step one would be a relatively clear-cut but nonetheless modulated response which would make it clear that the French behaviour was utterly deplorable and to be condemned, and would spell out why that was the case but would at the same time create a basis for a further exercise in persuasion being mounted in a way that would not be counterproductive. Secondly, it would involve consultation with the South Pacific countries with a view to developing a combined regional response. We put that in place very quickly—within two, three, four days of the announcement—with the delegation to France. Thirdly, it involved follow-up action after that particular delegation had its opportunity to seek to persuade the French government and to get a response. That follow-up action is exactly what we are now embarked upon. There will be follow-up at a Forum-wide regional level. There will be further follow-up of an appropriate kind at the Australian government level. I will be putting a package of measures to the government later today which will do just that.

         —I think the minister has missed the point. Before I get to the nub of it, in the last few days we have been told that you did write to the French Prime Minister. Then we were told in this place that you did not write to the French Prime Minister. Today you tell us that you did write to the French Prime Minister. I invite you to table that letter so that we can all have a look at it. Your modulated response seemed to be so much inaction. Why did you not lead a delegation and do more than write a letter before the decision was announced, when there was some real chance of influencing a policy change? Why leave it all until after the announcement and why, after the announcement, play it down? Surely that is a modulated response that can only tell the French that we are really not serious about protest.

        That was exactly the position we adopted. We made very clear how much we deplored and condemned the situation, for all the reasons that I have just spelt out. We made very clear that we were engaged in an exercise in persuasion, not a mere futile Alexander Downer type adolescent protest. To make that persuasion effective, we believed it was necessary to acknowledge whatever it was that could be said by the other side. We then upped the ante by mounting a mission to Paris. Because that particular mission failed to produce the result, as it has, we are now proposing to take further steps.

         —The government has been very confident since the conclusion of the Indian Ocean region forum that it was a success because it met the goals we set. But it is always more effective when you get the assessment of people other than yourself for something that you have undertaken. Let me indicate two or three of the responses that we have had to the outcome of the forum. Most particularly, yesterday I had the opportunity of talking to the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr Khur Shid. During my discussions with him last night, he made it absolutely clear that, in his view, the forum was a success in achieving goals which we share. They were the goals of having, for the first time, an inclusive gathering to discuss cooperation in the Indian Ocean region, to get the discussion going and to set up processes which will enable us to take forward regional cooperation, to elicit ideas on how we might move forward and to develop a process for doing it. They were our objectives, and they were met.

         We saw two regional bodies established—the Indian Ocean consultative business network and the Indian Ocean research network. They are both scheduled to meet in New Delhi in December next year. It is very easy for people, including some members of the opposition, to say that this was not a sufficient achievement and that somehow or other we should therefore consider it a failure. I refer to the two recently published responses by participants, not members of the government, and in one instance someone not even known to me, but people who have indicated their view of the response. Firstly, I refer to a response from Harold Clough, the president of ACCI, in a letter published in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         on 21 June. He described the forum as a landmark event in world trade and commerce and said:

        . . . there can be little doubt an IOECC, or an equivalent, will be formed in the near future.

        He continued:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there is widespread support for a vehicle like an IOECC to improve commercial and economic relations in this region, and the Perth meeting was considered by all to have been a great success.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Clough chaired the meetings of business people at that forum, so he was the person best placed to judge the mood, rather than some of those who sat in Wagga and made clever remarks.

         Then there was a lengthy article by a fellow from the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the ANU, Sandy Gordon, whom I have not had the opportunity to discuss this with. That contribution by Dr Gordon comments upon the considerable potential of the liberalising of the economy of South Asia and says:

        As for the conference itself, the fact that no cooperative structure emerged does not mean there was no momentum towards regionalism. In fact, there was a general consensus that the process should be taken forward, make certain comparisons with APEC.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was suggested within the security workshop, for example, that an interinstitutional dialogue process be initiated. Such a process, if properly supported, could potentially lead to a genuine second track dialogue emerging, a goal that has hitherto alluded the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it met the goals that the government set and they are goals that are very important for Australia. It is a pity that some people tried to interpret it as not being a success because that undermines our opportunity to build on the momentum we have created. I believe the meetings that will happen in Delhi in December and subsequent activity and the meeting in Mauritius in August and what flows from it if it is as successful as the Perth one, will mean that we have a momentum for Indian Ocean cooperation that will be substantially to the economic and diplomatic benefit of Australia.

         In order to be effective in mounting those representations, you have to pay due regard to the way in which international discourse works and the necessity not to fire every shot in your locker and anticipate every course of action you will subsequently take before you do it; because if you ignore, in your public statements, whatever it is—however minute—that can be said for the other side's argument, all that happens is that when you confront those on the other side with your position, they spend all their time talking back at you about what you have ignored in your initial presentation. That is a fact of life.

         We need to increase the participation of women, both to ensure that the issues relevant to them are addressed and addressed adequately, and to improve the quality of rural policy through closer consultation with those who are affected by it. I have already asked my department to put in place initiatives to achieve this aim. As a first step, a rural women's unit has been established in the department. The unit will develop policies and programs to improve the status of rural women and to enhance the role of women in agriculture. It will be headed by a national rural women's coordinator, supported by departmental staff.

More than 300 enquiries were received about the position and 81 applications for the position were lodged from all over Australia, including from the Northern Territory. The major rural women's groups, the Country Women's Association, Australian Women in Agriculture and the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women, participated fully in the selection process.

         —The answer to the first part of Senator Coulter's question is no. I am advised that since the Quarantine Act commenced in 1908 the importation of fish and fish products has, with very few exceptions, never been restricted for quarantine concerns. Prior permission to import has not been required and therefore has never been sought or given. Over the years, quarantine authorities have imposed a number of restrictions on the importation of fish in the light of the increasing knowledge of fish disease and developments in the industry.

         As I told the Senate the other day, I am advised—and our own inquiries seem to confirm this—that there is a great dearth of scientific knowledge on fish, not just in Australia but around the world. But, as that knowledge base has been improving internationally, a number of restrictions have been introduced. For example, quarantine requirements were introduced for oysters in 1935, salmonid fish products in 1975, live fish in 1983, and processed feed for aquaculture in 1990 and 1992, when there were concerns raised about insect infestation of these products and concerns also that other animal ingredients were being mixed into the fish feed products.

         In 1992, as I also advised the Senate, AQIS commissioned the BRS to conduct a major review of quarantine policies on the importation of aquatic animals, their products and related materials. This was in response to what have been quite rapid changes, particularly over the last few years, in commercial fisheries and aquaculture. As I advised the Senate a few days ago in response to a question from Senator Boswell, that report should be available by July.

         In terms of the last part of Senator Coulter's question, I am advised that a preliminary review of the scientific literature reveals no report of significant infectious disease of pilchards anywhere in the world, as far as can be determined. No specific work has been undertaken on diseases of Australian pilchards. In terms of my own examination of the literature, it does not appear to be the case anywhere else, either. One study was undertaken in Western Australia in the 1980s of a parasite distribution amongst species of fish which included pilchards. There has been no scientific work done on the immune status of pilchards to infectious diseases. This would be impossible without the isolation of infectious disease agents.

         It is also relevant to again advise the Senate that, because of the death of large numbers of pilchards off the Australian coast some weeks ago, there has been an intensive scientific investigation into possible causes of those deaths by a special Commonwealth-state task force.

         Senator Coulter and the Senate may be interested to know that in the last 24 hours the Chief Veterinary Officer of Australia has been informed of significant numbers of pilchard deaths apparently occurring off the north coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of pilchard deaths apparently have occurred there very recently and it appears from the advice we have received from the New Zealand authorities that those deaths have been related or appear perhaps to be related to what has been a significant and sudden drop in ocean temperatures in that area from about 19 degrees to 13 degrees. We are cooperating and consulting, of course, with the New Zealand authorities about this information to see whether any parallels can be drawn between the deaths there and the deaths here in Australia.

There appears to have been very little research on pilchards anywhere in the world—and they occur in large numbers right around the globe. In fact, it is highly likely that as a result of the work that was commissioned by us in 1992 and which is about to be concluded, we have probably done more work on it to this point than anyone else.

         The difficulty about these matters is, of course, something that is often misunderstood by members of parliament and certainly by the wider community—that there are extreme limitations on Australia's capacity to deal with problems that do afflict Australian citizens abroad when those problems are of a kind which require police investigative action or other effective executive action of that kind. The most you can ever do is make representations to the government in question and, when it comes to police investigations, liaise with the local police authorities and hope that you can persuade them to do whatever is necessary to mount an effective inquiry.

         You cannot take it into your own hands and do it. The only context in which that is possible, technically, is for Australian offences which have extraterritorial application; for example, the paedophile laws or laws of that kind which make it an offence for Australians to do certain things while they are, in fact, overseas. Then there is a jurisdictional foundation on which to place an investigative role but, of course, in practice that, too, depends on full cooperation from the local authorities. So the particular problems that you are referring to all basically have had these characteristics.

First of all, the QCOSS report states that the social security initiatives in this year's budget by the federal government are clearly heading in the right direction—that is, the difficulties it has seen and studied based on that out-of-date evidence clearly are being countered by the initiatives of this federal government in the budget that go a long way to addressing those difficulties around the country.

         But the most important point to reiterate is that the poverty statistics this report is based on were collected less than a year after the election of the Goss Labor government. The fact that poverty was higher in Queensland than in most other states of Australia reflects 30 years of neglect of social policies by the coalition government under the then National Party government. So the most important thing is to know that this is 1989-90 data and that it is a measurement of neglect by the Queensland government under the National Party in the 30 years before that.

         —The emergency relief funding is allocated each year on the basis of a formula that is principally dependent on the number of people on unemployment benefit. Based on those figures this year, as a result of the dramatic fall in the number of people on unemployment benefit, there has been a significant fall in the allocation for emergency relief—from something like over $19 million to $14 million. While I have not got the exact figures for Western Australia, Senator, I have no reason to doubt your figures showing that there has been a drop in Western Australia of the order you say.

         The most important thing to know is that the formula we have at the moment is based on unemployment figures. That significant drop means that there is a fall in the formula for emergency relief. Importantly, hopefully, that should be a measure too of the fall in the number of people who are approaching agencies looking for assistance for emergency relief. One of the things we hope is that people will, in fact, not keep using emergency relief but, indeed, get steered to or go directly to the payments under social security to assist families in times of difficulty. The ongoing commitment by government for payments for families is much the preferred way to go for families than depending on emergency relief.

         The government does recognise that, from time to time, families may have a call on moneys that they simply do not have access to—for example, if a car breaks down, it might be some hundreds of dollars to fix. For a family, that is very critical, but, if you are living on a very tight budget, you may not be able to find that kind of finance. The emergency relief is there to assist families in that kind of cash call.

         We are not quite sure who are the people using emergency relief. That is why I am pleased to inform the Senate that I have just approved a considerable grant to ACOSS to do significant research on the people using emergency relief so that we can be much clearer about just what it is that leads people to emergency relief—whether those people come back time and time again; whether they are people who visit emergency relief once and are then assisted into other payments and benefits that our government provides; whether they are working families on low incomes—we have a sense that quite a few families of that sort might sometimes use emergency relief; also, particularly, whether the people providing emergency relief do have the best training and support to assist them in working with families and to encourage them not to depend on emergency relief but to go into the mainstream payments on behalf of families.

         Senator, I think the important thing is that within your question there is an understanding that, as there may still be a considerable need for emergency relief, if the formula we have means these cuts are real and perhaps there will still be more call than there is finance for it, we might need to look at that formula for the allocation of emergency relief. We will be able to do it based on good data from the ACOSS research. I think it will put us in a much stronger position to know exactly who uses emergency relief and whether or not our formula does need to be changed.

The minister will be aware that I tabled earlier this week information which reveals that a Mr Mike Rowley is the front man for Taiwanese interests that are seeking to gain a foothold in the protected waters of TEC 4 area E off the North Queensland coast. This is the same Mr Rowley who boasted to last week's ECTUNAMAC meeting that he had achieved the effective transfer of permits to fish in the area by transferring shares in the boats to which the permits had been issued. It is also the same Mr Rowley who misled ECTUNAMAC by claiming billfish were not being taken by long-line tuna boats, when photographic evidence shows his boats are doing just that. Does the minister feel it is acceptable that the clear intention of the Fisheries Management Act regarding non-transferable permits is being flouted by a member of a government advisory committee? Is it the government's intention to allow permits currently in the possession of Taiwanese investors to be renewed, when this protected area was established 15 years ago to keep foreign fishermen out of these waters? And, given the poor record Taiwanese fishermen have for protecting the environment, is the minister concerned at the impact an increased long-line effort in this area would have?

In relation to the two specific questions Senator O'Chee has asked, I am advised that the Fisheries Management Act provides for transferability of permits under section 32(10). In fact, it is the management arrangements in place for a particular fishery that determine whether the permit may be transferable or not.

         As far as the east coast tuna fishery is concerned, I am advised that permits in area E are not transferable at the present time. Where a permit is held by a body corporate, there is no provision in the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to inquire as to the beneficial ownership of that company or the nationality of the shareholders. It is therefore possible for ownership of a company, and therefore a fishing permit, to change hands without the knowledge of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.

        That explanation of Senator Gareth Evans really demonstrates our concern in this matter. Earlier this week when we raised the question of what the Australian government did between the election of the French President and his announcement, when the whole world knew that he was going to announce the resumption of tests, when it was running hot in the international media, when it had been a specifically stated promise in the course of the French elections, what did the Australian government do? The answer we heard in the Senate on that occasion was twofold—the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) had written a simple letter and so had Foreign Minister Evans to the now Prime Minister of France, Monsieur Juppe, formerly the foreign minister.

         Later in the week Senator Ray had to come in here and say, `No, in actual fact, the letter from Senator Evans didn't refer to the tests at all.' Today Senator Evans got up and said, `I wrote to the Prime Minister raising concern about these tests.' After question time he said that in fact it now seems he did not write to the Prime Minister raising the issue of the test. What a confused state of affairs! It demonstrates and underlines that the Australian government took so little action. At the only time when it had any realistic chance of influencing a change of policy on the part of France, the Australian government did next to nothing. That is the point. It seems that the Australian foreign minister personally took no action at all. I accept what he said; in fact, he is picking up a statement that my leader made. Obviously, in these circumstances you make a graduated response. You do not fire off all your shots at once.

         The point is that at the time when there was a chance that the Australian government could have influenced a change, it did not fire off any shots at all. This delegation that Senator Evans led to France is not firing off all your shots. If it was worthwhile doing, why wasn't it done before the public announcement of the French policy? Why didn't Senator Evans take diplomats from the South Pacific, or better still take leaders from the South Pacific, to France to express concern as to what would happen if the French election promise was implemented? It did not occur to him to do so because he was concerned with other matters. That is the point that we are seeking to make. Senator Evans did nothing at the time when he might have influenced a change of direction.

         Secondly, when the public announcement was made, what did Senator Evans do? He talked down the decision that France had made. There is only one way that that gets interpreted. We all know diplomatic code. That is interpreted by France and intended to be interpreted as a form protest.

        He goes on and eventually says that the situation is not as bad as it could have been.

That is the whole point. A graduated response, yes, but take it seriously. When Senator Evans had a chance to influence a change of policy he should have done something. When the announcement was made he should have made a vigorous protest, not compromise the situation by almost talking it away before he led this delegation to France. The graduated responses that he has made have been as a reaction of the anger of the Australian people, not as a result of his recognition as to how serious this matter should be treated or his capacity to influence—

         —Well may members of the opposition wave their arms around in anger when, in fact, they have had a pro-nuclear policy ever since the Ranger inquiry in the 1970s. They were the ones who began the uranium mining and the export of uranium. They were the ones who have supported the very industry which lies at the basis of both the civil and military nuclear program. For a short time the government took an ethical position. The Labor Party had a policy of opposing uranium mining and export but it too adopted a very pragmatic position later on and its present position is totally indefensible.

         What we have had today from Senator Hill is simply more arm waving. He is talking about who did what and when, not what should have been done. That is the important point. I remind the Senate that yesterday, when we raised this matter through seeking a suspension of standing orders, we raised the really important issue of whether Australia should continue to mine and export uranium and, particularly, to send that uranium to France, underpinning the very industry which is now the basis of those nuclear tests in the Pacific. We found that, with the exception of the Greens, this whole Senate—as a body—sat on this side of the chamber and voted against the suspension of standing orders.

That is the issue that should be debated here, not whether the minister took action this week or last week and whether that action was weak—as it was. We accept the opposition's statement that what the minister said was clearly sending a message to France that Australia was not serious about taking significant action against the French.

The minister may well speak in a moment. He will point to the non-proliferation treaty and other things, but they are bits of paper which have no ability whatsoever—as we see with these tests and as the minister in his reply has indicated—to restrict the use of the uranium that Australia sends to other countries once it has left our shores.

         I would like to comment on the French news on SBS last Sunday. The news described the New Zealand people as `a little bit nervous' and said that `they seem to have an allergy to the atomic bomb'. However, the foreign minister of France, Herve de Charette, speaking from Canada, reassured us. He said, `My Australian colleague, he understands.' Is that the kind of foreign policy we want to see reflected on the world stage? The achievement that Senator Evans said he made at this delegation in Paris, that the French government will eventually cease after they have done eight more tests, is the same position that the French government took in its initial statement about what it intended to do.

         I want to continue with the statements of the French foreign minister on the SBS news on Sunday. Before Senator Evans had even reached Paris, the French foreign minister said, `You don't understand. There are two decisions made by President Chirac and one is much more important than the other. The first is we are just going to have eight little atomic bomb tests in Mururoa Atoll, and the second is that definitivement we will be ceasing in May.' That is no consolation to the people of Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. It must not continue.

I can only speak with regard to my own statements to the French ambassador. This occurred before the decision to test was made. I say it now because it is also on the public record that I was not alone as a parliamentarian in saying to the representative of France in this country before the decision to test: `There are three issues, ambassador, that detract from what can be an excellent relationship between Australia and France, and they have been longstanding. The three issues are, firstly, your intention to continue nuclear tests in the South Pacific, which we totally object to, which all parts of the parliament totally reject; secondly, you have a continuing colonial record in the South Pacific and it is time that that colonial record was finished and there was independence for the peoples of the South Pacific; and the third issue is the common agricultural policy and France's role, along with the others in the European Union, to act unfairly against Australia with regard to agricultural imports.'

The point was constantly made during the election that a decision would be made on the basis of technical advice from the military as to whether computer simulation was sufficiently far enough advanced to enable stockpile safety to be ensured without the matter of testing. Of course, there was a degree of scepticism about that in the international community which we shared. We wrote accordingly at the highest levels and made representations at the highest available levels in order to try to stave off a decision that did seem to be very likely. But there was no explicit statement made, as I have described, and we did do our best to head it off.

        Minister: I think you have just got to keep these things in proportion. We are talking about underground tests, we're not talking about atmospheric tests and as such the health implications of that remains to be proven beyond doubt that there is a serious and widespread impact. We are, of course, concerned that that issue has not been proved beyond doubt but there is no doubt equally that the issue is less serious in terms of health impact beyond the immediate lagoon that it might be if the tests were being done on a different basis. So you have got to keep that in proportion and it is important to keep in proportion and very much in the centre of your mind the fact that we are talking about limited duration limited number and the commitment to go down the track of the treaty. If people are not prepared to see the significance of those limits then that is unfortunate. It just has to be acknowledged and recognised as part of the total picture that we are confronted with.

        Minister: Not really, of course. I think that both countries are equally to blame to the extent that they are continuing testing. The chinese never committed themselves to a moratorium so to that extent they are behaving no worse than they always have. Equally the Chinese however have committed themselves also to participating in the treaty negotiations and concluding that treaty by next year. So the Chinese tests are themselves finite in duration. Moreover, they are not taking place in the South Pacific, in someone else's part of the world—they are taking place in China. But these carefully modulated distinctions are really not all that much to the point. We have been very strong in our condemnation of the Chinese tests and I hope there is no doubt about the strength of our feeling in relation to the French tests.

        The French are in no doubt about how strongly we feel about this. We have made endlessly clear in very direct talks and representations that I have had, that the Prime Minister has had going back now for the whole period. It was always on the cards that this policy would be changed with a change of government, once President Mitterand, the Socialist President, left office and the Conservatives were in power across the spectrum. One consoling thing about all of this is that the decision has obviously been wrestled with rather than just instantly taken and that it is accompanied by these important qualifications limiting the duration of the tests to May next year, limiting the number to eight and accompanied with a very firm commitment to negotiate and conclude by next year a comprehensive test ban treaty. That is a very important difference from the situation the last time round when these tests were underway. I think while still expressing our objections and protest to this in unequivocal terms, we should acknowledge the differences.

        TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE BY SENATOR GARETH EVANS RE FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS HELD AT IMPERIAL HOTEL ON FRIDAY 16 JUNE 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        GE:You've seen the Prime Minister's press release by now, earlier today, announcing the core composition of the delegation from the South Pacific that I will be leading to Paris on Monday, leaving Japan tomorrow for that purpose. The decision to send such a mission follows an initial conversation I had with the French Foreign Minister two nights ago; a long conversation in which I covered all the substantive grounds about objections and raised with him the possibility of such a delegation and urged him to receive it at as short notice as possible. That's been able to come together and I will be leading it as I say.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The object of that delegation is to convey, unequivocally and unambiguously, the distaste and resentment which does exist right around the South Pacific region about the French decision to resume nuclear tests. The arguments that we will be putting to the French Government are essentially threefold, seeking reconsideration of the decision. First, that the decision involves a really quite fundamental breach of faith with all those countries who worked so hard to secure the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty just a few weeks ago and did so for the reason, among others, that the Nuclear Weapons States said that they would exercise the "utmost restraint" so far as nuclear testing was concerned in the future, until such time as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is negotiated. The NPT has, of course, been in existence for twenty years. It is the most important single arms control and disarmament treaty we have, and it is absolutely crucial that its credibility remain intact if its effectiveness is not to be diluted, and that is a very important consideration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Secondly, we will be arguing, so far as the negotiation of the new Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is concerned—it doesn't yet exist; it is not in place, there is no legal obligation to stop anyone testing; we have got to try and put that in place that this decision poisons the atmosphere for those negotiations in Geneva which are still at a very sensitive and delicate stage and do involve, among others of course, countries other than the nuclear weapons states themselves. To the extent that they are as upset as we all are by this test resumption decision, it is going to make it that much harder to get a negotiated outcome within the time frame that we are all seeking
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Thirdly, we will be arguing that this does involve a really quite serious breach of faith with the countries of the South Pacific who have made as clear as they possibly could their concern about these tests taking place in their own neighbourhood. We have made clear our concerns—particularly the environmental consequences, the dangers that could be obviously be associated with any accident during the context of the tests, and in particular the longer term, really unforeseeable, dangers associated with possible leakage from the underground rock structures, coral structures that are housing the tests. We are concerned that those consequences could occur. And we believe that if the French are as confident as they say they are that there is no risk of accident, there is no long term possibility of this kind of leakage occurring, then why don't they hold the tests on a farm in Provence or down a mine shaft in Picardy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        That is the case that we will be putting. We will be putting it very clearly, very directly and seeking of course a reconsideration of the decision on that basis. There won't be any room for doubts—ifs, buts or maybes—about where Australia or any other South Pacific country stands on this, just as there has never been any room for such doubts in the past.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Q:The other day Senator you said that you didn't think these tests were—I've forgotten the exact words—but the decision to recommence the testing wasn't as bad as what it could have been, yet Australia is now leading a delegation to Paris. What brought about the changes of mind?
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        GE:The other day I made exactly the same points as I have made today. I said that Australia deplored the test resumption; I said we were unequivocal in our concern about that and the way in which we responded to it; I outlined briefly, but clearly, I thought the particular reasons for our concern and I do not think there can be any doubt about the strength of our position. I notice that Don McKinnon, the New Zealand Foreign Minister (who hasn't been criticised at all so far as I am aware, for the way in which he has made the case) said in a radio interview, about the same time as I was talking to you, that, and I quote "Certainly I don't see this in the same parallel as the late 60s or early 70s—of atmospheric tests or unlimited tests out in front of you": he made that point in various ways, that there were obvious contextual distinctions between then and now. I was simply explaining that that is why our response was a proportionate one, one that was appropriate to the nature of the sin that was being presently committed. But it didn't in any way then, nor does it now, effect the strength of our basic position. We are prepared to acknowledge what has to be acknowledged because that is the role in which you conduct diplomacy, that is the way you are most effective, most persuasive—not by being raucous, and refusing to acknowledge what can be said on the other side of the equation. But having acknowledged that, we keep on coming back to the basic point that these tests do appear to be unnecessary and they do appear to be counter-productive in terms of the major concerns we have about the effectiveness and credibility of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. And there are very major concerns we also have about being able to get a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty actually negotiated into place.

        GE:All I can do is hope that when confronted directly, face to face, with those countries who do feel most strongly about this, who can't be just dismissed as being across the other side of the world, but are sitting, there right in front of the relevant Ministers. I can only hope that under those circumstances France will be prepared to reconsider.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        GE:I think my record as Foreign Minister stands reasonable comparison against Mr Howard's and Mr Downer's in the international sphere, and I am prepared to be judged at any time by my achievements so far. It is very easy to succumb to the temptation, particularly if you are an opportunistic politician engaged in a domestic campaign, to engage in raucous chest-beating. But my particular responsibility as Foreign Minister is to be as persuasive and as effective as I can be with the Countries out there who are actually making the decisions that affect us and affect the countries in our neighbourhood. And I believe, from long experience at doing this sort of thing, that I can be most effective over the long haul in adopting an approach which is reasonably measured, but which nonetheless is coldly meticulous when it comes to Putting the arguments, and going to the questions of substance which have to be addressed. Others can be firing emotional bullets, and it is no bad thing that the French now realise the extent of the sheer raw emotion that exists out there in the South Pacific and in Australia. But in terms of the way in which I conduct the argument with the French, I have got to conduct it as a Foreign Minister, and not as an opportunistic, political brawler.

        Q:Is that the same sort of message you would have for the Labor Party Caucus as well?
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        GE:I think the Caucus well understands the particular tightrope that I have to walk, and that I have always had to walk, in arguing the case as effectively as I can, to advance Australia's national interests. I think the Caucus well understands that there is no doubt about the substance of our position. I think they also understand the distinctions that I was making in order to describe why it is we are responding in the way we are on this occasion, as compared with other previous events. I think they do understand that we had very real fears about this Chirac Government, given the previous track record of 148 underground tests initiated after the atmospheric ones were abandoned, and all the rhetoric that led up to the campaign. I think Caucus and everybody else that has been following the details of this, understands that there were very real fears that this new Government, new Presidency, would walk away altogether from not only the Test Ban Treaty, but any commitment to limit tests in the future. I think there was a real fear that we would be back into a situation of open-ended tests, and the development of new Generation weapons technology. Mercifully it seems—as a result of the kind of lobbying and the argument that I and others have been meticulously mounting over a long, period of time, the case we have been making, of the Test Ban Treaty—that at least we are not going down that path. I think Caucus can see the total complexity of this. But none of that diminishes the need for strong, direct and effective communication of the basic point here in issue; that these tests are not only intrinsically dangerous particularly because of the risk of accident and particularly because of the long-term (maybe five hundred years away but nonetheless real) risk of leakage in the area, but there is concern about those things but it is a concern also about the very real negative impact on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that makes these tests indefensible. It is a complex balance of issues, and I think my position is strengthened in arguing this through with the French if I acknowledge what has to be acknowledged and do so frankly and directly but then, on that foundation, make the case that has to be made coldly, logically, meticulously, about why it is that this decision really does need fundamental reconsideration—in the interests of France's credibility in the region; in the interests of France's credibility in the world, and in the interests of the disarmament and arms control objectives that we are all supposed to share.

        GE:Yes I do. I think the US and the UK could be more direct and explicit in making the case for the negative implications of this for the test ban negotiations and for the effect on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia has been reasonably explicit, and critical, I understand in what it has said. China of course hasn't offered a squeak on the subject because China is, at the moment, going on testing—although it too has at least said that it will stop an embark upon the CTBT negotiations with a view to producing that outcome in 1996. But I do think a little bit of consistency is required around the world in the response of the nuclear powers. They can't change their tune—one week making a case for indefinite extension at the NPT and three weeks later being mute on the subject of a possible undermining of the credibility of just that operation. Consistency is a virtue in all sorts of places of course: I would have thought Mr Soorly might have been contemplating severing some sister city relationships in China as well as in France.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        GE:I haven't thought of being able to do that on this particular trip but maybe that will be possible. It sows a useful seed actually. We have certainly made the point diplomatically, through official channels, as to the reaction that we think is appropriate to the resumption. Whether a more direct ministerial response would be helpful I don't know. It does seem that the US and UK have rather taken the view that these further tests are the price that has got to be paid in order to get France's adherence, under its now presidency, to the Comprehensive Test Ban, and they seem to be regarding that as the major game, and the major achievement. But for all the reasons I have spelt out to you, I think there may well be a case for them going in harder, there may well be a case for us urging them to do so. I think probably the opportunity has obviously been there with the G7 meeting taking place in Halifax—and Mr Clinton has obviously raised the matter with Mr Chirac, but whether anything more than that I don't know.

They were prepared to make that decision and I am sure that President Clinton will stick to that.

        GE:Well that strength of feeling has always been there. I think it did become muted over the years as those successive tests took place. I don't know, up until April 1992, how many press releases I put out deploring tests when they occurred, at pretty monotonous intervals, as those 148 underground tests took place between 1975 and 1992, a lot of them in the years that I was Foreign Minister. Certainly during, that particular period there wasn't much in the way of community reaction each time that occurred, although there had been of course ten years ago at the time of the Rainbow Warrior affair. I think however that France having made the decision to go down the moratori

        um path, having created expectations that that was the course it would follow in the future, and with the test ban issue being such a prominent one at the time of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty arguments just a few weeks ago, the profile of the issue has been raised all over again. It is not surprising, accordingly, that public reaction has been strong, and I think it is important that the French Government understand the strength and intensity and breadth of that community reaction. I will certainly be doing my best to communicate some of the sense of that to the French Government, as indeed I did in talking to the French Foreign Minister by phone the other night.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        GE:Well that's a matter for your judgment. I have been around this game long enough to know that the press always personalises everything whether things are a matter of government decision, cabinet decision or a committee decision as the case may be they are nonetheless always personalised, in the form of the particular minister, who has got to carry the can. I have got a good enough understanding of the way the system works to acknowledge that reality. Any response that was a proportionate one, that was in any way a moderated one, was obviously going to generate some significant and noisy reaction and criticism on the grounds that it wasn't going far enough. But I have spent my life, the whole of my political life as Foreign Minister, wearing this. During the whole of the negotiations over the implementation of the peace plan for Cambodia, and still, I have been wearing the brunt of considerable criticisms from those who thought I had been wimpish about the Khmer Rouge. I think history is proving that wrong and similarly other judgments might change when people get a better sense of the complexity of some of the issues and some of the responsibilities that I have to balance as Foreign Minister. My basic responsibility as Foreign Minister, I repeat, is simply to communicate, as effectively and persuasively as I can, the basic core arguments to the people that are actually going to have to make the decision, other governments.

The truth of the matter, as I said the other day, and as everyone has said, is that the nature of Australia's economic relationship with France is such that any economic boycott of this kind, instituted on a wide spread scale, much more widespread trade sanctions, would be no doubt utterly unproductive and only end up hurting ourselves, without having any redeeming effect on the decision-making process. That is a judgment that you constantly have to make, but I think the balance is about right in terms of our response.

France had re-created, I think, an image for itself as a good neighbour and a good regional citizen, and it has unequivocally and unquestionably put that reputation and image at risk by this action. And that is one of the messages I will be communicating. The response over and over again from the South Pacific countries, including ourselves, is simply this: if you are that confident that these tests run no risk of accident, run no risk of long term environmental damage, why aren't you conducting them on a farm in Provence or down a mineshaft in Picardy rather than on a coral atoll in the South Pacific. It's a very hard question to answer. But it's a question that should go on being asked.

         In terms of what has been achieved subsequently with the visit to France, apart from the obvious effectiveness of the protest when it is made face to face and when you have a lot of very effective and articulate spokespersons from the island countries lined up, I can say this. It is important to appreciate that this sort of dialogue does produce some results. In the first place, we have had an absolutely unequivocal assurance from the French government. It was ambiguous before this exchange I had that these eight tests, adding on to the 175 that have already occurred at Mururoa, will not be for the purpose of new generation weapons technology. That was left ambiguous before I met the French. The point had been made that the tests were for certain purposes—to test computer simulation technology and stockpile reliability—but it was not said specifically that they were not for new generation technology. That is the most crucial thing about the tests in terms of their overall significance for arms control.

         Secondly, I did get a repetition, obviously, of the assurance that they would sign the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996, as President Chirac had said. I wanted to find out what sort of treaty they were going to be prepared to sign. If the French were going to hold out for some sort of impossible criteria so far as the definition of tests and so on are concerned—if they are going to go down the track of arguing that a 500-tonne T-equivalent explosion is okay as a permissible test—it would not be worth having these bits of paper, as Christabel Chamarette and others are saying. I did get some assurances that, at least as a result of these further tests, France's position on that would be very much more moderate than would otherwise have been the case. I think that was an important gain.

         —I want to ask a few questions in relation to the answers given by Senator Gareth Evans during question time. First of all, why did Australia jump to lead the delegation of the South Pacific diplomats who, as we mentioned, were not South Pacific ministers? I would answer that it is part of the whole process and part of the whole problem. Instead of taking the time to listen to the South Pacific countries, Australia has jumped in in this manner to control the outcome of this delegation of the South Pacific Forum by taking diplomats whom the minister clearly had rank over.

         It seems to me that Australia is doing it. Why? Because there was to be a proposed trade-off. What is that trade-off? What will you give us if we accept your eight tests? What will you promise to do? In fact, it was exactly in today's answers that there was an indication that the trade-off would be to try to get France to toe the line in relation to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We know that we are being treated with contempt, and we know that the countries of the South Pacific are also being treated with contempt, because the definitions are being fiddled with.

         What is `comprehensive'? `Comprehensive' means that the nuclear powers will be restricted. Once again, just like the NPT, the nuclear powers will be allowed to update or maintain their own stocks and have tests of a certain size. It seems that the trade-off is not a trade-off at all. The trade-off is not in any way going to strengthen a comprehensive test ban treaty. The trade-off is more likely to put the whole test ban treaty off the rails altogether.

         Australia will share that responsibility if the comprehensive test ban treaty goes off the rails. Why? Because everybody is going to look and say, `We don't take this seriously. We're not judging the action in itself. We're judging it in the same way that the government considers it should operate in parliament'—that is, to do trade-offs which are leading to something else, which we all know do not lead to a result. We are not standing on principle. We are not denying the principle of testing. We are saying, `If we accept your testing, what will you give us?'

         It seems to me that we are selling off the vast majority of the people of Australia. But not only that. By taking this colonial attitude with relation to the South Pacific Forum, we are actually perpetuating the whole problem. The nub of the problem in relation to Mururoa is that the people of Mururoa are being denied access to a life. The people of the South Pacific are being denied access to their rights to a reasonable environment, to health, to safety, to the future of their country, and to fishing safely and so on in the future. That is what we are trading off here. The reality is that it is no trade-off at all, because France will be standing laughing at Australia's position in relation to how `reasonable' Australia is acting.

         What we have already done is traded off the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Australia delivered Indonesia. What was the trade-off? Was it guaranteed access to uranium? Does that mean Australia guarantees that—no matter what Indonesia does, no matter what other countries do, no matter what areas they may take in towards developing nuclear weapons, no matter how dangerous their program might be in relation to their nuclear power program, no matter what they do—we have to supply uranium if companies in Australia negotiate to do that?

The chamber acted in a fair and reasonable way, recognising that the extra time he would take in the half hour set aside to take note of answers would deprive other senators of their time.

          The government's view was that we should extend the half-hour envelope to enable the additional time granted to Senator Evans to be extended to other senators who might want to speak. My understanding is that Senator Kernot has indicated that she wants to do that. There is an extra minute or so available to do that. If she does not take all that time, other senators can speak in the remaining—admittedly short—period.

          However, we now have an attempt to change the standing orders in relation to the total amount of time set aside for taking note so that other political points can be scored. There are four senators in the opposition to decide who takes priority in taking note. If others had wanted to take note they could have risen in their places and done so, displacing some of the other opposition senators already on the list. If they have not done that, that is their choice. Standing orders are quite clear: there is half an hour. In this case, there was special dispensation but there should not be exploitation of that, extending the whole concept of taking note because some senators have missed out today.

In his response a few moments ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, said that he made a judgment about the best way to handle this issue when he was in Tokyo. If he were here now I would want to say to him that the Australian version of statesmanship—I use the gender advisedly—and leadership does not have to preclude a sense of passion.

         The language of diplomacy is often found wanting precisely because it leaves no room to express real feeling. While `Get your rocks off' might be able to be said in here, it is not appropriate to say that diplomatically. Irrespective of what may be achieved in international negotiations in the next 18 months or so, the here-and-now fact is that the Australian people required greater and more passionate representation and greater support from their foreign minister; they did not get it.

        I say with some regret that Senator Crowley is like most people in the Labor Party: they will do or say anything to distract attention from the real issue.

         My question related to the survey by the Queensland Council of Social Services into poverty. The survey was undertaken in 1994 and it raised a number of specific issues which I mentioned in my question. The low socio-economic group of people in Acacia Ridge in Brisbane was included in the survey. It is an area with a high poverty rate and people have difficulty in getting to hospitals because of inadequate public transport. The people interviewed in the Blackwater area of Central Queensland in 1994, during the term of the Goss Labor Government and the current federal government, said that the local hospital was like a bandaid way station and that they had to travel significant distances to get medical treatment. At the Kowanyama Aboriginal community there are no maternal medical facilities.

         If this is the record of the Goss Labor government and the current federal government on social justice issues, heaven help Australia. Mr Howe was lauded for the great job he has done. The unemployment rates in Queensland for youth and the long-term unemployed are higher than anywhere else in Australia. This is the sort of thing we can expect from another term of the Goss government. It is also the sort of thing that this federal government has not been able to address after 13 years in office.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison this day, relating to the procedures of the Department of Foreign Affairs for protecting Australians when overseas.

        The situation is this: in the last six years we have had some very unfortunate circumstances where Australians overseas have been in desperate need of assistance because they have been hijacked, held hostage or imprisoned. I refer to 1989 when Miss Jacqueline Hamill was taken hostage by some prisoners in the Philippines and subsequently murdered. I refer to David Wilson who was taken hostage in Cambodia and subsequently murdered. I refer to the case of Robert Bowra, a businessman from Western Australia who was trying to sell Australian-made boats in the Middle East and who had the misfortune to be involved in an accident which resulted in the death of a local citizen. Mr Bowra was subsequently imprisoned for six months. If Robert Bowra had been in Australia he would not have been liable to any criminal sanction at all. We have the case of Mr Maresh who died in Timor. There was a subsequent inquiry in relation to that matter.

         When Australians travel overseas they need the assurance that their government will do everything in its power to look after them and safeguard their interests. All the coalition is asking for is that there be an inquiry into how the Department of Foreign Affairs handles these incidents. I highlight the most dramatic examples to illustrate the point. There have been complaints about the department's handling of these matters and they cannot go unnoticed.

         What I am saying to the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that, if he is dinkum, let us leave aside the big picture and let us look at individual Australians and their families and see how they can be better serviced overseas by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Let us look at how the department has handled these particular instances where Australians have been in dire straits. That is all we are asking for—nothing more, nothing less—just an assessment of the department's handling of these situations. These criticisms cannot go unnoticed.

         —This is a very sensitive and difficult issue. I can say that with some degree of experience. In 1990, when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, I had a relative, Mr Greg Pollock, who was the husband of my sister-in-law, in Kuwait. He was taken hostage and held as a hostage for five months—first in Kuwait and then later in Baghdad. At the time, honourable senators will recall that there was a lot of public criticism about the action or supposed inaction taken by the government of the day. There was also criticism levelled at the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

         In these circumstances obviously families under distress and the public believe that, because they do not see public demonstrations or public action being taken, no action is being taken. On that occasion, and I believe on all other occasions, what was done behind the scenes, what was done in the department and what was done in the embassies was as much as was humanly possible to be done by the government and by the government's representatives. I can say that because I know that it occurred in that instance.

         But, naturally, the families of people and other people are distressed and they hold out hope that something more can be done. I want to make it very clear that in that circumstance, and I believe in these current circumstances, everything that could be done was done. It behoves us to look to support rather than necessarily be too quick to criticise the work, particularly the behind-the-scenes work, being done by departmental officers to assist those families and to assist those people, as was clearly done in the case of the hostages during the lead-up to the Iraqi war.

        This government has accepted, at least on paper, the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle says that one does not do things which potentially are likely to damage the environment in a significant way unless one is certain that the long-term effects are not going to be adverse. What we heard from the minister today was that, against a background of almost total ignorance, this government has placed no restrictions whatsoever on the importation of pilchards and their use in the wide variety of the Australian environment. We also heard about that lack of background information. I am glad that Minister Cook is in the chamber. Minister, this is an area where we need publicly funded research and we need a great deal more of it. This government is not providing those funds.

Moreover, it is considered that the tax is iniquitous in that, when introduced, it will apply retrospectively to people currently building homes, who had entered in good faith into `fixed price' building contracts.

        Thank you for your letter of 11 May 1995 concerning the amendment to condition 8108 of the Migration Regulations in Statutory Rule No 38 of 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you know, regulation 71 of Statutory Rule No 38 of 1995 amends condition 8108 to require that a person must not be employed in Australia by any one employer for more than 3 months without the permission in writing of the Secretary. Condition 8108 is only imposed in relation to subclass 417 (Working Holiday) visas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The working holiday scheme provides an opportunity for young people to holiday in Australia and supplement their funds through incidental work. Australia has formal working holiday agreements with Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The agreements enable nationals of those countries who have turned 18, but have not turned 31, to enter Australia as working holiday makers, provided they satisfy all prescribed criteria. Nationals of other countries who have turned 18, but have not turned 26, may also enter as working holiday makers, once again provided they satisfy all prescribed criteria for the grant of the visa.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the main reason for subclass 417 visa holders being in Australia is to holiday, it is intended that any employment in Australia should be incidental to that purpose. It is considered that, in most cases, working for long periods with one employer would be inconsistent with this policy intent. Accordingly, subclass 417 (Working Holiday) visas are granted subject to condition 8108.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Prior to amendments to the Regulations in September 1994, the equivalent to condition 8108 (ie condition 9217) required that a person must not be employed by any one employer in Australia for more than three months without the permission in writing of the Secretary. It appears that the words "without the permission in writing of the Secretary" were omitted due to a drafting error during the drafting of the September 1994 Regulations. The amendment to condition 8108 accordingly restores the former position.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As condition 8108 is a condition which attaches to a visa, rather than a criterion relating to the grant of a visa, the Secretary's discretion in relation to this condition is not subject to formal merits review. The exercise of this discretion is, however, subject to other accountability measures such as investigation by the Ombudsman.

         —The Soccer inquiry has required more time to complete than was anticipated when the terms of reference were given to the committee on 8 December 1994 and 2 February 1995. During this inquiry a large number of persons have been named adversely in public and in camera hearings. Under Senate procedures, the committee is obliged to send copies of the evidence where persons are adversely named to those persons, with an invitation to respond to it if they so wish. The volume of adverse comment, and the procedures the committee is obliged to follow to deal with it, have imposed a large task on the committee, which threatened to delay its report unduly. The committee has therefore agreed to present a report by the due date of 29 June 1995, which will present its conclusions and recommendations on the matters raised in the terms of reference, and to seek an extension of time to complete the task of sending out the adverse comment to the persons concerned and inviting their response to it. The committee will then present a second and final report.

         That the Senate censures the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator McMullan) for their deliberate refusal to table the report of the Australian Broadcasting Authority on cross media rules ordered by the Senate, in circumstances where the documents may contain matter highly critical of aspects of government communication policy in relation to cross media rules and, notwithstanding Senator McMullan's assertions to the Senate on 21 June 1995, may not be made public in the near future, or ever, in order to conceal these criticisms from the electorate.

        During the life of this present parliament, there have been 43 occasions on which the Senate has ordered the production of documents. On only two occasions during that time has the government refused to comply with those orders. On one occasion the minister was censured and on another occasion he was not. This occasion is particularly important and certainly deserves all the condemnation which the Senate can bring to bear. What we are confronting is a deliberate and wilful disregard not only for the order of the Senate but also for the interests of the public and all those who are concerned about the way in which the government has used media policy to advance its own political interests.

         I was struck most forcibly this morning by the sheer hypocrisy of the government on this matter and its refusal to allow any public debate prior to the matter coming before cabinet. When I read today's

         I saw that the minister—who is not prepared to allow the Senate or the public into his confidence—has provided a comprehensive brief about not only what is in the report but also what will go to cabinet, including sensitive discussions that are taking place and negotiations between Mr Lee and Mr Willis about the new foreign ownership limits. Mr Lee want wants to include quasi equity in a new definition of foreign investment. Treasury agrees with the need for a stricter definition but is pushing for a higher foreign investment limit and for companies to sell down under so-called transitional arrangements.

         I learned for the first time that Mr Willis is preparing a response to the recommendations of a Senate inquiry into the Foreign Investment Review Board. We know that 18 months ago the hearings were held and that the interim report, which was essentially the substantive report, was tabled about three months later. We have been waiting for more than 12 months. There is a requirement that the government table a report within three months. Now we learn for the first time that we are about to get some sort of token response; perhaps not. Nonetheless, this is the way in which the government responds to requests or orders of the parliament.

         The public ought to be outraged at the cynical way in which this government has reached the point in its political cycle where it really thinks that it does not have to take democracy very seriously, that it can simply govern in its own interests in an authoritarian fashion. If it wants to spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars in helping Carmen Lawrence, it quite cavalierly resolves that moneys be made available without limit. There is intense public interest regarding this matter on the back bench of the Labor Party. We well know that it is one of the few issues where the Left still has a voice on policy and is not afraid to express it.

         A large number of groups in the community have publicly expressed their views on these issues, and they ought to be given the opportunity to influence the public debate. There is no valid reason for withholding a public report. Senator McMullan has conceded that it has the status of a public report and that it will be released in due course. Cabinet decisions are not made in isolation. They should take account of public opinion on this matter. If ever there were a need for a full and public debate, it is in this sensitive area. The only logical conclusion one can reach from Mr Lee's withholding of the ABA report and deliberately defying the Senate is that Labor is about to make yet another media ownership decision on the basis of rewarding political mates and punishing political enemies, rather than acting in the national interest.

         It may be that the nominal minister, Mr Lee, has been overruled by the real minister for communications, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but he has to accept the blame for the wilful failure to cooperate with the Senate. I can well understand why Mr Lee would not be anxious to table this document, because in many respects it represents a humiliating backdown for him. After all, he was the one who was out there spruiking to all and sundry that 20 per cent ought to be the limit in the wake of the comments made by Mr Packer.

         We all know what this is about. Currently, the cross-media and foreign ownership limits for commercial television are both set at 15 per cent, although the limits have proved to be totally unenforceable because of the government's inept control test. What does the government do? It keeps the totally enforceable control test but proposes a new limit. In effect, the foreign and cross-media ownership limits would be 15 per cent if we can believe not only the ABA report, which has been leaked selectively, but also what Mr Lee is now saying, once again selectively. No longer is he insisting on 20 per cent; he has now come down to 15 per cent because he knows that the ABA has exposed the fact that 20 per cent would actually represent a higher level of foreign ownership and cross-media rule and would advantage, in particular, Rupert Murdoch and fundamentally disadvantage Kerry Packer because he would then be permanently locked out of any catch-up to Conrad Black, who has 25 per cent. As we know, he is on a promise to go even higher.

         The fact remains that now that Mr Lee is proposing a 15 per cent figure, we ought to know the basis on which the ABA has expressed a view that that is the most desirable option. I think at one stage Mr Lee was trying to suggest that he would come down in his figure because although the ABA had said in relation to Mr Packer that he had voting interests of 17.17 per cent, there were convertible notes which reduced that figure below the 15 per cent mark and, therefore, 15 per cent could be appropriate. When you examine that earlier ABA report, you find that convertible notes are included in voting interests. So there is no logic in that decision. It is clearly not just political expediency but it reflects the reality that the ABA has refused to roll over and do what the government originally wanted.

Do they in any shape or form touch on multimedia or what one might regard as a new concept of the information or entertainment industries? Do they address the fundamental issues of plurality and diversity or is this simply a convenient basis for the government to make yet another highly motivated political decision?

         It is hard to understand why the minister is not wanting to release this document now, although to suit the government's political convenience, undoubtedly it wants to make a cabinet decision on the matter first. But there is absolutely no guarantee that we will ever get to the cabinet decision.

There is no guarantee, as Senator McMullan said yesterday, that it will be considered next week, or indeed at all. Once we rise next week we may not come back. Once again, the government, with all the freedom in the world, will make some selectively and politically motivated decision that suits its political interests in relation to some aspect of cross-media.

         If there is any good reason why this report cannot be in the public arena posthaste, I would like to know about it. We know why it was initiated in the first place. The public is intensely interested. We do not know why the government will not support a comprehensive public review. Presumably, it is because it will reveal the extent to which the original decision was so hopelessly flawed. After all, it was Mr Keating who said you could be a prince of print or a queen of the screen but not both. The fact is that you have people in both camps wanting more all the time, you have enormous cross holdings, you have a state of continuing political unrest, you have a great degree of uncertainty and you have a long track record of making decisions that have very little to do with public interest. Therefore, quite clearly, the ABA report will be yet another way in which the shallowness of the original decision will be exposed for what it is worth. It was originally the `get the

There is no pretence any longer about making decisions in the public interest—whether it will assist the proper operations of the industrial relations regime.

That is a perfectly  reasonable aspiration as a political party—it is a perfectly understandable aspiration for an opposition political party—but has nothing to do with the high principles of democratic accountability which are about making sure that the executive cannot act without proper scrutiny.

I do not always like the decisions the Senate makes about those matters of principle, but that is the way democracy is: you argue issues of principle, you put your view, there is a vote, and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. We can all live with that. We do not enjoy it, particularly when it goes against us and we get censured; but that is the way a democracy operates—and we live with it.

         But here we have a question of partisan preference elevated to a matter of political principle. If, as a consequence, the Senate decides to censure the minister, having made in my view a fundamentally flawed decision yesterday about requiring this document to be provided before the cabinet has had a chance to consider it—which is a reasonably dangerous precedent and one with which the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has made it clear he will not comply—that would be a dangerous principle. But that is a matter for the Senate. If it makes that decision, I am sure the minister will give it due consideration.

         Then there is the regular process of censuring Senate ministers who you absolutely know cannot comply without the cooperation of their colleagues. I am not passing the buck; I will stand by the decision of my colleague the minister. I understand the principle that he is defending against what is merely a partisan attack. It is not that I am saying you should not make that attack; the Senate is entitled to censure me, if it wants. That is part of the process. But if you think that is in some way lifting the status and regard of this institution when you run around throwing up these things like confetti, when you really have a fit of pique that a document you want to use for political purposes will not be available until after the cabinet has made its decision, I have to say that you are sadly mistaken.

         —That was a very interesting speech by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan). I understand why he had to give it. But the attitude of the government that tabling the ABA report is in some way dangerous is absolutely extraordinary. This is a matter of principle. The Senate required the government to table the report of the ABA. Whether I had voted for that yesterday or not, a majority of members in this place required the government to table a report which the government says it will make public.

         The question is whether it will be made public this week or next week. The Senate has asked for it to be make public this week. The government has said that it is dangerous—it used that term—to make it public this week. How can it be dangerous? That is such a silly term to use. It cannot possibly be dangerous to make it public this week. As far as I can see, there are two reasons this report has not been tabled today. The first is that the cabinet believes it has good reason for nobody to see this report, except people who work for the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         , until cabinet has made a decision on it. Why would that be? Is it because public debate would then substantially be on the report rather than on the government's response and the government's response would not be a fait accompli and would not be able to be influenced by its own back bench or by anybody else? That is a possibility.

         The second possibility—and the only other one I can think of—is that the executive considers itself to be above the parliament. Its members have a sense of arrogance and conceit, one that is quite familiar to us at the moment and one that the government does not like very much when the French are showing it—but it is fine when the government is.

         I find it quite extraordinary; this is a matter of principle. That report should be on the table now. We understand it will be there next week, but perhaps we will never see it. Perhaps it is such a dangerous report that we will never see it. I would love to know how dangerous it is—and why. I am really looking forward to reading it. I cannot understand what the government is doing. Whether or not I had voted for that motion yesterday, I am voting for this censure motion today. It is outrageous that this report is not on the table right now. I will definitely be voting for the motion.

         —in reply—Senator Bourne is perfectly correct: there are two fundamental issues at stake. One is the merits of the document, whether it ought to be in the public arena and the extent to which there are sensitive matters in it which either should not see the light of day or must go to cabinet first. That argument is blown out of the water by the fact that Steve Lewis and Tom Burton have been told the highlights of the document. I thought it was interesting that Senator McMullan did not even try to defend that fact. He did not for a moment try to say there had not been comprehensive leaks. What do we have? We have a government that is not even prepared to argue that somehow it is perfectly justified in leaking to the media but it cannot be allowed to leak to the parliament.

         The other fundamentally important principle which Senator Bourne identified is the primacy of the parliament. The executive is a creature of this parliament. It consists of members of this parliament. If a chamber resolves that a document be produced, then even your government, Senator McMullan, has overwhelmingly acknowledged that that is a requirement with which it must comply. We have not heard any serious attempt to justify this document as being somehow of such overwhelming national significance or sensitivity that it could not possibly see the light of day.

         As Senator McMullan said yesterday, this is only an argument over timing. The document itself, apart from this dangerous suggestion which perhaps was trotted out in desperation today, does not contain anything of significance. The fact is that you have conceded that the document will be on the table. Of course, we have had various indications of when that might be. I do not have the slightest confidence that the government is going to make it available at any particular time.

         It is interesting that only a few weeks ago Mr Lee was promising to introduce legislation to alter the cross media rules in this current session of parliament. Yet what we have now been told is, `Well, there will be at least a two-month gap between the cabinet decision and any legislation being debated by the parliament, so you will have plenty of time to kick it around then.' Once again, perhaps without his even realising it, Senator McMullan is simply ripping up Mr Lee's commitment to introduce legislation in this session.

         The government is in such frantic political campaign mode that it does not give a damn about what the parliament or anyone else might say. If there are solemn resolutions passed, it will simply ignore them if it thinks it is in its political interest. That is what I think is so offensive to all parties in this chamber. Over the years the respect for this place has been pretty high; it has been taken pretty seriously by government.

It is absolutely ludicrous for people like Senator McMullan to say, `You tell us your policy; on the other hand, we will not tell you ours.' The government knows full well that what it is doing is not only a deliberate defiance of the parliament but also elevating political expedience to the highest possible level. In other words, the parliament is being treated with contempt. The ABA, in effect, is being told that its reports can be used for party political purposes. The ABA is not the private plaything of any political party. It is set up as an independent body to give advice. I presume the minister does not claim the government has the ABA in its pocket.

         Why shouldn't the ABA report be allowed to see the light of day? Is there anything in that report that will be so embarrassing? No, because we have been told that it will be released. What can the harm be in releasing it now? The ultimate argument, of course, is that, even if you disagree with all that, as Senator Bourne rightly says, you have the right to disagree; you have the opportunity to argue your case. But you do not have any respect for democracy at all. You come into the chamber on a political issue without the numbers and then have total contempt for the process. You say, `We are just not going to comply. We do not have to give any reasons. We will trot out a few arguments about how it does not suit our purposes, or we simply want to suit our political convenience by having the matter looked at by cabinet.

        —We are not proceeding with that notice of motion, even though we did have support from the opposition; I am not sure what the Democrats' position was—the government had announced it was not willing to do so—because we have gained an absolute assurance from the office of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), firstly, that, at the supplementary estimates hearing tonight, we would be given a copy of the text of the proposed amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 that was agreed to be deleted by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, at a meeting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people concerning the draft land fund bill on 16 June 1994. We want that on the public record. Secondly, we have been assured that there were no drafting instructions. That was the second request contained in the notice of motion. Thirdly, we have been assured that Pat Turner's notes are the only remaining copy and were not doctored in any way. I place on record that that is the reason why we are not pursuing this as a formal motion.

        CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. I will briefly outline the amendments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section three of the bill will have effect from the seventh of July 1994. Item sixty-three in part three of schedule four provides for the duty free entry of certified reference materials. Reference materials are mainly metallic compounds with accurately known compositions which are used as a standard against which like materials and processes are compared and apparatus calibrated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment contained in this bill will allow certified reference materials to be used in a broader range of industrial and scientific processes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Schedule one operates from the eighteenth of November 1994. In February 1994, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from eighty-one percent to ninety-four percent were wholly of viscose. This decision reduced the government's intended industry assistance rate from twenty-seven percent to free.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments contained in this schedule redefine the description of goods for the subject tariff items by replacing the word "wholly" with the phrase "of 100%". This action will reinstate the level of assistance for goods of mixed fibre content by excluding them from tariff items which require one hundred percent content.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 3 and schedule 2 of the bill gives effect to the government's decision on the Industry Commission's report on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries and came into force on the first of January 1995. The overall effect of the tariff changes will be that all imports of unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will be free of customs duty. Manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will still attract the excise equivalent duty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of duty, the concessional schedule four items 35b and 35c become superfluous and have been omitted. Consequential amendments to item 53a in schedule four and to the table in section 26 of the principal act are also necessary.
       </para>

        I refer honourable members to the joint ministerial statement of the thirteenth of December 1994 by the ministers for primary industries and energy, industry, science and technology, and trade and the Assistant Treasurer which sets out the main elements of the package of measures taken by this government and the state governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales to assist tobacco growers and manufacturers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Schedule two also contains an amendment consequential to the world trade agreement coming into effect in Australia. The change is necessary to maintain the intended rate of duty for parts of regulating and controlling instruments of tariff heading ninety thirty two which are not goods of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles.
       </para>

         The arrangement made on the debate on the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 between me and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) was that we would speak briefly. Where it was obvious that neither side had the majority, we would nominate the fact that we supported the bill but would not necessarily divide. I draw this to the attention of Senator Schacht.

         My three amendments are very similar to the ones moved in relation to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Bill. In relation to the first amendment, we on this side did not have the support of the Democrats, who did not agree with us that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or Airservices Australia, or AA, would be either economical or effective. For some reason, they did not see fit to support that proposal. They also did not see fit to support the notion that these groups should promote and foster civil aviation. We divided on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Bill.

        An argument was put that this is really a GBE and, as such, the rules, regulations and conditions that apply to other GBEs should apply to AA, or Airservices Australia. We have taken a contrary point of view because it is plainly obvious that AA is not a normal GBE in that it is a monopoly. It is no good saying that this will appear in the annual report, because the annual report will not be seen by members of parliament for 12 months. Therefore, that is the purpose of that amendment.

         The third amendment relates to the minister giving a direction under various sections of the act. The minister shall cause a copy of the direction or notice to be laid before each house of parliament within 15 sitting days. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this was a recommendation of the joint house committee chaired by Mr Peter Morris which was ignored by the government.

         In summary, the first amendment, for which we do not have the support of the minor parties, we would like to see embodied in the legislation. But, in the interests of time, we will not call a division. We have the support of the other parties for the second two amendments. Again in the interests of time, I suggest that the government follows the same course that we are proposing for amendment No. 1.

         The Trade Practices Act has applied to the corporate sector of the economy—which is most of it—for over 20 years since 1974. The essence of this bill is to extend the Trade Practices Act to reach the government sector and the unincorporated enterprises within the economy. With the government sector—the government businesses, the government commercial enterprises—we are talking about something like 10 per cent of our GDP. So it is a very important sector and a very important provider of essential services. We want competition within that sector so that it is more efficient and so that businesses can get on with being more efficient and world competitive.

         The proposed framework allows competition within these sectors and the onus goes back on government, particularly the state governments, to adopt competition policies. We are talking about a new procedure—an access regime—whereby people will be able to access the essential monopolies, such as electricity for the transmission grid, gas pipelines, rail lines and ports. There are two arms in relation to this bill: the administrative and enforcement arm, which is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; and the policy and advice arm, which is the National Competition Council.

         This bill comes to us because, at long last, there has been agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, with each of the states agreeing to implement competition in their respective areas. There will be hurdles for the states with respect to performance on electricity, gas, water and road transport over the ensuing years. If the states clear those hurdles, as will be judged by the NCC, they will qualify for additional income from the Commonwealth.

         Why is this competition important? It is extremely important because it offers the prospect of increased efficiency within the economy. I commend to senators and to the public the Industry Commission's report of March of this year on the growth and revenue implications of the Hilmer and associated reforms. It estimates that implementing all those reforms will add 5.5 per cent to GDP. Since GDP is presently around $470 billion, that increase is equivalent to around $23 billion. For consumers, that will mean an additional $9 billion, the equivalent of about $1,500 per household, if these reforms are implemented.

         The reforms by the Commonwealth will contribute about $4 billion out of the $23 billion, with the Commonwealth getting increased revenue of about $6 billion.

         I would like to share my experience in one of those monopoly areas—the electricity industry. When I was in the commercial world I had experience as a major electricity buyer for Australian Newsprint Mills. I was the leader of a team which built a newsprint mill at Albury in New South Wales about 15 years ago. We spent $200 million at that time establishing a world-class, internationally competitive pulp and paper mill. But we were very dependent upon electricity.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Within 12 months of building the mill and getting it going, the Wran government doubled the price of electricity to the mill, making it uneconomic. The mill would never have been built if the directors had known that the New South Wales government was going to do that. If there had been a national grid at that time and if we had been able to negotiate with a different supplier, that particular mill would have been profitable from the end of its first year. Instead, it had major losses for several years.

         I suggest that, had it not had to meet that price rise, the mill would have doubled in size by now, attracting, in current day costs, an additional $500 million in investment. Australia would be importing much less newsprint and would probably be exporting some of similar grades. But that has not happened because a state government doubled the price of electricity to an industry without due warning. That disastrous experience is a good example of how to frighten off investors.

         On the other side of the coin, before coming here I was chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission, an electricity supplier, for four years. It was obvious that a national grid was coming and we went through a major program of reform in the face of eventual competition. We spent a lot of time and effort on improving productivity. I am proud to say that that organisation has doubled its labour productivity over the last several years through contracting out and outsourcing goods and services rather than having everyone employed within the one organisation. Sadly, I refer to an article in last Monday's Hobart

         The Hilmer reform puts the onus back on the states to perform but they get rewards for doing so. If they clear the hurdles, they get additional income from the Commonwealth.

That is, it will be calling tenders for the provision of particular services to see if outside contractors can provide them more cheaply but without loss of quality. We applaud that move. All state governments are doing this. I know that in my state of Tasmania the government has made enormous gains in efficiency and competitiveness.

For example, the National Farmers Federation gave evidence before a Senate committee on 5 May about the meat industry and said that, while the product markets for that industry are exposed to world markets, the labour market is not and, as a consequence, the cost of processing meat in Australia is double that of other world processors.

The government has retained part 10 of the Trade Practices Act for outward cargo liner shipping services operated by an international cartel—called a conference in the trade. This was against advice that the government received from the Hilmer committee, the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Surveillance Authority, the Treasury and the Industry Commission.

         What has the government done to help business and investment in Australia? The government has added substantial taxes to the business sector. While the government talks competition, it is headed in the reverse direction on things which are within its own control. Since Prime Minister Keating came into power the total revenue of this government will rise from $100 billion in 1993-94 to an expected $124 billion next year. That is a huge increase in revenue. It is an example of a high taxing, high spending government.

         The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 will help set in train one of the most radical and far-reaching public reforms. The public sector as we know it will be forced to restructure in far-reaching and not necessarily positive ways. This bill will force public service agencies to reassess their role, their relationship to the public, and to realign their operations. I do not object to any of that. However, the focus is to do all of this on largely economic commercially driven lines. As I said, nobody objects to the notion of an efficient public sector, but the question is who pays for it.

Yet this bill, and the ramifications of this bill, have been the subject of very little public debate. It has been the subject of minimal public scrutiny.

It was identified that the Industry Commission had double counted a range of ongoing reforms, had overestimated the flow-on effects from the reforms to the general economy, had assumed reforms which go much further than the Hilmer report ever intended and had assumed no negative effects from the displacement of thousands of public sector workers whose job losses will provide the filling for the Hilmer magic pudding.

The Industry Commission has done its job: it has delivered its first strike and it got its few weeks of good catchy headlines. But I want to talk about the other picture, the real picture—the picture that includes a long list of potential losers. I have said that there will be some winners. There will be some losers, too. The first losers are the thousands of public sector workers who stand to lose their jobs. The thousands who remain will be expected to provide a higher level of service to a larger population with fewer resources. It is not that people object to working harder: it is what resources they have to work with.

         Secondly, there are the consumers of services. These people will also lose. They are likely to get less and pay more for public sector services. The third group of losers will be in the education system, where schools could be forced to compete with each other, to accept commercial constraints, to contract out core services and to charge higher user-pay charges for parents—and all this without any consideration of the likely impact on educational standards. In a world based on competition, market forces are supposed to set quality, not the education system itself.

The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 is part of a national policy package which aims to free up competition in Australian markets. The objective is to systematically remove anti-competitive behaviour so that efficiency is improved to the public benefit. The more competition, the better off we will be.

The two do not necessarily go hand in hand.

         Mr Goss admitted to `an audit of government activities by legal advisers to identify which business activities would be affected by the application of part IV of the Trade Practices Act to the Crown in the right of each state'. The Premier refused to table the audit because it deals with `commercial-in-confidence matters and is the subject of legal professional privilege'. What I believe he meant to say is that all private enterprise regulations will be exposed to the Hilmer sunlight but his government is going to be very careful about letting anyone get too close to government enterprises. That is a double standard. If the Goss government were truly committed to the competition principles, it would be open about government enterprise reform.

         While not constitutionally compelled to apply competition principles, the states have nevertheless signed a performance-tiered agreement and they will be rewarded with money, which was rightly theirs in the first place, so long as they reform in line with the Hilmer principles. The advocates of deregulation are sure that there are a number of state laws which have the effect of exempting behaviour under section 51 but are not visibly or explicitly doing so.

The major problem is that removing some regulations will make the big bigger at the expense of some of the small.

         The Hilmer report and the subsequent Industry Commission report used the fundamentally flawed assumption of pure competition, which is not possible in industries characterised by unequal market power. A newsagent's submission said, `Our significant concern is that the unintended consequence of the legislation designed to foster competition may produce the opposite result.' In many Australian industries—from beer to newsprint and hardware to groceries—there are a few players who are so large that they do exert considerable influence on price and raise the barriers to entry. They can sustain undercutting price wars to force new competitors out and they can extort the lowest prices from suppliers, so they grow more dominant. This bill does nothing to foster competition in those very imperfect markets. In fact, if you take away regulations that were set down to ensure that consumer interests were protected—for example, allowing only pharmacists to own pharmacies—you place more power in the hands of these conglomerates who can move to new markets and force the small players out.

         I hope that I have proven that a strong small business hand will be needed to guide competitive reform in the direction that will be healthiest for Australia. It is not this one piece of legislation before us that will doom small business, because all it does is set up the Commonwealth framework. So much will depend on bureaucrats who have never run a small business yet will sit in judgment of the futures of hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Since they work to put into practice a specific government's policy, it is ultimately about that government's commitment to, and understanding of, small business.

         Unless you have a strong fighter in parliament for small business, the outcome could be disastrous. There is a discussion these days about getting more women into parliament. I totally agree with that, but there is a category of Australian that is almost as rare as a bilby, and that is a parliamentarian with a small business background. I trod the boards of small business for 20 years before coming here, and I have tried to bring that perspective into this parliament. But when you have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who says of small business, `If they are feeling the pinch, they ought to say that small business is not for me and go back to PAYE employment,' I suggest that small business should be very concerned about Labor's approach to deregulating everything except the labour market. Maybe the Prime Minister was prophesying the Hilmer fallout when he said of small business, `This is as good as it ever gets,' meaning that it is probably going to get worse.

         —I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. I do so having had a longstanding interest in Commonwealth-state relations and being a federalist by conviction. I am also a very keen supporter of small business. I indicate at the outset that I was pleased to be able to participate on the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which considered this bill in some detail. In fact, some 26 submissions were received. Whilst no publicity was given to the fact that the committee was sitting and deliberating, it once again shows the valuable work that the Senate and its committee system engages in, which unfortunately the public virtually never gets to hear about. I just place on record my thanks for the opportunity to participate in that process.

         Like Senator Boswell, I had some concerns about this legislation. The opportunity to ask questions of departmental officers and industries involved has relieved me of a lot of those initial fears. I will briefly comment on some remarks of Senator Boswell. It is very rare that I disagree with Senator Boswell, but on this issue I do. I disagree with him on the basis that I think he tried to tie down the legislation far too strictly with his comments. I am not sure that I wrote this down correctly, but there was a new maxim: thou shalt deregulate or thou shalt not regulate. I forget the way that he put it. The thrust of the legislation is that there should not be any regulation unless it can be justified on the basis of certain criteria. That was the important aspect that I think, with respect, Senator Boswell left out in his comments on this legislation.

         I turn to some of the key aspects of this legislation that may be of interest to some people. A major aspect of the bill is the creation of an access regime defined in the explanatory memorandum as providing for the declaration of certain services provided by facilities which are of national significance by which persons may seek access to declared services. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be merged to form the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, and a new advisory body, the National Competition Council, NCC, will be established. Further, defining new Commonwealth state relations are two intergovernmental agreements—the conduct agreement and the competition principles agreement.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The conduct agreement sets out processes for amendments to the competition laws of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and for appointments to the commission. Amongst other things, the competition principles agreement sets out the arrangements for appointments to the National Competition Council and the principles which governments have agreed to follow in relation to prices oversight, structural reform of public monopolies, review of anti-competitive legislation and regulations, access to services provided by means of essential facilities and elimination of the net competitive advantages enjoyed by government businesses where they compete with a private sector.

         To a great degree, pressure has always been placed on the states to submit to competition without an equal focus on the Commonwealth. The statement has been made by the federal government that competition is good for all sectors of the economy. With that, I would basically agree. Yet the new section 235A states specifically that part IIIA of the Trades Practices Act access regime does not apply to the supply of telecommunications services by a carrier or under licence. There is no deregulation at all of the labour market. I will make comments about that later. An important provision, new section 29B (2) and (3), allows the council to carry out a function conferred on it by law of a state or territory. The council in carrying out its functions may cooperate with a department, body or authority of the Commonwealth, state or territory. The council has the potential to become a most powerful body.

         Provisions provide for the declaration of certain services provided by facilities which are of national  significance and for the means by which persons may seek access to the declared services. By signing the competition principles agreement, governments agree to the processes for further micro-economic reform, but in general each government will be responsible for setting their own timetables and agenda for progressing these reforms. In relation to comments made earlier by Senator Boswell, I believe that aspect needs to be kept in mind.

         Another very important area of concern is that of the community service obligations. Many of the government business enterprises affected by these reforms perform important community service obligations by virtue of their monopoly or near monopoly position in the market. Concerns have been raised over the future compliance with these community service obligations, particularly in the climate of privatisation of government business enterprises and increased competition in the utility sectors of the market.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While the bill does not deal directly with the question of community service obligations, the competition principles agreement does consider them particularly in relation to prices oversight. As prices oversight is primarily the responsibility of the state or territory that owns the enterprise, the agreement states—and I think it is appropriate that this be put on record:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . State and Territory Parties will consider establishing independent sources of price oversight advice where these do not exist.

       <para>
        It further states that any independent source should take into account:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . any explicitly identified and defined community service obligations imposed on a business enterprise by the Government or legislature of the jurisdiction that owns the enterprise . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Once again, to a certain extent, I think that answers the concerns that Senator Boswell raised. We on this side express our concern about the maintenance of community service obligations by state and territory owned business enterprises. But I am satisfied, given the mention of that in the agreement, that they will be appropriately taken care of.

         During the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing into this bill a number of issues of concern were raised that were meritorious. They highlighted that when one introduces such wholesale change, it is appropriate that it be done with a degree of sensitivity. The Liberal Party signed a brief, but nevertheless pungent, minority report which is on page 7 of the committee report. That was signed by my colleagues Senators Chapman and Gibson and myself. That highlighted three matters. Before developing those concerns, I hasten to add that, despite having expressed those concerns, the Liberal Party—speaking for myself as well—supports the legislation.

        I move on to the concerns of small business, such as the taxi industry, which expressed concerns. My own view is that some of those concerns were not fully justified.

         The other point which I want to make and which I hinted at earlier is this government's complete refusal to deal with labour market reform. In an economy there are a whole range of matters that need to be dealt with. Clearly, the cost of labour and the way the labour market operates has a significant and vital impact on the total economy, on its productivity, on the number of jobs that become available, on the standard of living that is available within the community and the profitability of companies and individuals. From that profitability governments are then able to raise tax revenue to deal with some of the important social justice issues of the day. Without the profitability, governments cannot raise the taxes to then deliver the taxes to those who are so deserving.

         Clearly, why the government has not touched the question of industrial relations reform is because it is continually doing deals with the trade union movement to protect itself. We have not seen a better example of that in recent days than the unfortunate demise of Senator Bruce Childs from this place in about two years' time to make way for a trade union official who, with respect, does not have a very good reputation. Of course, I refer to George Campbell.

If there is a test of competition to be applied to government business enterprises, state governments, territories and the professions across the board, one would have to ask, `Why not include labour market reform?' The reason is that the Australian Labor Party's financial lifeblood is through the compulsory levies that it gets from the trade union move ment.

         All of a sudden members of the Labor Party have gone deadly quiet. There are no more interjections, because I have them where it hurts. At the beginning of the government's reform process of the waterfront—this is the alleged process that it went through—the average ship turnaround time was 44 hours. Those in the gallery might be interested in hearing these figures. The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority identified a turnaround time as its target of 27 hours. To that, I say well done and well identified. It is something that ought be achieved. The government sets about, allegedly, reforming but all it did was rearrange the deck chairs on the

         . In June 1994 what was the average turnaround time for ships in Sydney? Was it 27 hours or the 44 hours before the  reforms took place? No, it was 53.4 hours. What a great record on reform! In Melbourne Ports the average turnaround time was not 27 hours, not 44 hours, but 47 hours. A great record of reform! Just in case honourable senators are interested in reform, the average wharfie earns $75,000 per annum. This is the result of the Australian Labor Party's dynamic reform process. I support the Competition Policy Reform Bill.

         A lot of people would ask, `What is in it for us?'—the average Australian in their suburban home or, indeed, the farmers in rural Australia. I have some doubt about the estimates and I will look at the figures with interest in due course.

I believe that that is a significant saving and a significant benefit for average Australians who otherwise might not normally be interested in a bill which is entitled the Competition Policy Reform Bill, but there are very real benefits for them—the ultimate consumers—at the end of the day, estimated at $1,500 per Australian household.

He must think Queensland people are living in fantasy land if he thinks that sort of rhetoric is going to fool them into not seeing what his connection is with the federal Labor Party.

Where is he jumping up and down and saying, `Hey, you can't do that.' He does not want to offend his mates in the Queensland Labor government.

          Drawing the line on poverty: an assessment of poverty and disadvantage in Queensland

         and commissioned by the Queensland Council of Social Services, we see Queensland is in a parlous state. Today I mentioned just four examples of how people in Queensland cannot get decent access to health services or any help with unemployment in my state which has been run by a Labor government now for six years in conjunction with a federal Labor government that has been in power for some 12 years. Poverty in Queensland is at a tragic level. Nothing is done by the Queensland Labor government and do not expect anything from the crew down here who have really forgotten the little people in Australia.

         I do not want to hold up the Senate. I am aware that we are anxious to get on to estimates committees. I just want to conclude by quoting from a speech Mr Keating made to a Labor Party dinner in Brisbane last year. It shows the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. When it suits, coming up to a Queensland election, the parties try to distance themselves from each other. Goss says he does not want Keating there and, as I say, he will indulge in a bit of Keating bashing and Canberra bashing over the next few weeks. But if you really want to know what it is all about, refer to the words of Mr Keating at that Labor Party dinner last year at the Greek Club in Brisbane. This is how Mr Keating finishes:

        So, thanks for having me back on this occasion, it's a long way from the election now but we've got a lot to do yet. And, as we do it I hope you people of the Labor party in Queensland can be proud of this government—

       <para>
        There we are. No matter how much in the next few weeks Mr Goss tries to distance himself from Mr Keating, there it is: they all stand together. The sort of federal government in Canberra at the present time is the sort of government that is becoming increasingly obvious in Queensland—there is the same arrogance, the couldn't care less attitude, the we know best attitude. It always reminds me of one of Wayne Goss's promises before the 1989 election. He said, `I want to do to Queensland what John Cain has done for Victoria.' He is succeeding. From being one of the wealthiest states, we continue to go backwards, and the people of Queensland should be aware of that.

         this morning, you would be left in no doubt that there is an election in the air—probably in August of this year, maybe a little later, but certainly it is imminent. The Labor Party is running the same tired old line it was running during the campaign in 1983 and, of course, in 1980. What it says in Canberra every time is, `If you vote for the Liberals, you will lose your jobs in the Public Service.'

         I want to put on record this afternoon the actual facts of what Labor has done to the Public Service, and Canberra in particular, so that people will be able to evaluate the sort of rubbish that the government keeps putting out as the election campaign goes on. As I said, it started the campaign this morning. There have been changes to the Public Service and drops in the number of staff under Labor, and you might say they are justified. The government may be able to explain it. But that is not what I am talking about today. I am talking about what the government says on the one hand and what it actually does on the other. That is what the people of Canberra and the people of Australia generally need to know something about.

         It is even more interesting, though, to look at what the Labor Party has moved out of the national capital during the time it has been in government. We could ask a very good question in relation to each one of them as to why it was moved out of Canberra. That has never been satisfactorily explained in relation to any of them. Of course, the cost to taxpayers of doing so also is a matter that taxpayers would be interested in.

The Industry Commission transferred to Melbourne; Australian Defence Industries transferred to Sydney. The National Aviation College, which ought by any test to have been established in Canberra, was established in Tasmania for totally political reasons.

In 1989 the government threatened to relocate the Maritime Safety Authority to Newcastle.

         The federal Labor government voted for the Australian National Training Authority to be in Brisbane, rather than in the national capital, where, quite clearly, a national authority of that kind ought to have been based. Why were the CSIRO headquarters moved to Melbourne from Canberra in the December-January 1992-93 period? It was costly, and for what reason? There was also a proposal to transfer the Australian Broadcasting Authority to Sydney, but that was defeated in the end by the pressure of the sense of it staying in Canberra. So, at any whim the government will shift out of Canberra anything it likes. It does so not because it is in the best interests of the organisation, but for some reason of its own. It is in no position to talk about what a Liberal government would do.

         The reason this matter has come this week is because Senator Ian Macdonald had a paper and some notes of his own about his own area of responsibility—regional development. In it he referred to the fact that if he was able to persuade his colleagues for the $1 billion or so that he would like to see allocated to regional development—I suspect many of us would too—he would propose that some of that be spent at the coal face, where regional development is necessary. Who could argue with that? This was latched on to by the Labor Party as saying that we would take public servants from Canberra. Not every Commonwealth public servant is located in Canberra. In fact, I think it is only about 26 per cent who are located in Canberra.
