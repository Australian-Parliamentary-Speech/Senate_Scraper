         On 22 June 1994 the Committee of Privileges was ordered by the Senate to consider a particular instance of refusal by a minister to produce documents in response to an order of the Senate as part of its consideration of the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994, which had been referred to the committee on 12 May 1994. The resolution also required the committee to consider a report by the Auditor-General, subsequently tabled on 20 October, which the Senate had by the same resolution ordered him to produce in relation to leases for office space in the Casselden Place building in Melbourne.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In examining the matter the committee was influenced by a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations tabled on 3 December 1986 and draws attention to that committee's general conclusions on the question of commercial-in-confidence reasons for non-disclosure of contracts to parliamentary committees. The conclusions are outlined at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Privileges Committee's report.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Committee of Privileges has made some observations on these conclusions at paragraph 10 of its report and has reached its own conclusions. Firstly, that the Casselden Place matter referred to the Committee of Privileges on 22 June 1994 constituted a further instance of non-compliance with an order of the Senate which gave rise to the committee's reference on the Parliamentary Privileges (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994. Secondly, the committee reaffirms the comments made in its 49th report that any claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity are ultimately for a house of parliament to determine but draws attention to its comments in paragraph 10 of its report.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Thirdly, the committee again draws attention to the suggestion outlined at paragraph 2.15 of its 49th report that, in the event of a conflict between a claim of executive privilege and the assertion by a house of parliament of its right to have access to information, relevant documents be sent to an independent arbitrator to evaluate them on public interest immunity criteria. Fourthly, that, in this instance, the use of an independent arbitrator to examine the matters of concern to the Senate—that is, the Acting Auditor-General—appears to have worked satisfactorily. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the amendments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Schedule one contains amendments announced by the Treasurer in the 1994-95 federal budget and have operated since 11 May 1994. The amendments give effect to the government's decision to decrease the customs duty on topped crude oil by 2.977c per litre and on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre. These changes will lower input costs for industry and will specifically benefit coastal shipping, export oriented mineral projects and certain manufacturing operations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Schedule two is operative from 1 July 1994. In May 1993, this government decided to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences from 1 July 1993 by phasing out the most developed countries from access to the developing country margin of preference for certain imported commodities. On 4 May this year, my colleague Senator Cook, announced in the Working Nation White Paper that a similar phase-out would be extended to the remainder of goods in the customs tariff with the exception of cheese, sugar, unmanufactured tobacco and certain replacement components for passenger motor vehicles.

        The Treasurer also announced on budget night 1994 an increase of 1.194c per litre in customs duties on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene for use in aircraft. This increase is a further part of the process announced by the government in the 1992-93 federal budget of a phased introduction of full recovery of the costs incurred by the Civil Aviation Authority in implementing aviation safety standards, and 50 per cent of their costs of safety standards setting and compliance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The rate of duty on aviation gasoline is subject to further variation in respect to the duty collected and paid to the CAA to recover airways costs attributable to aviation gasoline powered aircraft. The reduction of 7.521c per litre follows the adoption by the CAA of a marginal cost basis for the pricing of services provided to operators of gasoline powered aircraft. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the fact that a large proportion of CAA facilities are put in place because they are required for regular public transport operations mostly undertaken by aviation kerosene powered aircraft.

        As part of the government's policy pertaining to the automotive industry until the year 2000, tariffs on passenger motor vehicle replacement components were to be maintained at fifteen per cent from 1 July 1992. Amendments contained in this schedule redress certain anomalies which arose in the implementation of the government's policy. Specifically, a number of tariff classifications were omitted from the original PMV schedule of replacement components. There were also a small number of other classifications for which rates of duty had already fallen below the 15 per cent threshold.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I stated at the time that the Government considered the bill of such importance that it would be reintroduced as soon as possible. The Government did not accept the refusal of the Opposition to support this vital legislation and would give the Opposition another chance to support it.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government welcomes the Opposition's belated acceptance of the importance of this bill and their indication that they will now support it. The bill itself is unchanged from that which the Opposition rejected last year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill, through its proposed changes to section 35 and 36 of the act (which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively) seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were thought to possess prior to the decision of the High Court in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in December 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was this decision which gave rise to the commencement of claims against the Commonwealth for compensation for wrongful imprisonment of a number of unauthorised boat arrivals who are usually referred to as boat people. Prior to this decision no one had questioned the use of section 36 of the act (from December 1989 to September 1994 numbered as section 88) to detain the unauthorised arrivals in question. Indeed, those sections were not challenged in the Lim proceedings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 36 of the act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of this kind were detained in custody under this section while their claims to remain in Australia were assessed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Lim case other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people were challenged and doubt was subsequently cast upon the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing—like all other concerned parties—that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves—and their legal representatives—saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention on the basis none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the Government and the Department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        New provisions to detain unauthorised boat arrivals came into effect in May 1992 with the commencement of Division 4B of the act. These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in the Lim case to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992 with the support of the Opposition. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under Division 4B of the act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to one dollar per day the damages payable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Honourable Gerry Hand, declared to Parliament, ". . . It is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who arrived here without authority and who have been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA—and I would repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid when it was established—is yet to be heard by the High Court. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the "just terms" requirement in the Constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to one dollar per day is constitutional.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I earlier remarked, the amendments proposed seek to reflect the Commonwealth's previous understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88), and their operation. Legislative amendments of this kind can be classed as "curative", which retrospectively correct defects discovered in the law or its administration, and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recent High Court judgements involving the "just terms" requirement of our Constitution have suggested that this approach of "curative" legislation is an avenue available to the Commonwealth. Indeed the courts, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, have emphasised that it is always open for Parliament to correct developments in the law, other than in constitutional matters, where those developments do not accord with Parliament's intention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable, and it may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights. It merely gives effect to administrative action already taken. Action, it should be noted, which was previously assumed by all relevant parties to be valid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill—the No.3 bill—is substantially identical to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 introduced in the Senate on 8 June 1994. The Government has introduced this bill with the intention of placing the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend the claims for compensation. The bill seeks only to achieve the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA—to prevent a possible windfall of a substantial award of damages to persons who arrived in Australia without lawful authority and were held in detention for the legitimate reason of assessing their claims to stay in this country as refugees. In this way, the Government seeks to ensure that section 88 has, and always had, the effect and operation that Parliament intended.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Opposition parties were influenced in their earlier decision to oppose the curative measures in this bill by the dissenting report of their members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in it's consideration of the No.2 bill. That report attempts to distinguish the proposed curative steps in the bill from the dollar a day provision on the ground of retrospectivity. This is pure sophistry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 54RA limits  any compensation payable to one dollar per day after the cause of action concerned has already arisen. Thus the Parliament has already applied retrospective measures to substantially limit the claims of the boat people for compensation. Sufficient doubt has now been placed upon the measures taken to date, for the Government to accept the necessity of pursuing further retrospective measures of a curative nature to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the strongest possible position to defend these claims.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The dissenting report also adopted the line pursued in the submission of the Law Council of Australia before the Committee, that the curative measures would distort the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government. This submission ignores the well established prerogative of the Parliament to legislate so as to affect and alter existing rights at issue in pending litigation without interfering with the exercise of judicial power in a way that is inconsistent with the Constitution. Until the High Court decides otherwise, curative legislation of this nature remains a valid course open to the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I turn now to the curative provisions of the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to sections 35 and 36 (sections 87 and 88) do not seek to change the operation of those sections, but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of Division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that Department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed, or for example is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This amendment also permits the taking and keeping of persons in custody, notwithstanding that the vessel on which those persons departed for Australia might not necessarily be the same vessel on which those persons arrive. It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel, to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country, for instance to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the circumstances envisaged by new subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) it is not appropriate that the period for which a person may be detained should be determined by reference to the departure of a vessel from a port. The proposed amendments will, therefore, provide that custody is to be authorised until the person is granted an entry permit; or for such period as is necessary to allow for the person's removal from Australia, following a request in writing from the person to be removed, or after all applications to remain (for example, entry permit applications and applications for refugee status) and associated appeals or reviews have been finalised, or once all consideration of whether the person will be permitted to remain in Australia has been otherwise concluded; or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the act, a person is considered to have entered Australia once they disembark in Australia. Proposed subsection 36(1AB) (subsection 88(1B)) makes it clear that a person is taken not to have entered Australia as a result of temporarily, haphazardly disembarking—for instance, on an island off the Australian mainland, briefly and without the knowledge of the Australian authorities—after which the persons then reboard their vessel.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendment to section 35 (section 87) similarly does not seek to alter its existing operation but instead inserts specific provisions, to avoid any doubts, as to the extent of the power under this section. Under it an officer may, to prevent a person from entering Australia unlawfully, require a vessel to enter a port and require unauthorised persons to remain on that vessel until it arrives at the port.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I repeat that these simple, common-sense amendments, curative in nature, seek no more than to ensure that sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) of the act have and have had the operation and effect that Parliament intends them to have, which is the operation and effect which the Department and Ministers previously understood those provisions to have had.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also inserts a constitutional validity or "reading down" provision. This will provide, unless a contrary intention can be clearly discerned, that where a provision of the act could have both valid and invalid applications, the provision is to have every valid application and is not to have any invalid application. The provision is similar to and consistent with "reading down" provisions in certain other Commonwealth legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the doubt over the validity of section 54RA the Government proposes to repeal that section in this bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By supporting the curative steps proposed by this bill the Parliament can provide the Commonwealth with the strongest possible position for the defence of the boat peoples' claims. In doing so the Parliament will not as I have outlined above be embracing retrospectivity for the first time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Parliament has already demonstrated its will to protect the Commonwealth, and the taxpayer, from the potential burden of compensation payments to those unauthorised boat arrivals who were detained under section 88 while their claims to remain in Australia were exhaustively assessed. The Government's commitment to this position is demonstrated by the introduction of the curative measures in this bill.

          —in reply—We have canvassed the issue, obviously. We have not got the support of the Democrats, despite their previous public stance that they would prefer a prolonged investigation of this bill. The sad reality is that when it comes to the vote we will not have the numbers. This legislation, as I said yesterday, fundamentally alters the whole structure of health care in this country. It is absolutely appalling that the legislation is not to be given the scrutiny that it deserves. I know for certain that the people who are going to be most affected by this will be the patients out there in the community. None of us want to be consumers of health care but it is inevitable that every year one in seven people approach a doctor and receive some form of treatment. So one in seven people in the community listening today will need to access health care.

          This legislation will fundamentally alter the contract whereby the patient becomes contracted to an insurance company, whereas at present the patient is contracted to the doctor who is looking after them. I know which position I would like to be in. I would not want to put my faith in an insurance company, but that is in essence what will occur under this legislation. The Democrats have always preached this mantra that they are going to `keep the bastards honest'. I do not want to put that mantra upon the Western Australian Greens; I do not impugn their honesty at all, but surely they would agree that there needs to be thorough scrutiny.

          The reply I was given from the Western Australian Greens, and from the Democrats for that matter, was that it was some sort of trick, that it was because in this case the opposition might have a casting vote. The same thing was said about the whistleblowers committee—that it was some sort of trick. It has been fairly obvious that in the conduct of that committee that has not occurred. By bringing it to the vote we will have these people on the record.

          We have already had 67 separate submissions in relation to this legislation and, despite what Senator Chamarette said, the agenda for the hearings on Friday is that they start at 10.30 in the morning, conclude at 4.20 p.m. and then resume on Monday morning for an hour and a half. So it is not two days. It happens to be two separate days on which they are sitting but the actual time given to the debate is one day. So it is a one-day hearing, albeit that it is being postponed on Friday after previous legislation is considered early in the morning—again something of serious significance, the compensation bill, the so-called double dipping when people are under workers compensation. So it is a one-day bill. It is a one-day quick and dirty operation. I believe the people of Australia deserve better than a one-day quick and dirty look at the legislation, but that is what is going to occur.

          The Democrats have said that if the evidence shows that then it may need to be extended. There are 67 separate submissions on this matter from interested bodies. The only ones that are supporting it are part—surprise, surprise—of the Australian Health Insurance Association. The Medical Benefits Fund, which is the largest privately operated company in Australia representing 1.4 million people, is totally against the legislation. The Aged Care Organisation of Australia is totally against the legislation. The psychiatric service is totally against the legislation and the rehabilitation service is totally against the legislation. The only supporter, as far as I can see, is the Executive Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association and even his organisation is split.

          What I would like to know is why the rush to judgment. Where is the consultation? Where is the opportunity for consumers to appear before us? This is a one day, quick and dirty operation supported by the Democrats and the Western Australian Greens. I think the Australian public deserves better than that. When this legislation comes before the parliament we will do everything in our power to expose the hypocrisy of the so-called independent groups. I think it is clear that there needs to be much more debate, much more reference to the community and much more opportunity for the organisations to appear before a Senate select committee. That was the purpose of my motion.

          —When the committee was last considering the bill, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) moved that the request be not pressed. This was debated and the committee then reported progress. Senator Campbell then moved to refer the bill to the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. The committee reported on the bill on 9 February 1995. The question before the committee now is that the request be not pressed.

        I look at the first of those amendments, which relates to clause 3 on page 25. It relates to the amount to be provided to the fund. The amount provided originally was $121 million. That was on a per year basis. In other words, it was a fixed sum. Our original amendment had proposed that there be an additional $3 million a year—again, a fixed sum. That would have effectively capped the amount for administration and, over time, would have meant that the amount available in real terms would have diminished over the period of 10 years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This amendment seeks to ensure that at least $3 million is available. It allows the parliament, by means of an appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund, to increase that amount each year, presumably on an indexation basis but providing a general discretion. Having the additional funds appropriated from other legislation avoids the difficulties that are normally involved with the Senate seeking to provide for an increase in funds and avoids the necessity for a request to be pressed with the House of Representatives on the matter. It can simply be put forward in terms of an amendment.

         —During the course of the select committee's hearings on the amendments as dealt with by the chamber the last time this was before us, there were a number of views expressed in relation to the amendments. What we have before us today are amendments proposed by the coalition which deal with concerns that were raised during the hearing. I absolutely refute any allegation that the members of this committee went into those hearings with their minds made up. That was not the case and that is evidenced by the fact that in some cases we have changed our stance in relation to the amendments.

         Firstly, there is the appropriation of $3 million for administration expenses, which has previously been mentioned. That has been changed to an appropriation from a request. What is more, there is an amount of $3 million or such higher amount as is appropriated by the parliament from the consolidated revenue fund for this purpose. That simply says that there is no cap, as such. There was some concern expressed during the hearings about a cap being placed on administrative expenses. That, in brief, is the reason for that amendment.

         What I would call the second amendment, which on the circular appears as 3(f), relates to the Indigenous Land Corporation making sure as best as possible that there is no native title involved in any land that it seeks to acquire. Again, there was some concern about that because in our prior wording we had required that the Indigenous Land Corporation lodge a non-claimant application pursuant to the Native Title Act. Of course, there has been some legal concern that you cannot lodge a non-claimant application if you have no interest in the land. That is, you have to have some aspect of a lease—freehold, licence. What you would have in this instance is a requirement that the Indigenous Land Corporation go along in a situation where it has no interest in a piece of land and make an application or non-claimant procedure to clear the decks.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It was thought that there might be a legal hindrance to the Indigenous Land Corporation doing this. There was also come concern expressed by witnesses that this would unduly delay any acquisition of land. So that is why you will see in what I call amendment No. 2, which is subparagraph (3)(f), the deletion of the requirement for lodging a non-claimant application. I believe that streamlines the situation and answers the concerns that were expressed to the committee.

         The next amendment appearing on page 4 is subparagraph (3)(g) which deals with amendment No. 4 previously dealt with by this chamber. That is the one which dealt with the rather controversial phrase `those most severely dispossessed'. What has happened there is that the whole paragraph has been deleted. It formerly read:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands;
       </para>
       <para>
        That is now deleted and replace by new wording in what I call amendment No. 3, which states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of the resources of the Fund, priority is to be given to those who suffer most disadvantage in relation to access to land or who are unable to gain substantive title to land.'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That I believe clarifies the phrase `most severely dispossessed'. There was evidence given that the principle was a good one but the wording was not that good and it could be improved upon. We are indebted to the Aboriginal rights movement from South Australia for that wording. That wording was suggested during the hearing in Adelaide.

         Finally, we have in subparagraph (h) the amendment which deals with consultation with traditional owners. Previously it was in amendment No. 26, that before the Indigenous Land Corporation performs a land acquisition function it should take all reasonable steps to consult with traditional owners of the land. During the course of the evidence given to this committee there was some concern as to what constitutes a traditional owner and it did cause some consternation. The coalition senators, and I believe the Greens as well, took this on board and a suggestion was made that instead of saying `traditional owners' it should be expressed in terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having a traditional or historic link with the land. That spelt it out a bit more clearly because that aspect needed clarification.

         There we have a thumbnail sketch, if you like, of the amendments proposed by the coalition and the reasons that they came about. I would seek to address them in a touch more detail because I do think it is important for it to be placed on the record as to the evidence given during the course of this committee and why that evidence was accepted in these discrete instances. It is interesting to note that in the government's land fund bill mark II, which is in the other place, it has adopted some amendments which were canvassed by the select committee on the land fund bill. Those dealt with the disclosure of information in criminal proceedings, the native title committee having a function of review, any change in the national strategy being notified to the minister within two months and one or two other amendments that escape my memory.

         Firstly, we have provided more discretion to the parliament to go beyond the $3 million, and we have done it by a mechanism which allows for an amendment. Secondly, there is effectively a direction as to how the $3 million is to be spent, allowing for indexation. Thirdly, there is a legal clarification to make it clear that day-to-day administrative expenses ought to be spent on just that and to ensure that land fund moneys are spent on land acquisition and maintenance; in other words, to both minimise administrative expenses and quarantine the nature of those expenses.

         That seems to us to strike a very sensible balance.

         —The government opposes this amendment for reasons of principle, for technical reasons and for practical reasons. Let me spell all of those out. As to questions of principle, the removal of the $3 million cap in the original amendment—which we have, of course, sought—is here offset by a provision requiring the government to provide a separate appropriation for the ILC's administration expenses every year. That will require governments to find additional moneys separate from the land fund for administrative purposes. That is a new burden being created for the government which the government is not minded to accept.

         Be that as it may, the larger issue of principle that underlies this is the reality that we now have a fairly extreme form of paternalism being imposed upon this corporation. Virtually all other statutory bodies—certainly every one that I have been able to think of or research so far, and certainly those with commercial functions—are given discretions as to how much of their funding will be spent on administrative costs.

         It is very paternalistic, I have to say, not to trust the Indigenous Land Corporation, virtually alone among statutory corporations, to be able to manage its finances appropriately. It might not have been the motivation of this amendment—which is to provide some additional amount for administration, and no doubt I will be told that by the opposition—but it is certainly its effect. For that reason, quite apart from any of the others, there is a problem right at the threshold with this kind of amendment.

         The technical problem I might try to describe in the following terms. It is a legal problem which could, in fact, prevent the land fund from being credited with any money at all during its first 10 years, with the way the legislation is crafted. The formula for credit to the land fund in each category A year includes, with this amendment, an unspecified amount of not less than $3 million to be appropriated by the parliament. That actually conflicts in its terms with existing subsection 193(5), which provides a standing appropriation for the purposes of credit to the land fund.

         On one interpretation this amendment combined with 193(5) itself now purports to appropriate at least $3 million. But of course the committee is not in a position to appropriate anything or at least to initiate a clause appropriating anything. That would have to come from the House. So the amendment is improperly cast and it should be a request. I am not sure that that is a very powerful argument.

         A rather more obvious and, I think, more powerful interpretation is that what is going on here technically is the negation of the standing appropriation in 193(5) by this further provision providing for the additional appropriation to be made year by year, with the result that no credit may be made to the land fund unless and until the parliament appropriates the additional unspecified amount each year. What that means of course is, in turn, that credits to the land fund would not be determined by this bill, by this legislative exercise that we are presently engaged in. The credits to the land fund itself, leaving aside the question of administration, would have to depend upon yearly appropriations being made by the parliament—and, of course, the parliament may or may not make those appropriations.

         You can be absolutely sure that so long as the Labor Party remains in government we certainly would; we are absolutely totally committed to this. But I have to say, in all charity and generosity, there would have to be doubts about a similar commitment from the other side of politics to this. On our reading of what you have technically done by introducing this amendment, you have made that credit to the land fund itself, the acquisition fund, wholly dependent on the vagaries of parliamentary process and the parliamentary majority, rather than doing it now for 10 years, which is the very least that people want us to do in order to ensure the permanence or at least the first 10 years of the creation of this fund, and to achieve that here and now by the enactment of a standing appropriation that has been put at risk.

         There is a third category of problems—what I describe as practical problems. We still have, of course, what is in effect a statutory cap on expenditure on day-to-day administration. The cap is not confined to $3 million; it is $3 million or such higher amount as is appropriated, but it is still, in effect, a cap on the basis of the particular amount that is appropriated each year. What that cap may prove to do in practice is prevent the ILC from operating at all for part or conceivably even for most of any given year, once that particular amount is exhausted.

         It is easy enough to envisage situations in which, with the best managed corporation in the world, that could occur. There are often variations in expenditure beyond the control of a corporation, that can arise—for example, the necessity to answer any litigation brought against it. When you take into account the number of potential sources of litigation that are now available under the bill as it presently stands coming out of the Senate and as is proposed to be further amended today, this is a very real prospect. We all know the merciless impact litigation costs can have on even the best run outfits if they have to bear these costs.

         So you could have a situation with the ILC and the subsidiaries having to close down for a large part of a year, with many outstanding debts owed to staff and to others. The performance by the ILC of any of its functions will always involve administrative expenditure in the form of salaries and payments of office, transport and other costs—surveying, conveyancing and so on. But I say again, it may prove quite impossible to confine this kind of expenditure to some fixed amount or fixed proportion of total expenditure.

         The capacity of the ILC to operate under these circumstances when confronted with pressures of the kind that I have described will depend in turn upon the willingness of the parliament to grant further appropriate funds to carry the administrative expenditure on in that particular year. Under those circumstances, once again, you have a situation where the operations of the ILC are not only dependent on the whims and fancies of the parliament in passing the additional appropriation for the actual administrative expenditures but, in circumstances which could very easily conceivably arise where that particular quantum is exceeded in a particular year, you will depend further on the willingness of the parliament to make the appropriate further supplementary appropriation to get the organisation through.

         There are all sorts of obvious practical impacts that flow from that. Far from guaranteeing the ILC funding security, we see this amendment as removing its funding security because there is ample capacity for the ILC to make its own decisions and its own judgments about the proportion of administrative expenses from the existing amount that is appropriated under the bill as it was introduced by us. We are sure there will be ample pressures upon the ILC not to expand unnecessarily its administrative expenses. As always, under pressures of that kind, this body will be under the spotlight, and properly so. I do not think that there is a need for any extra statutory discipline of the kind that is here proposed or is here necessarily involved. Quite apart from the paternalism of it all, and repeating the point with which I began, there are some very obvious practical problems about leaving this up in the air and subject to changing circumstances in the way that this does.

         In summary, the net result of all of this is that the government believes that the substituted amendments are even more objectionable than the original version of the amendment on the ground that they do contain what seems to us to be a manifest legal error. They do leave the land fund operations vulnerable to funding crises, and they do impose an arbitrary interference on the autonomy and the flexibility of the Indigenous Land Corporation. For all those reasons, you will not be surprised to hear me repeat that the government will be opposing this amendment.

         —I have a question for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) about the principle that he raised. This amendment that is being referred to as a so-called cap was never intended as a cap—and well the minister knows it—but was intended as a quarantining of the administrative costs from the acquisition and management functions of the money that is being set aside for the land fund. The conversion of it from a request to an amendment was simply so that that quarantining effect could be put in place.

         There are two questions—maybe there are three—that I have for the minister. Firstly, if, as you say, there is a requirement now for parliament to determine the appropriations on an annual basis, could you inform me whether you think the impact of this amendment is that the appropriation will be in excess of $3 million or whether it will be an unspecified amount that has to be appropriated? I think that is a fairly legitimate criticism of the framing of the amendment. My understanding is that it is only that amount which is in excess of $3 million which is to be determined annually by parliament; not an X figure at all, but an additional amount to the $3 million, which really was determined at the setting of the amount that the government had said it had given for administrative costs.

         If you remember, the way in which the government determined the total withdrawal from its so-called billion dollar fund which would go to Aboriginal people was based on a doubling of the ATSIC allocation of $21 million which is already there, plus $3 million for administrative costs. That total of $45 million is what we have been working with as the complete expropriation that is available to our Aboriginal people every year forever from this so-called billion dollar fund. The $3 million cap was really that set by the government. The only thing that the government did not do was to endeavour to make sure that that $3 million would not encroach on the amount available for acquisition and management.

         So the first question is: is it not the fact that it is the additional part to that $3 million that may be needed to be determined by parliament, and is that not, in a sense, a legitimate way of parliament checking that the administrative costs are not totally depleting the land fund?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second question is: when will the ILC cease to function in terms of administrative costs? If there is no limitation on how much of the fund is to be used for management and there is no limitation on the amount that is to be used for administration, what is the government intending to do with the bill when the total $45 million expropriated from the fund is being used for existing management and existing administration? Will the fund then close and simply be a draw down for management, or what exactly will happen when there is no available money to either give Aboriginal people the capacity to acquire land or manage land that has been acquired or is in their possession?

         The third question is: although there are some technical problems with the amendment, if the government has the goodwill to support the spirit of the amendment could it not suggest a better way in which the spirit of the amendment could be incorporated into the fund so that Aboriginal people would gain at least $3 million, or possibly more, for the acquisition and management functions so that the fund would not be limited in terms of its administrative costs beyond a reasonable means?

        That is an easy provision to understand and apply as the proposed section is now crafted as it was introduced by the government, because the only appropriation that is being referred to is the one for the whole 10-year period of $121 million a year effectively.

         The difficulty arises from the fact that the amendment now before us proposes to add to that basic formula a new formula which is of uncertain impact in terms of the actual dollar sum involved. There is no precise formula involved that sets in concrete the calculation of the additional amount for the whole period of operation here. It is $3 million, or such higher amount more than $3 million, as is appropriated each year. The amendment in terms does not actually appropriate even the basic $3 million. It leaves it up to parliament each year to appropriate the $3 million, or the $3 million plus as the case may be. It is quite proper that a plus has been built in because obviously over time administrative expenses may require more than $3 million—not with our present inflation policy, but one has to anticipate that possibility in the future.

         Under those circumstances, we then have a situation where simultaneously we have what purports to be a standing appropriation pursuant to a specific concrete formula and added to that a contingent sort of provision which depends upon what parliament chooses to appropriate each year. We cannot have those two things living together without some further attention to the technicalities involved, which has not been done in the drafting here. What we are saying is that the most likely interpretation of all this by a court is that the standing appropriation here would not bite in any given year unless and until the further appropriation task is undertaken by the parliament—the task of appropriating an amount of $3 million, or $3 million plus, for this purpose. So the whole thing is to that extent thrown into technical uncertainty.

If it is true that this amendment means that the money cannot be drawn down till they are already expending it, because we do not know how much it is, then that is a problem. But surely the government has the skill of reading the spirit of the amendment, which is to quarantine the administration costs from eating away the acquisition and management sections of the fund. If the government is so concerned about the lack of sympathy on the opposition side, why is it not willing to let the opposition support this motion as a sign of its goodwill that if it were to be in a position to be requested for such an appropriation it would be on the public record as having committed itself to doing so?

         To treat this particular corporation differently from the way in which we treat all other commercial corporations established by statute of which I am aware is to introduce a wholly new element of paternalism in our approach to the boards in question which I would have thought Senator Chamarette would agree was inappropriate. It does involve a degree of faith and confidence in the quality of the boards that we produce and their particular responsibility to the people whom this legislation is designed to help. That is essentially the answer—a combination of not wanting to be paternalistic combined with confidence in the structures and processes and confidence in the people who are likely to be appointed.

Even in a catastrophic litigation or expense environment, it is difficult to see any sort of massive invasion of that. But it is very easy to see the way in which any given amount of $3 million or $3 million plus could be exceeded in any particular year. It is for that reason that we want to give the corporation the flexibility to manage.

         There is a top-up provision in the bill as it stands to cope with a situation where the investment return on the fund might have been less in practice than that which we anticipate. There is no similar top-up, I suppose, to cover administrative costs which turn out to be in excess of what we are guessing to be, on average, about $3 million a year. I guess in that exceptional circumstance, where some massive impost does arise—some major series of litigation burdens—it would always be open to the parliament in that situation to respond generously and appropriately and say, `Under these circumstances there is too much of a burden being borne by the basic fund itself, against our intentions and our expectations, and we'll make a special supplementary appropriation to deal with that.'

         We can envisage that possibility. But that is very different from every year this process being dependent on that degree of parliamentary goodwill. If the fund is to be able to manage at all and not just go into massive debt to its own staff and creditors and become, in effect, non-functional if it exceeds its cap, where you have a situation where that could arise in any given year now because of the inability to draw upon the larger fund, in that event arising in any given year, the corporation would again be dependent upon the charity, the largess, the goodwill of the parliament. That is something which, with all the optimism in the world, I do not think we can rely upon.

         Senator Chamarette said, finally, why do we not just sit back and enjoy the assurances we will no doubt hear from Senator Alston and other opposition senators that, of course, they will not be miserable and mean spirited. Maybe they will not be, as individuals. I cannot imagine Senator Panizza being miserable and mean spirited. He does not have a miserable or mean spirited bone in his body. He is a gentleman. But he may not be in the cabinet.

         These bland assurances from people who may or may not be around for very much longer, in the context of a party which, with the utmost respect, does not have a terrific track record in consistency on basic policy positions, are not good enough for this kind of fund, corporation, and policy commitment that the government is wanting to make and the Australian people are clearly wanting to make to Aboriginal people. For all those complex reasons, however much you twist and turn and fiddle and fix the terms of this particular clause as proposed, we believe it is fatally flawed and we will oppose it.

         —I do not believe this amendment is an improvement, either. I think we all clearly understand the principle that we are talking about—the quarantining of administration costs from the purpose of the bill. We understand that, but it sounds a bit like the small government argument—the assumption that everything is automatically wasteful and inefficient. I agree that that is a rather paternalistic assumption in this case, but I want to talk about the principle because Senator Chamarette has talked about the spirit of it. I think we understand that as well. Where else does this principle apply now? Are the opposition and the Greens intending to apply this principle generally in the future? I do not know whether that might make it harder or easier to vote for, but is it an appropriate principle to apply?

         Let me take an example—it is not a statutory authority, but I do not think that matters—and apply it across-the-board: think about the Liberal secretariat. What proportion of funds goes towards administration costs compared with the proportion that goes towards moneys being spent on the objective of the secretariat, which is to gain electoral success? How fixed is that amount? Where is the capacity for variation—for example, the need for extra polling because of by-elections, that sort of thing? It raises the debate that is going on in America at the moment about a balanced budget. If you are going to have a yearly appropriation, the same question applies: from where do you take that extra money?

         As I heard an American senator say this morning on the radio, do you dilute the social security budget? What do you do about the need for variation? I believe that the need for variation is unpredictable. For example, look at the number of Senate committees we regularly establish here and the effect that must have on the budget of the Department of the Senate. It is not to know how many committees in response to issues are going to be established on a yearly basis. So the idea of a yearly appropriation goes against the Democrats' view that we should have greater certainty of funding. I think we should have triennial funding in a huge number of instances to allow for better planning and certainty.

         —If we are talking about paternalism, why does the government not hand over its $200 million this year and $121 million for the following nine years to Aboriginal people right now and let them determine the expropriation they are going to put for acquisition, how much they are using for management and how much they are using for administration? The Greens would have no difficulty with leaving totally free how much was expended on administration and available to Aboriginal people themselves to determine within their own priorities if it were a larger amount. But the reality is that by giving them only $24 million beyond what ATSIC already utilises, the amount used on administration will actively intrude upon what is made available in the fund.

         I do not know of any organisation in the community that, if it is given a fund for a certain purpose, can use up the entire amount of that fund for the administration of the fund and not be accountable for how much is available to the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of the fund. If that accountability has to come via a parliamentary expropriation, my view is so be it. It is irresponsible of the government to say, `We have set up a fund. We do not want to be paternalistic apart from fact we are only giving $45 million a year instead of the $200 million a year we are keeping in government funding' and then to say, `and we do not mind whether it all gets taken by administration or legal costs such that there is nothing available to be used for the fund.'

We are all very interested in the principle and we certainly will not for a moment accept the concept of paternalism. What we are anxious to do is ensure that as much as possible of the funds appropriated by the parliament are there for the real purpose which is land acquisition and maintenance. The analogy you draw about the Liberal Party is quite misplaced and I will tell you why. It is not substantially relying on moneys appropriated by the parliament as much as you might depend entirely on public funding. For our part, we use that money as best we can. If we misuse it then those who suffer are the members of the party at the polls and the people—

If what the parliament seeks to do is to ensure that as much as possible is used for land acquisition and maintenance, then I would have thought that if you are going to come back to the parliament to ask for an increase you would be much better off coming back asking for more in administration. If you found, for example, that they were subject to a whole swag of very expensive court cases then you have the capacity not just to ask for $3 million plus indexation but to ask for a lot more for administration. Whereas, if you went down the other path, you have to come back and ask for the real moneys to be appropriated.

         Given that the government presumably does not have any target in the mind, it seems to be quite relaxed about the possibility of substantial portions being eaten up by those sorts of special claims being made on the fund. If that is the case, it would then ultimately be left to the vagaries of the parliament to try and top up the process after the event. This at least gives you the opportunity to decide whether or not you think administration expenses are under control and to provide for the funds accordingly.

         Does the minister agree that 121 plus zero equals 121? If it does, as I think it does, then I cannot see how you could ever be in a situation where no funds could be appropriated until the parliament had identified the precise sum in excess of $3 million. I do not think we need to canvass what might happen down the track with a change of government other than to say that this legislation makes it perfectly clear that the parliament is expected to appropriate that money—it does not say `may appropriate' it says `to be appropriated'; that is a command—and I think any reasonable person looking at the legislation would assume that what would happen is that, as a matter of course, an amount of least $3 million would be appropriated. As I say, there is the discretion to go well beyond indexation if the circumstances warrant. I would like the minister's view on the basis on which he would argue that 121 plus zero does not equal 121.

You can appropriate in accordance with a formula, as the existing clause does, but once you add the additional element in that formula about an appropriation of an additional $3 million plus a year—and the plus is an uncertain factor, as it needs to be for good policy reasons—then you cannot have an appropriation which actually bites here in terms of the actual bill or act as it will be.

In particular, they stem from the fact that ILC money is supposed to come by way of draw-down from the land fund, and the money is appropriated from consolidated revenue into the land fund rather than being appropriated from consolidated revenue directly to the ILC. Now we have amendments which in terms are saying, in effect, that the money is coming from the consolidated revenue fund. That is the way in which, I am advised, your amendments are drafted.

In those circumstances, we would still take the view that the amendment does the job.

        " `(4)  In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must take reasonable steps to inform itself whether any interest to be acquired in land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of that Act.'.".

        We saw recently in South Australia the rather tragic circumstances of an Aboriginal person being killed in a dispute over land. There have been some other incidents of disputes over land and there have been assaults and rather violent confrontations. This amendment purports to avoid that situation arising.

         Originally, the coalition thought it would be wise for the Indigenous Land Corporation to make a non-claimant application in an area where it thought there might be native title in order to clear the slate, to make sure there were no existing native title claimants who might come along at a later stage, after the land had been acquired and given to another Aboriginal group, and challenge that.

         What it seeks to do is avoid confrontation between those Aboriginal people who cannot maintain a claim for native title and those who can. There are areas on the fringes of regional centres and the more remote parts of Australia where this could well be the case. In fact my state of Western Australia has, I would suggest, great tracts of land where you could possibly have the ILC going to acquire a station, for instance, for Aboriginal people under this scheme and find that there are native title claimants in the area. In fact there are presently native title claims—the Miriwoong-Kadjerong, for instance, which covers a good many pastoral leases which the Indigenous Land Corporation might otherwise be interested in obtaining for other Aboriginals who cannot make a native title claim. So that was the rationale behind this.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But as I said, during the course of evidence it was indicated for two reasons that a non-claimant application was not a good idea. The first was that it would unduly tie up the Indigenous Land Corporation in sorting out the question of native title; that is, a non-claimant application under the Native Title Act could take many, many months and there would be no action in the interim and you would not get anywhere.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other aspect is perhaps a more fundamental concern and touches on the legality of it; that is, in order to make a non-claimant application there is a body of opinion which is developing, and I believe so in the Native Title Tribunal, that you must have an interest in the land before making a non-claimant application. This is where I think the Native Title Act is going to have to be looked at because the non-claimant application was brought in for someone who is going to do something in an area where there were no native title claims pending. The person intending to do something could bring on the issue, bring it to a head so to speak, by making a non-claimant issue and asking, `Is there any native title claimant out there?' That was basically the purpose of it. That could then result in clearing the decks or flushing out any claimants in the alternative.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a concern that you just cannot willy-nilly make a non-claimant application. You have to have some sort of nexus with the land in question, some sort of legal interest. Of course, the Indigenous Land Corporation would not have that necessary tie with the land where it is approaching the land ab initio and is about to purchase it or lease it in some way. That might then preclude it from making a non-claimant application. So the modification to this amendment was done in relation to evidence received during these hearings. I commend the amendment to the chamber. I believe it is in a preferable form to that which was hitherto couched.

It is the case, as quickly became apparent when we all went back and looked at the provisions in the Native Title Act, that the ILC would simply not be able to make a non-claimant application in most of the situations here in contemplation because of the need for anyone making such an application to have an interest in the relevant land. As such, we completely agree with what Senator Ellison says. There is not much point in keeping a reference in those terms if it was not going to have any practical utility.

         The problem is that you are, in the guise of doing something that is a model of sweet reason, obliging the ILC to go down a path that will place unnecessary and onerous burdens upon it and, in particular, potentially expose it to quite a lot of litigation and certainly an enormous amount of delay in the performance of its functions. What exactly are reasonable steps that the ILC must take in determining whether the land is subject to native title rights or interests is uncertain in the nature of things and the nature of language. What constitutes reasonableness is a matter about which people can and do argue. Moreover, they can argue about it in court, because that is a question that would certainly be justiciable.

         What we are talking about here is not just taking reasonable steps to determine whether someone has some claim that they want to make which the ILC ought to take into account as part of its general cautionary approach to making sure that it is acting consistently with the philosophy of the legislation. What you have got in the way in which the provision is drawn is an obligation on the corporation to inform itself whether any interest to be acquired in land is subject to native title or native title rights. That is an immensely difficult thing to establish.

         We all know how complex the whole business of determining native title is. It is not just whether someone is making a claim or whether there is a potential complication in the acquisition; the corporation has to take steps to inform itself whether the land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of the act. That is no short or limited inquiry. That is an absolutely major exercise.

         Now, it is qualified—it says `reasonable steps'. But, as I have already said, what are reasonable steps in all the circumstances is very much a matter to be resolved by the courts, and it will certainly be the subject of a process of litigation to establish just what that means. We need a further process of litigation impacting on the corporation like a hole in the head.

         The other thing that needs to be said is that the ILC itself and its immediate staff cannot be expected necessarily to have the expertise and resources to perform this kind of investigation. If it starts acquiring the body of expertise and resources to do it, it will add very substantially to the administrative expenses that we have been discussing under a previous amendment. Moreover, as a further practical problem, the requirement that a competing native title claim be effectively decided prior to the acquisition of land means that opportunities for the purchase of land are bound to be lost while that process is undertaken.

         Moreover again, there is a further practical problem. By flagging, as this process would, the ILC's interest in a particular parcel of land, the investigation of title would almost certainly lead to vendors thus armed and informed demanding a higher price for the land in question, thus generating less value in the land fund dollar as a result. Each of those matters I have mentioned might individually have only a small impact. That is perfectly possible, but cumulatively, or in some cases individually, they might well have a very major impact indeed.

         Again, you have a situation where, at first blush, you look at this amendment and it looks reasonable. Of course the ILC should have regard to some likely claim that may be hanging around, because the basic point of this exercise after all is not to trespass in the area dealt with philosophically and practically by the Native Title Act. This is to enable the acquisition of other land which does not necessarily have any traditional connections at all in order to meet other objectives—to meet the land needs of the dispossessed.

         But when we strip out the reference to the ILC itself going down that track—as we have to, for reasons that Senator Ellison has explained—we really do strip out the last relatively straightforward mechanical route by which this matter could be resolved, we create a whole new layer of uncertainty and we still have all the problems of delay and expense that are associated with a provision of this kind. The government is genuinely concerned about these kinds of provisions littering the bill. They are among that series of provisions which I have previously elsewhere identified as `the seven deadly sins of the legislation', because their cumulative impact on making the bill unworkable in practice is simply immense.

         We now have a register of claims that have been lodged and decisions that have been made being accumulated by the Native Title Tribunal. A quick reference to the Native Title Tribunal could reveal what claims are pending in the area and what decision has been made. We can also, I believe—and this is by inquiry that the joint native title committee has made with the Native Title Tribunal—ascertain whether there might be any intended claims. What it has are situations where someone has come in and said, `Look, we want to claim this area' and it has referred them to one of the representative bodies or sent them away to rejig their application. It is able to tell us whether a claim has been or is yet to be accepted or not.

         There is the question of what reasonable steps should be taken; they are readily ascertainable. What this simply says is that the ILC goes to the Native Title Tribunal, makes an inquiry, and perhaps makes one or two inquiries in the area where the land is. It would have to do that anyway because it would want to know if the government had any plans to put a highway through the land or whether there were any town planning arrangements which might affect it.

         These reasonable steps, which have now been watered down by the exclusion of a non-claimant application, simply would involve the ILC in making such inquiries. These could be done at the same time that, if it is to function efficiently, it has to make due inquiry as to the land it is about to purchase or lease. In other respects, it has to do those other things that any individual would do in a commercial sense, and this can be done at the same time. I do not see how it adds to the process.

The truth of the matter is that those opposite are stuck with the terms of their own amendment. The amendment does not say we have to take such reasonable steps as are necessary to establish whether any native title claim has been endorsed by the tribunal; it does not say we have to take such reasonable steps as are necessary to establish whether any native title claim has been registered by the registrar; it does not say we have to take such reasonable steps as are necessary to establish whether a native title claim has been lodged with the registrar but not yet registered.

         In terms of your own legislation, you have got to go to the underlying legal reality, not just what has been registered and not just what is extant as a claim. You have got to look at whether the actual right exists within the meaning of section 223 of the Native Title Act—the right or the interest and concern. So you are stuck with the terms of your own legislation. If all it involved were the ILC informing itself of what is actually around and it taking that into account in its own judgment as to whether to proceed or not, there is no hassle about that. I am sure the ILC in practice would do just that before acquiring a piece of land. As a practical matter, it would inform itself in that easy way by going to the registers and asking what is before the registrar that may not have been on the former register at this stage. There is no reason why it should not do that, and I am sure that, as a practical matter, it is a very simple inquiry. It is just like going to the titles office and seeing what is on the list. But that is not what your amendment says. So you are stuck again with some lousy drafting. Lousy policy follows from lousy drafting.

Native title is out there subject to recognition by appropriate process. If it were the case that anything that constituted native title, or a right or interest under native title, had to be already recorded and registered somewhere—as is the case with ordinary land law systems—then I would not have too much difficulty about agreeing with you that that was the meaning of the section. But you have got to inform yourself, not just of what is on the books as already having been recorded and registered as native title; you have got to inform yourself as to what is native title—whether this land is subject to native title or whether it is subject to native rights and interests.

         I am not being cantankerous or difficult or in any way introducing issues which are not real issues. The truth of the matter is that, literally read and construed and knowing what we know about native title, you are creating a very onerous obligation on the ILC. It may be that, through some process of court adjudication, the court will say that reasonable steps, in the context of this particular clause as drafted, means doing what you are talking about—going to the registrar and looking at what has been registered because it would be unreasonable to ask the ILC to do more than that. But you cannot make that assumption now. I cannot make that assumption now. And certainly we know that getting to that point would require a process of litigation which is absolutely, unnecessarily burdensome. I do not want to prolong the argument. I will not contribute any further. I think that I have outlined all the points that I possibly can.

Senator Ellison is saying it will be for the ILC to take reasonable steps to ascertain that land is not native title land. In that context, taking reasonable steps can only mean making such inquiries as to ascertain whether land is registered as native title land or whether it is likely to be native title land.

Those claims have no status whatsoever but the ILC ought arguably to be aware of them. Level two is claims which have been accepted by the registrar as having some prima facie status and certainly ought to have regard to by the ILC. That is easily establishable. Thirdly, of course there are native title rights that have been recognised by the Native Title Tribunal and certified to exist as such by the Native Title Tribunal.

         I think Senator Evans is merely trying to play with something about which he has no genuine will to improve the legislation and is not intending really to support the spirit under which the amendments are being placed. So we should not waste the Senate's time by mucking around with phrasing that the government may or may not agree to for one amendment if it is not proposing to take the whole matter seriously of improving the bill to such a point where it will support it. I would like to say why we are putting these amendments up. If people had bothered to refer to the committee report, they would have seen on page 15 the concern expressed in our consultations. It states:

       <para>
        It is that reason for which this particular amendment was put in. It is a response to concerns. I was there and repeatedly we heard people say that, while they do want to benefit from the land fund, they do not want to benefit at the detriment of people who may be found to have a legitimate native title right. By specifying those three things we are stating the obvious. It is perfectly possible for any court that is in dispute over this to refer back to the minister's words to ascertain what these reasonable steps might be.

         I think the spirit with which the people raised the concern was that there should be some onus on the ILC to actually be informed about any people who have even the potential to make native title claims. So I would rather support the original amendment. If the government is so persuasive that, for its purposes, it wants support for its amendment, then it can put that up and I will be prepared to look at it; but I ask the government to scrutinise its motives in this.

         This is perhaps the second arm of the process of trying to ward off any potential conflict between potential native title claimants and those who cannot claim native title for which this land fund is designed to help.

But if there is no claim registered with the native title registry, nor is there one in the offing, it still has to consult with the people in the area who have traditional links.

That must be tied back to a land acquisition function. So if you are performing that function with respect to a piece of land, by that drafting you must consult with the people who have traditional links with that land, not with other land, which would be irrelevant.

         If the government were to agree to amendment No. 4, we would have the two limbs. We would have the mechanical check and the consultation with the traditional people. In that way we would overcome the concerns expressed by Senator Chamarette. If the government says, `No, we don't agree with that,' we do have a bit of a problem, as Senator Chamarette puts it, in that we might not have that consultation with the people in the area.

The Broome Crocodile Farm was an instance involving the Yawuru people, and the Djugan people said that they had some involvement with the land which was the subject of the dispute with the minister.

         Having been to Broome and having had some association with that area, I know that you can without much inquiry ascertain the relevant language groups and skin groups, as they are referred to. It does not take much. The Djugans had been removed some years ago. There were one or two left and they surfaced very readily. You just have to speak to one or two people in the town, a few elders, and you get to the bottom of things pretty quickly. You do not have to travel all over the state trying to find out where people have gone. You will generally get a ready history of the area. That is as far as you can go. Those are the reasonable steps you take in consultation.

         If you went to some areas of the Pilbara you would find it very hard to find traditional groups because they have been absent for well over 50 years. In fact, in some areas of the Pilbara there have not been any groups at all because of reasons of taboo and the like. Similarly with Eneabba, in Western Australia. I think Southern Cross, where Senator Panizza comes from, is another area where you will not find Aboriginal people and nor will you find a history of them because traditionally it has been a no-go area for them. They have had no association with that land because of a spiritual aspect.

         The reasonable steps to consult with those people are just that.

We want to get the best bill possible in the shortest possible time. That has been our motivation from the outset. It remains our motivation. We are not going to accept a bill which is unworkable and which we think is wrong in principle. But if we can improve it to the point where it is workable and acceptable we will grab it because we believe we have a responsibility to the Aboriginal people to do just that. We think we have demonstrated our bona fides in this respect by having accepted 28 amendments, a number of them against our better judgment in the sense that we did not think they were strictly necessary, but very helpful. We have accepted 28 amendments with a view to getting something acceptable out of this process. So please, let us have no more of that, Senator Chamarette. It is unworthy of you.

         As to the question of a redraft of Senator Ellison's amendment 3(f), we have a draftsperson with us. She has put something in my hand which I think does what was described as the mechanical job quite succinctly and quite well. What is proposed and what we would suggest as an alternative to Senator Ellison's amendment 3(f) is this language:

        We will circulate it later, if you like. I honestly think that meets the kinds of points that emerged in our debate earlier on so far as the objects in Senator Ellison's draft of 3(f) are concerned and what is practically, easily do-able. Whether or not it needs to be in legislative form is another question, but we would accept a provision in those terms if that is helpful in getting agreement on that particular area of contention.

         As to proposed fourth amendment 3(h), in regard to the sheet that is before us and the government's attitude towards that, this again is one of those amendments that has caused us some difficulty because, on the face of it, it seems another model of sweet reason but in practice would, we believe, operate to make life very difficult to the point of unworkable for the tribunal. We took the view originally that the reference to having to consult traditional owners created exactly the sorts of problems I have been talking about in relation to having to identify individual native title rights or interests, that it demanded attention to a very complex issue, would not easily be able to be satisfied as a practical matter and would open itself up to litigation.

         You are proposing to modify that and not have a reference any longer to traditional owners but rather to people with traditional or historic links with the land in question. I am afraid the difficulty we see with that—and I say this again in utmost good faith—is that there is still a statutory requirement to identify certain people and consult with them. We believe that that statutory requirement will be very difficult to satisfy.

         It will certainly increase the risk of disputation and legal challenge by people who claim such links if they have not been consulted or they have been insufficiently consulted—and you know the range of responses that the administrative law system is capable of delivering to those sorts of arguments these days. It certainly means that the consultation process will be even more complex. If anything, because the category of traditional historic links with the land is even wider, there will be greater delays and risks that opportunities to purchase land will be lost.

         There is a further possibility—and I am really just anticipating everything I was going say in relation to amendment 3(h), and I hope we do not repeat ourselves unduly as a result—that traditional owners, strictly so-called, and those simply with historic or traditional links with the land will turn out to be different groups with different views. It is perfectly possible to envisage a course of events in  relation to a particular piece of land where the traditional owners have moved off and gone to another location and some other people have come in and established themselves historically, maybe 50 or 60 years ago, and are known to have come from another part of the country but, nonetheless, established this degree of association with the land.

         Obviously, it is important to keep the basic philosophy of this legislation on track—that the ILC be wholly sensitive to the reality of possible traditional ownership claims or related claims over the land in question.

         That is where these regional strategies come in.

It is not likely to be an issue in Victoria or New South Wales, but it is certainly likely to be an issue, juggling and balancing those considerations, elsewhere in the country.

That is why we will oppose that. You should take what I have said into account. I hope it does not make life unduly onerous for you in coming back and considering a change to 3(f) on its merits, but that frankly will be our position on 3(h).

         Equally, I suppose that leads on and gives a suggested way through your second question. It may be possible to modify 3(h) by saying something along the lines that the ILC `may consult' such persons rather than `must, taking all reasonable steps to consult,' those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional or historic links with the land. The difficulty about that is that it sounds a bit weaker than, in practice, I think it would be the disposition of the ILC to do.

You are caught in a bit of a dilemma here. We think the best way to do it is just to leave it up to the good sense and the good faith of the ILC.

         —With respect to (h), I will just conclude the debate and respond to some matters which have been raised. That amendment states, `Before the Indigenous Land Corporation performs a land acquisition function . . . it must take all reasonable steps to consult those Aboriginal and Torres Islander people having traditional or historic links with the land.' We originally used the term `traditional owners' of the land and that caused some consternation, as I mentioned previously, because there was difficulty in understanding exactly what a traditional owner was.

         It was suggested by the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement of South Australia that an alternative phrase could be used whereby we stated `those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional or historic links with the land'. There were a number of witnesses who said, `If you talk about traditional owners, that really is not a concept which we know because we don't have ownership as such as you have it under the Torrens system and common law; we have an ongoing association with the land based on cultural and traditional links.' That is what the High Court said in the Mabo decision and it related to such things as traditional usage of the land.

         Therefore, a good many witnesses thought that the principle was very good but we just did not have it right with the traditional owners. So we took that on board and we have changed that amendment to include that. I wanted to place that on the record. The evidence of the Cape York Land Council stated—

       <para font-size="-=2">
        With our applications to ATSIC in the past, we have always had to provide an account of consultations with the traditional owners because we end up in a terrible fight afterwards if we have not done it properly. There have been some cases where a lot of grief has resulted because there has been a perception that only some of the traditional owners have been made beneficiaries of the acquisition whilst others have been missed out. . . So I have to say that there is a definite need to sort out the traditional owner question. Once you cement the wrong group or only half of a group, as the people owning the land, you need more than a shoehorn to get the others into the picture after that, you know. You can have a terrible argument.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that vividly put the scenario as to what you can get if you do not consult with traditional owners. I appreciate that Senator Gareth Evans has pointed to the regional strategy function in the bill. Of course 191P(5)(a) states that, in consultation with regional strategies, the Indigenous Land Corporation:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        must, if any part of a region is included in the regional area, consult the Regional Council for the region—
       </para>
       <para>
        That is straightforward. But, in 191P(5)(b) the corporation:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        may consult with such other persons and bodies as the Board considers appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The committee showed an overwhelming support, after hearing the evidence, for consultation with people with traditional or historic links to the area, and by leaving that in that form—`may consult with such other persons and bodies'—it was just too nebulous.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I appreciate that Senator Evans has mentioned that we are casting an onus on the Indigenous Land Corporation, but it is done for a good reason: there has been concern expressed that there should be some directive—that these people who have these traditional links should be consulted. So that is why we state that the Indigenous Land Corporation must take all reasonable steps—and `reasonable' has been included to alleviate the onus—to consult with those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having a traditional link with the land. If you leave it up to the ILC just to consult such other persons and bodies as it sees fit, you are not addressing the concerns that we heard before the committee that you should have this directive there.

         Therefore, the coalition sticks to this amendment. It is one which I believe the government recognises as a principle, and Senator Evans has said that he has great difficulty with the efficacy and practicality of it. I think I understand Senator Evans correctly when he says that the principle might be fine, but the practicality is not.

         I might say that this principle is one of the most serious principles in the land fund bill, because what you are doing is ensuring as much as possible that there is not this conflict between those who cannot claim native title and those who can. What we are endeavouring to achieve here is that you do not have those altercations such as we had in northern South Australia when someone was tragically killed, you do not have the confrontations that might develop and you do not get into the mess that the Cape York Land Council has said that you can get into if you do not consult with traditional owners.

         I note that the Cape York Land Council says that it even gives an account of its consultation. It might run things very well, but there is differing opinion across the country. I base this on evidence taken over the course of 10 hearing days while travelling 12,000 kilometres around the country to capital cities and regional centres. It is not always done that way. People are saying, `We want some directive to be given that the traditional people are consulted in an effort to avoid this potential confrontation.' The tragedy would be if this land fund bill effectively were to work to cut across the bows of the Native Title Act in the way that by this confrontation it possibly could. The coalition is saying that this consultation is essential.

         If the ILC did not take those consultative steps, then I believe that it should be held to account. I believe that the traditional people should be allowed to say, `Well, look, this body disregarded a directive contained in the legislation; it should be brought to account.' There is nothing wrong with a group or body, such as the ILC, being held accountable to the Aboriginal people themselves. It would be only traditional people who would bring this action; it would be those people who had not been consulted. What it would effectively result in is an Indigenous Land Corporation, ostensibly for the benefit of Aboriginal people, being held accountable to Aboriginal people.

         Litigation is always to be avoided. It is always undesirable to have litigation. But it is a fact of life. It occurs in our day-to-day life, it occurs in our society, and we make provision for it in our judicial system. What this does, though, is provide accountability to the people which this bill is intended to help. If there is lack of consultation, those people who are aggrieved by it can take that action. I think it is no bad thing that that take place. I am not saying that I relish it—I do not. I am not saying that it will necessarily happen, because if the ILC takes those reasonable steps it will not be subject to challenge. It is as simple as that. The whole thrust of it is one of prevention rather than cure—to prevent the possible conflict as much as possible. I think, as a principle, it is one of the basic ones that should be found in this bill.

I ask: does he agree with the point that Senator Gareth Evans made that the opposition, in changing its definition from traditional owners to people having traditional or historic links with the land, is creating the opportunity for conflict because it has created two distinct categories—traditional owners versus people with traditional links—and he is being perhaps asked to decide who has the greater attachment to land? Does he see that as a problem or not? I have not heard him address that.

There may be some people in the area who have traditional links, and we should consult with them. There may be people, however, who have historical links with the land. There is a difference between `traditional' and `historical'. In some areas we might have a group which has had an historical association with the land which has been brought about perhaps by white settlement in that they were shifted into the area—

         What this amendment seeks to do is to include both. If we said `traditional and' we would be making it much too restrictive. We would be saying that we would have to have both. That would be a hard bill to fill. By making it in the alternative, we do not have to choose one or the other. We can have a variety. We can have perhaps one traditional group and two historical groups. If we are dealing with a large tract of land—say, a pastoral lease of some thousands of square kilometres—we might have at one end a group that was moved there by, say, a mission or that there had been some resettlement; and at the other end we might have a group which has traditional ties.

         This allows us to take both into account. It does not require a decision that one has a greater claim over the other. All it requires is that we have to look around and see whether anyone fits the bill of either traditional or historical. If there is, we must take reasonable steps to consult with them.

Since we are no longer talking about traditional owners and we are no longer talking about permission, it would seem that you had better delete that and substitute an expression like `consultation'.

         As I have previously indicated, the government does have a basic problem with this. It is not a problem of principle and it is not a problem of believing that the ILC should not have regard to the views of people that satisfy these descriptions. Of course the ILC should inform itself in the best possible way it can, particularly when plunging into a land acquisition in some sensitive area where there may be competing claims of this kind. That is exactly the same point I made before. But it is much better, I suggest, to rely on the good sense of the people that we put on the ILC board to engage in those consultations, to the extent that they think is appropriate, helpful or workable in the particular circumstance, rather than to create a statutory obligation.

          I disagree, and the government still fervently disagrees,  with putting all this in the form of a statutory obligation. Once you do that, you create a situation where this becomes a subject, potentially, of endless legal disputation. The very breadth of the range of interests that you talked about as potentially being in competition with each other indicates the extent to which there might be an encouragement to actual litigation in situations of this kind. If people do see an historic interest at odds with someone else's traditional interest, that is the kind of context to which they are more likely than not to want to take such legal remedies as they perceive are open to them. Every time you draft these things in statutory form, you create the capacity for that kind of effort to occur and kind of inhibition on the ILC's performance of its functions.

What you almost completely deny with these sorts of provisions is any capacity in the ILC to do just that. You have got to give some credence to the good faith and the capacity of people like Lois O'Donoghue sitting up there in the gallery—as she so often is, listening intently in these debates to what we are all saying. You have got to give some credence to the good faith, the goodwill and the good sense of people like this who have been living and breathing these issues for years and who will be sitting on the board in one capacity or another making these decisions. We can afford to do that. We do not need to put it in statutory terms knowing, as we do, the downside risks of it. If you do want to have some sort of touchstone or benchmark in the statute, the most that the government would be prepared to accept is language saying that the ILC may—not must take all reasonable steps—in its absolute discretion, consult those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional and historic links. That is there for legal reasons in those terms in order not to create a justiciable obligation.

         I noticed with interest that at one stage Senator Evans talked about needing to move quickly to take advantage of a market niche. I would have thought that that would be the last thing the government should be seriously regarding as a priority in this area. In other words, the whole essence of Aboriginal culture, I would have thought, is not simply to rush in and make a fast commercial buck. It is to ensure that as many people as possible are comfortable with the decision made, and their forms of consultation and decision making may well be a lot slower than ours and may ultimately be a lot more enduring as a result. Therefore, I would not have thought that speed was of the essence. What is important is getting it right.

         The underlying concept is to consult as widely as possible. In picking up Senator Kernot's point, consultation with those with traditional or historic links would generally be a wider group than owners. To the extent that we were wanting to ensure that both owners and others were consulted, this form of words allows us to do that. There should not be any need for conflict between those two groups. Above all it is seeking to make it clear, not just to the ILC in some sort of heavy-handed fashion but to the community at large, that we expect good faith and we expect consultation to be as widespread as possible.

         One of the real concerns I have is that, for example, the ILC might think that it needs to act quickly. It might therefore think—after having spoken to an eloquent and persuasive spokesperson, representative, trade union official or whoever else it might be—that this has the flavour of having to consult with only those with traditional or historic links and that it does not need to consult with the rest of the community.

         One of the lessons that would have come out of Senator Ellison's inquiries is that, just as there is a great deal of concern about ATSIC running its own race rather than taking enough time to consult with all those at the bottom of the pile—it is like the frontbench being accused of not consulting the backbench—we ought to go out of our way as much as possible to ensure that we take everyone with us. We do not want a situation where we might simply be consulting with a spokesperson who purports to represent a large number of those with traditional or historic links. We want to make it clear that we expect the ILC to take all reasonable steps to consult as widely as possible. If we do it in that fashion and the ILC acts in good faith, as undoubtedly it would, we would absolutely minimise the prospects of litigation or legal challenge.

         What puzzles me is that, as I understand Senator Gareth Evans, who has alway been an enthusiastic advocate of administrative law, in relation to the concept of reasonableness he is quite comfortable with that in other contexts. The ability to bring a challenge where people are able to establish that not all reasonable steps were taken is one that ought to be there, not only as a last resort avenue to seek redress but in the first instance to put the onus on the body in question to do what we would expect it to do.

         If that is the case and everyone acts in good faith, as they do 99 per cent of the time, they would not be likely to be facing massive and regular litigation. So I find it a trifle odd that, although in every other area Senator Evans is comfortable with the concept of reasonableness, which goes to the heart of administrative law because it gives ordinary citizens the opportunity to go in and simply argue whether or not they did the right thing—it is not some arcane legal notion—suddenly here he raises this spectre of massive and endless litigation. I have not heard Senator Evans respond to that.

         This is a provision which requires consultation before the corporation performs a land acquisition function. It is not about consultation before the vesting of land so acquired; this is only before acquisition. While there may well be a case in practice—and it is in this context that I was largely acknowledging it before—for the ILC to be as well as informed as it can be before making an actual vesting function determining who is going to be given the joint title or whatever to the land in question, while there may well be a case in that context for it informing itself as best it can, there may equally well be a case for it to move very swiftly to take advantage of a market opportunity in order to buy a particularly obviously attractive piece of land and then sort out later precisely in whom that land might most appropriately vest.

         You are imposing much too difficult an obligation upon the corporation to have it embark upon this potentially very wide-ranging consultative process before the acquisition itself occurs. I have acknowledged previously that of course it is desirable for the corporation to have regard to what the kinds of interests are likely to be in that part of the country. I would envisage in the development of regional strategies it would take that into account and it would certainly be sensitive to possible conflicts between traditional owners who may well have a right under the Native Title Act itself and other people who may at best have only a possible access to land under this. Of course it will be engaging in that kind of balancing act in practice. But, again, subject to formal statutory provision and the possibility of endless amounts of disputatious litigation flowing from that, to require it to go down this particular path is not to go down a path that is going to be workable.

         It is a very substantial decision. You buy in haste, you repent in leisure. As you understand, the politics of that would simmer on endlessly if people felt that they were not adequately consulted. I would have thought you would err on the side of caution. It is much better not to go ahead with the acquisition at all rather than to rush in, consult a few leaders, put your money on the table and then find out that the whole thing blows up. It is not simply about getting best commercial value for money; it is about ensuring that you take the community with you. That is why I find it very difficult to understand why in other contexts you are the essence of reasonableness. You do not for a moment suggest that ADJR should be dispensed with and we should rely on the good sense and good nature of the bureaucrats. There are very many situations where reasonableness is of the essence and, particularly in a situation such as this where we are going into new territory, I would have thought that the ILC itself would want to move cautiously.

I am not knocking Senator Alston's argument. His argument concerns the insertion of these consulting conditions. If you take out an option, as occurs in everyday affairs, you can then start to consult. For a start, you generally consult your bank manager to see whether you can proceed any further. You can have all the other consultations.

         —That is a good point—in my case I would need to consult my partners. The point is that, by consulting, you make other people aware that the property is on the market. It may not be very common knowledge. Of course, they might become interested as well. But if you are holding an option, you can have consultation as well as having your foot on the property. Then you can move in. So I am supporting Senator Alston's argument. I cannot see why it cannot work in this case.

         —I am not claiming more than a passing acquaintance with either, but enough to be able to respond to all these sorts of arguments. There is a short answer to Senator Panizza—that is, the acquisition of an option in the terms that he describes would be a land acquisition function within the meaning of the act as it is now crafted. The particular clause in front of us states that, before the corporation performs a land acquisition function, it has to consult. So on Senator Panizza's reading of it, he would have to consult before he acquired his option. Once he has got his option, that is an interest in land within the meaning of the legislation. There is no doubt about that—even his mate Senator Alston agrees with that. So it is a nice idea but it does not work.

         —I do not want to delay the proceedings but I am afraid I cannot resist. The requirement here to do the proper consultation can be as early in the piece as possible. In fact, that is one of the benefits of having it written into the legislation because it puts the ILC on notice that it will be held to account if it has not consulted. If the ILC does its job properly, as long as it is provable under any challenge by the people who may be likely to benefit from such a challenge—that is, those who claim they have not been consulted—then it should not have any problems. To have it ahead of time allows it freedom from that concern, rather than the capacity for anybody to challenge that it has been done properly if it is not stated.

         The other point that has been omitted is that the ILC has two capacities. It can buy up land for its own purposes because that is written into the bill for other reasons. But this is referring to land that is being acquired for a particular group of people. That is why it is very important that the consultation with any other people who may be likely to have interests in the land be done ahead of time.

         The economic constraints will be overcome if, within the regional strategy, that requirement is met early on and it is available right throughout Australia. If there is adequate consultation with people who may have interest, that may determine how we use this meagre amount of money. The ILC may well say that, because it knows there is a dispute over a particular area of land, it may well be better to choose an area of land for acquisition that has no dispute in that regard. It is a precautionary principle that if written into the legislation could assist the ILC. If it is unspoken, it may well bring it unstuck in any event.

        It is only in that situation that you would have reference to the question of most severely dispossessed. The principle behind this is that funds are not unlimited. They are indeed limited, as was heard by the committee. When you come to a conflict of competing interests as to how you allocate your resources, you should be given some guidelines. The Indigenous Land Corporation, in the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers, should be given some principles.

They would be reasonable things for the board to take into account. In other words, some people do have title to land by virtue of it being gazetted and some people already have a land fund available to them in New South Wales.

         It gives a marker to the Indigenous Land Corporation as to how to exercise discretion when it reaches the dilemma of a conflict arising as to the allocation of resources. We see it continually in government. When government does not have sufficient funds to go around, it has to make the very difficult decision of where money will be allocated. There is perhaps no greater dilemma when one is attending to the funding for a person which is given by virtue of legislation. I suggest that a minister comes across this daily in the exercise of his or her duties, so the ILC no doubt will as well. This seeks to give the ILC some guidance as to how to address this conflict.

In some areas of this country you would have Aboriginal people who do not enjoy the benefit of having such a land fund available to them. That is what Noel Pearson said.

         —Senator Ellison is right in saying that the original amendment was seen as the centre of controversy and caused great divisiveness. He is correct to draw attention to the evidence given by all organisations that we are all dispossessed. I know that his motives in seeking to change that wording from `most severely dispossessed' to `disadvantaged' are that it is going to work more efficiently and fairly. But I wonder whether the `most disadvantaged' test is at least equally incapable of objective measurement, as is `most severely dispossessed'. In the land fund minority report on page 199 an example is given:

        To demonstrate the inherent unworkability of this formula, take the example of an Aboriginal community living by some form of agreement on another person's pastoral lease. On one view, they are not very disadvantaged at all in terms of `access to land' compared with, say, an indigenous commune in a densely populated part of a city.

         I understand that in the committee hearings those who suggested words like this as possible circuit-breakers emphasised that the principle should be a discretionary one, not a statutory one, and that the board should take into account, if they are talking about land as one of the criteria, the existing and likely land holdings, for example.

         We have to ask, too, an equally important question: how does your advocacy of this new category `severely disadvantaged' rest with your previous amendment 25? How does it link with the health, education and housing principle? Are you taking that into account? Are you going to read the two together and, if you do, what is the result of that link? How do you determine degrees of disadvantage, given that you already have amendment 25 in place? Any formulation which attempts to distinguish between former degrees of dispossession, this time degrees of disadvantage, levels of financial hardship or whatever on that long list that you quoted earlier is still bound to produce unnecessary conflict between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         It saddens me that the dignity and respect engendered by Australia Remembers does not seem to extend to the tens of thousands of women who suffered terrible atrocities at the hands of the Japanese army during the war. I am of course referring to the so-called comfort women. Their plight has been mentioned infrequently—usually in the context of being one of the unresolved issues of the war affecting relations between Japan and its Asian neighbours. It should be mentioned, for the story of comfort women is not one that should be swept under the carpet or consigned to history's dustbin.

         This week there has been a conference in Seoul in South Korea on the subject of comfort women. I understand it has been attended by delegates from Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan. There was even some hope that North Korea would allow some delegates to attend the conference in the south—that in itself is a noteworthy and hopeful sign of improving relations on the Korean peninsula. Unfortunately, in a fit of pique at the last minute the North Korean regime refused to let the delegates attend. If anything, the potential involvement of delegates from North Korea is an indication of how widespread the abuse of Asian women was by the Japanese army and how even 50 years after the war feelings in the region run so deep as to almost overcome the paranoia which prevails on the Korean peninsula.

Aside from the terrible toll exacted on allied personnel and prisoners of war and civilians throughout the south-east of Asia and the Pacific, the Japanese army was responsible for terrible and purposeful atrocities against as many as 200,000 women who were forced to become sex slaves or comfort women for Japanese troops. Women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Netherlands were victims of this vile and degrading treatment in front-line brothels.

         I notice that the book written by one of those women, who now lives in Adelaide, is available in the Parliamentary Library. I would urge honourable senators to take the time to read it. Jan Ruff O'Herne was enslaved by the Japanese army for four years and only spoke out about the horrors she had witnessed after watching a documentary about Korean comfort women a few years ago. She was just 18 years old when she was dragged away from her family by Japanese troops in Central Java to be brutally raped and beaten by hundreds of soldiers at a brothel run by the Imperial Army.

         The International Commission of Jurists investigated the crimes committed against the comfort women. Last year it recommended that each of the comfort women should be paid at least $US40,000 as compensation. It published a 240 page report which detailed the systematic brutality and the vast scale on which the atrocities occurred. Forcing women into army-run brothels amounted to war crimes and breaches of international law against trafficking in women and children, the ICJ said. The allies knew about it. They did nothing after the war to bring the offenders to trial or to try and get reparations for their victims. Make no mistake—the crimes committed against the comfort women were not one-off aberrations or isolated cases. They were part of a deliberate and ongoing campaign of brutality against innocent and helpless women and girls, some as young as 13.

         Before the International Commission of Jurists issued its report, I had written twice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in April 1993 asking what action he had taken or proposed to take to pursue justice for the victims of these crimes. In reply, the minister said that the Australian government would monitor the situation closely. He did at least acknowledge the evidence to support the claims inasmuch as the Japanese government itself had confirmed the Imperial Army's role in setting up and operating the brothels where women were forced into sex slavery. So there was no doubt about the veracity of the allegations against the Japanese, but we had a `wait and see' attitude from the Australian government.

         After the ICJ published its report later in the year, calling for compensation and fully exposing the nature of the crimes against the comfort women, I again asked the minister in a question on notice what action he had taken in response to the report or what action he proposed to take. The Japanese government had already announced that it would not be providing any direct compensation to comfort women. Instead, the Japanese government was setting up a $1 billion public relations slush fund to promote exchange programs and vocational training in countries where the atrocities against comfort women were committed.

In my view, it is a total dereliction of Australia's role in the international community. It seems that an apology and expressions of remorse are all that the women victims of wartime atrocities will get.

We are not asking for compensation for countries or governments.

         Twelve employees with the scientific and engineering services department in Adelaide have been identified as having used these gold supplies over many years to gold plate personal items including a tombstone, baby booties, bathroom fittings, watches, a chandelier and a host of other items. There are also concerns that stringent quality assurance documentation used to itemise the DSTO's highly sophisticated circuit boards may have been fraudulently manipulated to account for the disappearance of the gold supplies.

         The gold plating examples I have mentioned are but a few of the personal abuses we know about. The mind boggles at how many more items may have been given the royal gold plating treatment, eventually finding their way into the homes of the relatives and friends of these 12 employees. It seems that this practice has been going on for some time and I suspect that the $76,000 identified as having being stolen is just the tip of the iceberg.

         This matter has very serious implications not only because of the theft itself but also because of the method used to hide these scandalous practices. Apart from the fact that we know that at the very least some $76,000 worth of gold and radium plating supplies have gone missing and apart from the fact that we know that at the very least one batch of defective gold plating stocks has never been returned to the suppliers, I remind the minister—I welcome him to the chamber to listen to this matter—that the scientific and engineering services department within the DSTO in Adelaide is supposed to be controlled by stringent accounting guidelines because of the sensitive application of these circuitry components.

         For example, circuit boards used in weapons guidance systems require a very detailed and careful itemising of all components manufactured and used. This is done, I am told, to ensure that defective components can be quickly identified in the event of any subsequent system failure. The gold plating supplies were supposed to be carefully recorded and strictly supervised, but we now know that for many years these gold stocks literally walked out of DSTO's doors.

         Again I ask of the minister, given that he is here in the chamber, that a full and independent inquiry be established to examine this scandal. The Inspector-General, who has the responsibility for conducting an investigation, was made aware of this matter before Christmas. The Australian Federal Police, I am told, have been called in to investigate this scandal. But what do we find out about DSTO's headquarters at Salisbury in South Australia? All of these 12 employees still have their jobs. The only employees who have since been reprimanded or forced out of their jobs would appear to be those who refused to take part in this gold plating scandal or who blew the whistle. The buck must stop with this minister. He must not try to sweep this matter under the carpet but, as I have said, he must initiate a full and independent inquiry into this scandal.

Are you also aware that Australia's current account deficit, forecast at 5.75 per cent of GDP for this year, is the second highest in the OECD after Mexico—only Mexico is higher than us?

         —The truth of the matter is that the current account deficit on this occasion is clearly within the range of market expectations. It did fall marginally in January due to a strong increase in non-rural exports and a fall in imports. The significant deterioration in the current account deficit was to be expected, obviously, given the enormously strong growth in the Australian economy over the last 12 months and the forecast of further strong growth. You had a situation with GDP increasing by 6.4 per cent as compared with the 4 1/4 per cent predicted. Investment has grown by 24 per cent as compared with the 14 1/2 per cent that was predicted and which you lot said could never be achieved. You have had a massive increase in capital imports as a result of this growth cycle as compared with earlier periods and all of that is of course going to increase our productive capacity.

         We are conscious of the need for a significant tightening of fiscal policy in the May budget to boost national savings to reduce Australia's call on overseas capital. There is a very obvious and significant difference between the economic situation now and that which prevailed in the 1985-86 growth period. You had a situation then where growth was running at about 2.2 per cent as compared with over, as we know, 6.43 per cent on this occasion. You had inflation in the latter 1980s in the last growth surge period running at around 8.4 per cent; it is now sitting on around two per cent, forecast to go no higher than 3 1/2 per cent over the course of this particular cycle. You had mortgage rates running then at about 15 1/2 per cent as compared with 10 1/2 per cent now and other interest rates in a comparable position.

         The central message of the discussion paper is that Australia's pre-eminent trade policy objective is market access for Australian traders and investors. The issue is not MFN or preferential arrangements. The key issue is: how do we win market access for Australian business, Australian trade opportunities, Australian job opportunities and Australian investment opportunities? The paper underlines the fact that Australia has had a longstanding commitment to the multilateral trading system based on the MFN principle, and we are not about to make a sudden U-turn in respect of this policy. This applies to our approach to APEC also.

         What we have to emphasise is that APEC is a consensus based organisation. The fact that Australia's preference is for MFN does not mean that that will automatically happen. We are saying that, if the body of opinion in APEC is in support of a preferential approach, we will consider that. We will not necessarily stand in its way, particularly if that will deliver quicker and more comprehensive trade and investment opportunities. The public policy is not about some sort of esoteric, theoretical proposal; it is about getting the best possible result in the real world.

         We have to realise that Australia historically, despite its commitment to MFN which we retain, has been a party to some successful preferential arrangements—most obviously CER, but also in the South Pacific with SPARTECA and with Canada. We have begun a dialogue with AFTA on trade linkages, which the opposition has supported. If the opposition wants to say we should not do this, what it has to answer is: if at the end of the day the only way to achieve improved export access results for Australia is through a route with some preferential elements, would you close the door on these options? If our car industry can only achieve major improvement in access to the markets of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia through a route with some preferential elements, are you advocating that we should go to those employees in the car factories and say, `I'm sorry, you can't have that opportunity because there is an esoteric principle that we hold to; you can't have those jobs because you don't agree with that'?

         We are not neutral in the MFN preferential debate. Our preference is for an MFN approach. But it is too early in the discussions on implementing APEC liberalisation to lock ourselves into an entrenched position. There is a long way to go, a lot of discussion to be had and a lot of external factors—like whether there is going to be a move to a new global round of trade negotiations—to be dealt with yet.

Is it not a fact that Mr Keating called last night's extraordinary meeting not only in a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to achieve some progress on these issues, but also in a very unhappy attempt to revive the fast fading hopes of his ministerial colleagues and in order to try to build some bridges between the isolation of the prime ministerial office and all those others who are being kept in the dark? Why don't you come clean and admit that last night's meeting was symptomatic of a government in disarray; when is your part-time Prime Minister going to come back to work; and when can Australians expect some real action on these important issues?

         raising the issue of the long-term fate of the BHP steelworks at Newcastle in New South Wales. I understand that the issue is not that BHP is considering in any way, shape or form exiting from the rod and bar product market; rather, when it is talking about investment decisions for the steelworks, it is talking about new investment in new technology at Newcastle to ensure a long-term presence for itself in the Australian domestic and international markets. I think that is good news for BHP, and it overall fits into the very positive picture that we have seen emerge for the Australian steel industry.

         Calendar year 1994 was a record year for the Australian steel industry. It was five full years after the end of our steel plan and 10 years—a full decade—since BHP itself was thinking of quitting steel making in Australia. The Australian production of crude steel was at a record 8.4 million tonnes, nine per cent higher than the previous year and 48 per cent higher than the 1983 figure. Furthermore, this result was achieved with a more productive and efficient environment. For example, the yield of finished product from crude steel has increased from around 77 per cent in the 1970s to now around 90 per cent. BHP's steel profit for the six months to November 1994 was a record $344 million, up 19 per cent on the same period of the previous year. Steel exports last year was a record 3.2 million tonnes, with some 75 per cent of that going to the Asian region.

         It is also a good record of Australian technology. In 1994, Australia was the lowest cost producer of the 11 countries considered in the Paine and Webber annual survey. BHP's steel productivity has more than trebled since 1982, and the approach of total quality management is the order of the day at its steelworks. BHP's commitment to steel making in Australia is stronger than ever. For example, it is building a new $400 million blast furnace at Port Kembla and a $300 million expansion of the tin mill is committed. An expansion is under way at Whyalla and the Sydney mini-mill has environmental approval for expanded operations. BHP will unveil this complete strategy for Newcastle by July of this year.

         One of the other exciting features of the entire steel industry story is that Australia is becoming increasingly regarded as a source of new technologies. CRA's $200 million high smelt project and BHP's Project M joint venture are being keenly watched by world steel makers. The prognosis for the steel industry in this part of the world is extremely good. The huge demand in China is expected to continue. The ability of Australia as a primary producer of minerals and our knowledge and capability with technology in steel making puts Australia in a position to take advantage of further downstream processing opportunities and expanding and growing our steel industry much further than it has to date. I repeat that last year was a record year for the industry. There is no doubt that this government's steel plan laid the foundations for that achievement.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. I refer to the cabinet decision to consider a preferential free trade agreement within APEC hoping to accelerate free trade in the region but clearly while still continuing unilateral cuts to our support for Australian industry, including our car industry. Figures available through Ernst and Young's Asia-Pacific database and UNCTAD's directory of import regimes report tariff rates on cars of 200 per cent in Thailand, 100 per cent in Indonesia, 50 per cent in Malaysia, 60 per cent in China and 45 per cent in Singapore. I ask the minister: firstly, are these figures correct and, if not, what are the correct figures? Secondly, have these countries made commitments to reduce these tariffs and, if so, by how much and when? Thirdly, will the minister demand better access for Australian car exports to these countries as a quid pro quo for our own continuing unilateral tariff reductions?

         —I thank Senator Spindler for his question. The figures are not entirely accurate. It is a situation more complex than that. I will provide Senator Spindler with a full picture of the situation as well as with regard to both cars and parts—in fact, for Australia the figure for car parts is more important. There is a very high level of protection against Australian cars in at least some of those countries and to a lesser extent against Australian automobile components. That is an important issue and an issue of continuing interest to both the industry minister and me.

         Austrade and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology have been jointly investigating market access into Asia for the Australian auto industry. We are trying to focus on ways in which we can be as effective as possible in helping our industry to get that access, which it is increasingly winning because the level of exports of automobiles and automobile parts from Australia is going up very strongly.

         With regard to market access Senator Spindler asked whether these countries made commitments to reduce protection. Of course they have. Under APEC they have all made commitments to free trade by 2020. Three of those countries to which Senator Spindler refers—Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia—made significant unilateral tariff reductions, not all affecting cars. In some countries they affected cars, but they mainly affected many products of importance to Australia during the last 12 months. We appreciate that, and we expect that process to continue.

         I do not claim that that has been as a result of brilliant representations by Australia but because of international market pressures for competitiveness and for investment which require people to reduce their protection. I expect that to continue. We will continue in cooperation with the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to press for better access for Australian car exports and for automobile component exports, both of which are growing very strongly. But we can do better and would do better if the level of protection in these countries were not so high. That will continue to be a priority for us in APEC, as it will continue to be a priority for us in the multilateral round which we will seek to have resume as soon as possible, and in our bilateral relations with those countries.

         As to the question of the so-called quid pro quo, we will continue to press for tariff reductions in the area. What we do with regard to our tariffs and other matters beyond the commitments we have already given in the existing plans will be a matter which cabinet will give consideration to at the appropriate time. It will be part of our discussions both about our domestic economic policy settings and about our trade settings with regard to APEC and multilateral negotiations.

         I commend the policies of the government in New South Wales in terms of plantations. They are excellent. There are similar plans in Western Australia. I have publicly commended them. They are so far away from what the coalition is proposing that it is not funny. In New South Wales, the New South Wales forestry commission plants the plantation and does all the work as a joint venture with the farmer. That provides a real incentive. Mr McLachlan's policy is a joke. It has already been attacked by two prominent critics other than me—John Anderson and Tim Fischer.

It is with regret that the government has received the resignation of Robert de Castella from his position of Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. Robert de Castella has brought an invaluable perspective to that job and made an outstanding contribution to Australian sport as an athlete and an administrator.

         During his time leading the Australian Institute of Sport there has been considerable expansion of institute sports. The AIS programs have been integrated into the broader national sports system. One of his many achievements has been the development of support services for athletes, ensuring their all-round development as individuals as well as elite athletes and role models. The commitment of Rob de Castella and the AIS to the personal development of athletes has meant that, when the crowds stop cheering, these athletes can move on to new careers and have very productive and satisfying lives.

         As well as the extensive grassroots work that Rob has undertaken, his time at the AIS has helped raise the profile of the AIS, maintaining its integrity and its leadership role in elite Australian sport. He has played a major role in securing promotional funding for the institute and the programs of the Australian Sports Commission. We should all thank Rob de Castella for his great contribution to the institute and also to its athletes, its coaches, its administrators and to Australian sport in general.

         I think I can say very strongly that Rob de Castella's resignation is not a sign that the AIS in any sense is on the wane. On the contrary; Rob de Castella has confirmed that he will be maintaining close links with the AIS. I am personally very keen to explore ways in which his exceptional skills and experience can continue to be available to Australian sport. Action is already under way to find a new director. The vacancy has been advertised widely and an executive search consultant has been contracted to identify a suitable field of candidates.

         In keeping with its role as leader in Australian sport, the Australian Sports Commission is constantly monitoring its position both nationally and internationally. Internal review of the AIS is being undertaken with the assistance of external consultants which will firmly focus on the continuing role and functions of the institute in order to maintain its national leadership in this field—and make no mistake; it is a very strong view of the federal government that there is a crucial national role for the Institute of Sport in the development of elite athletes in this country. The government has an absolute commitment to maintain and strengthen the position of the AIS as one of the world's great sports training centres, a position that will become more important in the lead-up to the year 2000 Olympics. I hope all senators will join me in congratulating Rob de Castella for a job well done on behalf of Australian sport.

         —When it comes to drugs and other therapeutic treatments the government is of the view that it is not sufficient to let the buyer beware. Australia has a very comprehensive system of drug registration and it is aimed at protecting consumers, stopping drug companies from making false claims and ensuring the speedy delivery of new, fully evaluated drugs. The process involves either listing or registering drugs depending on their type and what they are claimed to do. When making applications for listing or registration the companies are very well aware of the consequences of the listing or registration of drugs, in particular that they cannot promote them for other than what they are listed or registered for.

         However, in the last few weeks a company in Queensland, SciNat Australia Pty Ltd, has flouted these laws in the promotion of a treatment that it brought out from Germany called Remifemin. The drug was listed on the Australian register of therapeutic goods last December for the relief of menstrual pain and pre-menstrual symptoms only. However, the company started to promote the drug, making claims which it must have known it was not authorised to make and which were totally untested in Australia, that this drug provided, in the company's words, `menopausal relief'.

         The Therapeutic Goods Administration contacted the company immediately the promotional material was brought to its attention and informed its managing director that by promoting the product for this purpose the company as sponsor of the drug was liable to prosecution under the Therapeutic Goods Act with penalties up to $30,000. It was also advised that it was liable for prosecution for promoting a product with prohibited representation—in other words, making claims about the drug that were untested in this country. The TGA advised the company to immediately cease all further promotion of the product and I can say that the company agreed to that. It has agreed to run newspaper ads retracting its statements and requesting the removal of all offending material.

         This is particularly important because the government is committed to ensuring consumers get information on therapeutic goods that is, in fact, verified. In this case, the TGA acted swiftly to stop the company promoting this drug in this way and provided an immediate response to the unlawful activity. If the company believes its product could be useful in relation to menopause symptoms it does have the option of submitting an application for registration or listing of the drug for this purpose and then providing the information to allow it to be tested and the scientific evaluation to be done in the usual way. That company knows it can do that and it is perfectly open to follow that course.

All senators will recall the claims made about a miraculous thigh cream just a very short while ago. If consumers have any doubts or concerns about these claims or any other product claims they can certainly confirm those with the Therapeutic Goods Administration.

         —Senator, if there is information that I can find for you about the lack of access for patients in northern Queensland, I will certainly seek it. I do not have any particular information about that matter, but it is not accurate to represent the case as you have. Some people are able to get medical benefits assistance for privately provided testing of this sort, provided it is in an already approved private provision place. So we need to get those facts clear. As to what is the arrangement for northern Queensland, I will seek some information and get back to you.

This is not the only private facility in Australia that does not enjoy access to those benefits, so do not come the raw prawn on this one! Those arrangements are agreed between the profession, state governments and the high technology committee. If there is further information I can find for you, I will. This is not the first time the private system has introduced high-tech equipment and then tried to force the provision of medical benefits. That is the case in other situations.

         —I thank Senator Woodley for his question which refers to a proposed amendment in the Social Security (Non-Budget) Measures Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify in the Social Security Act the principle that a temporary separation—for example, where people are separated from their partners due to holidays, work or study commitments—does not qualify people for the sole parent pension.

         The Department of Social Security has had legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department which confirms that the law does require clarification to put this principle beyond doubt in the legislation. However, the amendment does not seek any additional discretion and is not intended to involve any changes to existing procedures. In other words, the current arrangements for women leaving a violent situation are not changed. We are aware of the concerns raised about the impact of this legislation, particularly on people separating in circumstances involving domestic violence, but the concerns are unnecessary and misleading. There is no intention in the amendment to change the current procedures or to put any additional barriers to people needing to leave violent situations.

         The admission procedures for sole parents pay particular attention to the issues of domestic violence. Indeed, while we have a requirement that in order to be eligible for the sole parent pension claimants take reasonable action to obtain maintenance, if there is any evidence or case made about domestic violence then different arrangements are permitted. People can seek an exemption from the maintenance action if they are in fear.

         I think it is very appropriate for Senator Woodley to raise this concern.

We certainly do not want to put further hurdles in their way if it comes to seeking financial support from the sole parent pension.

         The referral to a social worker comes as a matter of course if there is any evidence or any reference to violence. Where a client is at risk or has left an abusive relationship, their entitlement to the pension is usually clear cut. Sometimes, however, family breakdown is complex. It does, as Senator Woodley knows, cover a myriad of situations. There are situations where claimants may not be able to say that the relationship has permanently ended. They may indeed be going through a period of separation. There may not be any evidence or even any claim that that is a separation consequent on violence in the relationship. In those cases, it is important that the individual circumstances are examined closely and that the pension not be provided, as I said for the examples before, except where there is clearly demonstrated, real need.

         The department does have procedures to verify separation. These can include contacting external parties nominated by the client.

         I think it is very important that we do not create a public perception that could deter women from applying to claim the sole parent pension in such situations, for example of domestic violence, when it will be absolutely necessary for them to have it and when they indeed will be eligible. I think we acknowledge a significant change in the sensitive way in which such people are now assisted in this matter.

         —It is an unfortunate fact that Senator Short either does not have the capacity to do the research or does not have an interest in it. If he did, he would see very clearly why the federal government has made this particular move. There has been a settled approach to the way in which directors are appointed. It was only a few months ago that the New South Wales government moved a motion at the previous meeting of the board that the board should be appointed by the Commonwealth minister on the advice of resolution of members. Basically, there was a move a couple of months ago by the New South Wales government to take whatever final say this government had in appointing members to the board of NAATI right out of our hands and make the minister and the federal government the rubber stamp. That is the preceding information on this.

         Senator Short can say it as often as he likes, but the reality is that we pay some $380,000 in funds for NAATI. That amount is probably 10 times the amount of most of the states. New South Wales pays over $200,000, but I am not so sure what its amount is. We pay a majority of the money. Whereas at the moment we do have a say at the end of the day as to who does get appointed, the New South Wales resolution was that all this power be taken away from the federal government. Basically we provide the funds but we have no say in terms of who is appointed.

If that had not taken place we would not have had the meeting in Adelaide last week in the atmosphere in which that meeting took place. We would not have had to confront the issue.

Put at your foremost consideration, Senator Short, the interests of Australian taxpayers. If we are going to be in a situation where we have no say as to how the funds are spent, where we are going to be rubber stamps, then obviously we have to consider how those fund are being spent. In that spirit of trying to work this out, I have had discussions already and I expect those discussions will lead to a constructive result.

         It is quite obvious from today's figures, and from Senator Evans's answer to Senator Hill's question, that Senator Evans, the third most senior member in this government and an aspirant for the job of Prime Minister, does not have a clue about the seriousness of Australia's balance of payments crisis, a crisis due directly to the disastrous failure of the Labor government's policies throughout its 12 long years in government. I point out that, for all of this time, the chief architect of those failed policies has been the former Treasurer and current Prime Minister, Mr Keating.

         We now have the balance of payments figures for the first seven months of this financial year. They show the worst balance of payments results in our history. In all but one of those seven months of this financial year, the monthly deficit has been well over $2 billion. That is a huge figure that is continuing to plunge us into hock with the rest of the world—week by week, day by day, hour by hour. That is not the end of it though because, on the revised forecast of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) presented just a few weeks ago, the government expects the average monthly deficit over the remaining five months of this financial year to continue at a level of $2 billion.

By comparison, the United States—a country which is extremely concerned about its external imbalance—has a current account deficit forecast of 2.3 per cent of GDP, less than half that of Australia's.

This Prime Minister that we have at the moment, who was our Treasurer for many years, has said that we are on the right track.

To put that into perspective, it is almost double the November merchandise trade deficit. The exports are down five per cent and imports are up six per cent.

         What is the government's response? `We are on track; we are on target.' Forget the fact that the target was changed by some $8 billion only a few weeks ago. The government usually goes back in history and refers to Fraser. It does not have any plans to resolve this issue. It does not even apologise for dragging Australia down into the mire. It simply tries to rewrite history. It actually tries to mis-state the facts. Let me just briefly state the facts. When Fraser left office 12 years ago, the foreign net liability was $23 billion; now it is over $160 billion—more than seven times under this government.

It is always someone else's fault. It is never the fault of the government—that is assuming that they ever recognise there is a problem. Usually, `We are right on track.' That is the obvious answer that Ralph Willis and Senator Gareth Evans give.

         The blow-out now is approaching some 5.75 per cent of GDP. In 1986, when the current account deficit was approaching six per cent, the then Prime Minister went on the Laws program and said, `You cannot fund $12 billion in perpetuity every year. You have to slow growth.' But when growth is less than three per cent, unemployment goes up. Then we hear those famous words which we all remember, `You have gone. You are a banana republic.' How appropriate it was here yesterday that Senator Evans was described as bananas in pyjamas. Not only is he a banana; he is in sleep mode. It is the perfect response for a banana republic. In 1986, we could not fund $12 billion a year; now it is now $26 billion a year. It is almost six per cent of GDP. So, by the government's own definition, we are on the road to becoming a banana republic.

Worse than that, the Prime Minister has the hide to say we should be grateful to him for putting up interest rates; it is a good thing. He says it is taking out premium insurance on our jobs because, if he puts up interest rates, we keep our jobs. He ignores the fact that Australians are already paying the highest prime bank rates in the world.

         In particular I wish to address the issue of what we are doing about the deficit. The government, when challenged on these particular figures, says again and again, `Yes, but our exports are rising.' This answer is nothing short of misleading the Senate because, while exports are rising from a very slow base, imports are rising at a much faster rate. This year we admittedly had 16 per cent export growth in ETMs and about 10 per cent for total manufactures. However, this has come, as I have said, from an extremely low base.

         Manufacturing import growth, however, is much greater in absolute terms. Import penetration has grown to 25 per cent of total domestic sales—up from 15 per cent in the 1970s. The manufacturing trade deficit has now grown to $35.3 billion for 1994. That is the last available figure. We should note that this is up from $15 billion in 1984 and $4 billion in 1974. In other words, we continue to import at a much faster rate than we export.

         All Senator Evans could point at today and say was, `You people won't support tax increases.' I will deal with that particular aspect in a moment. It is worth noting that in the last five years of the coalition government, before this government came into power, the total of the current account deficit was around about what it is going to be for this year—about $26 billion. It is also worth noting that in 1979-80 the current account deficit for the whole year was $1.974 billion. We have now had three consecutive months—a trend; it was an aberration last month, but it must be considered a trend now—of $2 billion more in each of those months. As has already been stated, it was more in six of the last seven months than it was for that whole year.

        That is in relation to the tax cuts. We know what happened to them and where they went. There was the promise by this government to pensioners. It was stated:

        I suggest very strongly that Senator Evans and the government are in no position to talk about our position as far as taxation is concerned. The facts are that they have not addressed in a proper way what is required to overcome the crisis that we now have with our balance of payments. One of the major areas which one must emphasise over and over again—and we listened to Senator Spindler and his solution—is that the real reason why we are not competitive in this country and we have imports flowing in consistently is the failure of this government to address proper labour market reform. That is the fundamental problem and issue the government will not tackle, because its masters in the union movement will not let it.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cooney this day, relating to the BHP Steelworks in Newcastle.

        This afternoon Senator Cook painted a very glowing picture of what is happening in the steel industry in Australia. Indeed, many of the changes in recent years have been of great benefit to this industry. It is certainly in a much more profitable position than it was before. It has moved far more into the export of product and it has become far more efficient.

         I listened to what Senator Cook said and I fear that he might have glossed over an ugly reality of the development of this industry. He did mention the expansion of the flat products division of the Wollongong steel industry, and that is to be welcomed. He mentioned the expansion of the Whyalla division, which is also to be welcomed.

         When he got to Newcastle, he glossed over what was happening up there by saying, `There's going to be new investment.' That is true; there is going to be new investment.

         What we have seen over the last 20 years in Newcastle, in the time that I have been there, is a steel industry that has gone from employing 20,000 people down to 4 1/2 thousand people. The steel industry has improved efficiencies a great deal, and part of the agenda of the 1980s was certainly to make industrial operations more efficient. But the minister glossed over the fact that the changes coming will probably not relate so much to efficiency as to a scaling down of the nature of the type of steel that is produced and the employment that that in turn will generate.

         In Australia we have two fully generated steelworks—one at Wollongong and one at Newcastle. I fear that the Wollongong steelworks will be the only remaining integrated steelworks if current plans which are in place continue. The city is rife with rumours that a mini-mill will be established in Newcastle. This new investment could be related to the closing down of the integrated steelworks and the establishment of a mini-mill, something like the one in Rooty Hill in Sydney, which works on an electric process, which is not the usual way that steel is produced by coal.

         This has ramifications right through the Hunter Valley. There will be a loss of jobs in the steel industry and, therefore, there will be a loss of jobs in the coal industry, the transport industry and a whole range of associated industries. It was very deceptive of the minister today to gloss over this fact. It was deceptive when, at a time of very high unemployment and extremely high regional unemployment, what is happening in the steel industry is likely to exacerbate this problem.

         John Howard has spoken about the five minutes of economic sunlight that Australia has enjoyed recently. The sun did not come up for many areas in Australia. It certainly did not come up for the Hunter Valley. Up until the last two months, unemployment levels in the Hunter Valley consistently stayed at 15 per cent, when in the rest of the country they dropped from over 11 per cent to over nine.

         Regional unemployment is rife.

Unfortunately, even though the Hunter economy is diversifying at some pace, it will not be sufficient to take yet another blow to the Hunter economy by dropping employment in steel and its associated industries.

         —We left off at the point where Senator Kernot had put to me a question in relation to the meaning and operation of this amendment.  If I understood her correctly, Senator Kernot suggested that the words `those who suffer the most disadvantage in relation to access to land' invite the same sort of conflict and concern that `most severely dispossessed' caused.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I will address that question but I also need to consider Senator Kernot's other question, which was: do you read this in conjunction with amendment 25, which talks about health, housing, education and the like? The first question was put to the coalition with the comment made by the dissenting report from Senator Reynolds and Senator Lees at page 199:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To demonstrate the inherent unworkability of this formula, take the example of an Aboriginal community living by some form of agreement on another person's pastoral lease. On one view, they are not very disadvantaged at all in terms of `access to land' compared with, say, an indigenous commune in a densely populated part of a city. On another view, however, the group on the pastoral lease could be seen as disadvantaged in the extreme, because they are so agonisingly close to the unfettered enjoyment of their heritage. The prospect of complex and lengthy legal action, in this or many other particular situations that could arise, is all too plain.
       </para>
       <para>
        With due respect, they have missed the point. In relation to the formula that has been expressed by the coalition you also look at those who are unable to gain substantive title to the land. Although you might have a group who have access to land, they still might deserve consideration in the event of a conflict of allocation of funds if they do not have substantive title to the land.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is precisely the point that Senators Reynolds and Lees were making in this minority report. They were saying that if you have these people living on the pastoral lease by agreement they have the access to the land. That is true. They say that, because they have access to the land, our formula fails them. Of course it does not, because the alternative in the formula is those who are unable to gain substantive title to the land. That was raised by Noel Pearson, the executive director of the Cape York Land Council. He said that it is not just access to land that is a yardstick of merit; it is also whether you have title to the land. He cited as an example those people in Queensland who had land gazetted in their favour.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So when you look at the amendment, do not just look at the first limb of it, because there are two limbs. The group that is living on the pastoral lease might have access to land but they fall down on lack of title because they are there only by agreement with the pastoralist concerned. So they would not miss out. When you applied the amendment in its true form you could see how severely disadvantaged they were because priority is to be given to those who are disadvantaged in either access to land or title to land. I believe that answers the question posed by Senator Kernot.

         Amendment 25, which deals with health, housing and education—which all go to the viability of the community—was in a different section of the bill and dealt with the policies that the ILC, the Indigenous Land Corporation, had to adopt—very different to the principle and objects of the bill. The principle and objects of the bill are in much more general terms. They are to be found at the beginning of the bill, whereas the actual policy of how you acquire interests, manage land or give grants of money or loans, et cetera, is more the nitty-gritty of it, so to speak. Therefore, you would not read them together because one is a principle and object of the bill; the other is a policy of the acquisition of land.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I remind those who are concerned about amendment 25 that during the hearings there was a good deal of misunderstanding about that. The amendment talks about improving the viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, including by addressing their health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural needs.

         Those are the policy aspects, but it is very different when it comes to the crunch when you have a conflict of interest in the allocation of funding and there is a dollar available and you have two very good applicants vying for that dollar. If you give both of them 50c you might not help either one of them. You might have to make a decision that one gets it and the other one does not. You may say to the other, `Come back next year.' That is an unenviable task and it is much like the discretion ministers have in the allocation of funding. This gives a principle in the bill as to how that will be done when that dilemma arises.

         I indicate that you should not read that together with amendment 25. When you apply this formula you should look at the two limbs which are access to land and those who are unable to gain title to land. As I said earlier, the evidence of Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council was that access to land was an aspect to be considered. I will not recite again what I have already outlined to the chamber. I do believe that that assists in answering Senator Kernot's questions.

         —The government has consistently opposed any attempt to have the legislation include directions on the prioritising of access to land fund moneys. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his second reading speech on the new bill that is currently before the House of Representatives drew attention to the unworkability and divisiveness of such a provision. When referring to the Senate select committee's proposed amendment, which is now before us today, to delete the reference to `most severely dispossessed' and to substitute a different form of words, the Prime Minister said:

         The committee's solution, however—a form of words which would still seek to rank degrees of disadvantage in terms of access to land—clearly fails to overcome the objection to the original amendment. Any statutory obligation to calculate and calibrate different degrees of disadvantage is bound to generate unproductive disputation.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly how we read this provision. The coalition has really just plucked another vague and undefined set of criteria out of the air as a means of determining priority. The formulation that is on offer now will lead, in our judgment, to difficulties which are equal to those arising from the original amendment.

         If the ILC is in the position, as the opposition proposes it should be, of having to apply these kinds of criteria and make sense of them, that is going to make, here as elsewhere, its operation very top heavy bureaucratically and would necessarily concentrate a whole lot more decision making power in a centralised structure. Some criteria are going to have to be developed to establish the relative degrees of disadvantage and everything else that is associated with this provision.

         Then we get to the problems of definitional detail. What exactly does access mean in this context? Is it to be defined in a purely physical sense? If that is right, then contemplate this: some states, and of course the Northern Territory, do guarantee access physically to pastoral leases in their legislation. That can hardly be compared to the rights which are conferred by full ownership. Is access not to be defined then in a physical sense but rather in some kind of structural sense, if I can put it that way, as in access to land acquisition programs or access to a legislative right to claim land irrespective of whether such a claim might be successful? If that is the case and if there is some notional right of access in that generalised structural sense, then you have a situation where the Aboriginal people of New South Wales would go right to the bottom of the priority list because that state does have a land rights act and does have land acquisition funds.

         Then you have the problem of how the ILC will assess, on the other limb of the equation, whether people are unable to gain substantive title to land, to use that part of the proposed new formula. Does gaining title encompass simply the ability to buy land and thereby gain title, or does it mean gaining native title through the processes of the NTA, the Native Title Act?

         The difficulties in defining these principles—the difficulties that I have identified in understanding what these words are to mean and how they are to be applied—are inevitably again, as so often, going to lead to arguments and legal challenge. They are going to lead inevitably to disputation about who has the least access, who has the most access, who has something in between along some graduated schedule and who at least is able to gain substantive title to land—however you define that. The whole amendment is an invitation to litigate. It places the courts again, I suppose, in the position of defining by exclusion who can get access to the land fund through setting aside the ILC's decisions.

         The truth of the matter is that all of this is just too complex to be prescribed by legislation which is inevitably going to be the subject of litigation. The diversity of circumstances of indigenous people all around the country means that there is going to be a range of priorities. It is going to involve a lot of difficult and delicate questions of judgment and balance.

         For some groups, there is an urgency in returning to their land before their culture and their language are lost completely. They might be people who do have access to land already in the sense of the Northern Territory right of access to pastoral leases for the purposes of formally exercising at least some rights to enjoy the land in question and not having any substantive character about the legal recognition of those rights but, nonetheless, raising questions of definition and application of the kind that I have already referred to. You can have competing priorities cutting across particular individual situations.

         So what we are saying again with utmost good faith—and we do not say this in any spirit of being cantankerous or just dismissive; I have tried to give a reasoned response to every one of these amendments all the way through this long debate—is that assessing priority in the allocation of the fund moneys should be left to the ILC board, which in the absence of legislative prescription will be able to take into account the diversity of needs of indigenous people in this country. It should be empowered to make its own decisions without unnecessary constraints which undermine its authority and make its job unworkable. That is our position and, there again, I am afraid that is where we are going to have to stick. We will vote against the amendment accordingly.

         —I will respond briefly; I do not want to delay the Senate. Senator Evans does make the point that the ILC board will ultimately have to make these sorts of decisions at its own discretion. The genesis of the wording of the modification to the amendment came not only from the evidence to the committee where, as Senator Ellison already said, Noel Pearson very articulately described at the Cairns hearings a whole series of circumstances where it would be desirable to assist certain groups in Australia to get access to land under the land fund before others. Senator Evans, I think, alluded to that when he spoke about those who should be given access as urgently as possible before they lose any more of their culture or tradition. Mr Pearson made the point that there are probably people who have been entirely dispossessed of their land and have lost a lot of that culture and tradition. It is probably in the interests of maintaining culture and tradition to find people who have not lost all the culture and tradition and who can be reunited with some land more urgently. That, of course, is addressed by the words of this modification to the amendment.

         Equally, Senator Ellison referred to Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council. That reminds us that, when the first discussion about this controversial amendment in its initial form was first debated by the Senate, Aboriginal groups around the country held a meeting. I actually forget where it was held, but it was basically to resolve what was regarded by the media as a sort of north-south divide over this legislation. They did agree that there needed to be a principle in the bill. The Kimberley Land Council, the Cape York Land Council and the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council agreed on a number of things at that meeting: one, that this bill not be regarded as compensation for disposition and, two, that it not stop them from claiming compensation in the future.

         Even though they agreed to disagree on the words `most severely dispossessed', they did agree that there should be a guiding principle. Peter Yu and Noel Pearson both stated that to the committee and supported the broad concept of assisting those with the least access to land and the least ability to gain access. Mr Pearson said in evidence that states like New South Wales, possibly South Australia and, to a limited extent, the Northern Territory already have existing legislation to give people like that access to the land. There were other states like Queensland where that did not happen and where the priority may be greater.

         The point I make is that there is a need ultimately to set priorities. The board will have to do that one way or the other. The issue then at stake is whether or not there should be a guiding principle in the legislation or whether we should just leave it to the board to make those decisions month by month, week by week, claim by claim and application by application.

         The coalition, after lengthy consideration and after hearing all of the evidence from the 244-odd witnesses around Australia, believes that the principle should be enshrined in the bill. I think it is fair to say that an absolutely overwhelming majority of people who came before the committee agreed that that principle should be in there. The only witness strongly against it was ATSIC. Even a number of ATSIC commissioners and ATSIC operatives on the ground around the country came forward and disagreed with the position put by ATSIC's submission. So there was overwhelmingly support for there to be a principle in there.

         I agree with Senator Evans that the wording of that principle needs to be done carefully. We believe the wording, as a result of the committee's deliberations, is much better than `most severely dispossessed'. The committee and the coalition were convinced that trying to assign grades of dispossession is not only repugnant to Aboriginal people but is also probably impractical and unworkable. That we have come up with this revised wording is a reflection of the fact that the committee was prepared to do the work and listen to the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I commend the modification of the amendment to the Senate.

         —I rise to indicate the Greens' support for this amendment. I am sure that will come as no great surprise to anyone in the chamber, but I will state briefly the reasons for it. The most important thing is that the failure to state a principle within the bill to assist in the prioritising of the very small amount of funds available across Australia means that some other different principle will have to be used in the operation of the fund. We need to make that principle, or whatever divergent principles are operating, explicit to avoid a de facto prioritising to perhaps a first come first served basis or to perhaps easier access to those groups who have already had the resources to work out what they need and where they need it and to be able to make their claims in an expeditious fashion.

         If there was adequate funding to meet all the needs of all Aboriginal people who cannot gain land via the Native Title Act or by any other means, it might be a different question. We might not need to put a priority guiding principle within the aims and objects of this legislation. But, if I may say so, it is an extremely strange omission that a fund should be set out without any objects or principles that ensure that those who read that act will know the purpose of the funds being made available and what kinds of priorities might need to be exercised in case those funds were short of the amount required to fulfil their total purpose. Any failure to state those principles by which moneys will be allocated is bound to generate ill feeling across the Aboriginal community.

         Repeatedly in the consultations that the committee took, there was anxiety as to how the extra $21 million was to be allocated—whether it was to go to every person at $124 per person per year, to every state at $2 million to $3 million per state, or divided between all states except perhaps New South Wales, which has a land council, or the Northern Territory, which has a land rights act. That anxiety was already present amongst the people who did support the need for some guiding principle.

         As has already been stated, the whole use of the phrase `most severely dispossessed' had become so detached from the context in which it was expressed, which was where there is a conflict that this kind of prioritising should be taken into consideration. That emotive usage of it by those who opposed any guiding principle being placed in the bill at all did allow many people to feel gravely concerned. Nevertheless, they all understood that when there was so little money to go around some kind of explicit guidelines would be useful and helpful.

         We believe that the amendment that the opposition has come to as a result of the committee hearings is a twofold thing: it is a sign of their goodwill politically to look at the concerns and it is also a worthy inclusion in the bill itself. While Senator Evans's view is that it is all too complex and there is an invitation for litigation, I repeat what I said earlier—that stating a principle to which the ILC can adhere to and be seen to adhere to will protect it from litigation provided it takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has endeavoured to make a determination which relates to the purpose of the fund. After all, we were told that the purpose of the fund was to assist those who have been dispossessed of their lands. They were the Prime Minister's words and that was one of the reasons why we used those words and agreed to those words in the principles.

         There are two possible reasons why the government is remaining adamant about this. One is that it may be that it wants to prioritise those groups that are more aware of what lands they need—they can actually see their country; it might be a country fund, not a land fund for dispossessed people who will not gain by native title—those who can see their country but cannot own it and who may already have a very well-founded belief that they should be assisted to help buy back that land from whatever leasehold or freehold it is under and regain their culture. I do not blame them for that one bit. But the government cannot win both ways. It cannot pretend that this is a land fund for all Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed and who will not benefit from native title if what it is really intending is for a small segment of those people to be able to gain. If it wants to do that, then it should state a different principle rather than simply leaving it unstated.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second reason why the government may be so adamant about not having any prioritising principles in the bill is that it does not mind that the acquisition needs of Aboriginal people may well be swamped by the management needs of the land they already hold and also of any lands that may be acquired through the fund. That is one of the matters. This guiding principle that it may well be that groups which, as the Tasmanian Aboriginal centre proposed, already have land should not get more lands before other groups who have no land at all may be interfering with the government's desire that it actually use the majority or as much of the fund as is available to meet the existing management needs of indigenous held lands as well as the management needs of lands that might happen to be acquired in the first few years of the operation of this fund. Neither of those two reasons is adequate to leave at a blank. If the government does not agree with the guiding principle, it should state what its guiding principles are and put them on the table because it is not adequate to simply leave them out.

The draftsmen, whose  advice I have taken, are by no means persuaded that you have succeeded in doing that.

         However, I think the intention of what you are trying to do is clear and it may conceivably be technically adequate for that purpose.

         The short point I want to repeat is that, however successful you may or may not have been in cleaning up the technical problem to which I drew attention, you still have some other problems of a serious kind, as we see it anyway , with the clause. You have still inhibited obviously the ILC from using any of the land fund moneys for administrative purposes. It is stuck with, it is confined to, such other moneys as are appropriated for administrative expense purposes. That appropriation is manifestly not accomplished by this legislation; it has to be accomplished each year by a new exercise by the parliament in appropriating $3 million or $3 million plus for that purpose. So the first problem is that you are in the hands of a cooperative parliament if the organisation is not to be stymied from the outset.

         Secondly, you have the further problem of the possibility for various reasons of overruns in administrative expenses in any year, which again throws the ILC back at the mercy of the parliament and government of the day for some extended supplementary appropriation to enable it to get through that particular year. In general, it does cut across completely the principle of administrative autonomy which has been the touchstone for all similar commercial corporations and it really is a pretty heavy-handed feat of paternalism to apply this constraint in the name of giving the ILC a new funding opportunity. What you are really doing is applying a new constraint of a paternalistic kind. So whatever the technical adequacy of what you are trying to do may or may not prove to be, for all those other reasons we oppose the clause as proposed now to be amended by Senator Chamarette.

What we are trying to do with this piece of legislation is to create a whole new regime for dispossessed Aboriginal people—to give them confidence about the viability of the land fund that will be built up over time and to enable them to have some confidence as they face their future, without the vagaries of annual appropriation regimes and all the political pressures, for and against, that work upon that. This whole legislation has been crafted to give them that degree of confidence that they are lacking at the moment. It is not a knockout blow.

         —I missed the debate this morning because I was out of Parliament House, but I understand that Senator Evans raised the fact that this may, in some way, stymie self-determination. Certainly, ATSIC was a body proposed to create some self-determination, so I do not think that argument has a lot of merit. But the ultimate objective of this amendment, as Senator Evans knows, is to ensure that the funds brought down each year for the acquisition and management of land are used for that purpose and that they are not chewed up by administrative expenses.

         I understand Senator Evans also said that, if they are tied up in litigation that runs into millions of dollars, that will cost the taxpayer more money. The reality is that, if that happened under the government's scheme and you had litigation worth $5 million, $6 million or $10 million in one year, the amount of money available for land acquisition or management would be reduced quite significantly in that particular year. That is what this amendment seeks to avoid. In relation to the committee's deliberations, I think the only witness that opposed the idea was ATSIC, but even—

         —ATSIC was one of the witnesses. There were 243 others, including Noel Pearson. In answer to what was probably a dorothy dixer from the chair of the committee, Noel Pearson said, `You'd be a mug not to agree to this.' Quite frankly, if the best argument you can create is that because parliament appropriates the money for administration, that interferes with the self-determination of the organisation, I think honourable senators would be mugs not to support this amendment.

Frankly, I think this suffers from the same problems from which the initial drafting of (b), (c), (d) and (e) suffered. Two amounts are referred to, one of which is being appropriated indirectly through the medium of a draw down from the land fund, which is the subject of extraction from consolidated revenue. In the same clause, you have reference to an appropriation directly from consolidated revenue. The language of the drafting may not be sufficient to reflect that distinction. I draw that to your attention, but this is not the final word we are going to have on this. I am sure the two of you will cheerfully embrace this language, and you are welcome to it.

         On the day the committee report was tabled, I did canvass what will happen to the bill, subject to how the government responds to it. I made it clear that there are two or three alternatives. One is that the amendments be insisted upon when returned from the House of Representatives, which is something I expect would and will happen. The second is that, ultimately, if these amendments to the legislation were never made, the only hope those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would have of achieving control of their own land, in the terms of the amendments moved by the coalition and supported by the Senate, would be, indeed, with the election of a Liberal or coalition government at the next election.

That related to trying to find out if native title existed before land was purchased. That has now, through some horse-trading on the floor of the Senate, been agreed.

The coalition and the senators who supported the amendment believe that to prescribe that only corporations should hold the land is unnecessarily proscriptive and rules out a whole range of other legal entities that could emerge for Aboriginal land ownership.

         We heard much evidence in the committee hearings that the corporate structure, although it is culturally relevant in some cases, is entirely culturally irrelevant in others—and the Torres Strait Islander people were one particular example. But there is a range of other Aboriginal people who will continue to be dispossessed because of the wording of the clause in the original bill without amendment. It does not mean that the ILC is forced to grant land to other legal entities; it just means that it has the flexibility to say that there is a whole range of other legal entities that could be granted land. That, I think, is desirable. It actually increases the flexibility of the ILC and meets the government's own principles in relation to that.

         Effectively, all that amendment No. 25 does—that is the so-called health, housing and education amendment—is to broaden the things that the ILC should take into account when granting land. We should read very carefully the transcript of the Prime Minister's speech to Hopevale last Friday on what was, until he got there, a secret visit—because I spoke to a few people in Hopevale on the morning the Prime Minister was arriving there, and most of them did not even know he was coming. But let us not be too political about that because at Hopevale, the Prime Minister—if we can get through all the waffly aspects of his speech—indeed, gave true recognition to the fact that health, housing and education are important consequences of assisting Aboriginal people to buy land.

         I do not think the government has ever contested that. It says that there should be some sort of strict delineation, and that this bill should only talk about land and not about other things. But, of course, the bill does talk about other things; it talks about cultural, environmental and other benefits that can flow from owning land. If we want a most—I will not say `articulate' because that is not fair to other people—thorough support for the position that health benefits can flow from the ownership of land, then I recommend to the people of Australia a reading of the transcript of Mr Keating's speech in Hopevale. He very effectively links health with ownership of land in, I think, the same way that Senator Lees referred to spirit sickness and the fact that, when people are alienated and cut off from traditional lands and their source of cultural, spiritual and traditional enrichment, their health can suffer—and the coalition recognises that.

I then move to amendment No. 32, which is the disposal of the land.

         The cold hard reality is that the ILC will make the decisions about who it grants the land to. It will decide whether to grant it to a corporation, to a trust or to some other legal structure. The effect of our amendment is to ensure that the people who are granted the land have some ultimate control over what happens to that land. That is the thrust of all of our amendments. The government says that amendment 32 will allow the land to be sold frivolously and for individual profit, but that is not what is intended, nor what would happen in reality.

         Ultimately—and we were given evidence all around Australia to this effect—in some circumstances land should be able to be sold readily so that the communities can take advantage of other opportunities that might present themselves. On the other hand, many Aboriginals said, `We do need to protect land that has cultural or traditional significance to us.' Amendment 32 does nothing to stop that from happening. All it does is put the control over that decision making into the hands of the Aboriginal landholders, into the hands of the community and into the hands of Aboriginal people, as opposed to being in the hands of a Canberra bureaucracy.

We were convinced by the evidence that that should be changed to those people with historic and traditional links to the land.

There is a feeling that Aboriginal people are not listened to, that they are not spoken to, that they are not consulted with and that they are not part of the process.

These are things that I believe are extremely workable. I do not believe the government's arguments that they are unworkable.

         When I spoke last by way of wrap-up in this debate back on 16 November, I identified what I described as the seven deadly sins in this legislation—seven factors about the bill, as a result of the opposition and Green amendments, which make the bill indefensible in principle, unworkable in practice or both. As a result of the further four hours of debate we have had today, a couple of those concerns have been marginally ameliorated but not to the extent of removing the sin in question from that particular description. They do remain sins because for one reason or another they create a bill that is indefensible in principle, unworkable in practice or both. Let me quickly indicate again those major concerns, which are points of absolutely no return so far as the government is concerned.

         Sin No. 1 is the requirement that the ILC give priority now to those who suffer most disadvantage. True it is that is a little bit better than the previous reference to `most dispossessed' from one point of view. But, as I pointed out at great length in the earlier debate—I will not repeat it now—that is likely to cause very significant conflict in the indigenous community as to who satisfies this description. It opens up the ILC to legal challenge about who actually satisfies these criteria. It is administratively a nightmare in terms of the demands that it will create for some kind of calibration of competing claims.

         Sin No. 2—and it is one that has not been addressed in any way, shape or form by the opposition or the process it is so proud of, the committee—is the reference to grants to individuals and trustees being possible. That is absolutely wrong in principle as far as we are concerned and as far as, we believe, the majority of Aboriginal people in this country are concerned. It is contrary to the whole aim of the land fund, which is to provide communal benefits. It is contrary to traditional indigenous land holding practices. It has the incidental operational disadvantage of reducing accountability; but the basic problem is the one of principle.

         The third sin is the requirement that grants of land have regard to health, housing and so on. That is contrary, as we have said, in principle to the purpose of the land fund, which is to provide land as a basis for the wellbeing of indigenous people. It is not intended to address what are absolutely legitimate but quite distinct objectives of other programs—other programs which are not the responsibility of the ILC. Requiring the ILC to have regard to the implications of these sorts of factors—health, housing, education and so on—when it is making grants of land is again, we believe, to make this particular proposal very difficult to apply in practice and to open up, again, the administration of the corporation to challenge and to many practical difficulties.

         The fourth deadly sin is the requirement—altered to some extent today, but not in such a way as to get rid of the basic problem—for the ILC to consult, before acquiring land, those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional links or historic links to the land in question. On the face of it, it is not a unreasonable aspiration, but one that in practice will, we believe, simply be quite unworkable—leading to conflict as to who precisely satisfies the description, certainly generating extensive delays while people are identified and consulted, and certainly creating not only the possibility of inhibitions on the ILC's capacity to operate effectively commercially, but also exposure to litigation and all sorts of practical difficulties to the point of making the corporation, with this provision alone, quite unworkable.

         The fifth sin goes to the business about administrative expenses. It is not a cap in quite the same direct terms that was originally proposed. It is a different sort of provision requiring a separate appropriation at what will, in effect, year by year, be a capped level for administrative expenses. We believe that is offensive in principle to the extent that it imposes an unprecedented paternalistic restriction on a statutory authority. We ought to have confidence in the boards to do what we appoint them to do and it will create—

That is another furphy you were determined to promote earlier on by implication and it is one that needs to be directly replied to, as I now do. ATSIC is the subject of an annual appropriation, but it is not the subject of any restriction—direct or indirect—on what part of that appropriation it can apply to administrative expenses. That reflects the reality that there does need to be flexibility if any operation is to be workable in practice. You have the further problem of being a prisoner of annual appropriations by the parliament and top-up appropriations in the event that unforseen—albeit perhaps perfectly defensible—additional expenditure is required to be made.

         Sin No. 6—and it is an important one again, a deadly one—is the removal of the ILC power to control effectively the disposal of land. That is absolutely indefensible in principle because it would lead dramatically and, we believe, inexorably to the diminution of the indigenous land base, the erosion of the land base which is the whole purpose of this legislation to create. There are some gigantic accountability problems associated here with expenditure of public moneys. You are talking about potentially making very large sums of public money available simply to support private individual acquisitions of land which can then be freely traded, and utterly miss the point, which is to create a new permanent land base for Aboriginal people to be enjoyed on a communal title basis.

In addition to that there are several what I might describe as venial sins, if Senator Harradine will forgive me for this foray into what has previously been his domain in this chamber. I would describe venial sin No. 1 as that going to the requirement for the ATSIC chairperson identified by official designation to be removed. That requirement, which is there in the original bill, for the ATSIC person to be there would no longer be there and there would be only one ATSIC commissioner on the board rather than two.

That reflects merely a political agenda rather than a legitimate practical one so far as the opposition is concerned. Senator Campbell has made perfectly clear what he thinks about ATSIC on multiple occasions. We will not get into that debate now, but he is not its biggest fan.

         —You have become a statesman in your old age after all. Amendment 27, I think, constitutes what I describe as the second venial sin, and that is the business about the ILC pursuing a policy of not retaining any interest in a parcel of land which it has granted. I perhaps should say a word about this, because we have not addressed this is in the course of these current debates. It is certainly the general intention that the ILC would not, at the time of granting land, retain an interest by granting some lesser interest such as a lease where the ILC has acquired a full interest.

         However, it was always the government's intention that it should be possible for the ILC to later take out an interest in land that it had granted in order to assist land holders to manage their land. For example, it might retain a leasehold interest in return for managing the land on behalf of the owners. There might be other commercial situations of that kind. It is not a major inhibition on the operation of the ILC. It is in the realm of the venial rather than the mortal; nonetheless, it is an inhibition on the effective operation.

         Finally, there is amendment 63, which I described as venial sin No. 3, which goes to the ILC annual report. The bill already requires detailed information on the operations of the land fund to be provided to parliament. This really is a provision which would enable the parliament, or some opposition so minded that happened to have a working majority in one house, to impose obligations upon the land fund and the ILC which are really beyond that which is necessary to ensure full accountability. We made these points in the course of the general debate and made all of them, at one point or another, at much greater length than I have done in this third reading reply.

We are not playing games in order to use this bill to pursue other political objectives. We want a bill that works. We want a bill that is effective. We want a bill that is defensible, I repeat, in principle. We have not got such a bill at the moment. If the Senate nonetheless is minded to give it a third reading, the government will obviously act accordingly in its further consideration of it—beginning with, I have no doubt, a rejection in the House of Representatives of all the amendments to which I have referred today.

We would like to support the bill in some ways. We certainly prefer it to the original unamended bill, but it falls far too short of what we consider to be the minimal requirements. The bill does allow greater self-determination to Aboriginal communities and greater flexibility in their holding and managing of land. It is more explicitly respectful of traditional and historical links with land and the different kinds of disadvantages experienced by all Aboriginal people as the result of white occupation of their land.

         Let us remember that the purpose of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is to set up a structure to facilitate the acquisition of land and its maintenance for indigenous people who do not benefit from native title. Let us leave aside the comments about whether or not the amount of money is adequate. Most of us believe that, in terms of addressing the huge need that is out there, it is not an adequate amount. The Democrats cannot vote for the bill in its amended form, but it is not over whether ATSIC has one or two commissioners on the board or over the renaming of the title of the bill or over the place and function of regional strategies.

We can point to an example in Alaska, I think—certainly in North America—where at the end of a certain number of years no land was left and the whole purpose of the legislation was defeated.

         One thing that worries me about this whole situation, particularly the one that has developed in the last two days, is that it has become highly political. That is the last thing I thought we needed when dealing with this question concerning Aboriginal people. After all, the constitution was changed by an overwhelming vote to give certain powers to this parliament and to recognise the position of Aboriginal people.

         There was the landmark High Court decision in respect of Mabo. People like me, who have had a long history of understanding and support for Aboriginal aspirations, were very pleased with that landmark event. I remind the Senate that, when we came here, one of the first things we did was adopt a resolution in support of Aboriginal people. On that occasion, I quoted Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baurman, an Aboriginal artist in the Daly River, as saying that the period of grieving must give way to a future of joy and inspiration, the period of despair must give way to a future of vital action and the period of grim endurance must turn into a period of vigorous growth. I thought we should be doing just that: setting the stage for vigorous growth.

         One of the saddest reflections of where we are at this time in our society is that the number of Aboriginals employed in Australia is lower now than the number employed in the Great Depression. Admittedly, some who were employed in the Great Depression were employed in slave labour situations, which I am not advocating. However, one thing that will empower Aboriginal people is gaining creative employment. One thing I thought would come out of this ILC is the provision of moneys for the acquisition and management of land that would enable the further employment of Aboriginals in a situation where they would have dignity and control.

         I am very disappointed—I cannot say that the situation is hopeless—with the sorts of attitudes that are now  developing. The best thing for the Senate to do is to adopt the resolution, adopt the third reading and send the legislation back to the House of Representatives. It is noteworthy that fewer people were in the House of Representatives during the committee stage debate—and they had a very poor and short committee stage debate—than were here in the Senate. From time to time a number of honourable senators have come into the chamber. As we know, we have all got other things running concurrently. At present I should be at a meeting of another committee but this, in my view, has taken precedence.

         I would suggest through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Senator Evans listen to what Senator Campbell says. Senator Campbell seems to have come a good way on this. Maybe I have got him wrong, but from what he has stated—and there is some difference about that—the opposition has come a long way on this matter. The government is taking a bureaucratic led attitude which I do not think is appropriate in these circumstances. I feel that we should adopt this legislation having regard to what the opposition has said—that if there is any way that the remaining areas of difficulty can be resolved then let us see it. But do not just use this as a political football, as I believe it has turned into, because of the circumstances of yesterday—introducing another bill into the parliament when we have given the government's bill our due consideration and when we have spent hours doing it. I am not prepared to vote against the third reading.

I am prepared to vote for the third reading in the hope that the legislation will be given proper consideration by the House of Representatives under the benign guidance of the government.

There is absolutely no call for the introduction of this land fund bill mark 2 which we hear about in the other place. I do not believe there is any precedent for such a move. I believe that the process up here has been correct and entirely proper. Senator Harradine asked: has everything we have done in relation to this matter counted for nothing? I do not believe it has and I think history will judge in hindsight that the events which have taken place have been quite proper and in the interests of good management of legislation and representation of the interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country.

No-one can refute the fact that the Senate committee engaged in extensive consultation. Is there any reason why it should not have?

It was from that that we changed some of our amendments and said yes, we were wrong on the most severely dispossessed and yes, we were wrong in one or two other aspects about the way we looked at things. Traditional ownership was not a way to look at it; it was looking at the historical and traditional links of people. We did change our minds. We went to that inquiry with open minds and we reacted on the evidence that we heard, unlike some other people, who said that was a cynical exercise in trying to prolong matters. It was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who said in the other place, `In all the circumstances, with the Senate declining to deal further with the amendments and with the request rejected and returned to it from the House of Representatives, the government considers there has been a failure to pass the bill.' If that is not a political point, I am a Dutchman.

If you think that you had wide consultation on this, then I am afraid you have been on a different planet. There was before this committee repeated evidence as to lack of consultation.

         Two letters were written to people in Darwin, as I recall. One was to the Northern Land Council and one was to the Chief Minister. That was incredible. They were the two letters of consultation that were written to Darwin—the whole city of Darwin, which has a large Aboriginal population, not only in the city itself but in the region it serves. That was what we found in this committee. There was no question of prolonging it. It was dealt with expeditiously. This committee reported, I think, only two days later than the day it was ordered to report. We sat for two solid weeks over the Christmas break and one day prior to Christmas. That is not the action of someone who is procrastinating. It did not prejudice in any way the government or the people whom this legislation is intended to benefit. In fact, it gave them an opportunity to say something, so much so that 244 witnesses were given a chance to say something and place it on the record for history so they could make their mark towards how this bill should be framed.

Senator Harradine referred to the overwhelming support of the Australian population in 1967, which is nearly 30 years ago, to the amendment to subsection 51(xxvi) of the constitution. This ensured that this parliament had the right to make special laws for the people of any race—it took out the words `other than the Aboriginal race'—in any state.

         I understand that the government would regard this as a special measure. We regard those citizenship rights that Senator Kernot is talking about as citizenship rights. The reason we have special measure legislation, both under our constitution and under the international covenants that prescribe these things, is that we require special measures to ensure that some racial or other minority groups actually achieve those citizenship rights. I do not think Senator Kernot would say that most Aboriginals enjoy those citizenship rights. We require a range of special measures, all of which the coalition has supported over the decades and is supporting now, and land is one way of achieving that.

This government, with the support of the Democrats, has not learnt from the mistakes made by the people in America nearly 100 years ago which forced a form of ownership onto people that was not appropriate in all the circumstances.

        The bill will also make consequential amendments to that act and to a number of other acts.

        The agreement was signed on 27 January 1995 and replaces the double tax agreement which was signed on 8 November 1972. As with the earlier agreement this agreement allocates taxing rights over all substantial forms of trans-Tasman income flows.

There is a convention in this place that where people have missed a division through misadventure of some kind or another of a reasonably plausible kind it is allowed for the matter to be put again. I might say that we have all suffered a bit of misadventure in this case. Our misadventure happens to be the absence of Senator Devereux lately of our ranks, who is overseas at the moment, unpaired, and who would unquestionably have been here voting on our side of the equation producing the result we just had. So be it. We have to tolerate that. Equally, we have to bear with such fortitude we can command the likely result of this division now if Senator Teague does take part in it. So we will not stand in the way of the matter being recommitted.

         —The misadventure was that there was a one-minute division bell and some people were not able to get back in time. It was partly our fault because a minister is always under instruction if there is what we call a mickey mouse division, if I can put that on the record, to interrupt debate to make sure it is a four-minute bell so that ministers can get back here. That is the only point I make. The last time this happened there was no graciousness. We moved 12 motions and had a division on every motion to reflect the will of the Senate. I just hope the graciousness that our leader has shown today is repeated when misadventure occurs on other occasions. That is the only point I make.

         —I rise to indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. The bill proposes to provide the classification of publications, films and computer games for the Australian Capital Territory. When this is through, it will form part of a national system for classification and enforcement of these classifications.

         The bill's main purpose is to establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board to administer this particular act. Classification decisions are to be made in accordance with the national classification code which is set out in the bill and guidelines to help apply this code. The bill does give effect to community concern about X and R rated material on computer, video and film. Overall, this bill is a triumph, I think, for cooperative federalism on the regulation of material that can harm and disturb.

         This country has, I believe, one of the best censorship systems in the world and I think it is regarded that way. It began in the early 1970s and very early on it was set up to balance what are perhaps two conflicting principles; that is, the rights of adults to see material they want to see and obviously the right of children to be protected. The conflict between these principles I believe overall has been resolved in a reasonably satisfactory way in regard to the public exhibition of material, particularly in cinemas, particularly with the application of the R classification.

         We have considerable concern about the way in which this material is in the video stores; the way in which that, in turn, has got into the hands of minors, and there is widespread evidence of that; the way it has affected the Aboriginal communities, particularly in the Northern Territory, in very unfortunate ways, and we have had evidence before the community standards committee of that; and the way in which paedophiles have used the material for seduction and the unfortunate effects of that on society. But we now have a national approach and we have seen evidence, particularly over the last two years, of a considerable amount of cooperation between state and federal Attorneys-General in the way in which this act or the whole area of censorship is to be administered in this country.

         We have, as a committee on community standards, made a number of recommendations to the government on additional reforms apart from what is here at the moment. I think it is very unfortunate that the government has not taken up those particular reforms and the committee has once again urged that the reforms initially put forward in the computer games area a little over a year ago and now restated in our latest report on film classification be adopted.

          Salo
         </emphasis>
         came into this country. It is a horrific film. It has been banned in most countries; it was banned in Australia 17 years ago. But when it came before the OFLC it was initially, by majority decision, decided not to classify it as R, but the Film Review Board overturned that decision. I think this points to the nub of what is still the problem in the censorship area.

         What we have done is set up a system that is not really representative of what the community feels is needed in this area, and we have also taken out some degree of parliamentary scrutiny of the process. In the report of the community standards committee we did recommend that these two things again be put into the legislation initially and, as the government has not done that, we would urge the government to review that decision.

         When I first read this bill I was very disappointed to see that the current structure of censorship pretty much stayed the same. What the committee had recommended was that we have a chief censor and a deputy chief censor who are drawn from the community. The person who is currently the chief censor would become the chief executive officer and he would perform a role something like the head of other statutory authorities in terms of administering that particular area but that the actual final decisions as in a chief censor and a deputy chief censor be drawn from a board that is far more widely representative than the one we have currently.

         On the record in a number of committee hearings I did ask about the representative nature of the present board. It is a great disappointment to me that public servants involved tried to hide the real situation on a number of occasions. We have a board that is highly unrepresentative. If you look at the occupations of the 10 people involved up until the latest change from 20, they include journalists, film critics, teachers, lecturers in media studies, public servants, school counsellors and a fitter. If you want someone perhaps representative of the community, the fitter was probably the closest you will get out of that group. Unfortunately, when the board was reformed and it was to go to 20 people—

         —I am just about to make that point—when the board was to be made up to 20 people the fitter went but there are still not 20 names. We went through the latest report and the board was only up to 11. Again, it was still the same sort of group. I am sure these people are very learned in these matters relating to film but the question is: do they really reflect community standards? When we asked the Attorneys-General offices and the OFLC questions on this from time to time, they claimed that these people, by their own community interaction, form a group that is reflecting community standards. I think that is drawing a pretty long bow.

         What we need to do is set up a wider group, and the committee welcomes the fact that it has gone from 10 to 20. But again, the way in which these people are selected and the types of people who are selected need to be very carefully analysed. They are all very highly academically qualified, but if you had a truly representative cross-section of the community, you would not be using academic qualifications as your first and, I suspect in some ways, only criteria for selection. So we urge that that aspect of the board's work and structure certainly be changed.

         The other thing that we have recommended twice in committee reports—which is still being ignored—is that there should be a community group to review what happens with decisions of this reconstituted board. We recommended that any decisions of the board to do with classification at a particular level which were not unanimous be reviewed by this wider community group. The other part of this was that, when there is disagreement between the OFLC and the film review board, this wider community group review the decision of the board.

         I think that will put in a mechanism which will solve a lot of the problems that we tend to have in this area. Suddenly, in an area that is fairly dynamic and rapidly changing, something happens—such as the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Salo

         case—and the community gets outraged that this has happened. If these structures had been set up in the first place, those sorts of problems would not have happened. Part of the art of government is getting your structures right so you do not have to constantly set up committees and have inquiries and reviews. If you get the structure right in the first place, you stop that sort of thing.

         The other thing that still disturbs us about this area is the lack of parliamentary scrutiny. It seemed very difficult to get information at times. A lot of the key information was tucked away in the back of reports; it does not come within the purview and scrutiny of the parliament. We have recommended, particularly when there are changes to the way in which we conduct the codes and review processes, that those changes actually lay on the table of both the state and federal parliaments, thus allowing parliamentarians to scrutinise the system.

         Probably the most disturbing shortcoming of the system at the moment—and I really urge the OFLC to be more diligent in its approach to this—is the lack of consistency between state and federal procedures and, indeed, legislative bases. This was highlighted most dramatically recently by a case in Victoria. An adult chain called Club X was raided by the vice squad and a whole range of illegal videos were seized. The point of the story is that they got off scot-free on this because the Victorian Labor government in the 1980s had not kept up the definitions in the act to take into account newer technologies. The act talked about film. I note in the federal act that film is defined to include video, but this obviously was not the case in Victoria.

This is important because this company was completely flouting the censorship rules in this country. They had videos on the shelves that were seized by the police, and this is documented by the police and the story has been written up in the press. They had material that would have certainly been banned by the OFLC had it been classified.

         The police seized thousands of tapes, along with invoices and documents. They took this material away, worked out their case to prosecute this group and went to court. A lawyer for the adult shops discovered a loophole in that the Victorian government had not changed the act to take into account the changes to the type of technology. Video is a series of electronic dots—it is not film technically—and it was not included in the definition. The judge threw out the case, restored all the films to these video shops and awarded them $200,000 in compensation.

         That shows that we can have a system that does not have proper scrutiny because the Public Service is not exercising due diligence to see that there is consistency between a state and federal act. It is not a big job. All you have to do is go to the front of the act and look at the definition. If you looked at the definition of the federal act and the definition of the state act, you would see that they did not line up. That is the problem.

         The community standards committee that reported on this bill was set up four years ago, in 1991, to do one job, which was going to take about three months. What we discovered were these sorts of loopholes in the system that I mentioned. In particular, areas of the Public Service—particularly, in that case, Telecom—were not exercising due diligence. As time went on—and we were looking at fantasy phone calls at that stage—we discovered a whole range of other problems in the system. Four years later, it is coming up again and again. There are further problems in the system. The latest one we have heard of is that we could have shown on pay TV live tape from road accidents and police sieges, fed straight through into TV sets. Normally, all the film goes into a television studio. It is edited—obviously following certain guidelines, such as the FACTS code—and then a snippet which is not too offensive is shown that night. Under this scenario direct footage will be allowed to go straight through to the screens of pay TV viewers. We can imagine some of the horrific scenes, dealing with road accidents, police sieges and other disasters. Small children can see this if, as we discovered—particularly with the overseas experience—the decoding devices are not effective in preventing a proportion of children seeing this sort of material. So this is of great concern to the committee.

         Obviously, bulletin boards are also a huge problem, and this is the next challenge for the committee. I am reminded very much of the advice of a very experienced staffer I had when four years ago I first got on this committee.

This should be contrasted with evidence given to the committee during its public hearings where community groups requested a tenure period of two years. We have a situation where we currently have a maximum tenure period of six years, the community wants a tenure period of two years—and the government has extended it to seven, thereby increasing the capacity for members of this board to be desensitised and make false judgments about what ought and ought not to be available on television and other communications media.

         The other point which I want to make concerns the amendment to this bill which excludes from the definition of `computer game' material on computer bulletin boards. The omission of paragraph (a) and thus the exclusion, it is stated, will enable the classification board to classify computer games on computer bulletin boards if there is some requirement to do so under other Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. Attorney-General Lavarch, in reply to a question on 12 October 1994, said that part of the reason for this exclusion was that:

         A further argument which has been used for this exclusion is that the percentage of the Australian population who access the international computer network via a modem is currently only four per cent.

However, in Australia, there are currently some 500,000 Internet users, and the Internet is the fastest growing telecommunications network globally.

         The danger for our children, many of whom are much more computer literate than their parents, is simply that by using a personal computer connected to the Internet they can gain access to specific pornographic bulletin board services such as Kinknet and Throbnet, often without the knowledge or permission of their parents. Pirated software and sexually  explicit material, including interactive adult games and entire libraries of X-rated pictures, apparently can be found on some bulletin boards.

         The United States decided that cryptography is acceptable provided that it held the keys to a trapdoor in every system and sponsored a computer chip called `clipper' as an industry standard. Industry experts tried and failed to crack the clipper and it had been declared safe. However, recently it took a cryptography expert only 28 minutes on a common workstation to render the trapdoor unusable. The dual issues of privacy and censorship are not easily reconciled, but I urge the government not to rest on its laurels in relation to computer bulletin boards classification. This issue has been and is being addressed by other governments. Given the Attorney-General's acknowledgment that Australia is the second largest user of the Internet, perhaps the time has come for a more detailed consideration of this issue.

This bill seeks to implement recommendations from a 1991 report of the Law Reform Commission on the feasibility of establishing a national scheme covering films and publication classifications, and it recommends that there should be a rationalisation of state laws to create a national scheme. The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies has also looked into the matter, urging in 1993 that computer games and videos be brought under the national censorship system.

         I wish to raise four particular points at this point. The first one is not dealt with in this present legislation but it relates to the matter under our consideration at this time, and that is the repeated suggestions that the non-violent erotica classification should replace the X classification. The X classification has led to a misconception in the community that such films contain extremes of violence and sexual violence and illegal sexual behaviour, like child pornography. At the same time the X category currently allows material with certain activities which may be inconsistent with community standards, such as aggressive behaviour, demeaning sexual dialogue or sadomasochism.

         —Senator Harradine has quite helpfully pointed out that it is not simply violence or sexual violence that we are concerned about but demeaning behaviour. I think that this is one of the strongest arguments for replacing the X classification with a classification which specifies that there is to be no non-violent erotica and removes those demeaning components—demeaning sexual dialogue, sadomasochism or aggressive behaviour. My view regarding this is that it is indisputable that there is a very popular perception within the community that non-violent erotica should be available to adults—not children but adults.

         I also cite the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It announced that in some polling there was strong support—70 per cent—for X classified material containing scenes of actual sex between consenting adults being made available to adults, with video being the preferred medium. Whether or not that is a situation which I might agree or disagree with, I do not think any of us can fail to note that the popularity of such material and its current availability under the X classification mean that unduly demeaning and violent material is available.

         Also, a black market has arisen where material is available that would have been refused if it had been submitted for classification under the non-violent erotica category. I believe the police and enforcement agencies need to concentrate on the more extreme material and work together to promote a freedom from those kinds of rackets.

         We have the anomaly that, because the ACT and the Northern Territory have X-rated videos available in restricted areas only, mail order black market rackets can occur. I ask for greater consideration of the issue that it may be better to relabel or reclassify material as non-violent erotica with some modification to the guidelines and also of the issue of improving the age of participants to be 18 or over. This would allow us to have, I believe, a more realistic adjustment to both the demands for this material in the community and a control over what is made available or floating around Australia.

         The classification of material should reflect community standards. It is clear that the majority of people would like to see non-violent erotica available to adults even though they may not wish to obtain it themselves. What should be of greater concern is the level of extreme violence in films, videos and computer games as well as the sexual content of computer games. Computer games in particular—which are interactive, intensive and repetitive—have the potential to adversely influence the minds of young people and should come under increasing scrutiny.

         The second point I wish to raise is that, if we were to have non-violent erotica classification for films, that classification and the R classification should carry health education messages that allow people not only to learn from the materials that they are seeing and to counteract both the violence and the demeaning behaviour contained in films but also to promote a healthier approach to sexual material.

         The third point I raise is that classification costs at the moment are inequitable. The current position is that the fee for classification is based on the duration of films alone. That is inequitable because it has no regard to the nature of films and the extent of their distribution, nor the cost or the likely profits to be earned. So what we may have is an art film with very limited distribution having the same fee requirement as a blockbuster film which has wider screening and generates large profits. The fee structure for classification of films should, I believe, reflect the diversity of films and their different types of audiences.

         Finally, I wish to comment on an aspect of this bill which I believe is very important, and that is providing for the independence of board members. I believe that it can be stated that in more recent times board members have become engaged in policy making and advisory roles to the minister. This has the potential to erode the independence of board members in their primary role of classification. It raises the possibility of political pressure being applied on future classification decisions. That is an undesirable state of affairs.

         We certainly support the fact that the director should be the only person taking on a Public Service role, as recommended by the Senate committee. The limited tenure of such a position is also valuable because it allows a rotation of office and also a capacity to be more responsive to community needs and views. In conclusion, I understand this bill has the support of the Senate. I put on record these matters, which may receive consideration at a later date.

         The Joint Select Committee on Video Material indicated that much of the X-rated material treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its targeted audience and reduces persons to objects or occasions of sexual pleasure. It also in many cases deals with sexual harassment situations which would in fact have the condemnation of all. I am sure Senator Chamarette was not referring to that type of X-rated material.

        This annual report is an interesting report, because the work of the IMF is one of the things that are surrounded by mystery for most people. I must admit that, on reading the report of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), one is not necessarily that much enlightened on the operations of the IMF at the end of the perusal of the document. It is interesting, though, to note some of the things that the IMF has been doing. In particular it has been providing advice to a number of countries to deal with problems of adjustment, principally problems to do with growth, although there are some countries that have had more difficult problems than that. For example, the IMF has provided assistance in terms of advising Germany on how to handle recovery and advising the Chinese government in relation to issues of growth.

         The IMF also assists countries in transition. I would like to make some comments about the situation in Vietnam and Cambodia. I suppose I should preface those remarks by making the comment that it is easy for the IMF to give advice; the difficult thing is to persuade the people of a country to necessarily follow the advice. One of the observations I made at the end of the 1980s dealing with Latin America was that there were remedies for the Latin American crisis, but the question was whether people were going to accept those remedies. Countries that are in transition, such as Vietnam, require a certain degree of political courage, inasmuch as governments have to make decisions which are politically difficult. It then follows that you also need a certain degree of courage and willingness to cooperate from the community at large. That is just as difficult.

         Countries such as Vietnam are coming to realise that the years of communist rule were wasted years in terms of economic advancement and that communist countries across the world, it does not matter where they are, have been shown at the end of the Cold War to be economically backward. In comparing them with other countries that were in a similar stage of development at the beginning of the Cold War, it is shown very clearly that communism has failed. The socialist experiment was a failure; yet these governments often require some degree of encouragement to accept that and to accept that it is time to embark on a more liberal economic course than the one which has been in use in these countries for so long.

         Having said that, the difficulty, and it is a difficulty which is being experienced and observed in Eastern Europe as much as anywhere else, is that the people who have for so long lived in an economic system which was a fiction—nobody can say otherwise that the economic system in Eastern Europe was a fiction—have a lot of difficulty adjusting to economic reality because, in many cases, economic reality brings substantial pain. The longer a country has been a communist country, the harder it is for it to break out of the economic fiction. That is why we find in some eastern European countries a resurgence of people saying, `We should have a communist government.' Those people are dreaming of a time which can never come back and which never really existed in the first place.

         At the end of the day, the willingness of people to change quickly is the key determinant. If people are wanting to compromise change in these countries, then the process of change becomes much slower and it entails much more pain. I hope that we will see substantial change in countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia. Cambodia, of course, also has political problems. There are other countries in the region which have been subject to governments of less than satisfactory economic persuasion. We hope, too, that changes will occur there, just as we hope changes in human rights will occur. When we talk about human rights, one of the biggest factors in deciding whether a country enjoys full and proper human rights is the level of its economic self-sufficiency and the standard of living enjoyed by the people. Obviously, when they have a higher standard of living, they put more of a price and value on human life. That is something we should all look forward to.

         We have the IMF presented as a major tool in helping countries develop, yet Australia's representation to the IMF is still under control of the Treasurer, who may be interested in seeing increased economic activity but is singularly uninterested in equity, sustainability or most legitimate goals of the wider community both in Australia and globally. As such, I guess we show ourselves as being quite different in our opinion of the benefits of taking IMF advice from what was given just then by Senator O'Chee.

         As a high point, last November, at the 50-year anniversary of the World Bank, formed at the same time as the IMF, Michel Cadessus, managing director of the IMF, heavily criticised national minimum wage and condition regulation, unemployment support programs and restrictions on lay-offs and the dismissal of workers. The elimination of these things are liable to be included among the social policies the IMF uses its power to impose, along with a reduction of social infrastructure. The World Bank also seeks to impose such structural adjustment as a condition for its assistance. It was also revealed in Madrid that the World Bank receives more money from developing nations than it gives—so much for developing nations needing the World Bank to improve their position. These are good reasons to question the role and continued existence of these institutions.

         In regard to Australia's role in the IMF, the Treasurer, Mr Willis, said at the same meeting that no measures should be taken to integrate environmental or labour standards into trade. The IMF not only tends to be a fundamental economic decision maker on the global stage but also has the ability—and uses it—to erode national measures in countries that borrow, imposing draconian `structural adjustment' policies on subject nations. Just think about it: when the economies are good, it says, `Cut government spending,' and when the economies are bad, it says—surprise, surprise!—`Cut government spending.'

         The IMF and, indeed, other institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank where the Treasurer is our representative have been heavily criticised by the non-government international development community for these programs. Most recently there has been a strong campaign to end these institutions as counterproductive to genuine, equitable and sustainable development. When the purpose of Australian support for these institutions has been questioned, Australian representatives, especially from development and aid divisions within Foreign Affairs, often answer that they should not be ended, that `we' need to work within and to make them more green and more just.

         It appears, however, that the Treasurer and, through Treasury, the Australian people are working in exactly the opposite direction. We are working to ensure that nations have austerity programs imposed on them, to ensure that social services, basic health and education services, provision of clean water and so on are cut in order to pay for debt often imposed to pay for poorly conceived and heavily prescribed development programs advocated by these same agencies. At the same time, it is demanded that they open their economy to foreign investors anxious to exploit rather than to build and to foreign imports such as cars and alcohol which do nothing to increase productivity, and that they lift capital flow controls and so assist capital flight. This is structural adjustment.

         I note on page 27 of the report in the section on the enhanced structural adjustment facility that there has been increasing recognition of `the importance of addressing social issues'. This is whitewash. As the statement of the managing director to whom I referred earlier indicates, the IMF is not interested in social safety nets. It is a smokescreen to deflect critics of the IMF. While the moves towards increased social responsibility are to be applauded, they are likely to be too little too late.

         The IMF was created to regulate currency exchange. It was created after World War II to avoid the disastrous speculation that followed World War I. Its effective role ended with the floating of most currencies in the period around 1980. The IMF has not achieved the purpose it was designed for. It is not doing wonderful things to assist development in those nations which need it most. Whilst it is possible that the IMF might have done an Ebenezer Scrooge type transformation if the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future visited it since the Madrid meeting, I believe it is time to consider whether the IMF still has a role to play in today's world.

        This report from NBEET and its Australian Research Council monitors the progress of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University and checks that targets are met for collaborative activities with other universities. The Australian National University, in particular its Institute of Advanced Studies, is one of the great institutions of this country. It is a research body which attracts world-class scholars and which produces world-class results. It has in its ranks a number of Nobel Prize winners and Nobel Prize nominees. It is an institution which was started in the 1950s. It is one of the great achievements of the Menzies era. The institution developed initially under the guidance of Howard Florey. Since that time it has developed a wide range of research schools which are constituent to the Institute of Advanced Studies.

         Over a number of years reviews of that school have been undertaken. In 1990 the Stephens review discovered that the institute had fallen off the pace somewhat on one of its key roles, which was to act as a breeding ground for researchers and people who would move into research in other universities. The Stephens review also found that the institute had fallen off the pace with respect to collaborative research projects. The review had established a number of guidelines and targets with respect to collaborative research for the institute to meet. This report shows that the institute is on target to meet the percentage of the budget allocated to collaborative research projects by the Stephens committee.

         Honourable senators will recall that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training did carry out an investigation into the Stephens committee report. We did find the report wanting in many ways. It was particularly unfortunate that the Stephens review found that the government had attempted to carve up the Institute of Advanced Studies. There was an attempt back in 1991 that partially succeeded in moving the John Curtin School of Medical Research out of the Institute of Advanced Studies. In the end, the finance of the school was moved from the DEET budget to the health budget. Our committee, after conducting an extensive hearing, found that that should not have happened. It should have stayed as part of the Institute of Advanced Studies.

         One of the great strengths of the institute is that it has a number of constituent schools which interact with each other. For example, people in the biological sciences school interact very much with the people in the medical school. The administration of the school's funding is hampered by having two government departments involved. It is something which we hope the government will revisit some time. The last time I checked, the university was not very happy with this arrangement.

         At the time we thought it was part of a plan by the government to dismantle the institute. Some people thought that the time for this sort of institution had passed. Under the Dawkins grand, unified national system, the idea was to create universities that looked as alike as possible. The Institute of Advanced Studies sat oddly in that scheme of things. It was an institution that was totally devoted to research; it was totally devoted to excellence. It was not in the pattern of the other universities. We all suspected that Mr Dawkins really did not want it there. But it has survived, and indeed thrived, following the Dawkins years. This report is testimony to that.

         I wish to raise one small criticism about the distribution of collaborative research monies. It is still focussing very much on four of the big seven universities. Over 40 per cent of the funds go to those universities. The money really needs to be distributed across a wider range of universities. The collaborative work and the excellence that come out of that need to be distributed. That will be of great benefit to a wide range of universities. I commend the report to the Senate and wish the Institute of Advanced Studies well in its pursuit of excellence.

        In court proceedings (not involving criminal charges for drugs) an assertion was made that one of the families was involved in drugs. However firstly this did not refer to my family.

         It is intriguing that someone would assert that these entities only have been involved—Mr Tigani and his wife as principals and no-one else—and that Mr Francesco Labozzetta has never been involved in Sea Air Travel. I have here under the business names act an application for registration of the business name of Sea Air Travel Service of 403 Grange Road. The applicants as shown on this form, which is dated 22 May 1969, are Francesco Tigani, who has written me this charming letter, and Francesco Nocola Labozzetta, who, according to Mr Tigani, does not exist in South Australia, has never existed and has never been in partnership with Mr Francesco Tigani.

         I presume that this is the same Francesco Tigani who wrote the letter. Obviously, he has had some incredible memory lapse. Not only that, we have a statement regarding a change of persons in relation to whom the business name is registered. The business involved is Sea Air Travel Service of 403 Grange Road. On 5 June 1972, certain persons ceased to carry on business under that business name. As I have properly said, Francesco Nocola Labozzetta then ceased. Unless my mathematics are appalling, 1969 to 1972 is three years. I asserted that Mr Francesco Labozzetta had been involved in this business for three years. Perhaps Mr Tigani cannot count as well as having a bad memory. It is extraordinary that people write this kind of nonsense when the facts are self-evident.

         What is also extraordinary to me is that Mr Antonio Labozzetta, in some newspaper articles and on a television appearance, claimed how he wrote to the President, as I recall it, denying that he had any association or involvement with Sea Air Travel in South Australia. He said that, once again, that terrible fellow Baume was disgraceful in suggesting that he would be involved with this business, the Tigani family or whoever is involved in the NCA report—I commend it to Mr Tigani if he has forgotten about it—for 1990-91. As you are well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that report deals with the remarkable story of these families and the extent to which the various members of them were prosecuted. Some people say that the penalty did not fit the crime; others do not. They were prosecuted in respect of various tax matters relating to the remarkable way that they appeared to earn money which did not appear to relate to their stated businesses. I think that is a polite way of dealing with the matter.

        which is the company I referred to earlier this week when I dealt with the annual report of the Australian Soccer Federation. In that instance, I told the chamber that the annual report of the Soccer Federation revealed that something like $240,000 in travel business had gone to this company in the normal course of business by the Australian Soccer Federation while Mr Tony Labozzetta was a commissioner or director of the Australian Soccer Federation. I said that I thought that was not a terribly wise thing to do, irrespective of whether it was in the normal course of business, because there is the clear potential for a conflict of interests.

         In this advertisement, there is a special tour. One has to get in while one can; it costs only $5,490. It says that those who want to deal with this matter who are in South Australia should contact Sea Air Travel. The phone number for those interested in dealing with the Tigani family is (08) 356 3266. It strikes me as extraordinary that there is no link whatsoever and that gratuitously the Labozzetta brothers would promote in their own advertisements this company with which they have no associations and with which they have never been involved. I suppose one could say that at least they are not promoting another travel company owned by Francesco Nocola Labozzetta, which also exists in Sydney. I am just intrigued that the travel agency business is such an interesting one for such an interesting group of people to be so heavily involved in it.

Furthermore, I express my distress that when inquiries were made of the South Australian Soccer Federation about how one should book to go to the World Cup in America it referred people to Sea Air Travel. I wonder why the South Australian Soccer Federation would have any such links with this organisation in view of the background, which can be demonstrated by looking at the NCA reports, of its principals and their capacity to write such nonsensical letters which are simply false in every material fact. I seek leave to table the advertisements and the letter.

         I take this opportunity tonight to pay tribute to John Hewson's service to his party, this parliament and the people of Australia. As the Labor Party would acknowledge, it is an enormous achievement to lead one of the two major parties of this country at federal level. It is an achievement to lead what is, in my view, the greatest and most successful party of Australia—the Liberal Party of Australia. John did that for the third longest period after Menzies and Fraser; he led it for over four years. That achievement will always stand John Hewson in good stead and will always be remembered.

         The Liberal Party exhibited an extraordinary degree of unity and sense of purpose under the first three years of John Hewson's leadership. Everybody in the party acknowledges that after the 1980s, when the party had some difficulties, there is much to be said for the incredible esprit de corps, sense of purpose and unity that existed between 1990 and 1993 under John's very strong, dedicated and disciplined leadership.

         I have some personal relations with John in the sense that I was flattered and honoured to be invited by John to be his chief of staff when he first became leader in March of 1990. It is a phone call I will long remember—the difficulty I had in saying that I had at that point decided to stay in South Australia and seek Liberal preselection for the Senate, and was therefore not in a position to accept what I regarded as the great honour it would have been to be his chief of staff.

With all due modesty I am not sure that I could have done anything about what eventually happened in 1993, but it is odd to reflect on what might have happened if I had taken that job. I decided to stay in South Australia, seek Liberal preselection and run the federal campaign in South Australia for the 1993 election. I did that with great pleasure, working very closely and campaigning with John. The result in South Australia did prove that Fightback was saleable. It is said now that it was a totally unsaleable document, yet we had the best result in South Australia federally for 20 years.

There is absolutely no doubt that Australia would be in much better shape if he had won that election and if he were now Prime Minister. Every Australian would be much better off. It is ironic that today we have had another reminder of that with another disastrous set of balance of payments figures. The election in 1993 was a disaster for Australia, brought about by the appalling campaign run by the Labor Party. For it now to complain about certain tactics in Canberra is the ultimate in hypocrisy.

         I personally regret that John and I had something of a falling out after the 1993 election. I formed the honest and objective view that it was in John's best interests to resign the leadership of the party—to stay in parliament but to resign from the leadership because he had won the position and achieved his position in politics as the champion of a set of beliefs. I honestly thought he should resign the leadership to continue championing those beliefs, and he could not do that as leader of a party that had just lost an election under his leadership. So I thought it was in his best interests to resign from the leadership. He happened not to agree with that and as a result was not all that pleased with me.

         In concluding I want to congratulate John honestly and sincerely and as much as I can on his achievements in politics. He achieved much more than most of us ever will in politics in a very short time. He did make an enormous contribution to the party. He did wake Australia up to the kinds of economic reforms that are needed in this country. While Labor remains in office for at most another 12 months I hope it will pursue an economic reform agenda. Most of Fightback will ultimately be implemented in Australia one way or another and in time. I particularly want to congratulate John on the quality and dignity of his resignation speech. It was a great speech and one that will long be remembered. I honestly believe it is a tragedy that he is not currently Prime Minister.

This reality is badly contrary to the plan/policy of UNHCR and the Indonesian government. It is a serious obstacle to repatriation programme.

         It is not my grammar because it is a direct quote from the letter. I read that letter into the record because I was greatly distressed when that letter was brought to my attention when I was in Galang. The unfortunate circumstance on that island at the moment is that all the people who are held there have been screened out as refugees. They are not eligible to take up the offer of sponsorship.

          It is unfortunate that there are people in Australia who are giving false hope to those people who remain on the island. This has caused a lot of distress on the island. The people there see that they have yet another chance to resettle in a third country, but, of course, that opportunity is not there. Australia is not able to help. Australia has done an enormous job in resettling boat people from many parts of the south-east Asian region. Those people are leading very productive lives in this country. Unfortunately, many of their colleagues continue to vegetate in refugee camps in South East Asia.

          It concerns me that organisations, such as the one that  this letter was addressed to, ought to know better. They should not be giving hope to those people when that will not be fulfilled in the end. It reflects badly on organisations if they go ahead and give false hope to people who feel that they are in dire circumstances. I urge that no more letters of sponsorship be sent to Galang island because no-one else can be repatriated to Australia.

         John Hewson and I have a connection. He married his second wife and I married my wife in the same church—the Gartrell Memorial Church in Adelaide. I married in that church in 1970. The reason I married in the Gartrell Methodist Church, as it then was, was that my best man's name was Gartrell. It seemed as good a church as any to be married in. I understand Carolyn chose the church because it was the local church where she grew up. That is the only social connection we have other than both he and I were elected at the 1987 election. The only other thing that I can think of that we have in common is that for a short period when he was shadow minister for customs—in May, June and July of last year, before he was dismissed from the frontbench—I attempted to speak to him on a couple of occasions about customs issues and was not able to make the connection.

         I think it is appropriate that a couple of remarks be made about John Hewson's career. From our side of politics, we believe that he made a classic political mistake, and economic mistake in the circumstances, by proposing the GST which was the fundamental part of Fightback. I also think John Hewson's other mistake was that he concentrated overwhelmingly on one issue, an economic issue. I suspect that if, at the time he was leader, he had accepted the challenge of the Prime Minister in 1992 in relation to such issues as the republic and the Australian national identity, proposed those sorts of changes and engaged in a positive way in that debate, the election result in 1993 may have been much closer and he would have had a much greater chance of success.

         —You lost by 15 seats which is a pretty big loss. I understand that John Hewson had a very open mind and was quite positive on social issues and issues of national identity. I think he made a mistake in trying to buy too much acquiescence or quietness within the Liberal Party by allowing the John Howards and the Bronwyn Bishops of this parliament to run amuck on constitutional issues and claim their support for the monarchy in an extremely negative and backward way. I think John Howard will have great difficulty in the next election, which will be in the next 12 months or so, trying to claim himself as a man of the future when he only harks back to policies of the past.

         Though I believe John Hewson's economic policies were misguided, I do think it has to be acknowledged that he was willing to put forward a detailed economic prescription for Australia. He took his ideas into the marketplace of politics and was willing to fight them out. I believe he ought to be given due credit for that. Time will only tell what people think. Historians will speculate what may have happened if he had won the election. I think his troubles would have only just begun if he had won the election.

         I think he lacked the political skill, although he had an economic prescription, to get such a massive economic program through this parliament and accepted in the Australian community. That would have been really testing for any politician in Australia's history, even those with the greatest of political skills, but it certainly tested John Hewson.

         I pay tribute to the fact that John Hewson chose to announce his resignation formally in the parliament. I think Alan Ramsay is right in what he said. He made the speech in parliament and he did not, as he was fully entitled to do and was able to do, send a letter of resignation to the Speaker and never be heard of again in the forum of the parliament. I think that is a lesson for all of us. If we get the opportunity—and some of us may not because we may be defeated at an election and not have that choice—to make a resignation or parting speech in the parliament, I think we ought to take it. I think John Hewson should be congratulated for using that opportunity, even though there were probably plenty of people, particularly on his side, who wished he had not. As Alan Ramsay pointed out, it is significant that so few on his own side spoke. I think that is disappointing for John Hewson and disappointing for the parliament.

         I have to point out, of course, that many of us do not have the luxury of John Hewson's personal wealth, which means that this might not have been a consideration. There are many of us in this place who do not have access to personal wealth of such size, and a pension is a consideration after we leave parliament. But, just the same, he could have easily sat it out for another 12 months and collected the pension. I think that ought to be acknowledged. I think that says something about the character of Hewson doing it his way.

Despite the fact that he will be remembered as not being a good politician and for losing an election everyone said he should have won, I suspect that in some ways John Hewson would be quite happy to say, `I did it my way in the Liberal Party'. I think that is rather a glib reference and a very glib analysis of what really was going on in that election campaign. The issues were wider than just saying that he should have won what was considered an unlosable election.

He did it; he went out in the marketplace; he lost. I think the last two years in this place were pretty uncomfortable for him. It is acknowledged that, once you lose an election like that, you are on a treadmill that is going backwards in a sense. He lost the leadership and then he lost his frontbench position. Some of those instances showed that he did lack political skill, but you cannot deny the fact that he had his own sense, his own way and his own quota of courage to put the case.

         I want to acknowledge that—even though I have never said more than about three words to John Hewson. The only time he ever mentioned me, he deliberately mispronounced my name of Schacht into another variation that has more to do with lavatory humour. I thought that actually did him more damage than it did me, and it again showed a lack of political skill and judgment. But it was of no consequence to me. Anyway, I finally wish him and Carolyn success with the forthcoming family and wish him well in the future.

         I can say that I was proud to be part of his team leading up to the 1993 election. I was very happy to sell our policy. In Western Australia, as you know yourself, Mr President, the coalition did extremely well. We polled a record, I believe, 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. We took two seats from the government and were within an ace of taking another seat, the prized seat of Swan held by Mr Beazley—the difference was something under 200 votes. There was a very similar situation with Mr Gear in Canning, and we reduced the majority in Brand to 2.8 per cent. So I believe that we sold the policy in Western Australia. They accepted the policy, and we certainly did well.

        (1)-(19) As I have said in responding to earlier questions on notice from Senator Chapman on this issue, the AFP is currently assessing certain allegations relating to possible Commonwealth offences before a commitment is made to undertake a criminal investigation. Until the AFP concludes its examination, it would be inappropriate for the Government to make further comment.

        This position is in accordance with longstanding practice followed by both sides of politics. There are sound reasons for this policy. It is necessary so that the conduct of a criminal investigation is not prejudiced. Its is also necessary so that due process is afforded to the people or organisations subject to the allegations.
