         â€”I thank the Senate. On 23 October 1995 I reported to the Senate on the committee's concern with this instrument, which related to discretions which may not be subject to merits review. The committee has now received a reply from the minister, but will not be discussing the reply until its next meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow is the last day on which the notice of disallowance on this instrument can be withdrawn. Accordingly, I have given this present notice as a precaution in case the committee agrees to withdraw its notice of disallowance. If the committee decides to take other action, I will not take proceed with the action foreshadowed by my notice of withdrawal.

         â€”by leaveâ€”I have been advised that the government is prepared to respond to Democrat and other requests for some form of inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths in 1975 of the five journalists at Balibo and Roger East in Dili by asking for a report on the subject from Mr Tom Sherman, the former Australian Government Solicitor, former Chairman of the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission and the about to retire Chairman of the National Crime Authority.

However, I must say I believe the minister should give an undertaking to release, at the very least, a summary of Mr Sherman's findings publicly and to release the whole of Mr Sherman's findings to the families of the men involved.

        "It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action.

The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law."

        The bill seeks to remove discrimination in areas of Commonwealth law including employment, education, superannuation, industrial relations, the provision of goods and services, sporting activities, clubs and associations.

        It is recognised that any effort to bring about positive social change must take account of the need to respect deeply held religious beliefs, of the need for a person's own `private space' and, if they want to change their attitudes, the possibility to do so at their own pace in these areas.

        The process of producing what turned out to be an extremely complex piece of legislation was lengthy. The decision to take on the project was announced during the debate on the Sexual Conduct Bill late in 1994. It was triggered by the narrow ambit of that legislation, limited as it was to the right to privacy under the ICCPR and the missed opportunity it represents in its failure to deal with discrimination in a comprehensive way.

        In Australia anti-discrimination provisions of varying quality have been enacted in NSW, Queensland, South Australia, the ACT, the Northern Territory and particularly inadequately, in Victoria.

        The concerns federal Attorney General, Mr Lavarch, is reported to have about the constitutional validity of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation on the grounds of sexuality do not appear to be well founded.

        The external affairs power in s.51 XXIX of the Constitution brings into play the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and ILO Convention III.

        In its `view' on the Toonen case, the UN Human Rights Committee said that "the reference to `sex' in articles 2 and 26 is to be taken as including sexual orientation". The High Court is likely to accept that interpretation, particularly since it is open to the Court to base it also on "other status".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The need to construct the bill's constitutional underpinning in this way points to the urgent need for a comprehensive constitutional Bill of Rights, but that is a topic for another day.

        It is to be hoped that the ALP Government will find the courage to support this long overdue bill to deal with Commonwealth areas of responsibility and that the Coalition Parties can overcome that small but strident homophobic opposition in their midst, as they largely did in the vote for the Sexual Conduct Bill.

        The social philosopher, John Rawls, suggested that the level of civilisation reached by a community can be judged best by how it treats minorities. On that basis I am confident that Australians are essentially fair-minded people and that they will agree that it is only fair and just that people of a `different' sexuality are protected against discrimination in employment, in education, in the provision of goods and services, etc.

        It is not proposed to give homosexual, bisexual and transgender people any rights or advantages that no one else has. Rather it is proposed to ensure as far as possible to put a stop to the particular disadvantages suffered by homosexual, bisexual and transgender people. In many cases it is not an exaggeration to call it persecutionâ€”persecution of a minority which should not be tolerated in a democratic, liberal and pluralist society, a society which prides itself on the safeguards it claims to provide for individual rights and liberties, the sort of society that Eva Cox in this year's Boyer lectures calls the `civil society'.

        The reality is different. In a survey undertaken in 1994 by the Melbourne group, Gay Men and Lesbians Against Discrimination (GLAD), 1000 gay and lesbian people were interviewed. In the Report `Not a Day Goes By', 45 per cent of lesbians and gay men reported some form of harassment or discrimination in employment, including loss of jobs. 41 per cent of lesbians and 25 per cent of gay men reported inadequate services or refusal of service, 22 per cent of lesbians and 33 per cent of gay men had experienced inappropriate responses from police including harassment and actual violence in some cases. 70 per cent of lesbians and 69 per cent of gay men reported being verbally abused, threatened or bashed in a public place.

        The principle of essential equality before the law has led me to include heterosexual people in the definition of sexuality and as a result they too will be beneficiaries of the protection against discrimination the bill offers. A `special measures' provision will enable members of any particular sexuality to obtain exclusive access to services and facilities where this is needed to achieve equal opportunities.

        The same sex couple provision will provide the legal basis for specific amendments to other Commonwealth legislation on Immigration, Superannuation, Social Security, Evidence, Health Insurance, Family Law, etc. to the extent that the amendments in this bill do not adequately remove the effect of discriminatory provisions contained in other Commonwealth Acts.

        The prohibition of discrimination in the payment of superannuation benefits (cl.10) and the same sex couples provision will enable surviving partners to collect superannuation payouts in situations similar to the 1995 Greg Brown case where payment was refused because the partners were of the same sex.. In the establishment of superannuation and life insurance policies companies will be able to discriminate only on the basis of relevant actuarial data.

        The blanket provision to equalise the legal position of heterosexual defacto and same sex couples will result in some criticism from the gay community, partly on the basis that the `defacto' legal construct does not reflect adequately the nature and quality of same sex couple relationships, notably because the notion of dependency is not as prevalent as in heterosexual relationships. However, this distinction is not as validly drawn as it once may have been in view of the growing sense of equality and desire to share between partners of opposite gender.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It must also be recognised that the provision does not attempt to define all same sex relationships but merely provides a legal basis for those same sex couples who are in a `genuine domestic relationship' and want to be treated as such.

        The second point made often during the consultations was the obvious one of the reduction in Social Security and Unemployment payments as a result of a `couple' classification.

        At one level the natural response is "you have to take the bad with the good". At another it should lead us to reexamine a policy which penalises Australian couples and families for coming together in one household. Although brought to light by the `same sex couples' debate, the issue is one of general interest and of considerable importance for the community as a whole.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In a country where politicians of all hues expound the value of the family as an essential building block of a stable society, we should stop penalising people when they form such family units.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would clearly make much more sense to pay benefits to everyone at the individual rate and thus to provide an incentive for family formation. In other words, the adage "Two can live as cheaply as one" should be used to build a more cohesive society rather than serve as a means to reduce the level of Social Security payments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The high cost (approximately $7bn) of such a change is due in part to the fact that unemployment benefits would be payable to non-working spouses of above average income earners. However, this merely accelerates the development of the policy to provide support for home carers. By removing the financial disadvantage of family formation, it is likely that more people would form caring and sharing partnerships, including those not dependent on a sexual relationship, thus providing a more supportive community and corresponding savings in remedial social services.

        Recognition is long overdue that lesbians, gay men, bisexual and transgender people are sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunties and sometimes parents. They are members of families and deserve to be treated as such and not as outcasts.

        To return to the process: following the decision late in 1994 to proceed with the bill, I visited every State capital as well as Darwin and Alice Springs for consultations with representatives of relevant groups and organisations. An Issues Paper arising out of these meetings was released in February 1995 at Melbourne's Midsumma Festival, and circulated throughout Australia, eliciting numerous responses and comments.

        Mr John McNicol, reportedly with former associations to the far right Logos Foundation and now of the so-called `Christian' Alliance, was a little more careful: he merely threatened to mount a well financed political pressure campaign similar to those used by his American sister organisation to silence or unseat politicians daring to support gay law reform. Not surprisingly I am occupying a place of honour in his list of targets, but the Attorney General, Mr Lavarch, and Mr Downer get a mention, too, mainly because of their role in getting the 1994 Sexual Conduct Bill through Parliament.

        The payment by growers of the compulsory 4.5 per cent debt component of wool tax from 1 July 1993 onwards entitles them to a share in any surplus from the sale of the stockpile by wool international, to be made available once the associated government guaranteed debt has been retired, as well as to equity in any privatised Wool International.

        The Wool International Act 1993 currently allows these eligible wool tax payers to gain additional entitlements by making voluntary contributions up to 5.5 per cent of the sale value of shorn wool, other than carpet wool, in addition to the 4.5 per cent stockpile debt component of wool tax.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The circumstances in the wool industry have changed markedly since the present statutory framework was put in place in 1993, and there is now anticipated to be in a significant surplus  arising from stockpile sales after the government guaranteed debt has been retired. This has led the board of wool international to recommend that the surplus from the stockpile sales be made available to growers once the government guaranteed debt has been retired, and that any privatisation, if that is the wish of eligible wool tax payers, be funded from the non wool assets of wool international. The government has agreed with this recommendation.

        In these circumstances, it is considered there is no justification for eligible wool tax payers retaining the right to make voluntary contributions.

        SYDNEY 2000 GAMES (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this bill is to assist in preserving the financial integrity of the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games by facilitating the raising of licensing revenue in relation to the games through the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As honourable Senators would no doubt be aware, the hosting of the Olympic Games in 2000 is an event of great significance to Australia, providing a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. This government was a strong and enthusiastic supporter of the bid for the games and its support and assistance will continue throughout the task of organising the games.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This task is very large and complex. It is also very expensive. As the host nation for the year 2000 Games, Australia will be expending considerable sums of money in the lead up to the year 2000 to arrange the construction of facilities and infrastructure, organisation and marketing required for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The cost of staging the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games is estimated to be $2 billion, and will be shared between the organising committees, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC), the government of NSW and the Commonwealth Government. As well as providing $150 million toward the cost of staging the Sydney Games and up to $25 million toward the cost of the Paralympics, the Commonwealth Government will provide $140 million to sports in 1995-96. This includes $46 million to Olympic sport through the "Maintain the Momentum" program and the "Olympic Athlete" program ($135 million over six years) which is designed to ensure the best possible preparation of Australia's athletes for the Atlanta and Sydney Games.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Sources of revenue to meet the costs of the Sydney Games include the sale of television rights, ticket sales and the licensing of the right to use the games indicia and images. After television rights, licensing, or sponsorship, rights are the most important source of revenue to meet the costs of organising and staging the games. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the revenue budget of the games.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors will depend to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity afforded to the licensed indicia and images. Official sponsors recognise the commercial value of associating themselves with events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games and are willing to pay considerable sums of money to use the words and symbols associated with the Olympics. In this regard, I note that SOCOG has recently announced that Telstra and IBM are to jointly contribute more than $100 million as the first members of Team Millennium, the corporate sponsorship program for the Sydney 2000 Gamesâ€”the deal was negotiated in anticipation of the strengthening of the legislative protection of intellectual property rights associated with the Sydney Games.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        "Ambush marketing", however, has the capacity to erode seriously the official sponsorship revenue if not stopped or minimised. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Games, without paying for marketing rights. Typically it is the competitors of official sponsors of major sporting events that engage in these activities. Australian and overseas experience of recent Olympic Games has highlighted the threat that uncontrolled ambush marketing activities can pose to the value of exclusive licensing rights on Olympic Games symbols and indicia. Because ambush marketing can be very effective in creating a perception that the "free-rider" is in fact an official sponsor, it can dissuade official sponsors from continuing their association with the Olympics, or substantially reduce the amount sponsors are prepared to pay for the rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The preservation of sponsorship revenue is fundamental to achieving a sound financial outcome for the games thereby ensuring the least call on the public purse. The Government of NSW has underwritten and bears full responsibility for any deficit between the games income and expenditure. The protection of official sponsorships against ambush marketing is therefore critical.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth Government has always recognised the importance of protecting the sponsorship revenue. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the commonwealth, endorsed the bid, noting the provisions of the host city contract, and undertook to make every effort to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made. The government has long been supportive of the Australian Olympic Committee in its endeavours to ensure appropriate protection for Olympic symbols such as the five rings and the designs of the Olympic flame and torchâ€”the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 was put in place expressly for that purpose. That act was amended in 1994 to extend the protection available.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill provides additional protection to try to ensure a good budget outcome for the Sydney Games. It will protect the use of a wide range of words and expressions against ambush marketing during the lead up to and including the Sydney Games. It will pick up most of the recommendations made in March 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report entitled Cashing in on the Sydney Olympics: Protecting the Sydney Olympic Games from Ambush Marketing. The bill will have a limited period of application and will cease to have effect after 31 December 2000.

        Mr President, I would now briefly outline significant features of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill seeks to provide protection to indicia encompassing words and expressions associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Words and phrases such as "Olympic", "Olympiad", "Paralympic", "Paralympiad", "Sydney 2000", "Sydney Games",  "Millennium  Games"  and  "Summer Games" will be protected against unlicensed commercial use under this legislation. Particular word combinations will also be protected under this legislation. These include, for example, any combinations of the words "Olympics", "Olympian", "Paralympics" and "Paralympian" with words, numbers or phrases such as "Sydney", "2000', "Two Thousand", "Games", "Medals", "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze", "Green and Gold" and "Sponsor".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to protecting particular words, numbers and expressions, the bill also seeks to provide protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games. These images may be either visual or aural representations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The rights in the above protected indicia and images vest with SOCOG and SPOC. These two bodies have the power to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the legislation for commercial purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To constitute use for commercial purposes, the Sydney Games indicia or images must be applied to a person's goods or services for advertising or promotional purposes, or for enhancing the demand for the goods or services, and in a manner which would suggest that the person is a sponsor of, or has an association with, the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games or both. That is, a person who sells or promotes their goods or services by using any of the protected indicia or images in a way that would be reasonably understood as suggesting that the person is claiming a connection with the games would be using them for commercial purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to enable the public to be aware of the identity of those licensed to use the Sydney Games indicia and images, a register will be established and maintained by SOCOG and made accessible to members of the public at its office in Sydney. The register will also be accessible throughout Australia at State Offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. An entry in the register will include details such as the name and principal place of business of the licensed user, the Sydney Games indicia and images that the licensed user may use and the circumstances in which the indicia and images may be used. A person whose name is entered on the register is to be taken to be a licensed user of the Sydney Games indicia or images specified in that entry. A document certified by the Chief Executive Officer of SOCOG is evidence that the particulars set out in the document are entered in the register.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill, however, is not about placing an absolute fetter on any use of the protected Sydney Games indicia and images. The government recognises that while the preservation of sponsorship revenue is essential to achieving a good budget outcome for the games, the fundamental rights of the community to freedom of expression must be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of the Sydney Games indicia and images will apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, it is made clear in the bill that the legislation is not intended to affect the working of many aspects of everyday business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is recognised that some individuals and corporations already use the indicia prescribed in the legislation in conjunction with their goods and services. There are for example goods and services which either have the trade marks "Olympic" or include the word "Olympic", such as "Olympic tyres" and "Olympic Airways". This legislation is not about stopping traders who have been using these indicia and images for years from continuing that use. The established rights of owners of registered trade marks or designs containing those indicia and images remain unaffected so long as the trade marks or designs are not used in a way so as to imply a connection to the games.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The use of the Sydney Games indicia or images solely for the purposes of providing information, or for the purposes of criticism or review, is not of itself prohibited. Examples of such provision of information include the reporting of news and presentation of current affairs, the factual description of goods or services provided by a business (such as stating that accommodation is available at a hotel that is located near the Olympic site), or the factual description by an athlete of their performance and achievements. Examples of criticism and review are those which are likely to appear in newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals, in a radio or television broadcast, or in a cinematographic film.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government recognises that the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fundraising for and promotion of their preparation of athletes and teams for the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games should be allowed to continue. Those reasonable needs could involve use of the Sydney Games indicia or images for the purposes of providing factual information. As I have just explained, the bill is not intended to affect this type of use. Nevertheless, as I noted when I presented the government's response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's report, the government believes that, in the interests of clarity and certainty, it would be desirable for sporting bodies to negotiate Memoranda of Understanding with SOCOG to cover their proposed use of the Sydney Games indicia and images. Such a Memorandum is currently under negotiation between the Australian Sports Commission and SOCOG.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides various remedies to SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to enforce their rights in relation to the Sydney Games indicia and images. Thus, where an unlicensed user uses Sydney Games indicia or images in contravention of the bill, SOCOG, SPOC or a relevant licensed user may bring an action against the unlicensed user. The remedies available under the bill include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising. However, in addition to those remedies, the courts have the discretion to provide remedies under any law (whether a law of the commonwealth, a state or a territory) that confers any rights or powers on SOCOG, SPOC or a licensed user. Most notable in this regard are the remedies provided under the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also includes appropriate customs measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which seek to ambush the Olympic Games marketing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The on-going cost to the government of administering this legislation will be minimal. The Australian Customs Service will be able to carry out the measures of this legislation relating to the monitoring of imported goods at the barrier within their existing resources. It is likely that the increased security of the Olympic 2000 indicia and images will enhance SOCOG's and SPOC's capacity to ensure the financial viability of the 2000 Games through its marketing program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that the bill introduces significant protection for the Sydney Games indicia and images. The protection provided by this bill will both complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws to ensure, to the extent possible, that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games.

        At present there is no uniform international procedure for sample collection and testing. Most International Sporting Federations have sample collection procedures that differ from each other in a number of small variations. These variations have made it difficult for ASDA to undertake testing on behalf of International Sporting Federations as the procedures do not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of the current ASDA legislation.

        The bill will permit the agency to overcome this problem and undertake testing for International Sporting Federations, either at international events being held in Australia or when contracted to conduct other event and out-of-competition testing, even in those cases where International Sporting Federations' procedures are slightly different to the procedures outlined in the ASDA legislation which, of course are primarily designed for our domestic testing regime.

        This in no way suggests that the existing high standards will be diminished in any way. The amendments provided by this bill simply identify the procedures which ASDA must strictly comply with to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the drug test result.

        TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (BETTER BUSINESS CONDUCT) BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Small businesses make up 96 per cent of all firms in Australia and account for 45 percent of all employment. Increasingly, jobs growth is being fuelled by the demands of the small business sector. Many of Australia's most innovative firms are small businesses. These firms are critical to the export growth of Australia's manufacturing and service industries and are at the forefront of the push into Asia. Therefore, when small businesses complain that they are being unfairly exploited, there is good cause to listen.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Small businesses have long argued that they are not getting a fair go, and that the protections offered by the Trade Practices Act 1974 do not give relief from a range of unfair practices. Many of the concerns raised by small business are simply the result of competitive forces in the marketplace and thus do not justify a legislative response.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There remains, however, some practices of legitimate concern which are not prohibited by the Trade Practices Act 1974. Circumstances can arise where a firm cannot, due to the actions of another, protect their interests and are subject to exploitation in a manner unsustainable in a competitive and open market. The exploitation of small firms in existing commercial relationships denies many firms the capacity to develop and is an impediment to growth in this important sector of the economy. This bill seeks to remove such impediments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, it should not be forgotten that the market is a hard place. It is the nature of business that all firms seek to maximise their returns. The government recognises this and does not propose to prevent hard bargains being struck, provided that they are struck fairly. It is not the intention of this bill to protect firms from their own mistakes, nor is it intended to provide them with a guarantee of business success. It is about restoring choice to commercial bargains and allowing those who are denied choice the opportunity to take steps to protect their own interests.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is not a bill to prohibit harsh or oppressive outcomes. Agreements with such outcomes, freely entered into and consequent of full disclosure, must be allowed to stand. This is, however, a bill that addresses those commercial relationships where one of the parties has no choice. Further, the bill only targets conduct that is harsh or oppressive and not in the present or future legitimate interests of the corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Concern has been raised in some quarters that this bill undermines primacy of contract and threatens the fabric of Australian commercial activity. Australia's strict laws of contract are a comparative advantage in the Asia-Pacific region, and assist in attracting investment into this country. The government recognises this, and the bill preserves the advantages that certainty of contract gives to the business environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill is limited in the scope of its application to businesses in a pre-existing commercial relationship. The reason for this limitation is that, however painful the decision, businesses that have no sunk costs in a commercial relationship can walk away if the terms and conditions are not commensurate with the return.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provisions of the bill also only apply to commercial relationships of major significance to one of the parties to the arrangement. This is not a bill to provide relief from every provision that a firm finds inconvenient or burdensome.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill is concerned with prohibiting the exploitation of a party denied commercial choice by virtue of the particular relationship they have with another firm. It is not about providing relief for firms from downturns in the market or industry wide practices. For example, the forced reduction in the price paid to automotive component suppliers by the major car companies would not be covered by this legislation as it arises from changes affecting the Australian car industry as a whole, namely exposure to international competition. It is legitimate for the major car companies to seek to force reductions in price on their suppliers as the level of competition in the sector increases.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to note that the bill is confined to the exploitation of a particular commercial relationship. A company that chooses to engage in a common set of conduct across all commercial relationships is not exploiting any one particular arrangement. In a competitive market, a company which unfairly exploits all its commercial relationships is likely, in the long term, to do greater commercial damage to itself than to any one party with whom it deals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Even when conduct is found to be harsh or oppressive it may be justified by specific considerations which are peculiar to the particular relationship. The bill reflects this by allowing reference to the whole of the commercial relationship and the surrounding circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In markets where competition is reduced, such as in markets where the company has a substantial degree of market power, existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act governing the misuse of market power prevent the exploitation of firms. This bill addresses discriminatory conduct, where a company exploits a particular relationship to seek extra-market rents unsustainable in the open market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It should be recognised that a number of industry sectors have already taken steps to address the matters covered by this bill. This is to be commended. Many landlords, including the larger ones, have adopted practices that recognise the mutually dependent nature of their relationship with their tenants. The government welcomes the cooperation between the Building Owners and Managers Association and the Retailers Council of Australia on encouraging better business conduct between landlords and their tenants. This bill supports these changes in leasing practices, by capturing those firms that refuse to comply with industry developed norms of behaviour.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government welcomes moves towards industry codes of self-regulation as they create a regulatory environment protects all participants while allowing for a flexibility for change that legislation cannot deliver. This bill, with the other provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974, provides a legislative safety net for industry codes of practice, reducing the level of regulation that would otherwise be necessary for many industry sectors. By listing adherence to self-regulatory codes as a factor which a court may have regard to in determining whether conduct is harsh or oppressive, the bill explicitly recognises the important role these codes play in establishing acceptable standards of business conduct.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill is seen as an important facet of the regulatory framework for the petroleum and franchising sectors. Smaller participants in these industries, concerned at their relative lack of commercial independence from larger corporations, have welcomed these measures, as they provide protection from abuse while not involving the government in the everyday operations of their businesses. These firms have stated that they do not want heavy-handed government regulation of their dynamic industry sectors. They want an environment where they are protected from exploitation but where commercial success depends on their own commitment and business acumen.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill has been drafted with a view to providing realistic and effective protection without imposing unacceptable compliance costs upon business. The bill provides for better business conduct whilst not having any financial implications for the government. It is consistent with the government's policy of `minimum effective regulation'.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill aims to improve standards of business conduct, and does not seek to rely on enforcement for its effect. Where matters still result in dispute, the bill, through its support of industry codes of behaviour, favours mediation. Court action is a costly exercise, in both time and money, that many businesses cannot afford. The government supports moves which reduce the burden on the court system such as mediation of disputes, particularly under mechanisms arising out of industry-specific codes of practice. Willingness to subject disputes to arbitration rather than pursuing the claims in courts should be encouraged and taken as a commitment by the parties to making business relationships work.

         On 8 December 1994 the Senate asked the committee to inquire into the Commonwealth's treaty making power, which is also often referred to as the `external affairs power'. The committee consulted widely in relation to this reference. It conducted public hearings in all capital cities, except Darwin, and it received 157 written submissions. This perhaps has been the most comprehensive review devoted solely to the operation of the external affairs power.

They have given the committee invaluable assistance during the last 12 months.

          A number of central issues arose from the evidence which the committee received. These concerns related to the impact of international treaties on the Australian federal system and the sovereignty of the nation; the degree of consultation undertaken by the government prior to entering into and ratifying treaties; and the issue of the respective roles of the parliament, the government, and especially the executive, in treaty making.

          The legislative power to implement treaties in domestic law is governed by section 51(xxix) of the Constitution and, as I have stated previously, is commonly known as the `external affairs power'. At Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth government did not possess the executive power to enter into treaties. This prerogative remained with the United Kingdom. Australia subsequently became an independent nation, capable of entering into treaties on its own behalf.

          The current interpretation of the external affairs power is that it is an independent plenary head of power that supports laws with respect to matters that are physically external to Australia and laws affecting Australia's relations with other nations. The power also supports legislation that implements Australia's obligations under treaties, regardless of whether the treaties' subject matter is otherwise constitutionally within the Commonwealth's legislative power.

          Recently the High Court decision of Teoh demonstrated the increasing importance of the impact of treaties on Australian law and, I would say, supports the necessity for greater parliamentary involvement in the treaty making process. It is argued that the wide interpretation of the external affairs power to cover matters that are not external to Australia may threaten the continued existence of the Australian federation; that is, a wide interpretation of the external affairs power might permit the Commonwealth to extend its legislative competence to cover areas previously considered to be within the domain of the states.

          There were 11 recommendations made; they were unanimous. The first dealt with the information provided to the public at large in relation to the treaties that were entered into. Although it is stated that Australia is party to approximately 920 treaties, there is still some uncertainty as to that exact number. Accordingly, the committee considers that it is necessary for the government to conduct an audit of treaties to determine the precise scope of Australia's international obligations.

          The committee also recommended that the government report annually to the parliament on measures it has taken to implement treaties in the previous year.

          One of the concerns that was raised before the committee was about consultation. The committee was concerned that the public does not have access to adequate information and is not adequately consulted by the government prior to ratification of treaties. In some cases, the government may consult only the peak body in relation to a particular interest group. However, in relation to some groups a peak body may not be as representative of that interest group as the government may believe. Therefore, the committee considers the government should endeavour to consult widely with all relevant groups to overcome such problems.

          The committee went on to consider the role of the states and territories and, I might add, the states and territories were united in their submission to the committee that there should be a further body, a treaties council, set up in addition to the Standing Committee on Treaties. The Standing Committee on Treaties comprises public officials and the committee thought it was desirable not to duplicate the process and form another body but simply build on the Standing Committee on Treaties and establish a treaties council. This treaties council, however, should be made up of elected representatives from the parliaments of the states and territories. That would mean that you would have representatives from both state governments and oppositions and territorial governments and oppositions. As well as that, the committee recommended that on the council there should also be representatives from the federal government, federal opposition and minor parties in the Commonwealth.

          The committee also recommended that there should be a joint parliamentary treaties committee which would be able to review treaties prior to ratification. The committee recommended that the government should table treaties at least 15 sitting days prior to ratification and thereby provide an opportunity for the parliament to refer to a joint parliamentary treaty any treaty under consideration. Wide powers would then be afforded to that joint parliamentary committee to inquire into and report on the treaty concerned.

          There was some mention made of amendment to the constitution. The committee was of the view that that was not an option available unless there was bipartisan support and that, accordingly, legislation to regulate the exercise of the external affairs power was a more preferable option. There was also some mention made of the fact that there should be parliamentary approval of treaties. The committee stressed that parliament should not be involved in the negotiating of treaties but that the question of any parliamentary approval should be referred to the joint parliamentary committee for its consideration. The committee was of the opinion that this was such an important matter that it required a discrete debate in relation to this issue alone.

          As I said, these recommendations were unanimous. They are indeed ground breaking. They take us to an area in relation to the external affairs power where this country has never been before. I believe that if these recommendations are accepted you will have increased consultation with not only the states and territories but also the community at large. I believe these recommendations would go a long way to addressing the concerns that were put to the committee. I commend the report to the Senate.

          As Senator Ellison said, the area of treaties requires careful consideration. This country and this parliament have often been placed in the position where treaties which have had domestic consequences have been concluded by the executive government of Australia. Very often when we talk about that, the international treaty relating to human rights is mentioned. I believe those developments are extremely positive. The Australian Democrats have supported them.

          Our opinions are coloured very often by the content of the treaties. The Democrats are not happy about some treaties, such as the treaty relating to the World Trade Organisation which committed us to certain action under GATT. That very much highlights the situation that this parliament and the community at large must be involved in the discussion of treaties and must be able to contribute views and opinions and have a substantive debate on significant treaties before they are concluded.

          The committee has weighed carefully a number of avenues to achieve that. As Senator Ellison said, the committee recommended the creation of a treaties council with very wide representation. Some people might say that it is too unwieldy and too large because it is proposed that the council have representation not only from the Commonwealth government and all state governments but also representatives from oppositions and representatives of so-called minor parties. The reasonâ€”and I believe it is a sound oneâ€”is that this council is not a decision making body but is a consultative body. Its establishment is only a recommendation at this stage. I hope the recommendation is accepted by parliament. It will be established as a dragnet measure to flush out all concerns in the nation about a proposed treaty that creates obligations on behalf of Australia. If you look at it from that point of view, I believe there is a strong case for wide representation.

          The committee also recommends the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to have treaties referred to it, to examine them in detail and to report to parliament on them. I believe that is the appropriate place for treaties to be carefully considered and for the recommendation to be made to the parliament as to the value or otherwise on the treaty. It is appropriate that such a committee be established.

          I make a brief comment on the bill that Democrat Senator Vicki Bourne introduced. Its provisions require that parliament approve certain important bills before they are signed. The committee has not been able to reach a decision that it wholeheartedly recommends that procedure, but it has decided that how legislative provisions, and what legislative provisions, should be made to achieve parliamentary approval of certain classes of treaty should be referred to that committee. It does require further consideration.

It is not an easy or light matter for a country to accept international obligations by way of treaty, and it is proper and fitting that, as the community becomes politically more interested and politically more expert, it should have an opportunity to comment; it should have an opportunity to express an opinion on the content of those treaties. I commend the committee's report to the Senate.

          One of the recommendations of the report which I am delighted with is recommendation No. 9, which does suggest that there ought be, if you like, an impact statement on the domestic law of Australia pursuant to any treaty that we might sign, because so often we have signed treaties with scant regard for the domestic consequences of signing those treaties. We then have federal governments abusing those treaties for their own domestic purposes. I remember the heartache I went through at about this time last year when I was unable to vote with my colleagues in relation to the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill because of the adverse impact that was going to have on the Commonwealth-state relations and the way that got its legal foundation through an international treaty.

          We were told at the time by an Attorney-General who was beating his breast that we had an international obligation to pass this legislation; it was absolutely vital. But then, of course, when the High Court made a decision against the federal government in relation to the Teoh decision, all of a sudden all those international obligations were thrown out the window and we had a situation where the government then introduced legislation to overturn the impact of the international obligationsâ€”which, of course, shows the two-faced approach that the federal government has adopted to international treaty making.

          If there is to be an impact statement or an audit of the impact of international treaties on domestic legislation, we will then find out the true consequences of signing up on treaties. Some would argue that the Convention on the Rights of the Child, for example, would not allow for corporal punishment of children. I would have thought that 80 or 90 per cent of the Australian population believe that loving discipline of children can include an aspect of corporal punishment. Of course, the federal Attorney-General quite properly has dismissed the outlawing of corporal punishment pursuant to that convention. But, quite frankly, if that is the Australian domestic line, then we should not have signed that international treaty. Recommendation 9 requiring this audit or impact statement on the domestic legislation prior to signing a treaty I think will be of great benefit for the treaties council and for the people of Australia.

          I believe it has been agreed that we should all limit our comments as much as possible. May I simply make this other comment? I personally believe that, ultimately, there ought be an amendment to the constitution, but it is more important for us to get a unanimous report and that was why I was more than willing to go along with this unanimous report rather than suggest that the constitution be amended, because I am sure that we would not get bipartisan support for such a suggestion.

          The committee believes that the sale of Bond University, one of only two existing private universities in Australia, to a public university represents a threat to national interests. The committee has focused its attention on three issues: firstly, the risk to public money; secondly, the potential of the bid to change by stealth higher education policy, including no fees for undergraduate study by Australian students; and, thirdly, the impact the purchase will have on the independence of Bond and, hence, on the diversity of choice in higher education options in Australia.

          In relation to the safety of public money, the committee had two main concerns. The first of these relates to the initial purchase. The university's bid is believed to be around $110 million and the University of Queensland has assured the committee that no public funding or assets will be used to purchase the land and building.

          How such a risk of $110 million debt is to the public purse depends very much on the nature of the securities given. This raises the key question: in the event of the venture failing, how would the bank redeem its debt? The committee believes, on the evidence to date, that there is still a risk to public money. The committee is unconvinced that the assets which would be used as security equate to the value of the loan that they are held against. Moreover, what government is going to take the risk of damaging the reputation of one of its leading public universities by not coming to the rescue in the event of a default?

          Cross-subsidisation between a public and private university is also of considerable concern. In the long term the potential for direct cross-subsidisation is far greater, particularly in the event of the University of Queensland developing a contiguous public campus, as foreshadowed at Robina. The committee considers that there are grounds for concern here. According to some witnesses, such arrangements would almost inevitably lead to cross-subsidisation. While the safety of public money may be the most immediate of the concerns raised by the sale of Bond University campus, the sale is also seen to represent a real threat to aspects of current higher education policy.

          Of particular concern to the committee is the threat to the policy of no up-front fees for undergraduate studies for Australian students. The committee acknowledges that the current government policy does, in theory, prohibit the charging of up-front fees to Australian undergraduate students. However, this official position has been undermined by a number of developments over recent years: firstly, the existence of at least a partial legitimisation of the user pay principle through the introduction of HECS; secondly, the opening up of some post-graduate courses to full fee-paying arrangements; and, thirdly, the use of commercial arms of universities to offer fee-paying courses for which credit may be subsequently given as part of an undergraduate degree. In this context, the sale of Bond University can be seen as having the potential to undermine the policy of no fees for undergraduate study by Australian students even further. It is the committee's view that such a debate is appropriate at the present stage of development of higher education systems and this is encompassed in our first recommendation.

          While Australia's commitment to a high quality public system of higher education is unlikely to diminish, it is important that any developments in the private sphere with respect to higher education are guided by suitable government policy. Only then will the interests of both public and private sectors be served. To this end, the committee has recommended that the Senate and Commonwealth government encourage and facilitate a broad public debate on issues arising at the interface between the public and private activities of universities, on the role of the non-government sector in the provision of higher government, and the implications of these matters for higher education policy and funding.

          One of the biggest concerns to the committee related to the implications for Bond University's independence of the University of Queensland with the University of Queensland being a landlord and member of Bond's council. The committee regards a pure landlord-tenant relationship between the University of Queensland and Bond as considerably less threatening to the public perceptions of Bond's independence than a more direct involvement of the University of Queensland in Bond's affairs. However, on balance it regards such a relationship as conducive to a public perception that Bond University might in some way be beholden to the University of Queensland. A much greater threat to Bond's independence is the proposal that the University of Queensland have members on Bond's council.

          The educational program at Bond is under the council's ultimate control. The University of Queensland's influential presence on that council, therefore, could profoundly affect Bond's program over the long term. Put simply, the argument is that the loss of diversity with the University of Queensland's bid for Bond is that the purchase of the campus by the University of Queensland and the elements of University of Queensland control will mean elimination of Bond University's private and independent essence. A distinctive element and an alternative style of undergraduate study for Australian students would therefore be lost.

          Something different is happening at the Bond campus and it should be allowed to thrive and prosper in the national interest. The committee has, therefore, made two other recommendations. The committee recommends that, in the national interest, the purchase of the Bond University campus by the University of Queensland should not proceed. The committee also recommends that public universities should be disqualified from participating in any re-tendering or other future selling process for the Bond University campus. I commend the report to the Senate.

          â€”I begin by thanking very much the staff of the secretariat for their professionalism. They have to deal with quite improper inquiries which are held in an improper and, in my view, totally inappropriate way. As a consequence, they are placed in an intolerable position of, to a large measure, becoming essentially propagandists in terms of presenting material on behalf of senators which do not reflect the evidence. This stands in sharp contrast to the previous committee report which has just been presented, where very difficult matters were dealt with in an entirely different way.

          What we have here today is yet another pernicious, failed Senate inquiry which is built fundamentally upon a lie. That lie is contained on the cover of this report, which refers, in its terms of reference, to the sale of the Bond University. There is no sale of the Bond University. This was supposed to be an inquiry into the sale of the real estate at Bond Universityâ€”a very important difference. There are no public funds at risk in this episode. The only waste of public funds is involved in the operation of this Senate committee itself. In that regard it is my view and the view of Labor senators that this is an abuse of the privileges of this parliament and an abuse of the committee system of the Senate.

          As far as I am concerned it demonstrates yet again the complete lack of moral leadership within the Liberal Party. It was once said that it was just a question of apathy and lethargy on behalf of the Liberal leadership that various senators could behave in the way they do in the Senate. What has occurred to me on this occasion is the direct involvement of the Liberal leadership in what I believe to be a totally inappropriate strategy to undo the University of Queensland bid. It is a strategy that does the Liberal leadership and the Liberal Party no credit whatsoever.

          This grubby little inquiry is part of a concerted campaign to undermine the University of Queensland bid for the purchase of the Bond campus and adjoining landâ€”some 450 hectares of prime real estate. Planning developments include eight hectares of high rise, 81 hectares of townhouses, 57 hectares of houses, as well as a research park and a commercial facility. And Liberal senators come in here in this pious and pompous manner and try to tell us this is a matter of national interest. What we have seen here is a process of political interference in negotiations between commercial bidders for the assets of a company that is in receivership. It is a totally inappropriate use of the Senate to do such a thing.

The main players are Professor Carmichael, Professor Goldsworthy, Professor Corkery and Professor Farrar, in his role as Acting Vice-Chancellor following the resolution that was carried at Bond unanimously by the staff that Professor Messel be removed as the Vice-Chancellor. Professor Messel, of course, is now involved in his role as executive chancellor. I mention also Xavier Clarke and, of course, Terry Gygar, the chief of staff from the office of the Vice-Chancellor.

          This group was brought together upon the calling of tenders by the receiver. The group's strategies were on a two-pronged basis. The first was to form a consortium with private investors, such as BHP and News Ltd, that would act to bring together a corporate base to coordinate a bid for the lands at Bond. This consortium was coordinated by Peter Laver, the Director of Corporate Relations at BHP. This group was later joined with the Council of Bond University to access some $20.2 million from accumulated funds to act as a deposit and enable them to borrow funds needed for the purchase of the university lands.

          The second phase of the inquiry was to destroy other bids by Queensland University, Monash University and Griffith University. To this end they issued a writ against the receivers and creditors, KPMG and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, to try to gain a lease and extract damages accordingly. It was very interesting to note that only last week EIE called in the $95 million debt as a result of some of their shenanigans in regard to the Supreme Court in Queensland.

          It was interesting to note that the Bond contract with EIE was predicated on the assumption that that loan would become payable once a profit was declared by Bond University. This first occurred in the 1993-94 year when Bond posted a profit of $680,000. I understand that, as a result of that, Bond University Ltd was called upon to repay the loan, but has since ignored it. It can no longer ignore that call.

          Bond University Ltd has made a profit of $6.7 million in the last year. As I say, only last Friday week a writ was issued against Bond University for the immediate payment of the $95 million subordinated debt. It is the irony of this strategy that it has backfired. BUL now faces the real prospect of receivership itself as a result of these quite wicked manoeuvres through this place and through the courts.

          The third and most insidious move was political approaches through the Senate. To understand just what those links are one has to understand who forms the backbone of the consortium and their direct links to the Liberal Party. One member of staff at Bond University is Professor Ashley Goldsworthy, Dean of the School of Business. Professor Goldsworthy's role in this plan has been clearly to coordinate the political interference in the sale.

          It should also be noted that, despite his prominent role, Professor Goldsworthy did not himself ever give evidence to this inquiry. But his involvement had been more indirect through the coordination of all other submissions through BUL. Another active participant has been Terry Gygar, Chief of Staff in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor of Bond. Mr Gygar is the former state Liberal Party member for Strafford in the Queensland parliament.

In my view, it is totally and completely wrong for the Senate to be involved in a political interference of the proper and legal and prudential duties of the receivers in regard to the disposal of private assets of a company that is in receivership.

         Before speaking to the report, I want to particularly thank the committee secretariatâ€”our secretary, Rob Diamond, and researchers James Satrapa and Liz Williamsâ€”whose expertise and knowledge of modern technology in communications were invaluable in the writing of this report, which required a great degree of knowledge and involved a lot of technological terms. I congratulate them for the way they have reduced these technological terms so that the report has become more readable for members of the community who are interested in this area.

          I also thank my colleagues on the committee, particularly the committee's deputy chairman, Bruce Childs, for their efforts in once again enabling our committee to table a unanimous report. It is some 18 months since the committee commenced this inquiry, and at that time two other major inquiries were being untaken. In this inquiry we considered the outcomes of these reports in making our own determinations. Our committee also completed two other urgent major inquiries while the telecommunications reference was being dealt with. It is intended that this report be distributed on the Internet, which is our contribution to the technological advances in communications.

          The report is intended to reflect public debate about Australia's future communications requirements and how we are best able to meet those requirements now and in the future. The committee has tried to focus, however, not so much on the technology but on the people who will use it. This is a report about people and about the impact technology is having on society. We are becoming a different society as computers and advanced technology make their way into everyday use.

           While the possibilities of new communications are exciting, the committee quickly became aware that they will not be shared equally by all Australians. The committee has therefore paid particular attention to the needs of rural and remote communities, low income earners and the elderly to see whether their communication needs are being met. The committee considers it very important for public sector programs to coordinate their activities if they are to properly benefit the Australian community. The committee was also interested in the possibilities for work and the potential for industry in a new communications environment.

          Like other infrastructures, our future communications networks will serve as a framework to support social interaction, education, health, government services, business activities, recreation and our communication with the rest of the world. By neutralising the tyranny of distance, our future communications networks may even be the key to reversing the long slow population decline which has been affecting so many of our rural communities. I quote only one small part of our report which reports on a recent article in the

         The death of distance as a determinant of the cost of communications will probably be the single most important economic force shaping society in the first half of the next century. The cost of using services may be determined on other criteria such as the speed and capacity of the line. How those effects will translate into benefits for customers in rural and remote Australia is yet to be seen, but a commitment from government and carriers to maintain the process of reducing costs is vital.

         Many in the community are looking to government and to their elected representatives to play a leadership role in the new information and technology environment. The committee sees a continuing role for government as an information provider, a builder of infrastructure and a partner in industry development. There is also a role for government in ensuring that social objectives are met, that distribution of technology is fair and equitable, that it is affordable, that it is private and secure, that it reflects community needs and that the great majority of Australians can use new technology easily.

General policy frameworks are in place, industry is well on track to repeat and indeed improve investment returns and major telecommunication reviews are now complete. The committee's recommendations will provide the basis for some important adjustments and finetuning at an earlier rather than later stage. Once again I particularly thank the members of the secretariat, who are here in the chamber for the tabling of this report, for the work they have done over a long period, and a very intense period, too, in getting this report tabled. I once again thank them on behalf of the committee and I commend this report to all senators.

         In this report, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts maintains the momentum for moving the Commonwealth away from its outdated cash accounting system into the accrual accounting culture. Australian business, of course, has long operated in the accrual accounting environment.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they are incurred, irrespective of whether cash is paid or received. Accrual accounts for government departments would include depreciation on assets, employee entitlements such as long service leave and the value of goods and services received free from the Commonwealth or other bodies. Accrual information better reflects the true cost of providing services.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Australian Bureau of Statistics advised the Committee that, by the turn of the century, the International Monetary Fund will be requiring accrual based information from statistically advanced nations. The recommendations in Report 341, if adopted, would ensure that Australia is well placed to meet international requirements for accrual information on the financial position of the Commonwealth by the year 2000.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In 1992, the then Minister for Finance, the Hon Ralph Willis MP, announced that the financial reporting framework for Commonwealth agencies would be recast to reflect accrual accounting concepts. For the 1994-95 financial year, all government budget-sector agencies have submitted annual financial statements on an accrual basisâ€”most for the first time.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         But this is just the first step!  Government agencies cannot be expected to take accrual accounting and reporting seriously if they are still required to budget on a cash basis and continue to be funded by cash appropriations.

         Building on the recommendations contained in its Report 338,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Accrual Accountingâ€”A Cultural Change
         </emphasis>
         , the Committee proposes in Report 341 that the accrual reports of government agenciesâ€”including government business enterprisesâ€”should be consolidated into an accrual based whole of government report for the Commonwealth.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To comprehend the significance of whole of government reports it is important to understand what they are. Quite simply whole of government reports are the financial statements of the government as a single entity. They are derived from consolidating the accrual based financial statements of individual agencies which collectively represent the government.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Whole of government reports would show, among other things, the total revenues and expenses of government operations, the value of assets available to the government and the total obligations of the government, in a concise and easily readable format. This information is not currently prepared on an accrual basis for the government as a single entity.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Whole of government reporting for the Commonwealth will make the financial position of the Commonwealth more transparent. In particular, since whole of government reports will reveal the Commonwealth's assets and liabilitiesâ€”and not just cash flowsâ€”it will be immediately apparent if the government of the day is running down the asset base of the Commonwealth to fund recurrent spending, to the cost of future generations of Australians.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In Report 341 the Committee also makes recommendations which give guidance on contentious technical issues that will need to be sorted out before whole of government reporting can be implemented.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Report 341 proposes the preparation of audited whole of government reports for the 1997-98 financial year. Leading up to this it is proposed that the key agencies, the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office, develop a model and perform trials for the consolidation process. I understand that this action has already begun.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         But the preparation of whole of government reports  is not the final stage in the transition from a cash to an accrual culture. There is little point in preparing the latest and greatest financial reports for the Commonwealth unless there is also a mechanism for feeding this information  into financial planning and, ultimately, into the Budget.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If the Commonwealth produces excellent whole of government reports that sit on the shelf, then the whole exercise will have been a horrendous waste of administrative resources.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         At the moment, the form and content of the Budget Papers is at the discretion of governments and their advisers and there are no plans to move the Budget process away from cash reporting. If the Government ignores the recommendations in Report 341, the media and the community will continue to focus undue attention on the cash deficit or surplus. As one American economist has pointed out, the budget deficit is `a number in search of a concept'. Evidence to the Committee's inquiry into fiscal responsibility legislation pointed out that cash aggregates such as the budget deficit or surplus have little meaning and are not sensible fiscal policy targets.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is just not sensible for the Commonwealth Budget cycle to continue on a cash basis once government agencies have moved to accrual reporting and once the Commonwealth itself has started to publish accrual based whole of government reports.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There has been enough confusion about the Commonwealth's financial position when all the Commonwealth's financial reports have been prepared on the same basis. The prospect of having the Department of Finance publish a set of accrual numbers for the Commonwealth and the Treasury publishing another set of cash numbers for the Commonwealthâ€”and the public trying to understand why the numbers don't add upâ€”is clearly one to be avoided.
        </para>

         In the Committee's view, it is important that the Parliament plays a key role in determining the form and content of financial reports tabled. After all, such reports are prepared principally for Parliament's use.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Accordingly, the Committee also recommends that the Government introduce legislation to be called the Fiscal Reporting Act  in which Parliament  can determine the type of financial reports to be presented by governments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Fiscal Reporting Actâ€”as envisaged by the Committee in Report 341â€”would formalise the tabling of the Budget Papers, the Treasurer's Mid-year Review and the Actual Budget Outcome. The Committee recommends the preparation of two additional Budget cycle reports:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         a pre-budget fiscal strategy statement (to be tabled three months prior to the Budget); and

        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         a `user-friendly' condensed version of the Budget Papers that would be easily understood by the general public.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         But more importantly, the Fiscal Reporting Act would be the vehicle by which the Parliament could require the Budget cycle reports to be prepared as accrual based whole of government reports.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee has also examined the possibility of enhanced Parliamentary scrutiny of the Commonwealth's financial reports. At the moment, Parliamentary committees examine the financial performance of government departments and agenciesâ€”but not the Commonwealth as a whole.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee recommends that whole of government reports produced by the Department of Finance should stand referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.

         Report 342 is the result of the Committee's inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for Specific Purpose Payments held between 1994 and 1995.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A central feature of Australia's federal fiscal arrangements is the flow of Commonwealth financial assistance to state and local governments. As you will know, Commonwealth financial assistance to the states is divided into two categories: Specific Purpose Payments, or SPPs, and General Purpose Payments. In 1995-96, the Commonwealth paid out approximately $18.3 billion in accordance with the 90 odd SPP agreements between the Commonwealth and the state governments, local governments, universities and non-government schools.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         One of the striking features about these SPPs is their diversity. They range in value from programs with a Commonwealth contribution of less than half a million dollars per annum to those with Commonwealth contributions of over $3 billion per annum; and from one off grants to 10 year programs. Administrative structures and arrangements also vary greatly, depending on the size and complexity of the program and the degree of involvement by the Commonwealth government, other levels of government and non-government agencies.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the last decade, reviews at the Commonwealth and state level have highlighted considerable potential for improvements in the administration and structure of SPPs and in the effectiveness and efficiency with which SPP funded services are delivered to the public. The weight of evidence prompted the JCPA to establish its own inquiry, which has culminated in this report.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The JCPA made an early decision to confine its inquiry to the administration of SPPs and avoid entering debate on the appropriate balance of SPP and GPP payments to the states or the merits of individual SPP objectives. These issues are matters of policy and are well canvassed at the regular Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and Commonwealth-state ministerial meetings.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Despite arguments to the contrary from some state governments, the Committee believes that SPPs are a legitimate vehicle for ensuring that Commonwealth policies and priorities are implemented, even if this is done by complementing or `topping up' existing state government services. As such, the Commonwealth should have the primary responsibility for setting the broad policy and national objectives for SPPs.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee believes, however, that the Commonwealth should shift its focus from the micro-management of SPPs and leave state governments with greater responsibility for service delivery planning. The trade off for granting the states greater autonomy in service delivery planning is that the Commonwealth will place a correspondingly greater emphasis on measuring service delivery performance.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee became concerned that too few SPP agreements clearly articulate what the SPPs are designed to achieve, in terms of impact on the community. The result is often a continuing preoccupation with the activity associated with SPPs, rather than with the results of the activity. The Committee has recommended that all SPPs should have concise statements of what the SPP is trying to achieve, expressed in terms of measurable outcomes. Associated performance indicators should also be specified in SPP agreements.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Correspondingly, and importantly, state governments and other parties receiving SPP funds should be held accountable for their performance towards meeting program objectives, or what they achieve, rather than so much on how they achieve the objectives. However, the Committee believes that input controls such as maintenance of effort clauses, matched funding agreements and caps on the proportion of funds that can be spent on administration should not be phased out of SPP agreements before performance agreements are phased in.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Furthermore, most SPP agreements will need a more sophisticated framework of sanctions in place for non-compliance with the terms of SPP agreements before the Commonwealth can give full responsibility for service delivery planning to states. Such sanctions might include a temporary return to a greater Commonwealth involvement in service delivery planning and oversight.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While the continuous collection and assessment of performance data should be the main way of measuring SPP performance, the Committee believes it important for SPP administrators to be subject to external scrutiny by independent evaluators. The Auditor-General is the Commonwealth's major external reviewer and has a mandate to conduct performance audits of public sector entities and programs. However, the mandate does not extend to allowing the Auditor-General to evaluate the performance of the state agencies also involved in administering SPPs.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The former Commonwealth Auditor-General has argued that Commonwealth Auditors-General should be able to conduct holistic performance audits that `follow the Commonwealth dollar through'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Such audits would best be performed by Commonwealth and state Auditors-General conducting the audits with joint teams. There is the practical difficulty, however, that not all state Auditors-General have the same performance audit mandates. The Committee believes that the ultimate goal should be uniform audit legislation in all Australian jurisdictions. A less ambitious, but more achievable goal, which the Committee has recommended, is that all audit legislation be harmonised to allow Auditors-General to conduct joint performance audits of SPPs.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the short term, the Committee sees greater potential for coordinated audits between the Commonwealth Auditor-General and those state Auditors-General who have a mandate to conduct performance audits. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Auditor-General investigate the possibility of conducting coordinated performance audits of SPPs with state Auditors-General.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr President, the Committee has recommended major changes in the way that the Commonwealth acquits the many hundreds of millions of dollars that it provides to the state governments, universities and non-government schools each year as part of SPP agreements.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Let me state at the outset, the Committee believes that it is fundamental for the Commonwealth to be assured that SPP funds are spent on the basis on which they were allocated. However, the Committee believes that it is possible to streamline SPP financial accountability mechanisms and still allow a full acquittal of SPP funds. In essence, the Committee believes that the Commonwealth should be satisfied with the audited and appropriately annotated annual financial statements of SPP fund recipients for SPP acquittal processes.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The advantages of this model are numerous. The agency receiving SPP funding does not have to prepare separate accounts for the Commonwealth, the audit task is not duplicated and the Commonwealth can be assured that the statements will be prepared promptly. There will thus be a savings in time, effort and costs and one set of documents that satisfy the financial accountability requirements of all parties.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On a related matter, the Committee has recommended that Commonwealth departments administering SPPs should liaise with the Department of Finance to determine whether SPP payments are being made on an optimal schedule and dates to minimise the Commonwealth's recourse to short term borrowing. Such a recommendation has the potential to save the Commonwealth considerable sums of money, as badly timed transfers can place pressure on the Commonwealth's cash holdings and contribute to the need for short term borrowings to cover any cash shortfalls. This recommendation compliments recommendations made in an earlier report by the Committeeâ€”Report 340, concerning cash management in the Commonwealth.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr President, the Committee believes that it is important that both the public and service deliverers are aware of the Commonwealth's financial contribution to the delivery of SPP funded services. In the Committee's experience it is all too easy for the Commonwealth's contribution to joint Commonwealth-state programs to be ignored. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that all SPP agreements should include arrangements to ensure that the Commonwealth's contribution is recognised in application documentation, approval announcements, media releases, official openings and other program publicity.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee acknowledges that implementation of some of its recommendations will not be easy, particularly for the large, ongoing SPPs in the health, education and community services areas. Reforms will be gradual, not just because of the difficulties in measuring outcomes and performance, but also because of the impossibility of quickly reorganising complex systems without service delivery suffering.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Despite the practical difficulties, it is important that the momentum for reform continues, particularly as the political will to do so exists. The Committee believes that its recommendations, if adopted, will ensure that the momentum is not lost and that SPP administration and accountability, as a whole is improved. Most importantly, those individuals or groups in the community who receive SPP funded services, of what ever form, should receive more efficient and effective service, delivered in the most economical way possible.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to express the Committee's thanks to those people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearing. I would also like to thank the staff of the Secretariat for assisting the Committee in preparing the Report. I commend the report to the Senate.

         It is a task of national significance and one which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts supports. Indeed the Improvement Project was established in response to one of the recommendations in the Committee's Report 326,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          An Assessment of Tax

         Report 343, contains the Committee's comments on evidence taken at a public hearing held in October this year. At this hearing 17 witnesses from government, from tax and accounting bodies, and from academia were invited to give their views on a range of issues relating to tax law improvement.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Our intention in presenting this report is not to call into question the work of the Improvement Project, much of which has been strongly supported in the Parliament and the wider community. Rather, our interest is to ensure that the opportunities we now have to reform our tax law come to fruition.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There are three main themes which emerged at our hearing and which are reflected in the report. These are:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         the scope of the terms of reference for the Improvement Project;
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         the way in which the rewritten law should be delivered to Parliament and implemented; and
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         the need for a separate forum to examine matters of tax policy.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I would like to touch briefly on each of these matters.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It has been said that the capacity of the Improvement Project to produce simplified tax law is limited by its inability to examine and propose changes to tax policy. Since the beginning its mandate has been to re-express, in simpler language, the law as it currently standsâ€”not to review current tax policy.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         After weighing the evidence, the Committee believes that the mandate of the Improvement Project is appropriate. To encumber the Project with a broader responsibility at this stage would jeopardise the chances of producing better tax law within the sort of timeframe set for the Project.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The second main theme discussed at the hearing was the delivery schedule for the rewritten legislation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Project Team is proposing to deliver the new law to Parliament progressively, as it is drafted, and to seek progressive implementation, with each instalment of the rewritten law commencing for the income year beginning after Royal Assent.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         An alternative view, which has some currency within the tax industry, is that a deferred commencement date should be set for the rewritten law at the completion of the Projectâ€”the so called `big bang' approach.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There are valid arguments in favour of both approaches, but on balance the Committee considers that progressive implementation of the rewritten legislation is a better option than deferring commencement of the legislation until the conclusion of the project.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The final and most contentious issue emerging from the hearing was in relation to the need for a separate forum to consider tax policy issues.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The evidence we received indicated widespread frustration in the tax and business communities about the way in which tax policy has evolved and is debated in Australia. This frustration generated a number or views about the need for an alternative tax policy forum, about how such a forum might be constituted and about what such a forum might consider.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Although the Committee is sympathetic to the concerns underpinning these views, in the end, the Committee does not support the calls for a new external forum for the development of tax policy.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The development of tax policy is, and will always remain, a government's prerogative. The Treasury is rightly the focus of tax policy development in Australia.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This is not to say that Treasury always gets it right, nor that tax policy should be determined in a vacuum.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We received evidence which was strongly critical of the way in which Treasury deals with stakeholders in the tax system. It seems to the Committee that Treasury could improve its performance in this area by adopting the sort of open and inclusive consultative processes used by the Improvement Project in its work.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Even though we believe Treasury is the appropriate body to convene and direct any consideration of the strategic direction of tax policy, there is a legitimate role for Parliament to play in ensuring that issues emerging from the work of the Improvement Project are given close consideration.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To this end the Committee intends to continue its watching brief in the area of tax law improvement. While I expect that most tax policy matters emerging from the Improvement Project would, in the normal course of events, be taken up by Treasury and the ATO, the Committee will follow up any significant matters which appear not to be receiving appropriate attention.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr President, opportunities for reform are rare and it is important that the momentum for change initiated by the establishment of the Improvement Project is not only maintained, but built upon.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Improvement Project shows every sign of achieving the objectives set for it. This is to the credit of all involved in the Project. I would like to particularly acknowledge the efforts of the Project Director, Brian Nolan, who is performing a difficult job with distinction.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Nevertheless, the Committee agrees with those who have argued that the Improvement Project should be seen as the first step in a more ambitious reform of the tax law.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Ultimately a tax simplification program must focus on more than rewriting the Tax Act, it must seek to review tax policy and simplify both the full body of tax law, and the administrative systems underpinning the law.

         This broader goal is the challenge which will confront governments over the next decade.

         â€”When the debate was adjourned last evening, I was talking about the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995 and what we feel is the ham-fisted attempt to target money to `those who need it most'â€”in the government's wordsâ€”which is the government's usual justification. I had mentioned that the amendment the government is suggesting will not result in any increased fairness. It will only make people find more expensive rental accommodation so as to be able to access rental assistance and have slightly more money to meet their needs. Therefore, I had foreshadowed that we would be opposing schedule 7 of the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995 in the committee stage.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another concern with this bill is the amendment under schedule 2. That amendment takes 15-year-olds on special benefits allowance and moves them on to the youth training allowance. I would like to know what the difference is in the amount of each of these benefits. If the minister is not able to provide me with that, perhaps we can ask that further in the committee stage.

         We have concerns with schedules 1, 2 and 4 of the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 3) 1995. Schedule 1 is about extended deeming. It seems to be a fairly neutral change in itself. But there seems to be the incongruous situation where valuation of investments for the purpose of taking the interest as income can be different for two people with exactly the same investments; this can occur because they can be valued at different moments in time. Therefore, there is no certainty for people to know how much of their income will be lost in amounts of deemed income. Approximately 200,000 pensioners will have their rates reduced because of deemed income from their investments. I would like to know how many students and youth will be affected in this same way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I would also question the amendment in schedule 2, which is to keep recipients of the youth training allowance who get sick for more than 13 weeks on that allowance, instead of transferring them to the sickness allowance. I would like to know what the difference in rates is between the twoâ€”if not at this stage, perhaps in the committee stage.

         I have mentioned my concerns at the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart into one, under schedule 4. I believe that it is important for the government to keep a rigorous collection of statistics of the success of case management based on the length of the person's unemployment. I do not believe that it should be easier for the government to lump all unemployed people together, as it may blur long-term unemployment issues and special management of long-term unemployed people in the future.

         The definitions of paid work, the type of training that long-term unemployed people can receive, the different styles of paid work they can access from self-employment, collective, cooperative or community based work and voluntary work need to be reassessed by the government for long-term unemployed people. Much effort is expended trying to get long-term unemployed people back into the full-time work force, instead of dealing also with their changing needs and new ways of looking at the concepts of `leisure' and `work'.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At another level, I am concerned that this amalgamation will lead to a further fudging of the statistics, blurring any true analysis of the success of case management. People working in this area would know of the number of questions I have asked as to how much the government can tell us about the success of case management; and the answer is that they can tell us very little.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Putting people into training for 13 to 16 weeks is sometimes of more benefit to a government who can claim that moving people from newstart to jobsearch allowance is solving the unemployment problem, rather than benefiting the people concerned. We need to deal with the unemployment problem by creating alternative definitions of work, looking at the needs of the whole person instead of seeing a person who is not in full-time work as idle, and targeting services with a flexibility that the current structure of case management does not permit but has the potential to provide.

         I would like to emphasise here that this does not mean that we are saying case management is wrong. We are saying that the government needs to know what they are trying to achieve with case management and should actually be working on outcomes and putting their resources into outcomes rather than putting resources into the squeaky wheel. I urge the government to take this to task. I also foreshadow that we will be opposing schedule 4 of the youth training allowance bill No. 3.

         â€”In closing this debate I would like to thank the senators from all sides of the parliament who have contributed to it. The bills that are before the parliament and are to be addressed today are the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bills Nos 2 and 3 for 1995. As has already been discussed, these are mainly mechanical bills to reflect changes that have been considered and approved by the Senate over the last few days to the Social Security Act. This will ensure that the youth training allowance is similar in nature to other Commonwealth income support.

         Before I address the bills, I would like to make some response to some of the comments that have been made here in the chamber. I would like to state that during the time of this government the number of unemployed 15- to 19-year-olds has fallen substantially. It has fallen from a level of 150,000 when the government came to office in 1983 to now around 90,00, a drop of 40 per cent in teenage unemployment.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Of course a lot of other things have happened over those 12 1/2 years as well. These days 15- to 19-year-olds are by and large not in the work force. They are at school or in TAFE training or higher education. Secondary participation has increased from around one in three going on to year 12 when the government came to office to three out of every four going on to year 12 now.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Commonwealth growth funding for the TAFE and training sector has also seen participation increase in that sector and the higher education undergraduate population has increased by over 50 per cent. These are indeed quite significant changes. This has happened because young people these days need additional skills to be able to enter the work force. The kinds of unskilled jobs that were available to 15- to 19-year-olds in the past, particularly the 15-year-old school leavers, have simply disappeared. To enter the work force in the 1990s young people require more than just a basic year 10 level.

         I would also like to refer to my government's achievements with apprenticeships and traineeships. The federal Labor government has been very successful during its period in office in seeing the labour force grow. The labour force has increased by around 25 per cent from some 6 1/2 million to around eight million. At the same time, the number of apprentices and trainees commencing has also increased.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I note particularly that the opposition should be aware that when they left office apprenticeship and traineeship commencements were of the order of 35,000. In the last year they numbered some 70,000, so we have doubled the performance of the opposition, whereas the teenage population has increased by only a little over 20 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government has introduced a range of other measures, including Austudy, Working Nation's youth training initiative and the recently announced jobs pathway guarantee program. These initiatives are delivering more opportunities than ever before for young people to participate in education and training which will lead to full-time employment. The youth training initiative is particularly important for those young people who leave school, possibly before they complete their studies, and experience difficulty in finding work. The YTI, as it is called, provides individual assistance through case management to encourage young people in this situation to undertake full-time study or to participate in approved training and jobsearch activities.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, the number of young people unemployed is still too many and is concentrated particularly in some regions. That is why the government has adopted a structure of area consultative committees, along with the case managers regime, to ensure that the attack on unemployment, particularly on youth unemployment, is concentrated on those regions where greatest assistance is needed. In addition, 52 specialist youth liaison positions have been established and placed in the Department of Employment, Education and Training regions with the highest youth need.

         â€”In relation to schedule 7, as I mentioned, we have a situation where we are having the rent assistance threshold raised by $5. Our arguments are that the administrative costs will virtually eat up all but $5 million of the proposed revenue over a period of several years, and basically it will make a number of people worse off. The logic of it totally escapes us. Therefore, on behalf of the Greens, I do not intend to support it.

         â€”In support of Senator Margetts's position, we have noticed that historically when this sort of thing happensâ€”and it need not be necessarily restricted to rent assistanceâ€”it is possible to expect that the persons who would be most advantaged after a very short period of time would be those who are renting out the properties. The increase seems to have been made with the intention of supporting those who are renting properties, but the landlords are more likely to be the ones who gain because their capacity to pass on that increase is not restricted in any way by what is before us.

         With it being very clear that further assistance is available, if an increase in the rent is brought about fairly quickly, the renters are not the people who gain the advantage. I would have thought that might have been obvious to the government in proposing this. With what Senator Margetts has reminded us ofâ€”the administrative costs and the other arrangementsâ€”it is hard to see how renting people are to be advantaged at all.

I think that was the nub of the issue. The senator also asked why young people who were sick would no longer transfer to sickness allowance for short periods of, say, up to 13 weeks. Again, this is to assist young people so they do not need to administratively transfer between allowances and they retain access to the full range of assistance available to the unemployed. Neither of these changes will affect the level of payments. That is my advice in terms of your question, Senator Margetts.

         â€”In like fashion, because of my intention to oppose schedule 4 in relation to amalgamating jobsearch and newstart, I would ask that the chamber first of all deal with schedule 4 and then with the rest of the bill. In schedule 4 we believe the government is trying to cover up who is long-term unemployed and who is short-term unemployed. Case management schemes have been a cover-up. There has also been the pretence of jobs cloaked in the guise of training, which moves the long-term unemployed for a period of 16 weeks into either training or subsidised employment which takes them off newstart long enough for them to get back onto jobsearch when they return to unemployment.

         This then skews the unemployment statistics and makes it look like the long-term unemployed are being helped. This then leaves the system open for creaming off the work ready, who are going to be picked up by the labour market anyway. The government can then claim unemployment is falling and cut huge amounts of spending from labour market programs.

         There are two principal matters involved in this debate. The first is the government's attempt to force an accelerated repayment of HECS upon existing and past students. We estimateâ€”in fact, we have had the advantage of the government figures in this regard, so I can say that they estimateâ€”that potentially some 800,000 Australian students are affected by the government's proposed change. It seeks to change the rules on students in relation to repayment of a HECS debt without the approval of those students. We argued in this place that that was unfair and, therefore, that it should be resisted.

         Unfortunately, the history of this government has been that it seeks to change the rules on students in relation to HECS, it seeks to lower the threshold and it seeks to force earlier repayment. It is not surprising that Australian students have become disillusioned about these continual breaches of promise.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We see no reason why we should back down on this. It is really just akin to another tax. Students entered into a compact with government whereby, in undertaking higher education, they agreed to accept the burden of part of the cost of that higher education, which becomes a debtâ€”the higher contribution debtâ€”and they agreed to repay that debt on certain terms and conditions. The government should not then subsequently seek through legislation to change the rules to unilaterally and retrospectively change the student obligations. We have stood by Australian students, both existing and past students, in this debate and against the government's attempt to disadvantage them in this way, and we continue to stand on that position.

         The second issue related to the government's attempt to change the eligibility rule for HECS from permanent residence to citizenship. Again, we said this was unfair as it applied to those current permanent residents in Australia. It is much the same principle, but in this case when you enter Australia on certain terms and conditions we could not see why those terms and conditions, as they applied to the benefit of a HECS funded education, should not be changed unilaterally. We see no reason to depart from that position either.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With regard to future students, we think a different situation applies. We can argue about what is the appropriate level of HECS repayment of HECS debt or the terms of repayment for future students. Although we may in this instance have different views from that of the government, nevertheless, we think there is a different principle when future students decide to accept the offer of substantial publicly funded higher education on different terms and conditions from the past. Students either accept the offer of support from government or they do not. That is why we think that is fundamentally different from seeking to change the rules on students who have already been educated or are being educated on certain terms and conditions.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Similarly, we think the same principle applies in relation to those entering this country. If they enter this country knowing that HECS eligibility is based on citizenship rather than permanent residency, that is the basis upon which they take the HECS opportunity. It is fundamentally different from those who have entered on different terms and conditions.

         We are not talking about very large sums of money in this instance.

         One would not have thought the Senate's decision to stand by students in this instance could therefore logically have any effect upon the government's capacity to fund higher education overall. It obviously has no relevance at all. Unfortunately, Minister Crean has entered upon a path of political blackmail in that he has said unless the Senate passes this bill and inflicts this extra burden on existing and past students, he will refuse to fund additional places that are necessary in higher education. The interesting thing is that this government had already made the promise of those additional places.

         The government took the kudos and finally acknowledged it was undersupplying places to areas of population growth in Australiaâ€”in particular, Queensland, Western Australia and a small number of places in northern Tasmania. These were areas that had been disadvantaged relative to the rest of Australia. I remind you, Madam Temporary Chairman, that we have been calling for the provision of those places for a long time. Finally, the government determined it would meet that public obligation and announced those places. It attached no conditions to that whatsoever.

         Because the government has realised all of a sudden that Queensland is too politically sensitive, it has now changed its position from that which it was threatening in the lead-up to last weekend and during last weekend, which is that it would cut Queensland places. It has now, as I understand itâ€”and Senator Cook will no doubt confirm thisâ€”decided it will not cut Queensland places. The latest threat from Minister Crean which he put out to the press yesterday was to provide the places in Queensland and instead to cut them from South Australia and Victoria. That is equally appalling.

That was bad enough in itself, but it is now going further and threatening to withdraw a further 4,000 university places from Victoriaâ€”another exercise in political blackmail. Queensland is too difficult because the government has a whole series of seats that are threatened at the next election in Queensland. So let us quarantine Queensland and take the pain out on the southern states of Victoria and South Australia.

         This government may not understand that, due to the incompetence of previous state Labor governments in particular, both South Australia and Victoria were practically bankrupted. We now have Liberal and coalition governments in those states trying to rebuild the economies in ways that produce more high value added jobs. The success of that economic strategy initiative is very dependent upon the higher education sector in South Australia and Victoria educating enough graduates to contribute to the economic restructuring and, therefore, the rebuilding of wealth in both South Australia and Victoria.

In an interview on Brisbane radio last Friday he said that was another option that was open to him. The minister has been, I understand, communicating with the universities now threatening to do this in order that they might apply greater pressure on us to change our position and to endorse his requirement for earlier repayment of HECS by existing and past Australian students.

This bill does not refer to that at all. This bill is about other matters, such as the earlier repayment of HECS and changing the test from permanent residency to citizenship. There is nothing in this bill that links those two matters together.

         â€”This chamber should insist on the opposition's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) which would grandfather the increases to HECS repayments, the lowering of HECS repayment thresholds and the reclassification in relation to Australian residents so that current students will not be affected. An incredible amount of codswallop has been talked about in the other place in relation to the changes that were made in this place. There was also the most appalling examples of divide and rule in an attempt to set one part of the university system against the other by saying that one group must be responsible for accepting cuts so that another group can get the funding that they need.

         In the last couple of years we have noticed levels of underspending in a number of government areas, and the disguised cuts would indicate that the government is clearly responsible for any decisions it made in spending or not spending. It is not this chamber's decision not to support funding for higher education places. There is clearly a need in terms of research. It is felt, as indicated, that at least a couple of hundred million dollars is needed to just keep up with what has happened in the depreciation in research. There is an implied threat that research might be the next to go, and that is appalling. That would not be a clever thing to do. Allowing that kind of education capital to go down will not save money in the long run.

         As I say, the whole approach of setting one group of students against another and making them responsible for the government's proposals to cut funding in any way in higher education is disgraceful. It is time that senators stood up and said that it is not right. If the government is deciding to cut funding for extra places, that is their decision. The fact that there is not even more demand for places is largely due to the government making it a Hobson's choice for many students in relation to surviving through university. The fact that the government are even talking about decreasing in some areas the standards for acceptance in universities indicates that they may have gone too far.

         We have had a number of figures bandied about in relation to this. Minister Schacht was in the chamber the other day attempting to blind us with science and to convince us with some statistics. The statistics were never based on any contribution from the government which enabled us to recognise fact and reality; they seemed more to be statistics which were convenient and numbers which were becoming bigger as the minister's eyes grew wider.

That number was used in quite a cavalier fashion without a lot of responsibility and thought attached to it. The government seemed to be quite ready to depart with $7 million to assist one of the world's richest men to engage in a speculative project and to help him spend some money on some sort of Disneyland project in Sydney.

         The logical foundation of what everybody in this chamber has said is that you can spend money without raising it; that if you create new places you can fund them from some vague part of the budget. I am not particularly surprised by the Greens and the Australian Democrats because it is not entirely inconsistent for them to assume that, in economic management, you can spend without raising taxes and have outlays without getting income and without going into deficit. There has been a consistent threat in a number of their policies, put forward on a populist front appealing to sectional interests, to agree to every spending operation that comes along without having to fund them.

         For example, the package that the government has put forward is one which raises $50 million in the higher education budget in the 1996-98 triennium, which translates into 5,000 new student places. The opposition wants the places, but it will not raise the money. It somehow says, `Well, you go off and find the money.' And, after having punched several holes in our budget since May of this year, opposition members at macro-economic level then attack the government on the basis of: is the budget in surplus or deficit? At sectional interest level, they go around punching holes daily and without any fiscal rectitude or responsibility, appealing to populist sentiment that you can give places without funding them.

         â€”Very briefly I want to respond to a few things that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) said. Firstly, I regret that he is continuing this approach of the government to threaten students and future students and to set existing students against future students. It is depressing to hear a government advocating such an approach to politics in this country.

         Secondly, I regret that he did not tell the whole truth in relation to the letters of representation. I think if he is prepared to face up to that truth he will come back and tell you that NUS has been against, and continues to be against, the change from permanent residency to citizenship, and that is contained in the letters that he was referring to just a few moments ago. But he did not tell you that at all. He said that they were totally locked in to the government's package, and that is simply not the case.

The government is coming in here today and saying that students should have appreciated that, when the minister said he was going to improve the operation of the scheme, he meant that he was going to legislatively require them to repay the debt earlier. If you, Senator Crowley, say that was a fair representation to students, then you are kidding yourself. When Minister Crean in effect said on Brisbane radio last Friday that students knew the obligation they had because he came clean with them in his press release of 9 May 1995, he was being totally misleading.

         The real issue is a question of priority of expenditure, when it comes down to the crunch. Honourable senators will remember that Prime Minister Keating was prepared to apply $150 million of taxpayers' money as a contribution to the demolition of the Cahill Expressway in Sydney because he regarded it as an eyesore. Yet he is not prepared to allocate public money to provide these extra places in higher education.

It is not a revenue raising measure; it is a revenue accelerating measure. This means that there is nobody left in the Senate to blame for the revenue hole later for the same funded places. It is a total nonsense to say that accelerating payments now will create a revenue hole. It only means that you have to fudge figures later or find someone else to blame.

         â€”The minister spent some time trying to assert blame. It looked very much like somebody pointing with both hands in different directions, claiming, `It wasn't me, Your Honour. It wasn't me, Sir.' I think the electorate will recognise that this government has a responsibility which it is trying to avoid. It has a responsibility which it recognised by declaring that new university places would be made available, but to tie it to a particular group of people and say, `You students will pay for it' is to confuse an obligation.

         To suggest that we in this place want that to be done without any further revenue raising from any source at all is to entirely misrepresent our position. We are quite happy to consider a more appropriate tax regime. We are quite happy to recognise that it is the entire community which benefits from an investment in education and that, therefore, it is the entire community which should recognise its responsibility to fund it. But to assert that we come in here and do not want to consider those is based on no foundation whatsoever. The minister, in pointing his hands in all directions but at himself and saying, `You're to blame, not me,' is really conducting an exercise which will be recognised by the electorate for what it is: a desperate way of trying to fund it without being brave enough as a government to say, `Well, the community should pay for these extra places'â€”the entire community, not the student community.

         That has been our position all along. Our position has been that there should be no discrimination, that the ends do not justify the means in this case. The government has described the ends as being a wonderful situation where new university places can be funded and has said that that, therefore, justifies discrimination and justifies changing the rules, as Senator Hill said, without the approval of studentsâ€”a unilateral movement by the government from a compact, bargain or agreement, whatever it might have been, that was made with students at the time as to how much contribution they would make, how they would make it and when they would make it. The government has made a unilateral alteration to that without the agreement of the other party to the compact, agreement or deal. That is not fair. It is not fair in our society. That is not how we do things in other areas. That is not how people understand agreements to be made.

         If the government chooses to do that and say that because the ends are desirable, because it is desirable that we have extra places, that justifies this unfair strategy, then let the government be judged on that, because I contend that the ends do not justify the means. It is almost as good as saying, `We are going to put a GST on food for blue-eyed children only and all the others will be free from it. We will discriminate in certain areas because we are going to do something good with the money that we get from it.' I just cannot understand how a government from this perspective can propose such unfair and discriminatory practices as this accelerated HECS repayment and this discriminatory residents versus citizens debate. It would be a different matter if we had a society which was based on such a foundation, but we do not. It does not apply to the other activities of government, to the other obligations of government, so why should it apply here?

         We have, of course, contended in the past that the whole HECS scheme itself is in contravention of our international obligations to not charge fees for education.

I am indebted to Mr Dudley Kavanagh, a law graduate in Tasmania, who has done a considerable amount of research in this matter.

         I think it is very important to recognise, Senator Bell, that not everybody goes to university. If you have a look at who still gets access to university, it is very much a section of the community which in the past we would have called privileged. Although we have expanded very much the number of people who do have access to our universities through our special programs and targeted ways of assisting people not usually expecting to go to university to have access, still and all you would have to say the majority of people who go to our universities are people who will then have the benefits of that education and very often access to assistance through their primary and secondary schooling that is not available to all families.

         It is not reasonable to talk about students repaying either because it does carry the implication that students while they are being students have the obligation to pay. Once students are finished their courses and are then working as professionals, as people employed in all sorts of areas, they then get to pay back the HECS. They are not paying it back as students. Again, I would say that is open to misinterpretation. The government is not persuaded by any of the arguments put by the opposition to change its mind. It looks as though, from what you have said, that none of you are prepared to change your mind, so I think we would all be assisted if we proceeded to the vote.

         â€”The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), and the two bills relating to the franking deficit and deficit deferral constitute a huge package of tax changes. Many of them are incredibly complex. They add hundreds more pages to the taxation laws. It is, quite frankly, disgraceful that the Senate is debating these bills only now, in the dying days of the spring sittings, and possibly the last three days of this parliament.

         The government has had months to get these bills into order. These are taxation bills which flow from the budget or, indeed, from some earlier decisions prior to the budget. It is an indictment of the government's inability to manage its legislative program and a clear indicator of the disregard and contempt shown by this government towards the parliament that we are now, in such a compressed period of time and at such a late part of the session, debating the bills at all.

         The fact that we are required to debate the whole package cognately, which greatly truncates the time available for debate, simply compounds the disgrace. How on earth can complex legislation of this nature that touches every Australian in one way or another be given adequate consideration in this time frame? It is blindingly obvious that the answer is that it cannot. Let me put down at the outset the coalition's attitude towards the two major bills: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995.

         In respect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995â€”and I will try to talk about some of the details laterâ€”the coalition is totally opposed to the government's attempt to destroy employee share acquisition schemes. We will, accordingly, be voting against that part of the bill. We will also move amendments to those parts dealing with the capital gains tax, rollover relief for merging superannuation funds, the proposals relating to local government councillors and the proposals relating to late lodgment penalties. We believe that in some of those the drafting is very faulty and inequitable. We will be seeking to improve those.

        It would be the coalition's intention that, when schedule 7 is eventually approved, maybe amended, as a result of the Senate committee's examination, the provisions of the bill should date from 9 May 1995, the date of the last budget, as the government has proposed in the bill.

Time will prevent me from commenting at all during this speech on the second reading debate on the other two bills; namely, the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill 1995 and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Amendment Bill 1995.

         I will turn first to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. This is an omnibus bill dealing with tax exemptions for state and territory bodies, employee share acquisition schemes, refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error, pensions, allowances and benefits, superannuation measures, late lodgment penalties and sales tax. The most substantive changes in this bill are contained in schedule 2, which deals with the tax treatment of employee share acquisition schemes. It is on that aspect that I would like to focus my comments.

         Schedule 2 replaces section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act with a new division 13A, which provides for the taxation of shares or rights provided to employees under an employee share acquisition scheme, commonly known as ESAS. This is the third occasion that this Labor government has attempted to legislate workable tax rules for employee share acquisition schemes, and it is the third occasion on which it has, sadly, failed. The reasons for that are complex, but basically the heart of it lies in the concern that the union movement and members of the rank and file of the Labor Party have in terms of employees having a stake in the businesses they work for.

         The government claims that these changes are necessary to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislation and to ensure that the tax concessions available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company in which they are employed or a holding company of the employer. The government claims that the measures will increase the taxation benefits available to employees under these schemes.

         The government's claims are clearly one thing; the consequences of the legislation are quite another. When the current Treasurer (Mr Willis) decided to bring employee share acquisition schemes within the net of the fringe benefits tax, the consequences of his actions were made clear. The government was warned, but they refused to take advice from anyone involved in the schemes. They refused to listen to the concerns of industry. They even refused to listen to warnings from within Treasury. As is typical of this government, the Treasurer attacked the messenger, by claiming that anyone who disagreed with the government was a supporter of tax avoidance. That was a cowardly response and unbecoming of the Treasurer of this nation.

That is absolute. It is a commitment set in stone.

         Let me make it equally clear that the coalition does not believe that our tax laws can be treated as if they are an end in themselves. They are not something which can be brazenly separated from the operation of the Australian economy and Australian society. Our tax laws must be drafted to take account of commercial, social and political reality. Sadly, it is apparent that our tax laws in respect of share acquisition schemes have been drafted only to achieve a fiscal outcome and to satisfy a political goal. The commercial reality and the social desirability of these schemes have been ignored.

         The coalition was not surprised when the Treasurer was finally forced to concede, at the end of March this year, that his plan to impose fringe benefits tax on employee share acquisition schemes was ill-conceived and ill-considered. The proposed changes contained in this bill are the result of the Treasurer's earlier intransigence to reason. They are the result of the government's isolation from reality and its shelter in economic theory.

         What is even more critical, though, is that these changesâ€”the latest changes in this billâ€”are also wrong. The government could have acted to amend section 26AAC to take out its flaws, which are recognised. Instead, the government proposes to introduce a new taxation regime which is only designed to make share acquisition schemes less attractive and less available to ordinary Australian workers. The proposals threaten the viability of current schemes and they restrict the potential for further expansion of employee share ownership.

         The notion that employees should share in the wealth of the enterprise that they work in must surely be supported by every member of this chamber. Does any senator seriously argue that employees should not be able to enjoy the benefit of holding a stake in the future success of their employer, or that they should not have the opportunity to tie their own financial advancement to that of the company they work with and for? Certainly the coalition has no doubt on that score. We are totally supportive of employee share schemes that achieve that end.

         I cannot believe that the government does not appreciate the benefit of these schemes. The benefit of employees having a capital share of their employer and the productivity and industrial relations benefits of these schemes should be unquestionable. Recent studies have indicated that the top 350 companies with a share plan outperform on every measure those without one.

         â€”I am pleased to be able to speak on behalf of the coalition in support of the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which contains a number of amendments to various acts and is designed to implement the changes which were announced by the government in the budget. This is the second and final bill covering budget measures for veterans. Many of these amendments, as we see each year, mirror the changes that have been included in social security legislation and they are designed to bring veterans into line with the provisions which are operating under the Department of Social Security. The opposition does accept that the majority of the provisions in the legislation are designed to benefit veterans.

         The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) in his second reading speech in the other place specifically mentioned the needs of older veterans, most of whom are now in their 70s and who served in World War II. I agree with the minister that, while this has been an important year in which we have commemorated the achievements and the sacrifices of our veterans from that conflict, it is important that we also look ahead in seeking to improve the way in which we respond to the needs of veterans. Of particular importance at the moment is the needs of aging veterans. The focus on an elderly constituency has to be that much greater.

         I am pleased that there is now an initiative in developing a program for discharge planning. It is a matter which I raised at a meeting in Launceston only a few months ago. There has been much community concern there at the failure of hospitals and the department to work effectively together to put in place measures to support veterans and war widows when they are being discharged from hospital.

         All around Australia these days people are being discharged earlier and earlier. Many go home to an empty home or to a very frail spouse. These things have to be taken into account and planned for in advance so that we do not send veterans and war widows home to a crisis situation which so often leads to readmission to hospital and sometimes even worse. So I am very glad to see that initiative and the development of that program. I look forward to it being well introduced all around Australia with not much delay.

         I also have a particular affection for the program which enables carers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs to have respite care provided in the home. So many elderly people, especially if they become frail and confused, become even more frail and confused if respite care is provided in an institution with which they are not familiar. I would like to see the department focus more on the resources going into respite care in the home, wherever appropriate, of course, rather than in an institution. It is certainly much more cost-effective to provide it in the home and I think it is better for the veterans and the elderly war widows.

I was also delighted to hear last night that a veteran has been successful before the High Court in not having to provide his tax file number. This is something that some of us have been concerned about for a very long time. I am glad to hear that, on the grounds of privacy, apparently, he won. I have no more information than that at this stage. Good for him.

         Not only is this a great occasion for Vietnam veterans and their families to have a reunion, as a senator for Tasmania I can say proudly that it is also an opportunity for people to come and see our beautiful state, enjoy its heritage, perhaps some fishing, perhaps some snow, or whatever it is they would like to do in Tasmania. We are very proud of our state and it would be very worthwhile for people to combine the convention with a holiday. It is also an important convention for Tasmania from a financial point of view. Obviously, it is in the interests of everybody in Tasmania to encourage Vietnam veterans to come down and see us in August next year.

         The other matter relating to this conference that I would like to raise is financial assistance. The Tasmanian Vietnam veterans have made a huge undertaking but the resources they have are not all that great. I am very glad that the Liberal state government has made a financial contribution, undertaking to help with the costs. But, to date, there has been no such commitment from the Commonwealthâ€”which, after all, is the level of government which sent these men away to fight on Australia's behalf. Surely, it is not too much to ask that the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs make a contribution to support this important reunion and convention.

         I take this opportunity to call on the federal government to match the state contribution dollar for dollar, and to make it clear soon that they will do it. After all, when planning a convention you need to know well ahead what resources you can call on if you are going to be as effective as you can be. I find it very strange that the Commonwealth, which has been approached on this matter, has not been prepared to make that commitment. I urge the government to think about this very carefully.

         This will be no ordinary conference because the organising committee hopes to provide a forum for veterans to continue to strive for reconciliation and to fight for recognition from mainstream Australia. The convention will also provide an opportunity to air grievances, discuss needs, and meet with the government and its representatives. They will also be having workshops, which will be joint efforts between the veterans, the association and the government to discuss current and new issues.

         I think the convention will also provide an opportunity for discussions on the future involvement of the Vietnam veteran as a representative Australian veteran. As our World War II veterans age, the leadership of the veterans' community will start to pass, as it already has, to the Vietnam veterans. It is very important to these veterans themselves and to our country that they be included as an honoured part of our veterans' communityâ€”and that means that at the government level, the RSL level, with other veterans' organisations and in the wider community Vietnam veterans of Australia feel that they are honoured, as their fathers and grandfathers have been.

As we have such a short time today and, indeed, wanted to see this legislation passed before the end of the session, we have agreed to have it during the non-controversial business time.

         However, the Democrats do have one or two areas of concern. In view of the shortness of time, I would just mention those particular concerns. We have been contacted by Aged Care Australia, who are worried about the administration of the residential care allowance. They foresee nursing homes and hostels being involved in considerable changes to the fee charging arrangements when the administration of this allowance reverts to the Department of Human Services and Health in one or two years time. They have written to the department expressing their concerns and are awaiting a reply. The Australian Democrats will be carefully monitoring the implementation of this new scheme.

         Our second area of concern is the change in the threshold for rent assistance. My colleague Senator Woodley has already addressed this at considerable length yesterday when we discussed the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995. Whilst we welcome the increase in rent assistance payable to single or illness-separated pensioners, or to pensioner couples with dependent children, by $5 a fortnight, we are disappointed to see that this will be paid for by an increase in the rent threshold for all pensioners.

         The increase in rent assistance will cost the government $0.23 million in the four years to 1998-99, yet the increase in the rent threshold of the same time frame will save $4.05 million. In other words, the winners in this policy change, those who gain, will do so at the expense of other veteran pensionersâ€”and there is still, for the government, a substantial net gain.

         I would like to take the opportunity to mention very briefly that we have been receiving frequent and very serious complaints about HACC services for veterans. These appear to relate to a couple of states in particular, but they are certainly Australia-wide. In this regard it seems that a number of states are not carrying out their obligations. Certainly, as veterans age, they are going to require additional home based services.

It contains a range of measures which were announced at the time of the budget in May this year. The majority of these changes are most welcome.

         The first problem is the increase in the rent threshold for those receiving rent assistance. I thought that the Democrats would be putting an amendment to overturn this measure, and such an amendment would have had support. However, on listening to Senator Lees I realise that, because of Senator Woodley's failure to convince the chamber of support for similar amendments in yesterday's debate on the social security bills, the Democrats will not be proceeding with that intention. Therefore, I want to express the concern of the Greens on this issue. We would certainly vote against this part of the bill if it were going to the vote.

         The other measure is the increase in the guardian's allowance. As with the Social Security bill dealing with this matter, the increase is to take effect in September next year. This is a budget measure announced in May this year, and the government is getting the kudos for having announced it in May this year, but is not intending to deliver on that promise until September of next year. We believe that that is an outrageous and unacceptable delay for those awaiting this much needed increase. We will put an amendment which brings forward the increase to December of this year and I trust that the amendment will gain the necessary support. It is not a fair commitment by the government in the budget to then defer it to such a degree that it disappoints the people who had assumed that they were going to receive some consideration under this measure.

At this point, I state a personal protest at the way in which the government has organised the program so that bills that are clearly worthy of some debate of the decisions being made are being crammed into the lunchtime. It is a failure in democracy that divisions cannot be called. In that respect, this bill should not be appearing at this time. It does not have the consensus of the chamber and it should not be here.

         I will probably reiterate that remark from time to time over the next two days because I believe that the government, instead of prioritising its bills, and limiting it to those that are absolutely essential, has used what I could only class as emotional blackmail on those people who feel that they want to support the good measures in this bill by forcing them to limit the debate on measures within it that are not desirable. Because the Greens are supporting the bill, I am simply making that personal protest. I would urge the government and the opposition to give consideration to my amendment and support it when it comes to the committee stage.

        This amendment brings the guardian allowance forward from 19 September 1996 to 7 December 1995, and I have indicated why that should be the case. It is a government promise. If it were simply I who disagreed with the failure of the government to institute this promise, that would be a legitimate matter to marginalise. However, in speaking on this, I am speaking for all the people who are recipients of the guardian allowance and I do not think in that way it should be marginalised.

         The child-care rebate is aimed at strengthening the act and clarifying and helping to facilitate certain procedural aspects of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. Several of these amendments provide hardship provisions to help those people who are currently excluded from the rebate scheme but who should be able to get it: for example, children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special needs requiring ongoing child care; carers under the age of 18 who have certain child-care qualifications; and parents who are currently unable to have work related commitments because of extenuating circumstances.

These other administrative arrangements allow the delegation of powers by the managing director of the commission, allow the minister some discretion over receipting requirements, strengthen powers to overcome overpayments of the rebate, allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the date at which they were first eligible to register, also cancel family or carer registrations and recover payments when an administrative error has been made. They also ensure that the rebate is not paid for child-care costs which have been, or will be, reimbursed by another agent such as an employer. They clarify that the rebate is payable for child-care costs incurred for certain specified absences from care and also clarify the backdating of family registrations, as well as the eligibility of overseas students to claim the rebate, by amending the courses of study that are described and correct technical defects in the act.

         The amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to the Health Insurance Commission is an amendment to expressly give the Health Insurance Commission the function of providing consultancy and management services to the Commonwealth and other Commonwealth bodies. The amendment also enables the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized pursuant to the execution of a search warrant until the reason for its seizure no longer exists or a decision is made not to use it in evidence. The National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 has amendments to specify that, before appointing the chairperson of the council, the chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee or a member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research, the minister will consult with each state and territory health minister.

         There is also an amendment relating to exempt bed status by giving the minister the power to revoke or suspend this status if the nursing home fails to satisfy nursing home care standards. This is because a criterion for granting an exempt bed status is that the home provides a higher standard of accommodation and services than normal. This amendment will ensure that standards are maintained and make sure that the extra charges for these nursing homes are justified. This is something that is very important and is an issue which Senator Patterson has pursued in estimates, particularly before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee.

         An example she raised during the February estimates earlier this year highlighted this fact. Without mentioning names, there was a nursing home in Victoria which was charging excessively high fees and not providing adequate services accordingly. In fact, in a standard monitoring visiting report done by the federal Department of Human Services and Health, of 31 standards only eight were met. Yet, because it was an exempt bed status nursing home, it was charging $915 a week. Of course, the department had received complaints from relatives and patients, and from the time she raised it, it had been six months without any action. Hopefully, this amendment will prevent this situation occurring again.

         While the coalition supports this amendment, it is merely a small step in the direction of things that need to be done. Australia's ageing population is increasing in numbers and is obviously going to continue to do so. This is something that the government continues to ignore. Over and over again, we see cases of Labor discriminating against and neglecting our older Australians. Over and over again, we point out these policies and actions hurting the aged and over and over again, the government turns a blind eye, ignoring these problems and failing to take adequate action.

         I turn now to the treatment of dementia. The government has failed to recognise the needs of people with dementia. Ambulant dementia sufferers who have severe behavioural problems often have been inappropriately `integrated' with other hostel and nursing home residents. In many cases, the dementia sufferer is disruptive and can negatively affect the quality of life of other residents in the integrated facility. Where dementia-specific hostels have been established, the inadequate level of government funding has rendered the facilities unviable unless they are cross-subsidised from other sections of the aged care facility. Despite desperate pleas from the aged care sector, the government has refused to consider a more appropriate level of funding for these residents.

Carers are also affected. Only $10 million has been allocated over three years in the budget, that is, only $3 million per year which would go nowhere to meet the needs of carers for income support. Carers such as residential aged carers have been discouraged by the lack of trust and respect the Labor government is giving them.

         â€”The Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 June despite the fact that it is, in the main, a non-controversial bill, was not debated in the House of Representatives until 28 September. It has now been with us for some time but has not managed to struggle its way up the list. It is an important bill, despite the fact that it is non-controversial in the sense that the opposition does not oppose the bill. It is an indictment, again, of the government's conduct of business in this place that it leaves a bill of this nature to be debated on what is the second or third last sitting day of this sessionâ€”and possibly the second or third last sitting day of the parliament. The bill gives effect to the government's decision announced in the 1995-96 budget to amalgamate the Merit Protection Review Agency, the MPRA, and the Public Service Commission, PSC, to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission.

         By way of background to this move, following the abolition of the Public Service Board as part of the extensive machinery of government changes which were made back in 1987, three central agencies were given defined roles in relation to personnel management and industrial relations in the Australian Public Service. These agencies are: the Department of Industrial Relations; the Department of Finance; and the Public Service Commission. The Public Service Commission has approximately 150 staff and a running cost budget of around $17 million, although its net outlays in 1995-96 will be only $13.25, according to pages 64 and 65 of the portfolio budget statements for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Non-SES staff comprise a very large number of staffâ€”about 140,000.

         This bill looks at the amalgamation of two important agencies. As I said, it is a pity that there has been such a delay in the bill being debated. It is worth pointing out that the decision to amalgamate is contrary to the recommendation in the report of the Public Service Act Review Group, commonly called the McLeod report. That report was released in January of this year. That group was set up under the chairmanship of Mr McLeod to review the Public Service Act, and it did not, in its report, recommend the merger of the Public Service Commission with the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Indeed, it recommended that the Merit Protection and Review Agency remain separate. The agency, by its nature, is a joint union and management body whereas the Public Service Commission is all about management structures. Whilst the two are somewhat complementary, they are of themselves very different.

         The coalition will not be opposing the legislation. Indeed, we support the legislation but there are a couple of points that need to be made about the Public Service. I make these points bearing in mind the fact that the savings to be achieved as a result of the amalgamation are said to be modest. So it is not going to achieve a big deal with respect to savings and government finances. One of the things that concerns the coalition is that it appears that Ms Forward, the Director of the Merit Protection and Review Agencyâ€”and this emerged from evidence that she gave at the Senate estimates hearings earlier this yearâ€”was not consulted in any significant way, if at all, about the amalgamation before the announcement of the amalgamation. It was during those hearings that my colleague Senator Minchin asked:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Were you given the opportunity for consultations about the advantages or disadvantages of this prior to a decision being made or was it something that you read about in the newspaper?
       </para>
       <para>
        Ms Forward responded:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Neither of these reflects the facts of the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, quite clearly, she did not have much of an input into what was going to happen. It is equally clear, I think, that the agency or its principal officers feel that a greater degree of consultation would have been desirable before the decision was taken on the agency's future. That this consultation did not occur is a reflection, I think, of this government's lack of commitment to both the principles and practices of open government. If the government is unwilling to enter into consultations with its own employees, it is little wonder that the general public is cynical, and increasingly so, of the government's advocacy of open government.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are several other issues that the coalition wishes to raise about this proposal. The effect of the proposal will be that members of the agency, including the director, will retain their officers after the merger whilst the Public Service Commissioner will have the powers of a secretary in relation to the staff of the new commission. It is expected that the Merit Protection Commissioner will exercise personnel and financial management powers in relation to officers required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act.

         Three issues have been raised regarding this bill. Firstly, is the amalgamated agency guaranteed continued resourcing and independence? Secondly, will the proposals of the McLeod report be implemented in full and, if so, will the agency's workload decline as a result? Thirdly, is it appropriate to create one body which both makes personnel management rules and adjudicates on grievances arising from the administration of those rules?

         They are important questions and I think that people can have genuinely held, differing views on those, on all of them really, but particularly on the question of whether one organisation should be able to make both personnel management rules and adjudicate on grievances arising from the administration of those rules. We may have had some similar experience of this in the past but, for most of the period of the Commonwealth Public Service, there has been a separation, as I recall it, of the agencies that look at the promotion and appeals system compared with those that are formulating the personnel management rules.

         That is not to say that putting the two together will necessarily cause problems of a great magnitude, but it is something that will need to be handled very carefully. I hope that the parliament will have an opportunity to monitor the progress of the amalgamated body to ensure that the concerns that have been raised by some people in relation to the amalgamation so far as that aspect is concerned are not actually fulfilled.

         An additional issue concerns the functioning of the MPRA itself and the manner in which it conducts its investigations. That is evidenced by the controversy surrounding the investigations into the management of the Australian War Memorial which have beenâ€”and I think still areâ€”the subject of legal action. They have caused considerable community concern and they have raised serious questions about the agency's procedures. That is a separate issue to some extent from the question of the future of the agency itself, but they are matters of concern. In the amalgamated organisation it will be important that those matters are reviewed so that the concerns that have been expressed, and the questions that have been raised, about the quality and nature of the Merit Protection Review Agency's procedures are fully examined and that, where change is necessary, the changes be made.

         As I said, the financial impact of the proposals is smallâ€”indeed, somewhat surprisingly small, in my view. The combined budget of the two agencies is something of the order of $20 million per annum. According to the explanatory memorandum, the amalgamation will reduce outlays only by approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and in subsequent years. Any saving is a worthwhile saving, but it does surprise me that the saving is as small as that. It is a very small proportion of the combined budget.

         Having said those things, the coalition supports the amalgamation. It is an important developmental step in Public Service procedures. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) is able to comment on this, but I have just received today in the rounds the statement by Gary Johns, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters.

         The document presents an outline of a Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 which proposes a major rewrite of the Public Service Act. Amongst other things, it says that in May of this year the government accepted Mr Johns's recommendation that the 1922 act should be repealed and replaced with a new Public Service Act. He said that there were three major reasons why we need a new act: firstly, that the current act is too complex and hard to read; secondly, that it is out of date; and, thirdly, that it is inconsistent with the current management philosophy and the prevailing community-wide industrial relations system. He goes on to say that the new act will embody a series of principles governing the employer-employee relationship within the Australian Public Service to ensure that employees are aware of their rights as well as their responsibilities.

         â€”In respect to the savings to be achieved, Senator Short has said they are modest: approximately $200,000, from a joint agencies budget of $2 million. Certainly, $200,000 is modest in that context, but a saving is a saving. In government it is important to continually be looking at more efficient ways in which the Public Service can be structured and, particularly, in government, if we are seeking to finance expenditure from savings, every dollars counts.

         Concerning the comments about Ms Ann Forward expressing her concerns, it has been reported to me that relationships between the two organisations to be amalgamated are very productive and cooperative and any difficulties that may have been expressed are largely put to rest. The statement that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Mr Gary Johns, has released really is unconnected with the legislation in the sense that it is a progress report on the review of the Public Service Act. I understand there will be an act introduced in the new year. While I am on this issue, I would point out that the McLeod report did not make a recommendation on the amalgamation of the two organisations that we are dealing with in the legislation. It did not make a comment either for or against. It did review the agencies but it did not say, `Don't amalgamate them,' or `Do amalgamate them,' so the report was neutral in that sense. I thank Senator Short for his contribution.

         â€”The Industry Commission Amendment Bill 1995 amends the Industry Commission Act of 1989 to allow greater flexibility in the operation of the Industry Commission. The bill contains four main amendments. The first amendment is to allow the appointment of commissioners, other than the chairperson, on a part-time basis in addition to the current full-time basis. The second amendment is to allow a consequential increase in the maximum number of commissioners, other than the chairperson, from eight to 11. The third amendment is to allow a single commissioner to act on behalf of all other commissioners on an inquiry in the absence of other commissioners, but limits inquiries to public hearings and then only in emergency situations.

         The final amendment is to require full-time commissioners to obtain the consent of the minister to engage in paid employment outside the duties of his or her office. The amendment also is to restrict part-time commissioners from engaging in paid employment that, in the minister's opinion, conflicts with the proper performance of the commissioner's duties. The amendments are, overall, sensible proposals for amendment, and the coalition does not oppose these changes.

         There are some points to be made in relation to at least two of the amendments. The first amendment to allow the appointment of commissioners, other than the chairperson, on a part-time basis in addition to the current full-time basis is aimed at increasing the commission's chances of attracting a more diverse range of suitably qualified people. The commission will be able to recruit people holding other positions who are unwilling to become full-time commissioners. This a very sensible proposal because there is a wealth of talent out there in the general community, particularly in the business world.

         There are people who have business experience and who would be eminently qualified and suitable for working with the commission, but whom you will not get unless you are able to offer work to them on a part-time basis, rather than a full-time basis. This amendment should, in itself, widen the potential pool of suitable people considerably. The members of the coalition think that this is a good idea and we certainly support it. However, it does mean, as the second amendment makes clear, that there would be a consequential increase in the maximum number of commissioners. The proposal in the bill is that this consequential increase be an increase of three, which means that the number increases from eight to 11.

         The other amendment that requires a brief comment is the third of the four amendments, the one allowing a single commissioner to act on behalf of all other commissioners on an inquiry in the absence of other commissioners, but limited to public hearings and only in emergency situations. That amendment will apply where unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury prevent one or other commissioners on an inquiry from participating in the public hearing. In such circumstances the remaining commissioners will be able to preside at the public hearing or part of a public hearing.

         The financial impact of the proposals is said to be nil; it does not have any financial implications. I am pleased to note that the government has said that, should the number and mix of full-time and part-time commissioners increase beyond the present funding levels, an increase in funding would be sought through the normal budgetary processes. On that basis and given the fact that the proposals look sensible and will add to the flexibility and the operations of the commission, and will enable the government to attract a wider range of qualified and experienced and relevant people to serve on a part-time basis as commissioners, the coalition supports the bill.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cook. I remind the minister that last month he told the Senate that the government's `tax policies are in the budget'. Four days later he said, `To the best of my knowledge, we have not formulated our tax policy for the next election.' A week ago he said, `We do not intend to introduce new taxes in the forthcoming election and in winning government, subsequent to that.' And yesterday he indicated that the extent of the government's commitment was only to keep general taxation revenue as a proportion of GDP at around their current levels. The minister has enunciated four different positions in the space of just over one month. In those circumstances, minister, I ask what is your current position? Will you rule out new taxes?

         When we came to power in 1982-83, the tax revenue to GDP ratio in Australia was 24 per cent. In the year 1995-96 we expect the level of tax as a percentage of GDP to be 24.2 per cent. In other words, what I am saying here is that we came to power in a recessionary climate in which the level of growth in the economy was low and when you would expect, because there were fewer people employed, there was less business activity and lower profits, the returns to the Commonwealth in the form of taxation to also be low. But what I am pointing to now, in an economy which today's national accounts underline more pointedly than any other question that I have got from Senator Hill in the last two years, in an economy which is a strong and growing economy, is that the burden of taxation on Australia for the 1995-96 year is expected to come in at 24.2 per cent.

         So in a strong economy when there are more people employed you would expect to obtain more taxes.

        Almost all allegations of abuse by the Inquiry pursuant to its terms of reference have not been proven and the media reports of April and May 1995 must be regarded as greatly misleading. No systematic or widespread abuse of AIS female gymnasts has been found to occur at any time. The Inquiry did not find any credible evidence of inappropriate treatment of gymnasts currently in the program.

        The Inquiry did find a handful of complaints of past inappropriate treatment to be proven which in the overall circumstances of the Inquiry are relatively minor. These related to the inappropriate use of the sauna in the first half of 1986 and to one incident of hitting and two incidents of rough handling of the one gymnast in late 1992 or early 1993 by a coach who was employed by the Australian Gymnastics Federation at the time. He was based in the AIS gymnasium but is no longer associated with the AIS. No physical injury was caused by that inappropriate treatment.

        I believe that these allegations of abuse within the women's artistic gymnastics program at the AIS have been thoroughly investigated by Mr Opie. I am satisfied that there are no inappropriate training methods or abuse occurring within the program.

         The inquiry has recommended counselling for the coach involved in the 1992-93 incident, and that particular coach's conduct will be referred to the Australian Coaching Council and the Australian Gymnastic Federation. It is important to point out that this coach is no longer associated with the AIS and was not an AIS employee at the time of the incident. The inquiry has not recommended that any action be taken against the coach involved in the 1986 incident.

         The Australian Sports Commission recently revised the code of conduct for coaches in order to more closely define the standards expected of AIS coaches. The Australian Coaching Council has developed a generic code of conduct for all coaches. National sporting organisations are being encouraged to adopt this code. The ASC has recently negotiated an industrial award for coaches through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which stipulates that coaches formally negotiate their responsibilities, standards and goals with the director of the AIS.

In March this year, when asked by John Laws to rule out the introduction of wealth or inheritance taxes, the Prime Minister said, `I am not in the business of ruling in and ruling out taxes on the radio.' Two days later he pointedly refused to rule out the introduction of a services tax, saying, `I am not ruling things in and out because there is no point.' The Prime Minister has now had eight months to throw these dead cats out of the ring. Will you categorically rule out the introduction of wealth or inheritance taxes and the introduction of a services tax, or are you simply going to the electorate asking for a blank cheque so that if re-elected you would be free to kick long-suffering taxpayers to death with these sorts of draconian tax measures?

         I turn to the other parts of the question. For most of this year Mr Howard has been saying that the economy is highly vulnerable and that we have only had five minutes of economic sunshine. So much for Mr Howard and so much for those senators opposite who have been enthusiastically endorsing his rhetoric. Today's national accounts showed that the economy is in very sound shape indeed. We have recorded the longest period of continuous growth since records commenced in 1959. All the indications are that the economy is set to continue growing not just for several more quarters but for several more years.

         We should never forget just how dismal a failure Mr Howard was when he was Treasurer. We have just recorded 17 consecutive quarters of economic growth. That is four years and three months of growth. The best Mr Howard could manage when he was Treasurer was five consecutive quarters of economic growth. That is a measly one year and three months of growth. If 17 quarters equals five minutes of sunshine, the best John Howard can manage as Treasurer is one minute and 28 seconds. At once, the stark comparison reveals John Howard's past failure and exposes the opposition's claims about five minutes of economic sunshine as distortions and as nothing more than hollow rhetoric.

         The fact that we have smashed the economic growth record is, of course, tremendous news for Australians. But what makes this recovery particularly special is that for the first time in a generation we have been able to combine strong growth with low inflation. When John Howard left office in 1983 we had a recession, double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. In contrast, today's national accounts show an economy that grew by 1.6 per cent in the September quarter in seasonally adjusted terms and by 3.3 per cent through the year to the September quarter 1995. The national accounts also indicate that inflation continues to remain moderate. Over the last year the private consumption and non-farm GDP deflators, which are broader measures of inflation than the CPI, both increased by less than three per cent.

         The question goes more broadly to measures in the national accounts about the performance of the economy. I have just answered a question from my colleague on the back bench about the performance of the economy. In summary, we have strong, steady growth. We are past the boom-bust cycle. We are into a steady but strong, nonetheless upward trend line for economic growth for Australia. The important characteristic of the quarterly accounts that came out at 11.30 this morning is that this strong growth is married to historically low inflation. For the first time in a generation Australians are looking at a growth economy with low inflation. That is good news for the economy.

         Part of the question also related to productivity, and productivity measures in the national accounts. If one turns to productivity measures for Australia, one would have to say, looking at the history of the Australian economy, that we are witnessing now historically high levels of productivity, particularly labour productivity, in the economy. If we compare levels of productivity now with the time when the coalition was on the treasury bench, we see they are higher now. One of the reasons why they are is that we have introduced other measures which have encouraged investment in capital equipment, thus improving the stock and efficiency of plant and equipment in Australia, which means that the input of labour creates a vastly greater output in productivity terms. We have also decentralised the wage fixing system and enabled collective bargaining to ensue in the workplace and traded productivity gains for wage increases, which has also underpinned productivity growth. We are looking at strong, historically high productivity.

         Another part of the question goes to the earnings part of the national accounts brought down today. The earnings measure shows higher earnings by ordinary Australians. That is not a bad thingâ€”ordinary Australians having an extra few dollars in their pockets. That is attributed to an increase in farm earnings because of the end of the droughtâ€”and farmers having more income as a consequenceâ€”and the propensity for more overtime to be worked in the economy, and to productivity changes as well.

         What we deem as essential for the effective representation of shareholders is that companies engage in best practice corporate governance. Obviously, the quality of corporate governance is quite fundamental. We have been keen to ensure we can enhance the levels of corporate governance in Australia. We have taken measuresâ€”I think you have been aware of themâ€”including the improvement and streamlining of provisions of the Corporations Law relating to meetings, the adoption of a new ASX listing rule requiring listed companies to report on the corporate governance practices they have in place, as well as proposed reforms to the corporations law to provide for a statutory derivative action. As you would appreciate, this will be a particularly important weapon for minority shareholders and will provide much needed discipline for corporations.

For the information of the Senate, the only part of the Trade Practices Act which deals with anti-dumping is section 46A. This section applies only to dumping disputes between Australia and New Zealand. That change was made to the Trade Practices Act in 1990 with the agreement of the New Zealand government.

Were the implications of this policy thought through in detail by Defence before the policy was made public?

         â€”Senator Alston gives a self description by way of interjection. We were consulted, both at a departmental and ministerial level, on this particular policy. As Senator Evans I think has said, there is a fine line eventually to be drawn by the total abolition or some retention for deterrence reasons. That is one of the reasons I think the Canberra commission exists. We still face one ultimate conundrum in terms of total nuclear disarmament of how we deal with a rogue state not signed up that develops such a capacity. I am sure the Canberra commission, in all of its wisdom, will develop some views on that to the assistance of this government and a whole range of leaders right around the globe.

That is the goal to which they have committed themselves already. The question is about the practical attainability of that goal. Those of us who argue for absolute zero as being not only desirable but achievable do so in the context of making the point that, if you are serious about non-proliferation, the existing nuclear weapons powers are going to have to get serious for the first time about elimination.

         But there is a big problem about working out how to achieve stable deterrence all the way down to zero. There is a big problem about getting acceptance in practice of that obligation so far as the existing declared nuclear weapons states are concerned. As Senator Ray said, that is what this commission is all about: to try to map a realistic plan for actually getting to zero which will demonstrate that it is in fact possible to meet the obligations and that the world will be a safer and saner place as a result.

Given this cost, it is imperative that this issue be tackled on all policy fronts by both federal and state governments. In an all-out effort to halt and reverse the degradation of our land and water resources, this remains one of the key tenets of this government's rural and environmental policy strategies. Of course the two have to go hand in hand. To use just one example: the government's overall landcare funding for this year from my portfolio is in excess of $110 million.

The drought policy advocates the reintroduction of fodder subsidies that clearly encourage overstocking during drought. That is one of the known features of drought subsidies and that is why drought subsidies were rejected comprehensively by all ministersâ€”Labor and non-Laborâ€”as far back as 1992. Such subsidies remove the encouragement for livestock producers to reduce stocking levels and to conserve pastures at a time when they are most vulnerable, and that is during a drought.

         The result is further land degradation through overgrazingâ€”overgrazing that then increases the severity of the next drought. It is a vicious circle; one that all ministersâ€”Labor and non-Labor, as I saidâ€”broke in 1992, and it should remain so. All of those ministers sinceâ€”Labor and non-Laborâ€”have consistently rejected at every meeting of ARMCANZ where this has come up the reintroduction of these fodder subsidies.

         The reason I mention that is that the opposition's commitment to fodder subsidies was explicitly reaffirmed by Mr Howard only a week or two ago in a tour of New South Wales drought areas. He pledged that the opposition would reintroduce an ancient policy that has been comprehensively rejected by every primary industry minister in Australia irrespective of their political affiliations. As long as that remains the official policy position of the opposition, it cannot claim to be really serious about land degradation being the most pressing environmental problemâ€”which it isâ€”that this country has.

I ask: is it correct that the Commonwealth government has hired the services of a public relations consultant in order to convince the Australian people that this decision is indeed a good decision?

        â€”by leaveâ€”Mr President, I ask you to reconsider the ruling you gave during question time in response to a number of points of order from this side about the statement, `You know "what you are saying is untrue" is not unparliamentary.' During question time I had the opportunity of reading through a booklet entitled `Rulings of the President of the Senate from 1953 to 1971', volume XI, which details a few rulings. For example, ruling 229 is:

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

      <para>
       There are a lot of other examples. For example, you are not allowed to say that something is a `distortion of the truth'â€”that is ruling 107. Ruling 132 says it is a `disorderly expression' to refer to somebody making an `untruthful statement'. `The senator forgot to be a little bit honest' is also a disorderly expression.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        With due respect, there are numerous rulings from former presidents indicating that a reflection on somebody's integrity in relation to knowingly not telling the truth is imputing improper motives, is a disorderly expression, is disorderly conduct and should therefore be withdrawn. You, Mr President, in fact, are charged with making that decision as to whether or not a comment should be withdrawn. In fact, ruling 134 says:

On the basis of previous decisions by the chair quoted by Senator Abetz, it may well be that a senator who says, `What you are saying is false,' could be held to be in breach of the standing orders. However, today's question time problem emerged not out of that statement but out of a statement that said, `You know what you are saying is false.' It is the `you know' element that provides the imputation.

         The reason I support Senator Abetz's request to you to reconsider is that it may well be that you did not focusâ€”and there was plenty going on at the timeâ€”on those first few words which changed the nature of the remark by Senator Cook to make it a far more serious and offensive remark than the suggestion which is often made that `What you are saying is false or untrue'. To say, `You know what you are saying is false,' cannot be anything else than an imputation that you are doing something deliberately that is wrong and improper. Surely that is an imputation, and I ask you to reconsider your decision.

        This is in relation to the secret tax agenda of the Keating-Willis Labor government. I think this minister when he answers economic questions is given a brief at the beginning of the week. I think they sit him down on Monday morning and say, `Senator Cook, no matter what they ask you about the economy this is the answer.' He is very sure of himself when he is on this brief. They probably sit him down there for a couple of hours and train him away after he has had his morning cup of tea and his sleep in.

         This week it was: `Minister Cook, you have had your cup of tea. The line this week is that the general level of taxation as a percentage of GDP was worse under John Howard than it is under our government. Whatever they ask you, whether it is to do with your tax agenda or any other economic question, just keep saying that. Here's a little speech that will last exactly four minutes. If they ask you a supplementary, just do the best you can, but this is the speech and stick to the line. It doesn't matter what they ask you. Whether it is Senator Hill or Senator Alston or anyone else, just stick to this line.'

         Senator Cook gets himself in all sorts of trouble when he goes off the line. The briefings on Monday morning when he gets on the plane coming back from Perth are getting longer and longer. Senator Cook is getting better at sticking to the line. Earlier in question timeâ€”and it is a little bit off the subjectâ€”he was asked a question by Senator Hill in relation to four different statements he had made about tax policy. He has made a couple more today and that is clearly where he wandered off the line.

         The point I want to make in taking note of his answer is that tax is something you can quote in terms of the statistics. If you want to look at the statistics as far as tax as a percentage of GDP is concerned, all you need to look at is the statistics that applied in Australia under the Whitlam government.

         The tax rate at that stage was much lower as a percentage of GDP than it is now under this Labor government. One of the great achievements of Mr Keating, regarded in the early 1980s by the people who gave him the award as `the world's best finance minister' or Treasurer, as we call it in Australia, is that he, who has been a great critic of fiscal discipline under the Whitlam era in his unguarded moments, has achieved a higher tax rate as a percentage of GDP than was achieved under the average years in the Whitlam regime.

         I checked with the library during question time and the average rate during 1972 to 1975 that people like Senator Herron will remember as times of economic chaos in Australia was 22.6 per cent. Of course the average rate under the Keating government and as his time as Treasurer is significantly higher than that. Well done, Mr Keating. Well done, Mr Willis. You have outdone Jim Cairns and Gough Whitlam. You have actually achieved much higher rates of taxation as a percentage of GDP.

         What is more important to families, however, because the rate of tax as a percentage of GDP would be almost an irrelevant consideration to them when they sit down to do their budgets at the end of the week and their tax returns at the end of the year is how the tax system in Australia and how Mr Keating's taxes affect them as a family. When this government wants to look at international comparisons, it should turn to a very important study done by the OECD as late as only a couple of years agoâ€”in fact, 1992; not that long agoâ€”which compared the impact of income tax as a percentage of gross earnings with the average wages of a family with two children.

         Let us contemplate what that study does. It looks at the impact of taxes in Australia on the average family, with a couple of kids and probably living in the metropolitan area of one of Australia's great cities. What is the answer? It shows that Australia has higher tax as a percentage of gross earnings on families than Luxembourg, France, Portugal, Japan, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, the United States, Belgium, Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Irelandâ€”and even higher than Norway. In fact, there are only four countries in the OECD that have higher taxes on average families than Australia. They are Denmark, Sweden, Finland and New Zealand. That study was done in 1992. I suspect the OECD are updating that. It will be interesting to look at what has happened since the 1993 election because we all know that, despite the promises of the Keating government, taxes like sales taxes and petrol taxes have increased since then.

        Senator Cook did his best to dress up what really were a very disturbing set of national accounts released today. The most disturbing thing about them was the revelation that economic growth has slowed right down to an annual rate of 3.3 per cent, which is way down on what it previously was and what the government boasted about. The really disturbing thing about that level of growth is what it means for the three-quarters of a million Australians who cannot get a job under this government. These figures are very bad news for jobless Australians and mean that they will have great difficulty getting a job, and that in fact unemployment will continue to increase with a level of growth of that low order.

        That is an authoritative statement from the well-respected and independent National Institute of Labour Studies, pointing out that the five per cent target has no hope of being achieved. That conclusion is reinforced by the figures released today showing growth slowing to 3.3 per cent.

         I make two other points there. They say that even achieving the seven per cent will be difficult unless labour force growth slows and productivity growth remains flat. Of course, the government is increasing the growth of the labour force by its own policies, contradicting this, and the government has today boasted, through the form of Senator Cook, about the growth in productivity. So those two prerequisites themselves set by the National Institute of Labour Studies are being breached by the current situation.

         The institute itself thinks that the best we can possibly achieve is an unemployment rate by the year 2000, which I point out is only four years away, of 7.3 per cent; and even that figure would require an annual economic growth of 3.7 per cent over the next four years, which of course is higher than the growth we have seen today. The economy is clearly slowing; the growth is likely to decline.

         The institute said in this report which has just been released that if average economic growth falls below 3 1/2 per cent, unemployment will actually begin to rise. Of course, today's figure is 3.3 per cent. I heard a bank economist today commenting on these figures say that he expects that unemployment will be back over nine per cent very soon, based on these figures. So this five per cent target, which the government still proclaims to support, has been blown apart by this report and by today's figures.

We have only achieved a rate near 4.2 per cent in one out of every three years over the last 15, so that figure cannot be achieved. The institute notes that the growth rate required to achieve a five per cent target of unemployment is simply not sustainable under current economic policy. That is why this government has to be defeated. That is why, for the sake of the unemployed, we need a change of government and a change to the economic settings so that we can achieve the five per cent target which under current settings we simply cannot do.

We have wages and salaries growth hitting 7.4 per cent, way ahead of productivity growth and clearly putting a lot of pressure on inflation.

       <para>
        Senator Evans's answer reveals the priority given by him to this topic in that he was not able to respond, even in a small way, to my question. I know that he has many matters on his mind. In recognition of that, his office was informed three-quarters of an hour before question time that he would be receiving a question on that topic. However, as I told him in a note, it is `questions without notice' and his failure to answer not only wasted my last question for the session but prevented me from asking a supplementary. I said to Senator Evans that I was sure he would be extremely distressed on my behalf. He owned up to his truthfulness in his response when he said, `I cannot tell a lie; I am not deeply distressed'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I raised the question because it is a very important matter. The reason I asked Senator Evans a question in relation to this area is that I wanted to draw attention to a very negative state of affairs in regard to the funding for representative bodies. It appears that while the Native Title Act explicitly allowed for more than one body to exist in each region to allow Aboriginal communities to make a choice where there was a possible disagreement with a particular representative body or where there were two communities with competing claims over the same areaâ€”a very sensible provisionâ€”it appears that there is a proposition to reduce the options of Aboriginal communities to only have one representative body for each region. I very much wanted the minister to comment on this and to give us some kind of answer as to whether this has already been accepted as government policy and certainly to challenge that.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other matter that I believed needed to be drawn attention to, which I would have raised if I had the opportunity, was that over 40 per cent of ATSIC funding for these representative bodies is allocated to two land councilsâ€”the Kimberley Land Council and the Cape York Land Council. I believe that there are some serious questions that need to be addressed, which the minister clearly does not have under his purview regarding the equitable access for Aboriginal communities to assist them in native title claims. I believe that the government needs to commit itself to reviewing the nature of the distribution of funding to representative bodies and address the questions of equity that are plainly disclosed.

         I will later seek leave to incorporate two incredible graphs that illustrate this vividly. The first one simply shows the range of funding available to the different representative bodies. It demonstrates visually the malapportionment of funding to the two land councils that I have already mentioned. That is further exacerbated if we look at the second graph, which lays alongside that same graph and shows the percentage of population that is being served by these representative bodies. It is an absolute outrage. It extends the whole inequitability of funding that has been exposed in this government's response to native title, land funds and, presumably in the future, to the social justice package.

         It seems extremely inequitable to excessively favour, in this case, certain northern land councils as opposed to those in the southern part of Australia. It is actually penalising those Aboriginal people who have experienced more dispossession, more extinguishment of native title. So, of the 250,000 Aboriginal people, we have three groupsâ€”one which may have some chance of receiving native title, and they may be five per cent of that number; one group which may have access to a land fund, which is approximately 15 per cent; and the rest, 80 per cent, being totally ignored and increasingly dispossessed with every moment that passes. They are the same namesâ€”all in the northâ€”that appear on all the funding bodies, on all the funding that is given for native title, for the land fund and, presumably, it will be the case with the social justice package.

        The question I asked was a genuine one. I have raised this matter of fraud over the last five years. It may be recalled that some years ago the Auditor-General produced a report saying that massive fraud was occurring in relation to Medicare. The community affairs committee was given a briefing to consider the Auditor-General's report. The government came out backing the Auditor-General's report and said that fraud to the extent of $400 million a year was occurring.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I questioned the basis for that figure and it was found that the basis was an estimate made on figures given in the United States as a percentage of the total amount spent on Medicare there. So, in fact, there was no basis for the figure. I pursued Minister Richardson over the matter. The figure shrank from $400 million to $80 million. I questioned it at estimates committee hearings. The figure now, with regard to money that is refunded to Medicare, is in the vicinity of $1 1/2 million. So it is a rapidly vanishing figure.

         The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) announced yesterday that from 1 December a person can go to a Medicare office with a receipt form and a Medicare card and get an immediate cash refund without having to fill out a form. This opens up the potential for fraud of a major nature.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           I will give three instances. It may be that the government is not concerned if a patient gives a valueless cheque to a doctor. This has occurred, particularly in relation to radiology services. A patient can write a valueless cheque, get a receipt from the doctor, and now they will be able to go along to Medicare, produce a receipt, get a cash refund and they are on their way. The government does nothing about pursuing that. I know this has occurred in a number of instances. They say to the doctor, `That's your problem. If you accept a valueless cheque, that's too bad.'

         There is another aspect to it in addition to the valueless cheque situation. The government does not pursue that, even though it might occur on a number of occasions, because they consider it is not their problem. However, I know of another situation. I know this debate is being broadcast and I do not want a sudden rush of events to occur around Australia, but I think I should bring it to the minister's notice because it has occurred and it can occur under this system. A patient goes to the doctor complaining of a major headache. Eventually, upon the diagnosis determined by the general practitioner, the patient is sent for a CAT scan of the brain. That costs in the vicinity of $400. The patient pays with a valueless cheque, goes to the Medicare office, gets a refund of $400, and the cheque bounces. The next day the patient goes to another GP, complains of a headache, goes through the same process, pays with a valueless cheque, goes to the Medicare office and, as of Friday, collects another $400. That is a fraud on Medicare.

         The question was genuine. With these new changes, because there is no form to be filled in now as a result of these changes, what are they going to do to stop patients committing this type of fraud? We know from the prosecutions that have occurred that more fraud, numerically speaking, is committed by patients than by anybody else under Medicare. Twice as much fraud is committed by patients over and above the next step of fraud, which is done by secretaries producing a false receipt book. This lays it right open for anybody with a receipt book or a stolen receipt book, as has occurred in the past, to go along with a receipt and a Medicare card and get a cash refund.

         The third event, as I said, is intentional deliberate fraud. That has been done by a number of doctors. In the last 12 months, the average number of doctors who have committed fraud is about 53â€”it has been 52 and 45; it varies. Of the 47,000 doctors in Australia, 52 or 53 have committed fraud. We get this continual doctor bashing about doctors rorting the system, whereas the majority of rorting is done by patients by intentional fraud; secondly, by secretaries by theft; and, finally, by doctors.

         It is a very genuine question. The minister said that it has been addressed. I am sure she did not understand the questionâ€”that should have been fairly obvious to anybody who was listening. It may be that she washes her hands and the government washes its hands of it in relation to doctors, but my concern, particularly as a taxpayer and as a representative, is Medicare itself.

They have no plans to do anything about a road which is 700 kilometres long and yet has 64 kilometres of divided road. The rest of that road is just 1950s-style goat track.

I remind the Senate and the people of Australia that, in the last 10 years, 766 people have lost their lives on that road. How many accidents? Ten thousand accidents. Yet the way in which governments, state and federal, are now approaching this matter, it will be 20 to 30 years before the road will be corrected to what is needed now in 1995, let alone what is going to be needed in the year 2015.

        Notorious accident black spots, such as Raymond Terrace Road, Woodberry Road, Scotch Creek Road and Martins Wharf Road, are now going to be abandoned. What this state Labor government is doing in the Maitland area, which the minister was holding up as the shining light, is following his example: keep reducing black spot funding till it totally cuts out. How many more accidents do there have to be on that road? How many more deaths do there have to be on that road?

         The whole problem underlying what is happening is that Labor governments significantly and increasingly continue to reduce the money they spend on infrastructure, particularly roads. The last time the Liberal Party was in power federally, in 1982-83, we were spending 62.4 per cent of the fuel excise on road funding. When those horrific bus accidents occurred on the north coast, that amount had dropped from 62 per cent to 20.8 per cent. Since that time, it has dropped to 8.4 per cent. The government rips off 92c of fuel excise dollars and does not put it back into roads. That is why we have these accidents; that is why we have these deaths. It is about time the Labor government woke up to this and started spending proper funding on the roads of Australia.

         â€”You will weasel your way out of anything. We know all about you. It is worth looking at particular aspects of road funding. In looking at what has happened over the last three years, we see that in 1992-93 there was an increase of $1.1 billion in the take from fuel excise, in 1993-94 it went up a further $1.3 billion and in 1994-95 another $1.3 billion.

         As Senator Tierney has said, we see a gradual decrease in the percentage of what goes back into road funding. It is estimated that, in the year 1994-95, the government put $820 million into road funding, which is even less than what was put back into road funding in 1982-83. There has been a gradual decline in percentage terms of what is being put back. The actual amount that went back into road funding in 1994-95 was $817 million. The forward estimates for 1995-96 is $840, which is an increase of $20 million on the previous year's estimates, yet there is a further take on petrol and diesel excise in the order of $1.3 billion.

         That is the fundamental reason why we have enormous deterioration of infrastructure and the road systems throughout this country.

         When the Labor government came to office in 1983, the excise was 7c a litre. Today it stands at 33.5c a litre. I also note that the $9.7 billion taken from motorists today represents $570 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Commonwealth government fuel taxes make up 50 per cent of the retail price of each litre of petrolâ€”that is, at a price of around 67c to 68c per litre. By contrast, oil company revenues make up 32 per cent of the price of fuel and the dealer margin is only 2.9 per cent to 3 per cent.

         So the fuel excise has become a milking cow for general revenue for this government. They need to recognise, firstly, the importance of bringing a halt to the massive increases in fuel excise and the damage that is doing to living standards and businesses throughout Australia, particularly those involved in farming and mining; and, secondly, the costs which exist with regard to that. The excise on light crude in Western Australia puts up the cost of carting a tonne of grain to port by an average of between $2 and $2.50 per tonneâ€”an enormous additional direct cost that that industry has to bear.

         So I just want to put on the record that, in terms of the government's performance since coming to office, as far as fuel excise is concerned, the increase has been absolutely massive. It has been very close to 500 per cent; I think the exact figure is 498 per cent. Yet, at the same time, alongside that, we have seen a gradual reduction in the amount of money going back into our roads. We have seen a significant deterioration of our roads right across Australia, particularly in the northern parts of Australia, the western parts of Queensland, the western parts of New South Wales, the northern parts of South Australia and through the hinterland of Victoria.

         People living in the metropolitan areas, for example, do not recognise this. They see their highways, the fast-lane traffic and the various things that go there. But when you go out into the rural areas, the regional areas and the mining areas you find that in some instances bitumen roads are being pulled up because they cannot be maintained because the Commonwealth government has reduced so significantly the level of funding in real terms for the task that is required to keep those roads in reasonable order. The government needs to reassess the situation of fuel excise.

A comprehensive Government response should await completion by the Committee of its Inquiry, at least in respect of those other terms of reference.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Response: The draft provisions of the Bill are consistent with this recommendation. It is clear from the text of the Committee's Report that the majority supported the provisions of the draft, accepting that they would avoid futile arguments relating to financial and non-financial contributions, largely reflect the existing law, and provide a more `structured' approach to the issue of property settlements (paragraph 2.28). The Bill goes further than the recommendation, and sets up a rebuttable presumption that the parties have made an equal contribution to the marriage as a whole, including the acquisition of property.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recommendation 4
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommends that subsection 86C(2) be amended to add an additional factor which recognises the limitations upon the capacity to earn income (and by extension to accumulate assets) created by parenting responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Response: The thrust of this recommendation is accepted. Subsection 86C(1) is the provision of the Bill which provides initially that the contributions of the parties to the marriage as a whole are assumed to be equal, unless the Court finds that they were not in fact equal. Subsection 86C(2) sets out the historical matters that a Court may have regard to in determining the contribution that each party made to the marriage in fact. It would not be appropriate to insert into this section a provision that would explain why a party made a greater non-financial contribution than a financial one, which is what the Government understands the thrust of this recommendation to be. Subsection 86C(3) provides that financial and non-financial provisions are intrinsically equally significant. A provision along the lines recommended would not affect the finding of relative contributions. However, a provision should be added to clause 86D to specifically recognise the lack of income due to parenting responsibilities.

        Recommendation 5

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Response: Accepted. This expression will be deleted. The reference to the history of the marriage has been the subject of much criticism, especially along the lines that it might reintroduce an element of fault into property proceedings and invite consideration of domestic violence in this context.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recommendation 6
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommends that pre-nuptial agreements be non-enforceable but be available for use as evidentiary material in relevant proceedings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Response: This recommendation is not accepted. Binding pre-nuptial agreements are a cornerstone of the revised property regime. The Committee was concerned that such agreements could be oppressive, particularly of women. They also reflected a view that there should be mandatory prior independent legal advice. The Bill did not contain provision for prior independent mandatory legal advice because it was not considered desirable to compel parties to resort to this expense before entering into an agreement. There are adequate protections in the Bill in the provisions relating to varying and setting aside. After all, parties do not have to have independent legal advice before buying property jointly, making gifts to one another, or making wills in favour of one another.

        A dissenting report by Coalition Senators urged the Government to again address the issue of assumed equal contribution to the marriage as a whole, and in particular the meaning of `the history of the marriage' in proposed section 86C(2)(a).

        Response: The Government accepts the thrust of this recommendation. The Government views seriously concerns that the new regime will disadvantage women and that the starting point of assumed equal contribution to the marriage as a whole will become a de facto finishing point of assumed equal entitlement of distribution. The Government will do a number of things to meet these concerns. The provisions of the Bill will be redrafted so that it is absolutely clear that the 50/50 starting point is a starting point only, and that it relates to contribution only. It will be made clear that property will only be divided in proportion to contribution to the marriage as a whole where there are no other factors, such as future needs, that would make a distribution of property on another basis more just and equitable. Amendments will be made to the Bill to ensure that financial resources will be properly taken into account. There will be an intensive education program by the Government, in conjunction with the Family Court and the legal profession, to explain the amendments and their operation, and to dispel any misunderstandings that have arisen. The expression `the history of the marriage' will be removed from proposed paragraph 86C(2)(a).

        The terms of reference for the Inquiry into Conditional Migrant Entry undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations (JSC) focused on the feasibility of allowing migrant entry to Australia, on a conditional basis for those applicants who do not meet the health requirement on the grounds of undue cost or prejudice to the access to health care of Australian permanent residents or citizens. The conditional entry was not to be available for those persons who pose a threat to public health or a danger to members of the Australian community. The terms of reference required the committee to give particular attention to the operation of the Migration Regulations in cases of disability.

        In its report Conditional Migrant Entry: The Health Rules, the JSC recognised the extreme complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved in the health requirement for entry to or stay in Australia and that only a small number of cases are affected by the lack of conditional entry provisions. The JSC confirmed that the primary obligation of the health requirement is the protection of public health and safety, community resources and access by Australian citizens and permanent residents to expensive and scarce medical and welfare services.

        The JSC made twenty-one recommendations which cover a number of distinct areas in addition to conditional migrant entry (Rec. 15-17), that is technical recommendations relating to the health assessment process (Rec. 1-3, 5, 9, 10, 14), assessment of applicants with disabilities (Rec. 4, 7, 8, 11, 18), health standards (Rec. 6), protection of public health (Rec. 12, 13) and access to Medicare and related fraud (Rec. 19-21).

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In response to the conditional migrant entry (CME) recommendations, the government has decided not to proceed with a CME scheme at this time due to the significant practical and conceptual difficulties in developing a scheme that could be integrated and operate effectively with the current health requirement. The detailed reasons for this are outlined in response to Recommendation 15.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In examining the CME and other JSC recommendations, the government has concluded that priority should be given to a more fundamental examination of the current health requirement with a view to rationalising the existing health regulations to make them clearer and more transparent, to develop and enhance existing guidelines and standards, and make the health requirement more sensitive and responsive to current community views and practices. While the JSC did not canvass the question of medical review, the feasibility of establishing an appropriate formal medical review mechanism is being considered in the examination of the current health requirement.

        Accordingly, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Human Services and Health are undertaking a joint review of the health requirement and associated procedures for entry to Australia. Individual recommendations of the JSC, where agreed to by the government, will be implemented in the context of the review. This review builds on review activity to date such as the provision of greater flexibility in the use of the health waiver in response to JSC Recommendation 3. In many respects this and other fine-tuning of existing policy (in the context of the review) will provide the flexibility in the operation of the existing health rules which the JSC was looking for in recommending a CME scheme.

        Accepted in part. The government has, in the context of the review of the health requirement and associated procedures, amended the Migration Regulations to provide greater flexibility in the exercise of the waiver. The waiver was not previously available for exercise in those cases where the Commonwealth Medical Officer was of the opinion that the applicant was likely to prejudice the access of any Australian citizen or permanent resident to health care. The amended waiver provides for DIEA officers to make the final decision on the question of prejudicing access.

        Any move to make consideration of the waiver non-compellable and non-reviewable would be inconsistent with the current decision making structure. The current structure requires decision makers to consider whether or not to exercise the health waiver (where it is available) and such decisions involving the waiver are in many classes reviewable. The increased flexibility in the exercise of the waiver does not inappropriately liberalise the waiver provision, it simply allows DIEA decision makers to consider the question of prejudicing access in the same way as the question of whether an applicant is likely to represent an undue cost is currently considered. Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis in the light of individual circumstances.

        For example, spouse visa applicants currently have access to the health waiver, full merits review and Ministerial discretion while the humanitarian classes have access to the waiver. This reflects the relative policy priority attaching to these visa classes. To subsequently provide access to a CME mechanism (for the relatively small number of unsuccessful humanitarian and spouse cases) would either:

        There are considerable reservations regarding the equity of a CME scheme. The availability of a CME scheme would either be discriminatory in terms of those likely to be in a position to afford what is expected to be a very substantial average fee (estimated by the JSC to be in the order of $200,000) or otherwise incompatible with the objectives of visa classes such as those with humanitarian or close family objectives.

        Based on information from the newly installed computer system (MIDAS), operating since mid December 1993, it is estimated that there would be in the order of 200 applicants failing the health requirement each year who may be eligible for a CME scheme. However, this number could be heavily discounted for those who are subsequently approved through exercise of the health waiver, the review process or Ministerial intervention as well as those who would not be in a position to pay the fee.

        There would also be significant co-ordination and logistical difficulties in implementing and operating a CME mechanism. Establishing even a reasonable estimate of lifetime medical costs would be an imprecise and resource intensive process. If this is extended to include lifetime non-medical costs (such as special education requirements, welfare entitlements and supported employment) and an assessment of the likely contribution which the applicant or applicant's family may be able to make to Australia (pursuant to Recommendation 17) then the level of complexity, subjectivity and precision required would increase dramatically.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A likely perverse outcome of introducing a CME scheme for all applicants for permanent residence in Australia is that rather than recouping the potential health costs to the community it is likely to result in a net additional cost, thus frustrating the existing health requirement. It is probable that the combination of having open access to a CME scheme and a Ministerial waiver mechanism would have a negative impact on the health budget due to the anticipated requests and compulsion for Ministerial waiver. The administrative implications of such a situation would be difficult to contemplate.

        As indicated in the introductory response to the JSC recommendations, the recommendation for a CME scheme was in large part predicated on a perceived need to provide greater flexibility in the operation of the existing health rules. It is considered that the existing health rules already provide considerable flexibility where that is the policy objective (through use of the health waiver, access to merits review and Ministerial discretion) and that further flexibility could be achieved by simply fine-tuning the policy. The recent change to provide greater flexibility in the operation of the health waiver (response to Recommendation 3 refers) is considered to have largely addressed the JSC's concern for greater flexibility.

        As a supplement to the up-front fee proposed in recommendation 15, the government investigate the feasibility of implementing an insurance bond system and/or a loan arrangement for applicants who do not meet the prescribed health criteria or the waiver provisions and who are unable to pay an up front fee to the commonwealth. In any such arrangements, the need to protect the revenue over the lifetime of the applicant should be a relevant consideration.

        Introduction of a Ministerial waiver to accompany a CME scheme would result in considerable conflict with the existing medical waiver. In particular, consideration of "compelling cases" in the exercise of the CME waiver would conflict with the operation of existing waiver/review/Ministerial discretion mechanisms where the consideration also relates to compassionate and compelling circumstances. As indicated in the response to Recommendation 15 it would result in a policy tension by creating a discretion in those classes where the government had already decided not to provide a waiver. It is also indicated in the response to Recommendation 15 that an open access CME scheme in conjunction with a waiver will likely result in a net additional cost for the health budget. An additional significant difficulty is that of objectively assessing the likely contribution which the applicant or the applicant's family may be able to make to Australia.

        Draft Amendment 12 (Russell) was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on 16 August 1994. The Committee's Report was tabled in Parliament on 5 June 1995. This Draft Amendment of the National Capital Plan proposes a Master Plan for Russell which, among other things, creates a framework for the Department of Defence Russell Redevelopment Project.

         The national companies and securities scheme laws were introduced by the Government in 1989 to enable the Commonwealth to assume national responsibility for the regulation of companies and the securities markets, and implement a regime that would meet the needs of the Australian economy into the 1990's and beyond. The Government recognised that our economy is national, with companies operating across the country and often in the international sphere. To divide the regulation of companies on the lines of State and Territory boundaries, as existed under the former co-operative companies and securities scheme, meant that there was no Parliament, no Government and no Minister with overall responsibility and accountability for the operation of the scheme. The co-operative scheme had, by that time, outlived its usefulness.

         The NCSC had operated under a regime of ordinary and special investigations. The power of the NCSC to conduct compulsory oral examinations was reserved for special investigations only. Special investigations required the consent of either an individual State or Northern Territory Minister, or of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. For the most part, consent was to be granted only if the Minister or the Ministerial Council considered it to be in the public or national interest. In relation to ordinary investigations, the NCSC had to rely on the more cumbersome power to conduct public hearings to gather information.

         Like its predecessors, however, the breaches of corporate law that the ASC is called on to investigate are often extremely complex. Commercial arrangements frequently have an appearance of legitimacy. They are commonly highly structured and involve hundreds of individual transactions and thousands of documents. Professional advisers including lawyers, accountants, tax advisers and merchant bankers are used at all stages of the arrangements. Transactions often involve interstate and international activities and may be effected through the use of electronic technology. The arrangements often involve complex corporate structures or groups with interlinked shareholdings or debts, some of which may be incorporated or have assets outside Australia, often in jurisdictions which do not have cooperative arrangements with Australia for sharing information.

         Nevertheless, the timely and thorough examination of such transactions is essential to the effective enforcement of Australia's corporate laws and, ultimately, the maintenance of investor confidence in Australia's securities markets. To this end the legislature considered it necessary to equip the corporate regulator with effective investigatory powers. It is the exercise of those powers by the ASC that is the subject of review by the Committee.

         The Committee's inquiry commenced at a time when the ASC had only been operating some 3 years. Since it commenced operation on 1 January 1991, the ASC has grown from a skeleton staff to over 1600 employees. It has regional offices in each State and Territory as well as 12 business centres, an information processing centre in Traralgon and policy and administrative offices in Melbourne and Sydney.  It has successfully, in that time, achieved a significant presence as a truly national regulator.

         Nevertheless such significant growth can, not unexpectedly, reveal some deficiencies in the administrative practices of a large decentralised organisation. The Committee has recommended that the ASC adopt a number of administrative and funding measures to improve its investigatory practices. The Government supports each of those recommendations. The Government also notes that, in so far as these recommendations relate to internal ASC procedures, they either reflected the ASC's current practice at the time of the Report or have since been adopted by the ASC. Recommendations in this category are recommendations 2, 3, 6, 9 and 13.

         The Committee specifically recognises that any examination of the investigative powers of the ASC needs to address the balance which should be struck between two competing interests: the need for effective corporate regulation and the need to protect individuals from an excess of administrative power. The Government is concerned to ensure that in re-examining that balance, the investigatory powers of the ASC are not so diminished as to render the Commission completely ineffective as a corporate regulator.

Much of the anecdotal evidence presented to the Committee related to one or two investigations undertaken by the Commission shortly after its establishment. The administrative changes recommended by the Committee, many of which, as already noted, have been implemented by the ASC, should overcome many of the problems identified with the handling of those particular investigations.

         Section 92 of the ASC Law protects informants from civil liability for defamation and breach of confidentiality, but only where the ASC has exercised its statutory powers under Part 3 of the ASC Law. Thus persons served with a notice under section 19 of the ASC Law, compulsorily requiring their appearance for examination, receive the statutory protection afforded by section 92. While the statutory powers of the ASC under Part 3 of the ASC Law may be exercised once a formal investigation has commenced under section 13 of the ASC law, a formal investigation cannot commence until the ASC has "reason to suspect" that a contravention had taken place. Those persons who volunteer information of possible misfeasance, for example in circumstances where a formal investigation has not commenced, will not receive the statutory protection of section 92.

         The powers of the Court under section 1323 include the freezing of payments and the taking or sending of money, securities, futures contracts or other property out of the jurisdiction; the appointment of a receiver or trustee to the property of a natural person; the appointment of a receiver or a receiver and manager over corporate property; requiring that a person surrender his or her passport and prohibiting a person leaving Australia without the consent of the Court. The capacity to appoint a receiver is arguably the most valuable and versatile of the court's powers under section 1323. It is unlikely, however, that a final order, freezing the assets of the defendant, would be made on the basis of an ex parte hearing.

         Subsection 1323(4) relieves the ASC from the usual requirement to give an undertaking as to damages, but it does so only in respect of applications for interim orders. The exemption for such orders encourages urgent applications by the ASC in circumstances where, for example, an investigation has only just commenced, but where urgent action is necessary to preserve assets that may be in danger of being dissipated once the investigation becomes known. Were the ASC to be required to give an undertaking as to damages it would detract from the ASC's ability to take speedy action and thus restrict what has otherwise become a critical part of the ASC's enforcement strategy.

         In cases where regulatory action has not been possible before perpetrators have transferred assets offshore, the prospects of subsequently securing those asserts have been, generally speaking, low. Notwithstanding significant advances in the level of co-operation between regulatory authorities, co-operation that is advanced by such legislative developments as the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992, it is still the case that in certain overseas jurisdictions it is virtually impossible to trace assets and secure orders requiring the return of that property. By contrast, the ASC has had considerable success in a number of cases where it was able to move early to secure assets pursuant to section 1323. Such assets have subsequently been made available to pay creditors or, in some cases, investors.

         The Government notes the Committee concedes at paragraphs 0.20 and 5.20 that ex parte applications under section 1323 are sometimes necessary due to the reality of swift movements of money in the corporate world, but that it is of the view the law, as it presently stands, does not provide any incentives for caution in the use of the ex parte procedure and that there is a capacity for innocent persons to suffer loss and damage without any right to compensation for the loss suffered. In reaching this view the Committee appears to have assumed that the ASC has a policy of proceeding ex parte, or at least needs some special incentive to exercise caution in using that procedure. However, in fact the ASC uses the ex parte procedure sparingly, and in practice the circumstances in which it has proceeded ex parte have been, and should be, exceptional.

         The Government acknowledges that the current provisions of the Corporations Law providing for interim freezing orders are widely drafted, but notes that there are other incentives for caution on the part of the ASC. These include the availability of the sanction of costs orders to be made against the ASC where the ASC is unable to sustain its claim. The courts have a discretion to award costs against the ASC if it is satisfied that the ASC has in some way acted unreasonably or not prosecuted its claim with due diligence. The costs of the interim receiver may also be borne by the ASC: ASC v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 11 ACSR 137.

         Additionally, the absence of an undertaking as to damages is a matter that a court could take into account when weighing the balance of convenience in making the interim order sought by the ASC, particularly where the application proceeds ex parte. Further, where an order is obtained by the ASC as the result of an ex parte hearing it is the common practice of the court to allow  the order to run for a very  limited period only. During that period the court requires that the defendant be served and afforded the opportunity to be represented at a further hearing, held at the earliest possible date, to determine whether the order should be varied, discharged or continued.

         In all the circumstances, the Government is not satisfied that the existing fetters on the grant of interim orders under subsection 1323(4) to the ASC are inadequate and, in view of its concern to ensure that the ASC is encouraged to act without delay to secure assets in the interests of investors and creditors, does not agree with the Committee's recommendation. Nevertheless, the Government does see some merit in ensuring that the procedures governing the grant of interim orders under section 1323, where those orders are obtained following an ex parte hearing, operate uniformly across all jurisdictions. Thus the Government proposes to amend section 1323 to provide that where an interim order is obtained as a result of an ex parte hearing, that order is returnable on a day within 21 days of the making of the order or, in exceptional circumstances, such further date as is determined by the Court. Within that period the ASC will be required to effect service on the defendant and the defendant will be entitled to appear on the return date and make application for the order to be discharged or varied.

The summons should issue where the District Registrar is satisfied that the examinee can give information relevant to a matter that the ASC is investigating, or is to investigate, under Division 1 of the ASC Act. The issue and application in this instance should be able to be done electronically if there is a need.

         The examination procedure under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the public examination of a bankrupt or persons associated with the bankrupt, before the Registrar or the Court, by a creditor, the trustee of the bankrupt's estate or the Official Receiver (when he or she is not the trustee of the estate). An application to summons a person for examination under section 81 must be made to the Registrar or the Court, and the Registrar or the Court has a discretion whether or not to issue the summons. Registrars usually handle the applications for examinations and they also preside at the examination.

         As such, the examination procedure under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act is comparable with the examination procedure under section 597 of the Corporations Law. Under section 597 of the Corporations Law, persons who may be able to provide information or assistance in an insolvency administration can be the subject of an examination before the Court. An application for the issue of a summons to a person to appear for examination may be made by a liquidator, provisional liquidator or administrator of a company; an administrator of a deed of company arrangement; the ASC or a person authorised by the ASC. The summonsing of company officers by the Court for examination is mandatory under section 596A. However, the Court has a discretion under section 596B whether or not to summons persons other than officers of the company for examination. Such an application is to be supported by affidavit evidence (subsection 596C(1))but that affidavit is not available for inspection unless the Court orders otherwise (subsection 596C(2)).

         These amendments to the section 597 examination procedure were made by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992. That Act implemented a number of the recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in the report on its `General Insolvency Inquiry' (known as `the Harmer Report'). In the opinion of the Harmer Report, "[t]he chief purposes of such examinations [in both bankruptcy and company insolvency law] are to facilitate the recovery of property, to discover whether conduct of the insolvent led to the insolvency and to investigate possible causes of action against third parties"(1)  The Harmer Report continued:  ". . . it should be acknowledged that the principal purpose of the examination provisions [namely the section 81 and section 597 examination procedures] should be the discovery of information which will assist in the administration of the estate. The interests of `public policy' in prosecuting criminal offences, though important, are in this context secondary"(2).

         In contrast, the chief purpose of examinations under section 19 of the ASC Law is to facilitate the investigation by the ASC of suspected contraventions of a national scheme law; contraventions of any other State or Territory law concerning the management or affairs of a body corporate; or any fraud or dishonesty relating to a body corporate, securities or futures contract(3). To commence an investigation under subsection 13(1) of the ASC Law the ASC or its delegate must have "reason to suspect" that one or more contraventions of a national scheme law or a relevant State or Territory law may have been committed.

         In addition, the circumstances surrounding examinations under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act and section 597 of the Corporations Law are quite different to those surrounding examinations under section 19 of the ASC Law. By the time a section 81 or section 597 examination is contemplated, the fact of the individual's bankruptcy or corporate insolvency is already in the public arena. In contrast, the existence of an investigation under subsection 13(1) of the ASC Law may not be public knowledge at the time of an examination under section 19 of the ASC Law. The Courts have acknowledged that the premature disclosure of information while investigations were still on foot or the hearing of criminal charges still pending would enable persons to conceal or destroy relevant evidence and otherwise hinder or obstruct any investigation into, or proceedings with respect to, their activities."(4)

The premature disclosure of information sufficient to ground the issue of a summons, including the premature disclosure of the lines of inquiry to be followed by the ASC but are which necessarily untested at that time, carries the unavoidable consequence that the identity of persons being examined and the reasons why they are being examined will become public at an early stage of an investigation. This could result in considerable unfairness and prejudice to the individuals concerned as well as having a devastating effect upon the viability of the company. Section 19 examinations commonly involve the affairs and reputation of individuals still active in business.

         The ASC has advised that it has already made significant efforts to provide appropriate training for officers in examination skills. In April 1995 the ASC ran a 3 day intensive course for 24 senior investigators and lawyers in examination skills training. Other ASC staff undertook the same course in July 1995. The training was conducted in conjunction with the Leo Cussen Institute, a Victorian body which provides professional training to lawyers and is particularly experienced in providing advocacy training. The courses included mock section 19 examinations to generate discussion about common challenges and issues arising out of procedural aspects of section 19 examinations. The mock examinations were video-taped so as to provide an opportunity for peer review of the performance of each participant on such indicators as the structure and content of questions, the relevance of the questions to the fact situation and the examiner's style and demeanour in asking questions. Both courses were conducted on a national basis so that staff from different regional offices of the ASC were able to discuss and compare approaches in their respective offices. The ASC anticipates that the course will be made generally available to regional offices for those officers who have not had the opportunity to attend the national course.

         What the Committee's review does clearly demonstrate, however, is the clash of competing policies in relation to this issue. On one side is the public interest in ensuring the honest conduct of the affairs of companies by compelling those involved in a company's affairs to disclose all relevant materials. On the other is the public interest in ensuring that full and frank legal advice is sought and given by protecting the confidentiality of lawyer/client communications. There are clear and persuasive arguments for each of these competing view points. Ultimately, it is a policy decision for the legislature as to which policy consideration is to be favoured.

         The Government is persuaded that the continued abrogation of legal professional privilege in corporate investigations is required to enable the efficient and cost effective completion of investigations and timely enforcement action. Given the complexity of much of the conduct which constitutes breaches of corporate law, access to legal communications is essential to obtain a proper understanding of the complex legal and accounting webs that serve to mask ostensibly legitimate and complex commercial arrangements that are in breach of the law.

         Claims for legal professional privilege can result in major delays to an investigation and prosecution process for corporate offences and, in particular, delay investigations of major cases for considerable periods of time. Such delays enable potential defendants time to leave the jurisdiction or to destroy relevant documents yet to be produced to the ASC. The adverse impact on the course of an investigation by claims of legal professional privilege is often exacerbated by unsubstantiated ambit claims of privilege which becomes the subject of lengthy litigation. In practice, legal professional privilege claimed over a very large number of documents will be found, after lengthy court proceedings, not to be available in respect of a large proportion of those documents at all.

        The Government wishes to express its appreciation to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for their work on the review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights internationally. The Government accords a high priority to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally because we believe that the universal observance of the rights and principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other major international human rights instruments would result in a more just international order, from which security and prosperity of all nations and individuals would benefit.

        The Committee's report deals with a wide range of issues and is an important document which focuses public attention on what are at times very complex human rights issues. As can be seen from the Government's response to the Committee's recommendations, these issues are continually under review as we consider ways of improving our performance in promoting and protecting human rights observance internationally.

         As an initiative to develop regional understanding on human rights matters, the Committee recommends that the Government explore with regional countries the possibility of establishing a regional dialogue on human rights through regular ministerial meetings of the foreign ministers as appropriate, of the APEC countries and through regular contacts between the Human Rights Commissions of regional countries.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government seeks to establish international mechanisms for contact and dialogue wherever possible. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and other ministers regularly discuss human rights in bilateral meetings in the region. As well, the two delegations to China and the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation's visit this year to Vietnam have succeeded in establishing dialogue on a number of issues of mutual concern, including that of human rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government also gives a high priority to encouraging the establishment and strengthening of national human rights institutions in countries in the region. Through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Australia has provided a substantial degree of cooperation and technical assistance on national human rights institutions to a number of countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea. As well, the Government has contributed $300,000 to the UN Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation for the purpose of strengthening the domestic infrastructures which support human rights and, in particular, national human rights machinery in the Asia-Pacific region.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has long supported the development of Asia-Pacific human rights arrangements which would complement the UN human rights machinery and national institutions established in a number of countries in the region for the promotion and protection of human rights. In this context, the Government has been, over recent years, in consultation with other governments on the prospects for a structured dialogue, which might eventually extend to regular meetings at a ministerial level. The Asia-Pacific is the only region of the world which is still without such an arrangement. The Government believes a regional arrangement would foster greater understanding, cooperation and maintenance of universal human rights principles amongst the diverse and varied social systems and cultures in the Asia-Pacific. The Government's experience on this subject suggests that although there is interest by many countries of the region in closer cooperation on human rights some of them are not ready to formalise this and that further work will be required before such an arrangement could be set in place.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To advance work on a regional arrangement, three UN-sponsored meetings have been held, in Manila in 1990, Jakarta in 1993 and Seoul in 1994. At the meeting in Seoul, while there was no consensus on the establishmentâ€”of a formal regional mechanicism there was a general desire that discussions should continue. A resolution supporting regional activity was introduced by the Republic of Korea and supported by Australia at the 1995 session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and was adopted by consensus. At a meeting of national human rights institutions held in Manila in April this year, participants, who represented national institutions not governments, affirmed their support for regional cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Government considers the strengthening of the networks that are developing between national commissions in the region will assist in the establishment of a regional human rights body.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government will continue to look for opportunities to extend dialogue on human rights within the limitations of available resources.

        The Government is concerned that the US budgetary process will have a dramatic impact on funding to UN specialised agencies, the UN regular budget and its peace keeping operations. The Government is also concerned that current US domestic fiscal pressures will mean that the US will not address its significant arrears. Appropriate opportunities have been taken over the last year to register these concerns with the Administration and the US Congress. Mr. Bilney, as acting Foreign Minister, wrote to key US Congressmen noting Australia's concerns relating to declining aid volumes. In our representations we have emphasised that our concern is not the United States' internal budgetary processes but the global impact of significant reductions in foreign relations expenditure, and the need to ensure a strong US presence across the multilateral system.

        The prospect of significant US funding shortfalls is focusing agencies on reform measures and presents a possible opportunity to pursue with increased determination the reform of the UN and its specialised agencies. US funding shortfalls may convince secretariats and member States of the need for closer adherence to mandates and prioritisation of work programs.

        As of 31 May 1995, member States owed the UN an overall total of USD2.8 billion (US arrears were USD1.2 million). Of this amount, USD1.1 billion is for the regular budget and USD1.7 billion is for peace keeping operations. The UN Secretary-General noted in his statement to last year's session of the UN's General Assembly (UNGA49), and repeated subsequently on 22 June this year, that the financial crisis of the UN was threatening its ability to carry out its major functions, including peace keeping and other programs and activities funded from the regular budget. Australia continues to urge all UN members, including the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN's regular budget, to the peace keeping scale and to the specialised agencies on time and in full, as is our own practice.

        The Government is committed to ensuring that adequate resources from within the UN system are made available for strengthening the operation of the UN human rights system including the Centre for Human Rights. At the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Australia argued strongly for the United Nations to devote the financial resources necessary for strengthening human rights activities. Since then, Australia has continued to argue in the UN Commission on Human Rights and at the UN General Assembly, for a greater proportion of the UN budget to be devoted to human rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to increased financial resources for UN human rights machinery, the Government has strongly encouraged the UN to provide the administrative, managerial and staff resources required by the UN Centre for Human Rights to carry out its core functions as the focal point for the human rights activities of the UN, and has supported reform efforts currently underway in the Centre. Australia has urged the Centre for Human Rights to strengthen its management so that it can operate more efficiently and effectively.

        The position of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was set up in 1994 to develop coordination between the various UN agencies on human rights as well as to integrate human rights activities in peace keeping and humanitarian assistance operations. Australia fought hard for the appointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights and has consistently supported the development of his role as the head of the UN human rights system and in coordinating human rights activities in the UN. The first incumbent, Mr. Jose Ayala Lasso, visited Australia in April 1995 as a guest of the Government.

        In keeping with the high priority the Government places on the need to ensure that adequate resources are made available for strengthening the operation of the UN human rights system and the importance of effective national human rights institutions, the Government has provided financial support to the UN for the creation of the position of Special Adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on National Human Rights Institutions. Mr. Brian Burdekin, former Australian Federal Human Rights Commissioner and an internationally regarded expert on national human rights institutions, has been appointed to the position for a two-year period. Mr. Burdekin commenced duty in Geneva on 26 July 1995.

        Criteria for membership of UN human rights committees established pursuant to the key UN human rights instruments are contained within each instrument. In summary, the instruments stipulate that committees should be made up of experts of high moral standing and competence in fields covered by the Conventions and elected by States parties from amongst their nationals. Experts are to serve in their personal capacity but consideration should also be given to equitable geographic distribution and principal legal systems. Alteration of this committee structure would require amendment of individual instruments. Opening for negotiation previously agreed language is an uncertain process and could result in amendments that would limit rather than enhance committee independence. In addition, amendment of UN conventions is time-consuming and expensive due to the requirement to consult widely and thoroughly amongst member States of the United Nations.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is the view of the Australian Government that efforts should be focused on ensuring that membership criteria are adhered to rather than revising the present committee structure. To this end, Australia carefully scrutinises each application for membership to UN human rights committees to ensure that high quality candidates are selected for vacant positions. In addition, Australia advocates and promotes the continual strengthening of the international human rights system of which the human rights treaty committees are an integral element. The Government does not agree that membership of the Human Rights Committee should be confined to experts elected by States parties which have signed the First (Optional) Protocol. This would require amendment of the International Covenant on Cultural and Political Rights (ICCPR), raising the problems set out above. It is the view of the Australian Government that the existing guidelines for membership of the Human Rights Committee are appropriate and that efforts should be concentrated on ensuring the guidelines are adhered to in electing committee members.

        Limiting membership of the Human Rights Committee by the method suggested would elevate the complaints mechanism above other key functions of the Committee, including the consideration of reports on measures adopted and progress made by States in achieving observance of the rights enshrined in the Covenant. Moreover, States which have not ratified the First (Optional) Protocol may be reluctant to participate in the reporting process if they were not able to nominate their nationals for election to the Committee. Membership of other human rights committees is not limited to those which have agreed to be bound by the complaints mechanism contained within the instrument.

        Work on redrafting racial vilification legislation was completed in 1994 following community), consultations held in 1993 to gauge public reaction to the Racial Vilification Bill 1992, which lapsed following the proroguing of Parliament on the calling of the March 1993 Federal Election.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The redrafted legislationâ€”the Racial Hatred Bill 1994â€”originated in three major inquiries which found gaps in the protection provided by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence, The Australian Law Reform Commission Report into Multiculturalism and the Law, and The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all favoured an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Racial Hatred Bill was intended to close a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour, and to provide a safety net for racial harmony in Australia as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Racial Hatred Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 16 November 1994. It was introduced to the Senate on 28 November 1994 and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for report by 7 March 1995. In the Committees's report, the majority recommended that the Bill be enacted as introduced.

        The Bill as introduced to the Parliament sought to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences. However, the criminal offence provisions were deleted by the Senate during the Committee stages of debate on 24 August 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The remaining provisions of the Bill were passed without amendment by the Senate. They created a civil prohibition against racial hatred by inserting new sections 18B to 18E into the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to make it unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On 31 August 1995 , the Government agreed to accept the Senate's amendments so that Australians gained the benefit of the remaining provisions of the Bill. Importantly thisâ€”provides an avenue of complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is a vast improvement for people in States or Territories that currently have no such avenues of redress.

        However, the Government remains convinced of the need for appropriate remedies in the criminal law to deal with extreme racist behaviour.

        Regular reporting on human rights is an important requirement of Australian missions overseas. This requirement is set out in the directives provided to newly appointed Heads of Mission and evaluated in the Evaluation Review of each post conducted annually by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Human rights objectives figure prominently in the planning programs of many posts. Posts are tasked with specific reporting on human rights matters as required and many posts in countries with serious human rights problems provide human rights reporting on a regular basis. All posts are encouraged to incorporate human rights issues into their regular political and economic reporting. It remains the Government's view that because of this on-going human rights reporting, which is targeted at meeting specific needs, reporting on an annual basis irrespective of the particular circumstances prevailing in the country would be an unnecessary diversion of resources.

        There have been calls on the Government to refer the matter of an inquiry into the desirability of a Bill of Rights to the Law Reform Commission. The Government is reluctant to embark on a Law Reform Commission report at this time. The Government however, will be pursuing the Australian Law Reform Commission's Equality Act proposal and it is hoped that a response to this measure will give a clear view as to community attitudes to many of the issues. In this regard the Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended in its report, Equality Before the Law Women's Equality, that the Government enact equality legislation which would benefit both women and men. Initially, the legislation would take the form of an ordinary Act of Parliament, the long-term goal being entrenchment of the Equality Act in the Constitution. This proposal focuses primarily on providing for equality in law, which should be defined to include equality before the law, equality under the law, equal protection of the law, equal benefit of the law and the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

        The WTO agreement establishes a non-discriminatory multilateral system of trade rules and obligations. The achievements made through its forerunner, the GATT, and in particular through the Uruguay Round of negotiations, were considerable. Insofar as trade liberalisation has resulted in rises in levels of development and standards of living, the GATTWTO has contributed to the better observance of economic and social rights.

        The issue of further discussion of trade and labour standards in the WTO has been raised by the United States and some European countries. The Government stands ready to contribute to such discussion in the WTO, but remains concerned that any links between labour standards and trade rules and obligations are not used for protectionist purposes, and do not create a North-South divide in the international trading system.

        However, concern over the effects of globalization on labour standards is widespread. The ILO has recognised that there is a link between trade liberalisation and social progress. The ILO has consequently established a Working Party on the Social Dimensions of the Liberalisation of Trade to consider ways in which the opportunities afforded by economic growth can be used to promote the adoption and implementation of ILO standards and to strengthen the effectiveness of the ILO's activities. The Government has supported this development in the ILO, as well as a study underway in the OECD on trade and labour standards.

        The WTO has 100 members at present, and another 56 GATT contracting parties are expected to join. Almost all are also members of the ILO, which has 171 members, and of the UN, which has 185 members. Membership of WTO is clearly not incompatible with membership of the ILO and other international rights agencies and agreements. Major studies are currently underway in the ILO and OECD on trade and labour standards. For these reasons, the Government does not consider an inquiry along the lines of that proposed in this recommendation is necessary.

        The Australian Government, along with 179 other nations, endorsed the Program of Action (POA) of the UN International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994. The POA establishes the framework within which multilateral and bilateral population assistance programs operate and emphasises that coercion has no place in family planning programs. Such programs must be based on the right of individuals and couples to decide freely and responsibly on the size and spacing of their family.

        Australia is opposed to the exercise of coercion in family planning programs. In developing countries such as China, we seek to demonstrate the benefits of voluntarism in family planning programs through Australian aid projects. The Chinese authorities have agreed that the principle of voluntarism will be upheld in our aid activities. For example, the Ningxia Family Planning, Women's and Children's Health project is safeguarded by an agreement with the Chinese authorities that coercive practices will not take place in the area of project activity. Thorough monitoring by the Embassy ensures that this agreement is upheld. In addition, in relation to China, a number of representations have been made on the issue of coercion and will continue to be made, including in the context of human rights delegations such as those Australia has sent to China.

        The Government makes bilateral representations to recipient countries to emphasise the efficacy of family planning services based on the principles agreed in the POA.

AusAID maintains close contact with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Beijing and seeks to reinforce UNFPA's commitment to combating the use of coercion in China's family planning programs.

        Restoring law and order, and the infrastructure needed to support it, is vital to the success of peace keeping operations and "justice packages" can be developed to ensure viable local legal systems. Such "justice packages" must draw upon universal principles and local personnel should be trained to take over their own systems. However the reasons the rule of law and infrastructure break down, are invariably complex and while "justice packages" are an important component in the restoration of law and order and the rehabilitation of government institutions, they are only one of a number of issues that must be addressed in developing sustainable solutions to complex emergencies. The Government supports the United Nations' efforts aimed at comprehensive responses to international emergencies and, through cooperation between agencies, the development of strategies to facilitate the transition from relief to rehabilitation and development.

        The intra-state nature of much modern conflict poses a whole range of new complications, especially the disintegration of law and order as the government in the zone of conflict loses control. The multi-dimensional nature of the United Nations' response can include cantonment and demobilisation of troops, election monitoring or Organisation, the repatriation of refugees, human rights protection, the monitoring of police activities and police training, and exercising some control over civil administration functions. Australia has, and will continue to promote the importance of restoring and maintaining law and order and of protecting the human rights of the local population. The Government recognises that local judicial processes need to be created or strengthened so that an effective criminal system is in place to deal with human rights offenders, including after the UN peace keeping force has departed. Where there has been a breakdown in law and order, "justice packages" should be developed with the aim of ensuring viable local legal systems. This could include assistance such as: creating a body of criminal law and procedure; establishing police forces; training judges, prosecutors and defenders; and developing adequate correctional institutions.

        In its present form, the UN Register of Conventional Arms covers seven categories of large scale military equipment: battle tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, large calibre artillery, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships and long range missiles and missile launchers. During meetings of an expert group convened in 1994, it became apparent that member States did not support expansion of the register at this stage, either to include new categories of weapons or to include production and holdings as well as transfers. The question of expanding the register will not be considered again until 1997.

Australia also announced a further $3.6 million in 1995-96 for bilateral demining activities, the bulk of which will be channelled through UN agencies with existing programs.

To this end we made representations on a regular basis through our Embassies in the Asia-Pacific region, capitalising on the higher profile of the Convention and Protocol in the lead up to the Review Conference. We have also raised, and will continue to raise the issue of adherence at Ministerial and senior officials levels in regular political, and arms control and disarmament exchanges.

        The Australian Government is committed to the elimination of all anti-personnel landmines as an ultimate goal. But in the absence of widespread international support for an absolute ban, at least pending the development of viable and humane alternatives, it will continue to make sense to pursue lesser, but still eminently worthwhile, practical solutions to begin to reverse the appalling problems created by the proliferation and misuse of these weapons.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Last year, the Government supported a UN General Assembly resolution adopted by consensus, that affirmed "the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines as viable and humane alternatives are developed". At present, however, landmines, like other conventional weapons, are regarded by most States parties to the Inhumane Weapons Convention (IWC) as a legitimate weapon when used responsibly and only against potential enemy combatant forces in times of armed conflict. Today's problems are due to the misuse of landmines, and what makes this misuse so reprehensible is that mines continue to kill and maim long after conflict is over. The Government's approach is focused on achieving concrete results which would have a practical effect in saving lives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We do not believe that simply advocating a total ban now offers an effective and realistic response to the pressing problems that the indiscriminate use of landmines is causing now for communities in many parts of the world. From discussions we have had, in particular as part of the diplomatic activity leading up to the Review Conference of the IWC, it has become apparent that adequate international support for an immediate and total ban does not exist at present. There are only nine countries which, ostensibly and in principle, support a total ban. They are Austria, Belgium, Cambodia, Colombia, Estonia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway and Sweden (of which Cambodia, Colombia and Estonia are not members of the IWC). Few of these countries have abolished their stocks of anti-personnel landmines or instructed their armed forces not to use mines. Further, most have significant qualifications to their positions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Until humane and viable alternatives are developed, the creation of a sufficiently broad international consensus favouring a total ban remains unlikely.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government believes that the international leadership role which Australia has adopted in pursuing a ban on non-detectable and non-self-destructing/self-deactivating mines, and pursuing increased participation in the IWC represents a practical and productive approach to the landmine problem at the present time, while meeting legitimate security concerns.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mines are a unique type of defensive weapon. For Australiaâ€”with a vast amount of territory to defend with a very small force-the task of defending Australia, and in particular, of protecting vital installations in a conflict, would be more difficult if the ADF were denied the use of all types of anti-personnel landmines. Mines represent a threat, an obstacle or a delay, which decreases the mobility and manoeuvre opportunities for an opponent and reduces the number of troops needed for the defence of an area or a facility. For Australia, with vital forward operating bases and important surveillance facilities in remote parts of the continent, this latter role is particularly important. The Department of Defence has looked at this issue in detail and concluded that while long lived mines were not essential in modern warfare or to defend Australia, there is no doubt that the ADF would be significantly disadvantaged if it were unable to use short lived anti-personnel mines. This would risk Australian lives, threaten the success of our military operations, risk prolonging the conflict, and threaten Australian security. And the dangers would be even higher if the opponent was using mines while the ADF, through a unilateral decision to support a total ban, could not.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is therefore of the view that, in the absence of widespread international support for an absolute ban at the present time, the misuse of landmines by some groups or countries should not result in their denial to responsible defence forces such as Australia's. Australia of course is a party to the Inhumane Weapons Convention, and the Government takes its obligations under the Convention most seriously. The provisions of the Convention are built into the training and operational doctrine of the Australian Defence Forces. The problem is that the improper use of anti-personnel landmines can cause indiscriminate death and injury, including to non-combatants, long after conflicts have finished. This is the problem which Australia's approach is intended to solve.

        In recognition of this, a core component of the Government's Justice Statement is the National Women's Justice Strategy (NWJS). The NWJS is designed to alleviate the barriers women face in gaining access to justice and provides $12.3 million over four years for the establishment of a network of women's legal services. Funding of $5 million over four years will enable the network of women's legal centres to establish specialist services for indigenous women.

        The National Women's Justice Strategy responds to key recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission's Equality Before the Law report.

        There is already a mechanism for identifying and prosecuting those responsible for serious crimes, including rape, committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the form of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Legislation to permit Australian cooperation with the Tribunal, the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995, came into force on 28 August 1995. This Act, which will enable Australia to assist and comply with requests from the Tribunal, provides for various forms of assistance, including the taking of evidence in Australia for Tribunal purposes and the surrendering of suspects in Australia to the Tribunal for trial if the Tribunal so requests. This is in addition to Australia's existing extradition network enabling the extradition of a person in Australia to face war crimes charges in a country with which we have an extradition relationship and for which war crimes are extraditable offences, if that country so requested.

In addition, Rules 71 and 90 provide for evidence to be submitted by way of deposition, that is, testimony given by witnesses who are unable or unwilling to testify subsequently in open court.

        It is the Australian Government's policy that activities supported through the aid program should protect and promote human rights. This includes the right of couples and individuals to have access to a range of high quality family planning options and the right to exercise choices about family planning free from coercion. To this end, in 1994, the Government approved guidelines to ensure that population related activities offered as part of Australia's aid program protect human rights. In particular, the guidelines ensure that family planning projects funded through the aid program do not force individuals to adopt particular forms of family planning. All population projects funded under the aid program are examined against the guidelines prior to funding being approved. In addition, funding for the multilateral population agencies is conditional upon the agencies providing statements which demonstrate that their programs and policies are consistent with AusAID's guidelines. The Government monitors the performance of the multilateral population agencies through its participation at governing board meetings.

        Australia has not ratified the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others as we believe that the views expressed on the issue of prostitution are outmoded and because Australia is a party to each of the four international instruments dealing with the traffic of women and children that the 1949 Convention sought to consolidate. (Australia has also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) and supports the establishment of an Optional Protocol to the CROC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The obligations imposed under these more recent international instruments render ratification of the 1949 Convention unnecessary.) While Australia condemns both traffic in persons and the exploitation of prostitution, the 1949 Convention also seeks indirectly to make the practice of prostitution itself illegal which conflicts with trends in Australia towards the legalisation of prostitution. For these reasons it would seem inappropriate for Australia to urge other states to ratify the 1949 Convention.

        HIV/AIDS is not only a health problem but is also a social, economic and development issue. Therefore prevention and care programs need to adopt a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approach. An effective response to the pandemic must be based on high levels of political will and partnership between governments, medical and scientific bodies, the non-governmental sector, religious groups, the media and the broader community. In the absence of a vaccine, the Government considers that the most effective method of preventing the spread of HIV is through well-targeted information and education campaigns, training for health care workers, effective screening of blood supplies and a supportive social, legal and political environment.

        The ILO has been concerned with the issue of child labour since its inception in 1919. In 1973 the ILO consolidated previous conventions on the subject into a revised convention, Convention 138, the Minimum Age Convention, 1973. Only 46 of the ILO's 175 member States have ratified the Convention.
       </para>

        Australia has not ratified Convention 138. The Inter-governmental Task Force established in 1991 to review unratified ILO Conventions and an independent expert have examined in detail the ratification prospects for the Convention. Both enquiries identified significant compliance problems for Australia concerning the Convention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia's non-ratification of Convention 138 has been due to the different approaches adopted to prohibiting work for children below 15 years of age by the Convention, which is highly prescriptive, and by Australian legislation, which provides for compulsory school attendance and child welfare protection. Convention 138 requires legislation fixing the minimum age of not less than 15 years for entry into employment or work. While the Convention allows some exclusions on matters such as artistic performances or light work, the conditions under which these are permissible are quite strict. The Convention deals only with minimum age, and does not recognise that child labour encompasses a wide range of activities, not all of which are considered harmful or exploitative. By contrast, UNICEF has developed a set of criteria to assist in determining when work done by children becomes exploitative.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is concerned that a Convention on such an important issue has only been ratified by some 46 countries. The ILO, however, is actively promoting observance of the Convention as part of its wider promotion of human rights labour standards in line with the outcomes of the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 to promote respect for basic human rights as embodied in relevant ILO Conventions (including Convention 138).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As part of its follow-up action to the World Summit, the ILO is currently seeking information on the difficulties and obstacles to ratification from those countries which have not ratified Convention 138 and other core human rights conventions. This information will be consolidated into a report for consideration by the ILO Governing Body in November 1995. The ILO Governing Body will also be holding a discussion in its employment committee on a report on child labour prepared by the International Labour Office.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These ILO activities will provide an opportunity to consider what further action might be possible in terms of either ensuring greater observance or ratification of Convention 138 or whether other options should be pursued. One possible option would be to revise Convention 138. A revised Convention which establishes effective and workable standards and which can be widely ratified would underline the ILO's authority in this field and provide direction for its technical assistance activities.

        As outlined in the response to Recommendation 19 above, the Government has reservations about labour standards being raised in the WTO. The issue of whether there are enough trade related interests to warrant further discussion of trade and labour standards in the WTO has been raised by the United States and some European countries. The Government stands ready to contribute to such discussion in the WTO, but remains concerned that any links between labour standards and trade rules and obligations are not used for protectionist purposes, and do not create a North-South divide in the international trading system.

        The wording of this recommendation raises an issue of definition which needs to be clarified before the substance of the recommendation is addressed. The matter that needs clarification is the use of the word "refugee". The Government does not detain refugees, ie, those who have sought Australia's protection and have been granted a protection visa. It is assumed that the Committee's reference to "refugees" is a reference to unauthorised boat people or asylum claimants in general. The use of the term "refugee" in this context is misleading as it assumes that all boat arrivals/asylum claimants are in fact refugees in terms of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees. Australia does not recognise its asylum claimants, whether or not they arrive by boat, as refugees until their claims under the Convention have been heard and accepted. Once a person's claims are accepted he or she is granted a protection visa and is no longer detained.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In general, asylum seekers who have entered Australia with a visa and are immigration cleared on arrival are not detained. The bridging visa mechanism allows claimants who become unlawful non-citizens to remain at liberty while their claims are assessed. There will be exceptions where an assessment is made that the claimant will not abide by conditions imposed on their bridging visa (such as regular reporting to the department) or where a claimant has already breached conditions of the bridging visa granted. Decisions to refuse a bridging visa are merits reviewable by the Immigration Review Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It has been a long-standing policy of the Government, that unauthorised arrivals usually be detained, irrespective of whether they are asylum claimants. That current policy has been reviewed recently and the Government does not consider that a further specific review is called for. On 27 May 1993, the Senate passed a resolution requesting that the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration (the Committee) conduct an inquiry into immigration detention practices in Australia. The inquiry occurred over a 9 month period and included consultations with community and government representatives. It visited various immigration detention, and reception and processing centres around Australia and held discussions with staff and detainees at those centres.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee's report, Asylum, Border Control and Detention, was tabled in Parliament on 2 March 1994. In this report the Committee supported the broad thrust of Australia's existing immigration detention policy, but recommended that modifications be introduced to guard against prolonged detention of asylum seekers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee emphasised that Australia must retain its sovereign right to determine who may enter, the conditions under which a non-citizen's entry may be permitted, and the circumstances under which a non-citizen may be permitted to stay or may be removed from Australia. The Committee determined that Australia's system of immigration control, which supports Australia's important migration program, must be upheld.

        During the inquiry the Committee considered a number of options presented to it for the release into the community of asylum seekers. In reaching their recommendations the Committee took account of:

        The Committee also listened to various complaints and criticisms about the immigration detention centres and sought responses from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Protective Service (APS) in relation to those complaints. The Committee found that the Department and APS were sensitive to the criticisms and were able to point to a range of improvements which had been made. In March 1992, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) prepared a draft report detailing the findings of visits made to the Darwin Detention Centre and the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre by the Acting Secretary of HREOC in August and December 1991, following representations which had been made to HREOC. This report, considered by the Committee, confirmed that most issues relating to conditions within detention centres are readily addressed and the most serious problem faced by detainees was the length of time they were likely to be held in detention awaiting determination of their refugee status.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Committee considered that the Government cannot be held responsible for prolonged detention where people pursue the administrative and legal options available to them, it was also concerned that there be a capacity to consider release. In this regard provisions are now in place for release on compassionate grounds, including age (both for children where it is in the child's best interests and for the elderly), ill health and previous experience of torture and trauma. The Government's response to the Committee's Report also stated that it will implement the recommendation to give the Minister for Immigration the discretionary power to enable the release of those who claim refugee status where they have been detained for more than six months from receipt of their application without a primary decision. Migration Legislation Bill No. 5 contained an amendment to effect this purpose and was passed by the Parliament on 31 August 1995.

        A detailed response to the Committee's report was tabled in Parliament on 22 September 1994. The evidence in the Committee's Report and the Government's response, which provides agreement to implement the majority of the proposals advanced by the Committee, demonstrates not only that the Government has acted with probity in dealing with unauthorised arrivals, but that it continues to explore means by which such people can be dealt with in a more humane way.

         The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) eleventh seminar on migration, held in October 1994, was on the issue of the International Response to Trafficking in Migrants and the Safeguarding of Migrant Rights and was chaired by the Deputy Secretary DIEA. The three day meeting enabled representatives from countries of origin, transit and destination to meet and discuss the problem and appropriate responses. The seminar participants called on IOM to act as a catalyst to advance international and policy dialogue on migrant trafficking by helping to forge and consolidate the necessary alliances between countries, intergovernmental and non governmental organisations and other key actors. To this end a Working Group on Migrant Trafficking was established.

        The Australian Government consistently supported the right of all women, including Tibetan women, to participate in the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and the associated Non-Governmental Forum `95.

As well, Australia made representations to the United Nations to emphasise the importance we placed on the resolution of this problem. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, China did not issue visas to members of the TWA in India and the NGO Forum had to proceed without their valuable input.

        The present whereabouts and release of Kuwaiti and other nationals still detained in Iraq are the subject of two UN Security Council Resolutions: 686 (paras. 2(c) and 3(c)) adopted 2 March 1991, which governed the cessation of hostilities; and 687 (paras. 30 and 3 1), the so-called "Ceasefire Resolution", adopted on 3 April 1991, and which outlined the framework for future international relations with Iraq.

        Australia's commitment to the comprehensive application of the UN Security Council Resolutions on Iraq remains undiminished. Australia believes there can be no loosening of the sanctions regime until Iraq complies with all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including the above-mentioned provisions in UN Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687 mentioned above. Australia continues to press the Iraqi Government, both multilaterally and bilaterally, to abide by all Security Council Resolutions and has, on numerous occasions, called publicly for the repatriation of Kuwaiti and other persons still detained in Iraq.

         The Committee believes that, in relation to East Timor, if there is to be any prospect of peace, there should be an enduring and just resolution of the Dili massacreâ€”the release of political prisoners and those detained as a consequence of peaceful demonstration, devolution of appropriate powers to the province and the reduction of the combat military forces.

        The Government agrees with the thrust of this recommendation. The Dili massacre is, of course, symptomatic of wider concerns in relation to Indonesia's approach to East Timor. The Government regards the Indonesian Government's response to the Dili massacre as credible, including in its setting up of a National Commission of Inquiry and a Military Honour Council which led to the gaoling of a number of military personnel involved in the Dili killings. The response, however, had some shortcomings. In particular, the Government has continued to make clear to the Indonesian Government its concern about the discrepancies which remain in accounting for those reported missing after the Dili Killings.

The Government takes a particular interest in cases where it appears that a person has been detained for exercising his or her right to peaceful protest.

        The Prime Minister has raised the situation in East Timor with President Suharto on a number of occasions, most recently, in Bali on 17 September 1995. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, also has been long urging on the Indonesian authorities the desirability of their talking frankly and directly to people of different opinions within East Timor, including the armed resistance, about longer term reconciliation strategies for the province. The Government believes such strategies should include a major reduction in the military presence, greater involvement of the East Timorese in the province's economy, further recognition of the distinctive cultural identity of the East Timorese and some measure of political autonomy. Senator Evans reiterated these points publicly after his meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in early August this year.

         The Committee believes that, in relation to Bougainville, despite the failure of the peace conference, there should be no return to violence and both parties should maintain the ceasefire. The Committee hopes that the peace process can be resumed as soon as possible and in particular, that both parties will accept the movement of people within the island so that humanitarian assistance might be freely distributed to all Bougainvilleans. Finally, the Committee urges that the PNG Government and the PNG Defence Forces should continue to give assurances that, in any reconvening of the peace talks, free passage for the leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) be guaranteed and, possibly, that talks should be held on neutral ground.

        Under the `Charter of Mirigini for a New Bougainville', signed in November 1994, a broadly representative Bougainville Transitional Government was sworn into office in April 1995, and immediately commenced discussions with the PNG Government on the political, economic and administrative future of Bougainville. On 18 May the PNG Government and Bougainville Transitional Government announced a series of agreements under the `Waigani Communique', the most significant of which was the announcement of an amnesty for all crimes committed either "on Bougainville or in relation to the Bougainville crisis" during the period I October 1988 to 19 May 1995. The amnesty will apply to the security forces as well as the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) and resistance (civilian militias opposed to the BRA). The Waigani Communique also mandates the Transitional Government to develop its preferred model for the political, economic and administrative/restoration framework of the province for national government consideration. The Australian Government recently announced a further $10 million in humanitarian assistance to Bougainville to help facilitate the restoration process (bringing total allocated assistance to $23 million).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since the Peace Conference and until recently the incidence of armed activity has been low, barring some notable and persistent attacks by hardline BRA groups. There was an increase in the reported armed activity on the island in August 1995. Such action risks undermining the reconciliation process. The BRA leadership has refused to participate in peace negotiations with the PNG and Transitional governments, refused to accept three seats held for it in the Transitional Government and rejected the amnesty offer. Should the BRA leadership declare its willingness to enter into the dialogue and negotiation process, assurances for safe passage would obviously need to be confirmed by the PNG Government with the BRA leaders concerned.

         Mr President the two reports I have tabled involve accommodation projects proposed by the Overseas Property Group. The committee's 27th report for 1995 relates to the construction of accommodation for Australian High Commission staff in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Kuala Lumpur is fast becoming a city where most expatriates can no longer afford to live in free-standing houses as opposed to apartments/town houses. The sustained demand for properties in Kuala Lumpur has made the cost of leasing residential accommodation expensive.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A significant proportion of the Australian-owned residential estate in Kuala Lumpur is nearing the end of its economic life or has proved unsatisfactory for the post's property requirements. Commercial and residential rent escalation has reached 8% plus per annum and the Overseas Property Group expects that at least for the life of this project, rents will continue to escalate, particularly within the immediate areas surrounding the central business district and in proximity to the High Commission.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The economic and life cycle costing analysis of options provided to the committee by Overseas Property Group clearly indicated that constructing a mix of apartments and townhouses on owned sites, selling unsuitable owned accommodation and relinquishing undesirable leases, is the most advantageous and economic course of action in Kuala Lumpur.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Kuala Lumpur proposal referred to the committee involved the construction of a three storey complex of 10 apartments at 9/11 Jalan Taman U Thant and construction of another 10 unit development on a site to be identified. A swimming pool, recreation room and multi-purpose room will be provided as part of each complex. At the public hearing the Overseas Property Group advised that a decision has been made to develop 4 Jalan Taman U Thant and investigations have shown that it is only possible to fit eight townhouses on the site. However, the Overseas Property Group has advised that this will still provide a viable project.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The committee notes an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that it will continue consultations with the Post Property committee during detailed design development. While there was general support for the Kuala Lumpur project from the staff at the High Commission, the Community Public Sector Union and Foreign Service Family Association, there was some concern expressed regarding the extent of the development at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant and also some details of the design of both buildings. As the site at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant was not confirmed until shortly before the public hearing, it is inevitable there is some confusion in relation to the details of the development on that site. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group consult with the staff at the High Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and the Family Service Foreign Association during the detailed design phase to resolve outstanding issues.

         The rapid growth of the Chinese economy in recent years has meant that the Shanghai property market has grown at a feverish pace. The financial pressures on the Shanghai economy are unlikely to abate within the next three to five years. Rents are expected to continue to increase at an estimated rate of 10% p.a. Residential accommodation of a suitable standard and size will continue to be scarce and command premium prices in sought after areas.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Rents are currently in the order of $A19,000 per month and have a fixed escalation clause of 10% p.a for the two year leases. There are currently 10 Australia-based staff in Shanghai with staff numbers likely to increase in the longer term.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On the basis of short supply and rapidly rising costs, the Overseas Property Group in late 1993 examined its property strategy in Shanghai including options of ownership. Early evaluations indicated a simple pay back period for a development option in the designated consular district was less than six years. The Canadian Government has indicated an interest in either renting or meeting the capital cost of two of the apartments. The Overseas Property Group advised that negotiations on this matter are continuing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The 10 apartments in Shanghai will be constructed as a single building of five storeys incorporating two apartments per floor. An indoor swimming pool and a combined recreational room will be provided in a separate recreation facility. Basement car parking and storage areas will be provided under an all weather tennis court which is elevated one metre above natural ground level.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Apartments have been designed in accordance with the design brief, taking account of local building regulations, climatic conditions, the surrounding built environment and the need for privacy, amenity and security for the occupants. Account has also been taken of the recommendations and requirements of the Consulate-General, which has been consulted in the development of the proposal.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In agreeing to the project proceeding the committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group continue consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, staff of the Consulate-General and the Community and Public Sector Union regarding possible changes to the design of the project which will allow for better utilisation of the site.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The committee accepts that many Australians at overseas posts would prefer not to live in compounds. But there is a basic dilemma if we wish to continue adequate Australian representation in many areas where we cannot afford the ever increasing rental costs. So it's a case of building apartments such as outlined in my reports or drastically reducing Australian-based staff.

We had agreed that we would do some of the appropriation bills to fill in between 12.45 to 2 o'clock if we had finished the four non-controversial bills. We were on taxation this morning and I had arranged with senators on this side to speak on that. The non-controversial bills took up all the time so we did not start on the appropriation bills.

I thought it just extraordinary yesterday, with the Senate debating the government's social security bills, that, without any notice at all, the government brought along a whole lot of amendments to its own bill and expected them to be voted upon. Bills that have arisen out of the budget in May are now being presented for the first timeâ€”and the government expects the parliament to be fulfilling a function of scrutiny and review. It really has turned into a farcical situation. Nevertheless, it is your program. If you want it in this order, then we will accommodate your request.

Senator Hill is now clearly raising issues about the content of the appropriation bill itself. I thought he would quite legitimately raise these and other questions on the appropriation bill in the debate that would take place upon this motion being carried. As the list of speakers is quite extensive and includes five from the coalition, I would have thought there would be plenty of opportunities for those questions to be put. And, of course, the minister responds at the end of the debate on questions raised. So, on the point of order, I think we should put the motion and get on with the debate. It will be then that those issues which have been raised by Senator Hill can be discussed.

Is the government really attempting to split the appropriation bills so that when we come back again we will find there is an appropriation bill No. 5 that deals with this quarter of a million dollars? If it is going to do that, we might as well have the debate on the extra quarter of a million in the course of this debate rather than next year.

         As we are about to address these bills, I think some clarification of what the government is planning is warranted because, as I said, there is no doubt that taxpayers are angered at the prospect of having to pay the bill for a party political objection that was instituted by the Prime Minister in an attempt to protect Minister Lawrence in the lead-up to the federal election, matters that have nothing whatsoever to do with her ministerial office as federal Minister for Health but rather to protect her reputation in the lead-up to the election.

         Of course it is history that the royal commissioner found that she had lied; it is history that she refused to resign as she should have; it is history that the Prime Minister demonstrated a lack of national leadership in not standing her down. But what is still current is the question of who is going to pick up the tab. Does this government still expect the Australian taxpayer to pay for this party political exercise, this exercise in which you sought to close down the royal commission and, as a matter of interest, in which an order for costs was made against Minister Lawrence and the other parties?

Why did Minister Beazley last night in effect mislead the Australian people by suggesting that no longer were they expected to pick up the ALP's bill? Why can't these matters be clarified before we start this debate? It seems to me a most appropriate time to do it at this time of reordering the program to facilitate your appropriations. Senator Schacht seems to have passed the baton to Senator Faulkner. He presumably has the answers to these questions and we wish to be enlightened in that regard.

         â€”I briefly want to raise a further concern about the government's change in program. It is always a concern when the Labor Party changes the order of business as listed. In the past we always left debate on the appropriation bills until answers to questions raised at estimates committee hearings had been received. We do that because a lot of the questions asked at estimate committees are very penetrating questions. When ministers have political difficulties in answering questions they get out of it by saying, `We don't have the officer here. We don't have the information here. We will take it on notice.' That is code for saying, `That is a politically difficult question for us. We cannot answer off the cuff. We want to go away and give the most politically neutral answer we can.'

         There is every expectation that we will not come back after Friday. The Labor Party, in typical fashion, is avoiding answering some of the very penetrating questions and politically damaging questions to this government that were asked in estimates over the last couple of weeks. We will now be in a position where those questions, which exposed this government's weaknesses, will not be answered by the government. They will not be answered by the deadlines set by some of the committees, and parliament will not be in a position to demand answers because parliament will not sit again. It means that yet again the Labor Party will have weaseled out of providing the information that the public needs to fully assess the Labor Party's mismanagement of this country and its economy.

Everybody knows that Dr Lawrence has been a big embarrassment and has caused a great deal of concern to the government because of the extent of her fees that she was trying to get the taxpayers to pay to her, not for the inquiry but to try to shut the inquiry down so that the truth could not be found. Dr Lawrence chose that course of action, expecting the taxpayers would pay for it, in typical Labor Party fashion.

Senator Faulkner manages this government business in this chamber in the same way as he manages his portfolio: everything is done on the run. It is done without sufficient thought; it is done without sufficient planning; it has no management principles in it whatsoever. I give the Labor Party a piece of advice: when you get where you will be after the next election, please get a new manager of opposition business in the Senate, which is what the Labor Party will need to manage whatever business they might have when they are in opposition. The way the country has been run is the way this chamber has been run.

It has taken an enormous number of caucus meetings, cabinet meetings, little huddles in the corner and little factions forming amongst the factions of the Labor Party as they try to desperately manage the problems within their own party.

They called the deputy leadership meeting when Senator Evans was overseas. He did not even get a chance to throw his name into the ring. Everybody knew that Senator Evans's reason for going to the lower house was so that he could be Deputy Prime Minister. When Mr Keating leaves after his defeat at the election, Senator Evans wanted to be the Leader of the Opposition, but he was not given the chance.

         Appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 plus the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1995-96â€”the three appropriation bills which are called the additional appropriation billsâ€”were introduced into the parliament on 26 October.

         In debating these bills, and presumably passing them today or tomorrow, the coalition hasâ€”despite the ramblings of the government members oppositeâ€”in fact worked overtime to try to cooperate with the government in putting some semblance of order into its legislative program.

         That poses some difficult problems for us.

          I do urge the government to respond to the cooperative approach that we have adopted on this side to the passage of these bills by providing answers to those questions which are still outstanding. The bills add another, in gross terms, $1.4 billion to the government's expenditure this financial year.

So here againâ€”and we are talking about huge sums of money involving the Commonwealth and Australian taxpayers and the sale of some major assetsâ€”we have every indication of a government in continuing disarray in terms of attempting to manage its program, be it assets sales, be it the handling of legislation here in the Senate, be it virtually anything that the government tackles.

         There is additional spending by the government of a net $1 billion contained in these bills. There is a likely shortfall in assets sales proceeds and there is talk that the government has been putting around in the last few days about proposing to sell the whole of the remaining 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank between now and 30 June next year.

         Then there is the shortfall in the Qantas sale and the government's inability to sell ANL. There has been a complete reversal in terms of its approach to the sale of the AIDC. Only seven months ago it was going to sell the remaining 80 per cent of the shares in the AIDC that are publicly owned. Now it is going to turn around and buy back the 20 per cent that was out in private hands. That is a turnaround in the budget figures of something like $180 million to $200 million. When you look at all of those things you see that the so-called surplus, which we always knew was a spurious surplus, of something like $700 million, published in the May budget, is going to turn out to be a very significant deficit, which could be as high as $3 billion or more.

         That is going to put inevitably increased pressure on interest rates.

That is why the further national dissavings by the Commonwealth government is making it harder and harder for the private sector for investment purposes. At a time when the government bleats about the need for increased national savings, it is putting its hand in the cookie jar of national savings and drawing on those national savings because it is unable to manage its own economic performance and its own finances.

         The economic consequences of these additional appropriation bills, coming on top of the other economic policy failures of the government, are simply going to compound the problems that have befallen and beset this nation as a result of the government's failure, as I say, to manage its own finances and its failure to take the tough decisions, particularly in the area of industrial relations, that are necessary if we are going to move the Australian economy off of the plateau that it is now on.

         We have had a lot of debate in this place in the last few days, and we are going to have a lot more debate in the period ahead, about just what this government has done to taxation since the last election.

         program with Kerry O'Brien, promised that the government would not increase the level of taxation in this country.

         Even if you accept that subsequent reinterpretation and rewriting of what the Prime Minister actually said, he has still failed lamentably in this respect because at the time that he made that statement the level of taxes to GDP in Australiaâ€”that is, in 1992-93â€”was 22.2 per cent. This financial year, on the government's own figures, the level of taxation as a proportion of GDP will be 24.2 per cent. That is two percentage points of GDP higher than the government promised it would be. That is $10 billion higher. In other words, simply because of that percentage increase, let alone all the other tax rip-offs that have occurred, the government has taken an additional $10 billion out of taxpayers' pockets over and above what it had promised to do.

         Worse still, the figures will deteriorate, on the government's own forward estimates, and will get worse over the next few years. That 22.4 per cent in 1995-96 will go out to 24.6 per cent in 1996-97 and it will stay around about that level until the end of the century. In other words, what the government is saying to us in those forward estimatesâ€”that is on existing programs, let alone anything else they might seek to doâ€”that the tax burden will go up in this country. We have always known that that would happen because one of the fundamental differences between Labor governments and governments of Liberal-National Party persuasion is that Labor governments in comparison are big spenders and therefore have to be big taxers. So long as you have a Labor government in power you will have higher government spending than would otherwise be the case. Therefore, you must have higher taxation and all the other consequences that flow from that. You will have higher interest rates, lower levels of employment growth and higher levels of unemployment. The performance of the Australian economy over the last period of this Labor government has shown that par excellence.

         Labor talks about big increases in employment in the last few years. That is an absolute nonsense. It is true that employment has grown in the last few years from the depths that it reached during the recession, but the fact is that there are no more people employed full time in Australia today than there were five years ago, despite the fact that the available work force over that period has increased by something like one million people.

         The employment record of this government has been absolutely appalling. The unemployment record as a consequence has been equally appalling. We now have the terrifying situation where, in a period of what the government claims is good solid economic growth, we are seeing unemployment rise. We have had three successive monthly rises in unemployment. The rate is now 8.7 per cent. It is absolutely inevitable that under a continuation of the government's present policies that figure will, tragically, grow heavily in the new year. That applies to the long-term unemployed and the short-term unemployedâ€”the whole lot of the unemployment pool. Long-term unemployment today is virtually unchanged on what it was a year ago.

Both Senator Hill and me raised the concern about the alarm bells that seem to have been ringing as a result of Senator Evans's statement today during his doorstop interview.

         Last night in the House of Representatives the government bowed to the coalition's amendment to delete approximately $250,000 from the $800,000 that was contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) for the purposes of meeting her expenses. I am pleased to say that we have managed to force the government to reduce that $800,000 by $250,000, being the amount of taxpayers' money that was proposed to be spent on reimbursing Carmen Lawrence for her costs in mounting the challenges to the very validity of the royal commission. That was a party political stunt if ever there was one by the Labor Party. They were never prepared to accept the existence of the royal commission and its validity and they went hell-bent for purely political purposes to prevent the royal commission ever taking place.

As a result, the amendment was made last night to the appropriation bill in the House of Representatives, which has now come into the Senate and which we are now debatingâ€”that is, Appropriation Bill (No. 4).

         It is interesting that there are two ministers' legal costs that are being met in these legal bills. One is Carmen Lawrence's. The other is the payment of $544,000 for the legal costs of Mr Alan Griffiths in connection with the notorious sandwich shop affair. There was an inquiry by Mr Michael Codd involving Mr Griffiths in that respect. Although the costs are included in the appropriation bills, they have never been identified as such. It was only simply by asking questions of the Attorney-General's Department that we have confirmed the sum and the purposes following press reports to that effect.

As a result, this has necessitated huge additional tax rip-offs of the Australian people, which will lead to inevitable further hardship for Australians, who have suffered great damage under this government over the last dozen years.

         â€”I, like Senator Short, want to deal, if only briefly at this stage, with one of the phoney elements of this budget, that is, the extent to which the surplus has been massively padded and will not be achieved. Senator Short dealt with big ticket items. I point to the way this government has tried to milk its government business enterprises such as Telstra to pay huge dividends which they cannot afford and which are leading to financial problems within the organisations.

         A multi-million dollar dividend was required by the government from Telstra. This was a record, by the way, and far higher than the percentage of profit normally paid by government business enterprises. The consequences are that it is paid out of profits that telephone users have to pay. The more profit and more dividend that the government squeezes out of Telstra, the more Telstra has to get from somewhere. And that somewhere is the Australian consumerâ€”the ordinary Australian user of the phone services.

         What is particularly dreadful about the way the government screwed extra multi-millions of dollars in dividends which should not have been paid out of Telstra was that Telstra knew at the time, and the government knew at the time, that Telstra would have a negative cash flow of half a billion dollars in the current financial year, according to its budget. In fact, we found out when the famous Blount memo was leaked to me a couple of weeks ago that this was going to blow out further, by another $1 billionâ€”a $1,000 million negative cash flow in addition to the half a billion dollars negative cash flow that was in the budget. In other words, overall, Telstra was going to be $1,500 million short of cash, which might explain why some Telstra employees were complaining they were getting a pretty frosty reception from some hotels when they wanted to book in on business, because Telstra was not too prompt about paying their bills.

         The point in relation to this debate is that Telstra and the government knew it would not have the cash, that it would be behind by half a billion dollars in its cash flow. Despite that, the government demanded it pay its highest ever dividend and its highest ever proportion of profits in dividend to the government to help it out of a budget problem. In other words, this government will cheat, dodge and sneak around to, if you like, fudge the figures so that its budget looks better than it really is. Of course, as Senator Short said, its asset sales program is absolutely hopeless, so we cannot expect anything like this phoney budget surplus to be achieved.

Quite frankly, if you were a worker in an area that was under the `control' of the AWU, would you want these peopleâ€”people described as incompetent, hopeless and embarrassing who made a laughing stock of the unionâ€”looking after your best interests?

They are still before the Industrial Relations Commission trying to get justice something like a year and a half after their disgraceful sacking.

         â€”We are considering Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), and I will speak to them in the reverse order. In one of the appropriation bills before us and under consideration today is the Lawrence legal costs. The stance of the Greens (WA) on this has been clear from the outset: there was no appropriateness in the executive assuring, through a cabinet decision, Dr Lawrence a blank cheque from the taxpayer. In this regard, I hold the cabinet responsible rather than Dr Lawrence, who did not ask for that.

         A valuable lesson that we should take on board is that Dr Lawrence has been left in an invidious position because the cabinet assured her, as I said, a blank cheque. They also seemed to have facilitated that she got the most expensive legal costs in the country, not only for her defence but for a challenge.

         In that way the cabinet left Dr Lawrence exposed to a most invidious situation. They did it without the parliamentary right to do it. In fact, that whole position, as argued in the chamber in August by the opposition, the Greens and I believe the Australian Democrats, has been vindicated by the fact that it actually appears as an item in the appropriations. It proves the statement that was made in August in this chamber that the government had no right, the executive had no right, to determine the allocation of taxpayers' funds without the approval of parliament. It did so without having that consent. In that respect, it has been solely responsible for the exposure that Dr Lawrence has been given in relation to her defence costs and also the costs of the challenge.

         The Greens made a statement on 24 August that the government had shown no good reason for Dr Lawrence being provided with legal funding. In fact, the precedent cited by the government did not fit the situation. The guidelines providing ministers with legal aid did not fit. There is a very questionable constitutional basis for what has been requested, even in this appropriation bill before us now, and I believe it is a question that has not been properly determined even by the committee that was set up to look into this matter.

         Finally, the legal argument whereby the government refers to a particular section of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 is highly questionable and its interpretation begs credibility. What it has used to support the legitimacy of the funding is subsection 4(4), which says:

         I believe the government has one thing right in that it has accused the whole royal commission of being a political exercise. I see that as a perfectly reasonable and arguable statement. But the government has also fallen into an equivalent error of using as a political matter defence costs, a challenge to the commission and federal funding thereof for a federal minister in relation to her previous role. That would therefore be appropriately addressed by her political party rather than by the parliament and by the taxpayer. As I said, we did not believe that it was a legitimate use of funding. At that time there was support from the opposition and also the Democrats in that regard.

That was a particular spin that the media chose to take on the remarks we madeâ€”which were that she had been left in an invidious position, a position many people in this country are in, but, because of her role as a minister, she was in a somewhat more fortunate position than other people. First, she had a cabinet that was willing to put themselves out on such a limb as to be highly questionable. Secondly, she is a minister, she has a salary and she has not resigned. Thirdly, this is being used in a preferential way.

         I believe the Democrats have made a response in that regard.

         The opposition has had a remarkable change of heart and mellowed quite considerably. I am not entirely sure of the reasons for that. Perhaps they feel that when they are in government they would like to accept the same precedent that has been established. However, they have agreed to the defence costs being covered. All I want to say about that is that I think we should be able to rejoice in a diversity of views in this chamber. It is extraordinary that the opposition has changed its mind because the principles underlying the inappropriateness of this segment of Appropriation Bill (No.4) remain and have not been sufficiently addressed.

         Nonetheless, that has been dealt with in the House of Representatives by pre-empting any decision that this chamber may want to bring to it or any delay discussion may bring. So the government has taken advantage of the opposition's mellowing in relation to this. It has taken advantage of it in a pragmatic way rather than a principled way. It has even had the audacity to state that. That is something we should be quite concerned about, because I think this is a case study where a cabinet makes a decision and then, by dint of persuasion, challenge in the media, sympathy, allegations of victimisation, et cetera, actually turns the parliament around to at least fund in part something which it did not have the executive power to order in the first place. So the Greens remain on the record as being against the principle that has been involved.

However, it is not ever accepted that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) be challenged in that same way, because Appropriation Bill (No. 3), being a supply bill, falls into the convention that the Senate should use its powers to block supply only in very extreme circumstances, that it has total justification for taking the elected government back to the people because it has done something that is worthy of this happening.

         I want to discuss in the remainder of my speech the issue of the Senate's powers to block supply. This has been particularly relevant because in recent weeks we have had the nostalgia surrounding the anniversary of the dismissal in 1975. It is also particularly relevant because there are some proposals regarding whether the Senate should relinquish the power to block supply. In fact, the Australian Democrats have promoted that view by saying that their membership, on coming into the Senate, would immediately sign an undertaking that they will never block supply no matter who is in government.

Far from their previous motto of `keeping the bastards honest', they are actually changing it in this way by saying, `Keeping the bastards in government, no matter who they are nor what they do.'

         While I want to comment on that, I just want to contrast where the Greens (WA) view the position. We view it very differently.

However, we feel very strongly that we should never surrender that power. We believeâ€”and I think we have grounds to believeâ€”that it is the basis of federation. The importance of the Senate is made quite clear in section 67 of the

         The Senate is one of the most conspicuous, and unquestionably the most important, of all the federal features of the Constitution, using the word federal in the sense of linking together and uniting a number of co-equal political communities, under a common system of government. The Senate is not merely a branch of a bicameral Parliament; it is not merely a second chamber of revision and review representing the sober second thought of the nation, such as the House of Lords is supposed to be; it is that, but something more than that.

        In our view it is the basis of federation. We have been misrepresented in some cases. We say that it is not using the power to block supply that is important but having it.

         On the other hand, the reason why it is very important that we retain that power, even if we do not use it, is that it is that power which gives the two chambers their equality. They are like two poles of a ladder, and democracy needs both of them. If we lose one of them, which we would if we lost the power to block supply, which is the equivalent of the Prime Minister's power to dissolve both houses of parliament and call a double dissolution election, we would become a pole rather than a ladder and we would have all the associated discomfort of a pole.

I do believe there is an agenda to abolish the Senate, and I think we should be very aware of that. We should be very aware of that when any referendum to remove the power to block supply is mooted.

         It has been quite wrong to think of the House of Representatives in some way as having greater legitimacy or greater representativeness than the Senate. In fact, it is quite a myth to call the House of Representatives the `people's house'. Because government is formed by majority support in the House of Representatives and preferential voting means that it is nearly impossible to elect any members to that House who are not members of either the ALP or the coalition, party bloc voting means that members of the House invariably support cabinet and any bill put up will pass unless party members cross the floor. So the House of Representatives becomes a rubber stamp for cabinet. That is the reality.

         The Senate, with proportional representation, has the power to review cabinet outcomes and is often the only point of review.

In fact, what we have is the House of Representatives as the house of majority and the Senate chamber as the house of democracy. To support that I would like to again read from some favourite quotes of mine. One is in Odgers, and there are two others that are quite delightful.

         The importance of the link to the separation of powers is that if the House of Representatives consists of a three-yearly elected dictatorship of the executive, it is at liberty to do what it has gained support in this chamber to do because of the two major parties voting together. That is to overrule and pre-empt decisions of the High Court by bringing in legislation that severely crosses the separation of powers. I now quote Andrew Inglis Clark at the beginning of Odgers:

         I conclude with some notes on what we aspire to. The government has always sought to represent Australia as a pure Westminster system of democracy. That has never been true. We are a hybrid, which our founding fathers established by drawing from both the Westminster and American systems. Our system of government, as with the vast majority of real democracies in the world, can be more appropriately described as a consensus model of democracy rather than the majority Westminster model. The consensus model is characterised by the sharing of executive power, separation of executive and legislative power, balanced bicameralism and minority representationâ€”that is, a multi-party system.

         But let me remind the Senate what brought all this on: the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence, struggling in the polls, staring defeat in the face, was given an opportunity with the Easton petition to play some very dirty politics. There is no doubt, given all the evidence and the findings of Mr Marks QC, that Dr Lawrence was in the thick of things. So often `smart' `clever' political ploys come back to haunt those who perpetrate them. That is what happened in Dr Lawrence's case; that scenario has visited itself upon her.

         While I am on this matter, I want to state publicly that I am horrified at the way the Australian Labor Party vilify and belittle decent, honest Australians who go about their work the best way they know how. When Sir John Kerr sacked the Whitlam government, the Labor Party waged a campaign of vilification against himâ€”against a man who, undoubtedly, made a gut-wrenching decision, given his former Labor Party candidature and connections. Rightly or wrongly, he acted in what he thought were the best interests of the nation he was serving. The fact that the Labor Party were absolutely routed at the next election and again in 1977 is completely dismissed from their minds. Indeed, if there were any legitimacy to Sir John Kerr's actions, it was given by the people of Australia through their votes in 1975 and 1977.

         Exactly the same sort of attack of vilification has now been brought to bear on Mr Marks QC who, in his retirement, made himself available to serve the nation by engaging in and conducting certain inquiries. Indeed, one of this government's own instrumentalities, Telstra, engaged Mr Marks because it was convinced that Mr Marks could go about his duties in an honourable, objective way. Of course, Mr Marks provided a report; the findings were accepted and implemented. But as soon as Mr Marks had made a finding which was not within the political agenda of the Australian Labor Party, they turned on him and attacked him with a viciousness which I think is to be deplored.

         Of course, the delay in the payment of such a large sum to the legal firm that was employed must surely be accruing interest. One wonders what will happen with the accrual of interest. Perhaps this legal firm has done a deal and said, `Look, we won't bother charging for this,' on the promise that they will undoubtedly get other jobs from this Labor government. Let us not forget what legal firm we are talking about: it is the one that Stephen Loosley, a former senator of this place, went to. That one job he got involving Carmen Lawrence has given that legal firm, in rough terms, about $853,000 in costs. It is not a bad little earner, is it.

         â€”I rise to take part in this debate on Appropriation bills Nos 2, 3 and 4 much earlier than I or my colleagues had expected, for reasons that we have already debated this afternoon. These additional Appropriation bills provide for additional estimates for 1995-96 of a total of $1.4 billion. Of course some of that $1.4 billion will be offset by some savings. There is that $1.4 billion of extra spending which is ever rising spending by this government. The offset is a saving of some $944 million, leaving a new net spending of $433 million for 1995-96, and of course we are not even halfway through 1995-96.

Even if those fiascos had not occurred, if that supposed $750 million surplus had not been wiped out then, it would have been wiped out by these additional estimates in no time at all. So this government has never been able to manage a budget. It cannot manage the simple running of the Senate from day to day so how can you rely on it to run a budget?

Most of those who were retrenched or took the package are back on the second register. The situation is the same old situation that it was before.

So between those two ministers it adds up to nearly $1 million in legal fees for ministers who either could not run a sandwich shop or seemed to have a great lack of memory, which is a disaster. Even though this minister in the other house who was a former Premier of WA has been found by a royal commission to have not acted correctly, Mr Keating refuses to tell her to go, whereas he should have long before now and cut the bills and cut the costs where they are at this stage and not have to worry about it any more in the future.

They were gone. No excuses. Bang, they were gone. I think there might have been another one as well somewhere along the line.

         â€”Tonight I wish to address the two items in these appropriation bills which deal with the funding for the legal fees for Mr Alan Griffiths MP and the legal fees for Dr Carmen Lawrence. The total amount that I have here for Mr Alan Griffiths MP comes to $468,945. With the amendment brought by the coalition in the other place, I understand the total figure appropriated for Dr Lawrence's fees will be $556,463. So, in total, we have a figure in excess of $1 million worth of legal fees for two people.

         It is interesting to note that at the outset one sees that, in Dr Lawrence's case, fees were paid at the hourly rate of $500 for a Queen's Counsel; $250 for counsel assisting; and a range from $125 to $330 for instructing solicitor. That is per hour, of course. In relation to Mr Griffiths's fees, they were set at the hourly rate of $350 for a principal; $200 for a solicitor; and $100 for a clerk. Although Mr Griffiths's fees related to a period which ran from January 1994, I think, through to February 1995 and Dr Lawrence's fees related to some months earlier this year, I cannot see that the disparity in time could equal the disparity in the hourly rate.

         So the first issue I would raise is: why can't the Commonwealth settle a set rate by which it will provide assistance to people? It does it with legal aid in the community. That is a set rate. There is no question about that, but it seems that what we have here is that the rate is set on an ad hoc basis. This is entirely unsatisfactory when you are looking at in excess of $1 million worth of legal fees.

In that report which looked at this decision, the committee recommended by a majority that, if the government wished to proceed with the payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs, it should do so by introducing a single-line appropriation into the parliament in order to allow the matter to be decided upon directly by the parliament.

In fact, there was mention of payment being made under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, supported by the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, and also by way of an appropriation bill. The evidence that was put to the Senate was scant indeed as to how cabinet intended to go about this.

         That is relevant to the point I am making, which is that this decision was made on the run. It was made with bits and pieces of legal advice, to use Senator Gareth Evans's phrase, and it was done entirely in an ad hoc fashion. When you are dealing with this sort of amount of money, I think you really are letting down the taxpayers of Australia when you make these decisions on the run. What has happened, of course, is that through not thinking this through, the government initially set aside $800,000 but has now left Dr Lawrence in the lurch because only $556,000 has been approved. There was not any clarity of how this money was to be spent and whether it was to be spent challenging the royal commission in question.

         There is another aspect which I am still waiting for an answer on. I asked Senator Ray last week whether the Attorney-General's Department had contemplated who would pay for the costs awarded against Dr Lawrence in the Supreme Court and the High Court. No answer has yet been forthcoming, although Senator Ray undertook to take that up with the Attorney-General's Department. It would seem that those amounts of costs awarded against Dr Lawrence would be substantial, because her figure for challenging the royal commission was in the sum of $247,000. Of course, if the other party's fees are the same, she could well be facing a bill in that amount in addition to the amount that it has cost her to challenge the royal commission.

         So, because of the government's lack of attention to detail and because of its shoddiness in the way it has approached this matter, I believe it has left Dr Lawrence in the lurch; it has left Dr Lawrence's solicitors in the lurch. But, above all, I think it has treated the whole process with contempt. The executive in this case has behaved in an arrogant fashion and with total disregard to the taxpayers of Australia.

         The decision by the coalition was made on balance, as Senator Abetz said, in relation to the payment of these fees. Certainly, if there is a royal commission and someone is involved in the royal commission by way of their official duty in the past, then the government that is calling that royal commission normally pays fees for that person. There is precedent for that. The Western Australian government agreed to pay Dr Lawrence's fees for her appearances before the royal commission.

         But quite rightly the Western Australian government refused to meet her costs to challenge the validity of the royal commission.

When you look at those decisions, you can see the lack of merit in her applications in that regard.

         The situation is that the government has seen fit to put the Senate in a spot whereby we are faced with a situation which is a fait accompliâ€”money has been expended over and above the Western Australian allocation for Dr Lawrence's representation. I would say Dr Lawrence has been looked after in a most generous way. Certainly I think the provision of two counsel with an instructing solicitor is as generous as it can get, especially when you consider the disbursements in relation to accommodating those counsel who had to travel from the eastern states. I look at one aspect which was $18,000 alone for photocopying. I think accommodation was in excess of $40,000 and travelling was in excess of $40,000. Nonetheless the coalition has decided that it will not be churlish and it will, on balance, support the payment of those fees which relate to the representation of Dr Lawrence before the royal commission.

         With respect to the challenge that was mounted against the royal commission, I would submit there was lack of merit and certainly that went above and beyond any possible call that a minister could make on a government. I believe the problem we have here is that there are not sufficient guidelines in relation to how a minister's costs are met in these particular instances. I might add that the guidelines that the Commonwealth does have in place did not accommodate Dr Lawrence's situation. The guidelines that are in place do not provide for an action to be commenced by the person concerned, as was done by Dr Lawrence in relation to the challenge against the royal commission, but relate to the defending of actions brought against the person involved.

         I want to point out one thing. Early on in the piece, Mr Brendan Behanâ€”he was not a playwright, unfortunately; he was one of the ASC investigatorsâ€”claimed in court documents that he had conducted an interim investigation into 50 named respondents and companies pursuant to provisions of section 13 of the ASC law. That material is contained in an affidavit that was sworn by Mr Behan and filed with the court on 16 March 1992. It is interesting that Mr Behan claims to have been investigating these companies for three months, the point at which he filed the affidavit. So sloppy was the investigatory work undertaken by Mr Behan that he was not even aware of the relationship between some of the respondent  companies and some of the respondent investors and the fraudulent company, Aust-Home Investments Pty Ltd.

         That in itself is fairly disturbing, but what is very disturbing was that it appears that the interim report was not filed until some time after the affidavit was sworn. It was not until the following year after the affidavit was filed that the interim report was prepared. The interim report, under section 16 of the ASC law, was prepared and dated 23 January 1993, not March 1992. In fact, the extracts of the minutes of meeting 246 of the Australian Securities Commission, prepared and dated 1 February 1993, state:

        That in itself gives lie to the claim by Mr Behan that he prepared an interim report in 1992. It was not even considered by the ASC until 1993, by which time the ASC, in its oppressive court actions against the innocent investors, had already ensured the consent of Mr and Mrs Bunt and other innocent investors to having their assets frozen, in part because Mr Behan asserted that he had conducted an interim report when he quite obviously had not.

We now have a situation where it appears that officers of the Australian Securities Commission have wilfully misled the Attorney-General and the Supreme Court of Queensland. That is just thoroughly unacceptable. In fact, the various justices who have heard the applications related to this matter have expressed concern at the accuracy of some of the material that was presented to them. They have expressed concern that the Australian Securities Commission proceeded in the way in which it did. Page 18 of a judgment handed down by Mr Justice Hill on 23 August 1993 states:

        Next, it is not insignificant that the initial appointment of a receiver was continued by consent. This does not mean, as was submitted by counsel for the Commission, that Mr and Mrs Bunt accepted the strength of the Commission's case. There are many reasons why parties consent to interlocutory orders being continued, not the least of which is the potential difficulty of raising finance to meet the costs of a court case . . . No doubt it suited the Commission not to continue the litigation to final hearing as it was pursuing its investigations in the Aust-Home Group. It must, I think, be said that the Commission appears not to have understood the underlying nature of the appointment of a receiver under s.1323(3). In particular it is clear, as is emphasised by Cooper J in His Honour's judgment of 19 March 1993, that the interim appointment of a receiver should only remain in force for a limited period. In fact, for whatever reason, the orders remained in force for in excess of 12 months.

Of course, there is a provision in the legislation which says that the ASC cannot be sued, nor can its officers be sued when they act in good faith. I believe that what I have outlined to the Senate shows that certain officers of the ASC have failed in that solemn duty to act in good faith. They have failed in that solemn duty because they have misled the Attorney-General. No wonder the Attorney-General had so much difficulty dealing with the correspondence from Mrs Bunt because he was believing that what he was told by the Australian Securities Commission was correct.

They did not provide information to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is also clear. They have misled the minister. It is thoroughly unacceptable for the Australian people to be told to put their faith in the ASC because it will be their watchdog when, in fact, the ASC has failed to protect the rights and interests of the innocent.

The provisions of the legislation say that if that has happened in good faith, the innocent cannot receive damages from the ASC. I can see good policy reasons for saying that. But when excessive pursuit of an ASC cause leads to a trampling of the rights of the innocent, the ASC then misleads the court and misleads the Attorney-General about the investigations which they have conducted, fails to provide material to the Attorney-General and fails to provide material to the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is difficult to have confidence that the ASC will take care of the interests of innocent investors.

        The report on the Australian delegation to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty conference tabled before the Senate reveals an interesting expose of Australia's position on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the NPT. Paragraph 28 on page 12 of the report states:

         By taking this line, the government is perpetuating the false bargain that is the underlying premise of the NPT. The heart of the false premise is the bargain between the non-nuclear weapon states and the nuclear weapon states. The non-nuclear weapon states have agreed not to develop nuclear weapons, in return for which the nuclear weapon states have agreed to disarm. Unfortunately, the nuclear weapon states have patently failed to hold up their end of the bargain.

         Since 1970, when the NPT came into force, more than 75,000 new nuclear weapons have been deployed by the nuclear weapon states. In fact, of all the nuclear weapons currently in the superpowers' arsenals, the vast majority were deployed after the NPT was signed. Even now, with the end of the Cold War, the nuclear weapon states continue to maintain their arsenals and pour millions of dollars into weapons development.

         Some enlightened non-nuclear weapon states, which Senator Gareth Evans referred to in the Senate as twilight zone countries, argued that the NPT could have been extended for fixed periods linked to disarmament goals. But while these so-called twilight zone countries were looking for a meaningful solution to nuclear proliferation, the Australian government was locked in the palaeolithic era still believing that `might' is right.

         Paragraph 29 of this report provides an interesting insight into Australia's position. It reveals that Australia's position on the NPT is related to its participation in nuclear trade; that is, the NPT is supposed to give an assurance that the sale of our uranium will not be used in nuclear weapons. Only last week was this premise shown to be blatantly false. The Australian Safeguards Office in its submission to the Senate inquiry into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty could not give an assurance that Australian uranium sold to France was not being used in their nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific.

        The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council is a statutory consultative body established to contribute a national perspective on the operation of the rural adjustment schemes as administered by the states. The schemes objectives are, among other things: to achieve the promotion of better financial, technical and management performance by the Australian farm sector; to provide support to farmers who have prospects of sustainable long-term profitability with a view to improving the productivity of their farm units; to provide support in a way that ensures that farmers become financially independent of support within a reasonable period; and to provide support for farmers during periods of adverse and exceptional economic circumstances for which they could not be expected to have planned.

         It is on the exceptional circumstances that I would like to make a few comments tonight. I am not game to say that the drought has broken, but it has certainly eased in the last few months. The drought we faced in New South Wales and Queensland was certainly exceptional. It drove efficient producers to the brink and, in many instances, beyond the point of no return.

         I applaud the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council for the work that it has done in assisting farm families during the past 12 months. However, that support is not completely unqualified. I believe there are many deficiencies in the way that the eligibility for assistance has been based not necessarily on need but on where a farmer lives.

         There is no escaping the fact that the federal government response has been miserly in terms of the historical commitment that the coalition made when it was in government in 1983. There is no getting away from those figures.

         The Prime Minister also said drought is a natural occurrence. He is probably right but, under 12 years of Labor, the ability of farmers to prepare for drought has been virtually destroyed. Farmers were not in a position to meet the problems of the last four years of drought. The reasons for that are obvious: the government has run a high interest economy, a high inflation economy and a high indirect tax economy and has taken away what was the prudent farmer's friendâ€”the ability to plan for drought by the use of income equalisation deposits. Much of the anguish caused by the government's hotchpotch response to drought could have been avoided if it had not gutted the sector so, and had had a decent national drought policy.

One is this: in terms of a group of people who would like to see themselves as the next government, if Senator Sandy Macdonald thinks that providing drought assistance to farmers at the rate of $2 million per week, which is what we are doing right now, as I speak, and have been for some time and will continue to do for a full six months guaranteed by statute after the drought declarations have been revoked, is miserly, it is an interesting little glimpse at what kind of fiscal management will be run by the coalition.

As late as last night I got a phone call in my officeâ€”because I was the only person there at the time, I took the callâ€”from a person ringing to say `thanks', which I appreciated, to be honest, because you do not get too much of that in this business. What the government has provided has been significant assistance.

         The National Farmers Federation certainly had. We only have to look at the written submissions they made to the government to see how much of that was reflected in the document that was finally produced.

         But, as I have said before, the people who particularly contributed to it were primary producers, in particularâ€”I have also said this beforeâ€”rural women. That is why we provided cash instead of fodder subsidies. Even though Senator Macdonald might disagree with a great many things that I say, and I am sure he does, I think he would accept my statement that I did seriously consider all of the options that were available. I rejected fodder subsidies for a number of reasons, one of which is that they do not do a damn thing for people who do not get their income from stock.

         But, apart from that, what I was told by rural woman after rural woman when I visited the bush was that the most desperate assistance they needed was not subsidies for something that they had to actually pay money out on in the first instance but cash. I can tell the Senate that I received those representations in that first drought trip I made to Queensland in the most, I have to say, desperate circumstances, in which farm families had not had a positive incomeâ€”that is, money of their ownâ€”through no fault of their own, for something like four years. You have to experience it before you can appreciate the utter soul-destroying impact that simply not having an income has on normally independent people.

         The 1994 annual report levelled many damning criticisms in relation to access and equity performance. Most of these criticisms emanated from the community and were directed particularly at service delivery departments. The criticisms were levelled primarily at, as I say, government agencies, including particular departments involved in service delivery. This year's report, the 1995 report, which we are now considering, asserts that these criticisms have been addressed by various government programs. There are statements as to what has been done to address the previous year's criticisms, but scant quantitative evidence is provided on the effectiveness of any of these initiatives.

         The silence on this matter is only to be expected because, when you look at it, the performance so far as the Public Service is concerned is appalling. As a recent ACTU study found, there has been an actual fall in the number of NESB personnel in no less than 28 government departments and agencies. The ACTU study also found that less than two per cent of all officers in the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service are overseas born NESB Australians. Worse: only nine per cent of new appointments to the Australian Public Service were from a non-English speaking background and NESB people were more likely to be made redundant in the restructuring of federal departments. So that is quite an appalling indictment of the government's real approach to access and equity.

         reported recently that some 30 per cent of the 200 richest Australians were born overseas. NESB Australians are over-represented amongst owners and operators of small business and the children of migrants are achieving better results in higher education than children of Australian born parents. It is remarkable and unfortunate that the Office of Multicultural Affairs has found this glaring inconsistency between the public and private sector performance of such little importance that it did not warrant any significant analysis.

        This is an intriguing report, if a short one. The Corporations and Securities Panel is made up of some of the top business and legal brains in Australia, it costs $135,867 a year to run and in the latest year not one reference was made to this body. This body is there to help the Australian Securities Commission, particularly in areas of significant matters. Its purpose, according to the Hon. Michael Lavarch, the Attorney-General, is to set some of the ethical and business standards for the Australian business community.

       <para first-indent="16">

         One would presumably wonder, as one looks at the pages of court actions involving some entrepreneurs, whether in fact there was not some significant need for this organisation to be very active indeed; but it depends on references from the Australian Securities Commission, and the commission has made none. In fact, since this panel was created in 1991 there has been only one reference to it. In order to give the panel something to do, the Securities Commissioner has determined that the panel should conduct a hypothetical case study to give the ASC and itself experience in handling these procedures.

         It seems to me extraordinary that such a wealth of talent should be obliged to spend its time on a hypothetical when there is clearly so much that a panel of this substance should be doing. Let me read from the report just to demonstrate that I am not making any of this up. Under the heading `The work of the panel in 1994-95', it says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Panel received no referrals from the ASC in 1994-95.

        Then it went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The work of the Panel is primarily determined by the complexity and number of matters referred to it by the ASC. There is a small amount of informational and policy development work required but this is minor compared to that required by even a single application.
       </para>
       <para>
        It then went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Chairman of the ASC, Mr Alan Cameron . . . said that he considers that its experience in its single referral to dateâ€”

        since its creation in 1991â€”

       <para font-size="-=2">
        has been an important development and learning process for all concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The president of the panel is an outstanding businessman; he is Mr John Pascoe, the Chief Executive Officer of George Weston Foods Ltd, a former director of Qantas and a trustee of the Sydney Opera House Trust. You would think that a panel led by him would be given plenty of work. He has said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that he is looking forward to the Panel developing its role and taking a robust and positive attitude to its work.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is the newly appointed chairman. I hope he does not get as frustrated as previous chairmen were. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the Panel is keen to ensure that its mode of operation is not perceived as having an adversarial and quasi-legal manner but an informal, practical manner with Panel members acting as persons with business and market expertise rather than as inquisitors or judges.
       </para>
       <para>
        All I can hope is that Mr Pascoe and his team in fact get something to do; otherwise I wonder why on earth $135,867 a year is being directed to this venture. I will not go through the list of the top quality people who are there; the Senate will be able to read it for itself. It seems to me that if you are going to have a panel like this, for heaven's sake use it. Looking at the area of business activity, one would have thought that the ASC would have needed as much assistance as it could get in this area.

        These quality of service reports are very useful little documents, and this one put out by Austel states:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the things that were apparent was that a significant decline in performance was evident in operator assisted domestic call connections. In various areas it outlined some problems. For example, it states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A decline in performance regarding unanswered calls was also evident, with a six percentage point increase to 15% in the June 1995 quarter compared to 9% in the preceding quarter.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is in relation to calls left unanswered altogether, as I understand it; not just ones that were not answered within 10 seconds or something. I understand the June quarter result was that 73 per cent of calls were answered within 10 seconds, representing a 14 per cent decline compared to the March 1995 quarter result of 87 per cent. This fact that 15 per cent of operator assisted national calls are not being answered at all strikes me as pretty poor service.

         To a certain extent, there is a crisis in sculpture. I am informed that the English erected 37 sculptures of prominent citizens in Sydney up to the time of federation. Since then, the Australian government has erected only twoâ€”one depicting Lloyd Rees and the other, Henry Lawson. The Sydney sculpture map of 1975 listed 35 public sculptures in Sydney, and the city council map of 1990 listed 16. Although somebody might challenge those figures, they indicate a problem. I do not know whether that low level of sculpture reflects some Anglo-Celtic inertia about using sculpture to adorn and enhance our cities. I think Melbourne might be slightly ahead of Sydney. Nevertheless, there is a problem.

         Many Australians were born in or come from countries where sculpture was part of their lives. It is mixed with the culture, the myths and histories of those countries. It is part of the education, part of the folklore of those countries. It seems that, as a reflection of the population, there is a need for us to look at this situation. If we are to achieve a truly multi-cultural society, we must correct this dearth of emphasis on sculpture. With our Anglo tradition, we need to overcome a sculpture deficit.

         Another parameter is the link between sculpture and architecture, which is another way of making sure that we enhance the quality of our buildings and the environment in which our city buildings are erected.

         I would like to refer to my experience of the very successful seminars in Gosford where we arranged for the provision of a block of Gosford sandstone, which has a particularly good quality for sculpture. At various times we had Asian, Japanese, East and West Europeans and Papua New Guinean sculptors. They all created their own traditions from that block of sandstone, leaving a lasting monument. I have a vivid recollection of two men, both over 70, from the Sepik district of Papua New Guinea. They had only ever worked in wood, yet they left their sculptures in that sandstone.

         All those sculptors lived together for six to eight weeks while they completed their works. I went to their camps and found that, although they did not have a common language, they were able to work together. The symbolism of that is a reminder of what I am talking about: the need to make sure that our society reflects all the different cultures represented by our people at the moment. Those sculptors have left their mark in those areas. Their gift is their creativity. I know that Lawrence Beck has done all of it on the smell of an oil rag.

         But it is more than that. For example, Lawrence Beck has suggested to me that we could have a competition by way of international symposia. People could come from all parts of the world to work on a sporting sculpture theme. With the turn of the century coming up, we should also be celebrating our cultural history. Our Aboriginal sculptors could make a contribution to the longer history of Australia.

         All those things are possible, not only in time for the Olympics and the turn of the century, but there is also an argument for having yearly competitions. Imagine an international symposium with all the people involved converting their blocks of stone into sculpture along a driveway. Their works could be judged by experts or by ordinary people to find the most popular contributions.

         However, people will argue; there will be controversy. There is controversy at the moment over two pieces of sculpture in the Sydney area. One in the North Sydney area is a sculpture resembling a phallus, which is causing no end of discussion; and the other in another part of Sydney is a sculpture of a prostitute, which also is causing a lot of discussion.

         But I think that is the very point of art; it is to make people consider their city. In my own case, I served an apprenticeship as an etcher using paintbrush and acids in the photo engraving trade. I subsequently became a union organiser where my duties brought me into daily contact with a range of artists and skilled tradesmen in the graphic arts area. I will always remember an artist saying to me that it is important to look at the world through an artist's eyesâ€”to see the light, the colour and the form of objects.'

         In those controversial things I have referred to, the point is that you have to have controversy. People do not always see what the artist has attempted to achieve. But we are all enriched if democratic discussion of artistic matters becomes part of our everyday life. It is then that everybody has the opportunity of having a say but, more particularly, we are developing Australia and the concept of what Australia is. Any form of art, particularly sculpture, has the ability to enhance our tradition, our culture and our folklore.

         For those reasons, I would hope that attention is given to this issueâ€”and this is not an election issue, I should point outâ€”and that sculpture be given a little more help and far more consideration than it has had previously from the Australia Council, the Visual Arts Board and other people. I hope that this plea might be something that people finally will pick up. I think the concepts I have mentioned are things that could be considered.

        The Information Privacy Principles in this proposal reflect both international and Australian privacy reforms. The basis for the principles are the Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988. Other concepts are drawn from the European Union's Directive on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and On The Free Movement of Such Data, the OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand), the `Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information' (issued by the Canadian Standards Association), and The Australian Privacy Charter.

         â€”Privacy is an increasingly important international issue. Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights specifically requires that individuals must not be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. The European Union direction on privacy requires member states to enact privacy principles. The OECD has issued a detailed set of guidelines on the protection of transborder flows of personal information.

         Closer to home, only two years ago, New Zealand extended its privacy protection rules to both public and private sectors with the passage of its Privacy Act 1993. More recently, APEC's Seoul declaration adopted in May last year has, as one of its 10 core principles, the obligation to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights, privacy and data security.

         Australia does not have full privacy protection. It does, of course, have the Privacy Act 1988, and amendments have extended the act's coverage to tax file numbers and credit providers. However, its basic coverageâ€”apart from those amendmentsâ€”is only over federal government agencies. The private sector is beyond our act's reach. The public has no legislative remedy for things like data matching by private corporations, the development and abuse of mailing lists, the use of some smart cards, or intrusive telemarketing.

         Australians are concerned. Recent polls commissioned by the Privacy Commissioner show that almost three-quarters of the Australian public see privacy as an important social issue. Eighty per cent of those polled not only believe that the government should legislate to protect privacy but also believe that the protection should cover both public and private sectors.

         There have been many calls to expand Australia's privacy protection. The Australian Privacy Charter Council, chaired by Mr Justice Michael Kirby, adopted a Privacy Charter of basic privacy principles outlining the privacy protection that Australians should expect. The government's own broadband services expert group said that, as we move towards the world of an information superhighway, we should have better privacy protection with rules which cover both the public and the private sectors.

         Papers developed for the government's National Information Services Council made a very strong point that `the new information and communication services will lead to the much more active collection and interchange of personal information'. This strong recommendation is for comprehensive privacy laws which extend the operation of the current Privacy Act to meet the challenges of the new information age. The latest annual report of the Privacy Commissioner, which was just tabled a few moments ago in this place, repeats the growing calls for comprehensive national privacy legislation.

         As yet, there has been no response from either the government or the opposition to strengthen what is an inadequate level of privacy protection for Australians. The Australian Democrats strongly believe that the current level of privacy protection is simply not good enough for the Australian public as we move into the information age. Australians have a right to expect there to be controls on all information collected about them. They have a right to expect that the personal information they provide to governments and private enterprises will only be used for reasons clearly stated at the time. Also, they have a right to expect that rules about privacy protection will be monitored and enforced.

         Our proposals to amend the Privacy Act 1988 will be the basis for the Privacy Amendment Bill 1996, which the Democrats will table in the next session of parliament. One of the first major changes we are proposing is the extension of privacy protection rules to the private sector. Information privacy principles will apply not only to federal government departments and agencies but also to individuals, corporations and associations in the private sector. The proposals also, however, allow industries to develop their own codes of practice which, when approved and issued by the Privacy Commissioner, can replace the act's information privacy principles. Because the codes will be disallowable instruments, all codes will come under parliamentary scrutiny.

         The other major change that we propose is that there be two additional privacy principles. The first concerns the development and implementation of systems and practices for the collection or retention of information which threaten the individual's privacy. This principle will cover practices such as data matching or the development of other information gathering practices. If the Privacy Commissioner finds that there has been a breach of this principle, he or she can make a special report to the minister or the parliament. The other new principle provides protection against development of unique identifiersâ€”or the Australia Card, by any other name.

         â€”Tonight I arise to continue the third of a series of speeches to place on the public record the government's failure to deliver jobs to the long-term unemployed. The Employment, Education and Training References Committee inquiry into long-term unemployment has relied on witnesses from all over Australia. The evidence of those witnesses adds up to an indictment of the so-called Working Nation program. The clear message is that the Keating labour market intervention programs are not working; they are not delivering outcomes to the unemployed.

         So far I have used evidence from the long-term unemployment report to set out real people's impressions of Working Nation. The consumer's view of this product is less than flattering. Last night I spoke about the voice of despair, the stark landscape for the long-term unemployed for 1995, and the failure of Working Nation in general. Tonight I want to underline the shortcomings of the centrepiece of Working Nation: the case management system.

         The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system. It established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system.

         Under this system, the CES is required to send out two notices to people who are under case management. The first letter notifies the person that they have been registered in the case management system. However, the person may have to wait for months before they actually meet up with their case manager. Sometimes later they receive another notice where they are actually referred to a specific case manager. With this system, the government can immediately inflate the number of people in case management by totalling the number of letters initially sent outâ€”even though a large number of these people have never met a case managerâ€”with those who are actually consulting with case managers.

         One of the biggest constraints this system faces when people finally get to have a case manager is that there are more people in case management than there are adequate managers to handle them. The coalition has long been concerned that the number of clients per case manager is sometimes ridiculously high. There have been reported incidences of case managers servicing up to 200 clients each. Clients cannot expect an adequate level of attention or advice when they are competing with so many other people for their case manager's attention.

         The Senate inquiry into long-term unemployment heard repeatedly from witnesses that since the introduction of case management resources are inadequate. The perception was advanced that DEET has set case loads between 125 and 250 people per case manager. These figures were given several times in evidence to the inquiry. This is indicative of the confusion and lack of realism in setting up this case management system.

         This was highlighted in particular by the Auditor-General's Report No. 3 into CES case management, which revealed very serious weaknesses in the functioning of the CES. The report said this must be `very quickly' remedied `as they reduce its capacity to assist the long term unemployed'. It was evident from this report that many unemployed people have very tenuous links with their case managers and are not receiving effective service at all. The survey results were critical in their assessment of the CES case management system.

         It was found that 39 per cent did not recognise that they were supposed to have a return to work plan, and yet such a plan is supposed to be a key element of the case management system. Surely if this government is failing to get across information about a key element of the Working Nation program to a large proportion of participants, there is something drastically wrong with the operation of the scheme.

         The survey also found that 29 per cent of the clients had not been asked for feedback about the usefulness of elements of their return to work plan in finding employment. Also, only 57 per cent of clients in employment or study at the time of the survey indicated they did not receive post-placement support. This support is supposed to aid clients in their transition to employment or study.

         Given that people who are receiving case management are the long-term unemployed, this is a group that should receive at least 100 per cent support in transition. Coming back into the work force after a two-year or longer gap, possibly after retraining, would necessarily entail a large amount of readjustment for most people.

         One of the most damning findings in this report was a suggestion that, while most clients were satisfied with the length and type of contact, 30 per cent of the clients who had visited or personally contacted CES officers believed their contact was useful. Presumably, 70 per cent did not think it was useful. For such a large minority to be unhappy with the scheme indicates there are some serious problems with the CES case management system. This negative perception by clients raises questions about the skill level of some of the CES staff operating the program. A witness from our long-term unemployment inquiry said at page 96:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        Many mature age workers feel that this early intervention is essential. Mature age and being long-term unemployed are two great barriers we have found in the inquiry to re-entry into the work force. As one witness told the committee:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

         The Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, has the so-called private contract arm of case management also under scrutiny. It has operated now for a year under Joan Kirner's guiding hand. Evidence to the Senate committee suggests that ESRA is creaming off the cases that can be more easily managed to secure an early employment outcome. Our support does not run to endorsing these sorts of rorts or the shambles that I have described in this speech. Case management can be improved by a coalition government. The consumers in the system, the long-term unemployed of Australia, deserve better.

         Let us start by looking at the SDA's submission. This is a submission that I spoke to in the public hearings. I must say that after contributing to those hearings I was disappointed when, rather than actually receiving a copy of the report, I chased up a copy of it and I reviewed what I felt were fairly limited contents. The SDA made a fairly extensive submission to the inquiry and there are a few points from it to which I would like to refer.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In relation to its submissions on support for families, the SDA submitted that there should be reform of Australia's income, taxation, social welfare and community support systems so as to bring about a fully integrated and coherent social system that gives social justice to all Australian families.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In discussing this subject, I should also mention that the submission was presented nearly two years ago, so some things have changed in the time since. The SDA felt that the basis of such a system should involve, firstly, the recognition of the family as a basic fundamental social unit of society on which many people can agree; and, secondly, the creation of a national family policy which provides a comprehensive and integrated set of policies directed to the wellbeing of a family and its members.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The SDA said there is the need for the government to provide financial support for families by, firstly, increasing family payments to at least their 1976 real value and maintaining indexation of such payments; secondly, increasing what was at the time the spouse rebate, cashing it out and restructuring the taxation procedure so that taxation falls equally upon one income and dual income families; and, thirdly, the introduction and payment of the home makers allowance.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With respect to what was at the time the spouse rebate, the SDA said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The spouse rebate is worth $27 per week prior to any changes which occurred in the 1993-94 budget. Current dual income families receive the benefit of two tax free thresholds. An increase in the value of the spouse rebate to $40 per week would remove such a bias in the tax system towards two-income families.
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to the work done by full-time home makers, the SDA submitted:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is both socially and economically valuable. Apart from the care of persons young or old, home makers contribute in innumerable worthwhile activities which benefit the whole community. Because of accounting conventions the value of full-time home making does not enter calculation of GDP.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once again, this is two years ago. I continue:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Research by Dr Duncan Ironmonger of Melbourne University shows that the real value of this work would add 30 per cent to GDP if it had to be paid for. The SDA's view was that it was time the government recognised the value of home makers work with respect to three steps that should be introduced. To have the ABS calculate the value of domestic work, to recognise the value of such work in GDP calculations and to introduce the payment of a home makers allowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would ask: how do the report and its findings pertain to this submission and some of the other submissions? The SDA submission does not support income splitting, one of the major findings in the report. When I made my verbal submission I was asked, on the subject of income splitting, what the association's view would be. I raised the association's concerns with the regressive nature of income splitting. This, as with much of the content of the SDA's submission, was not summarised in the report; rather, only limited reference was made to comments on the role and value of the family which the SDA made in its submissionâ€”issues on which we can all agree.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The only other reference to the SDA submission is as a secondary source regarding Dr Ironmonger's research into the value of unpaid work. Given that the findings in the report highlighted that more work should be done on recognising the value of unpaid work, I was somewhat surprised that the inquiry did not go back to the original source of such data. The SDA got more attention paid to its views in an article on the Lyons Forum in the

         What does the report do? Rather than focusing on supporting and nurturing stable and secure families, in typical opposition style, it hurls blame and insult. It attacks individualism. It attacks what it terms political correctness. It attacks feminism. Ironically, the thread throughout the report is an ideology based on individual choice.

         â€”I will put it in context, as Senator Abetz requested. I will look at the macro-economic changes that the inquiry thinks are required. It refers to a tax system which recognises family commitments; for example, income splitting or family unit taxation. Secondly, it refers to tax rebates for necessary family expenditure such as child care and mortgages. This government introduced a child-care cash rebate. That is one area that has been acted upon. In relation to mortgages, it is interesting that the opposition feels that mortgages are a necessary family expenditure. What about all the families that do not have mortgages because they are in the rental market?

         The next recommendation was: a tightening of the social welfare system to remove disincentive to family life and a recognition of home makers' contributions to the family. Rather than tightening the social welfare system, this government has improved the social welfare system, to recognise home makers' contributions to the family.

         Another recommendation, which I have already mentioned, was the recognition of the economic value of unpaid work done in the home in the GDP figures. Let us look at what the government has done in that area. This government has made a clear commitment to include the value of unpaid work in the national accounts through the development of satellite accounts. Australia is one of only seven nations world wide to undertake a valuation of unpaid work. Further estimates will be produced following the 1997 time-use survey which the government put in place.

         The government recognises the valuable contribution of parents, mostly women, who choose to remain at home to undertake unpaid caring responsibilities. Spouses of low income workers at home caring for children can receive up to $136 per week under the new parenting allowance. The basic component of the parenting allowance, which was previously the home child care allowance, is available to all spouses at home, with children, and was introduced by this government and increased by this government.

         The Labor Party did that very effectively in the last election with their campaign against the GST. But, of course, when you analyse the figures, you find that the people of Australia are now paying $7,700 million in indirect taxes under the Keating government more than they would have under Hewson, without all the benefits that the Hewson policy would have provided to them. So I believe that the people of Australia are now a wake-up that a simple campaign of fear and loathing is not going to work again, because they got tricked once.

         I would have thought that people on the other side would have welcomed a social policy outlook that encouraged the Australian population to get the focus off the self-centred aspect and on to a more social awareness concept of society through the family. I would have thought Senator Jacinta Collins and the Labor Party would be the first ones to embrace that and say, `As part of our socialist objectives, we have never believed in the me-centred approach to life.' But here we are witnessing Senator Collins criticising the Lyons Forum because we are encouraging people to go away from the me-centred approach to social policy to a more family and society oriented approach to social policy. I do not resile from that. Our society has been too selfish in the past. I recommend the report.

         â€”I wish tonight to speak again on matters which I have certainly spoken on before in this chamber. I wish to do this because there are so many issues related to the whole issue of whistleblowers and the Senate inquiry that I was recently a part of. It was clear from the enormous number of submissions that the committee received from the outset of its inquiry that there are many people in Australia who believe that they are not being listened to. The Senate and its committees try to perform that role, but it is not always possible.

         As I said in a speech last night, the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases was unable to examine many of the submissions we received. I did read many of them and met with some people so that I could hear their cases in more detail. One of the first things that struck me when the first whistleblowing committee, the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, began its inquiryâ€”indeed, I found it quite astonishingâ€”was the extent and depth of animosity expressed towards the CJC by so many Queensland people who saw themselves as whistleblowers.

         The story which these people told had a common theme: strong disillusionment with the treatment that they had received from the CJC. This did not simply relate to the fact that the complaints they brought to the CJC about the actions of various government instrumentalities were not investigated or acted upon, or were not upheld. Their concerns were as much to do with the treatment they received from the CJCâ€”how they were made to feel as though they were the wrongdoers, or that their concerns were not worth proper examination, or that they were just crazy people who should do everyone a favour and disappear.

         This is the treatment which whistleblowers or aggrieved people usually get from the department they feel has wronged them; it should not be the treatment they receive from the body that is supposed to investigate complaints.

         One case which the unresolved whistleblower committee was not able to examine and which I will mention tonight is that of Mr James Egan, a dairy farmer from the Beaudesert area south of Brisbane. Mr Egan presented the CJC with evidence of serious misconduct in the dairy industry, stretching through the 1980s up until 1990. The allegations which Mr Egan raised were the same as those raised in this chamber some 10 years ago by former Labor senator John Black and in the lower house on a number of occasions around the same time by the member for Rankin, Mr Beddall, and the former member for Hinkler, Mr Courtice.

The allegations were also given widespread media coverage back in the 1980s. Indeed, I understand the well-known and widely respected journalist Paul Bongiorno won a Walkley award for his coverage of this scandal.

         The CJC's response when Mr Egan presented it with the allegations and supporting evidence was to inform him that the allegations related to things that happened too long ago and it would cost too much of its limited resources to investigate it, with little likelihood of any successful prosecution at the end of it. Dissatisfied with this, Mr Egan went to the Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee, the PCJC, which monitors the activities of the CJC.

         The PCJC informed the CJC that the allegations `are of a serious nature and deserve a full and proper investigation'.

         I agree with the subsequent recommendation of the PCJC, flowing from this case, that the relevant legislation in Queensland should be amended to enable the PCJC to direct the CJC to investigate a particular issue. Such a direction could be required to be a unanimous one to prevent partisan political inquiries occurring. The CJC argues that this would compromise its independence from parliament.

I see this as a suitable check to enable some sort of reciprocal accountability from the CJC. Whilst the CJC is crucial in ensuring state government bodies are accountable in Queensland, it also needs to be publicly accountable. The PCJC, or its equivalent, is the obvious body to perform this role.

         The Labor Party's ascension to power in Queensland in 1989 was predominantly achieved on a wave of public support for reform. The people of Queensland were sickened by the entrenched corruption which was partly exposed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. The voters turned to Labor with the hope that real changes would result that would transform the system that had become so discredited. I was one of a great many Queenslanders who believed that change was essential to ensure that real reform could be achieved.

It was seen as somewhere that people could turn toâ€”a place where their concerns would be given a fair hearing. However, for the CJC to be effective it must have the confidence and support of the vast majority of the public. The concern I have is that this support is now not as strong as it should be. The CJC must acknowledge this and look to itself for at least some of the reasons. It must not become a mirror image of the unresponsive, antagonistic and unaccountable bureaucracies which it is meant to police.

         â€”I rise to speak on the importance of Australia's traditional cultural heritage and its place on the international stage. In April and May this year, a company of 30 tribal dancers, songpersons, musicians and painters from the Northern Territory travelled to the United States for a three-week tour. Called Dancers of the Dreaming, they performed in California, Arizona and Texas, receiving rave reviews and a letter from Texas governor, George Bush, urging them to `come back soon'.

         So why is this group so well-known abroad and not at home? The blame rests squarely with the federal Labor government. Despite recognition and acclaim from the US to Europe, the company does not fit existing federal funding guidelines and therefore must rely on the generosity of its overseas sponsors. That is an embarrassing situation for all Australians.

         I will go into detail later on, but first I want to pay tribute to the organisersâ€”the Aboriginal Cultural Foundationâ€”who remained committed to the tour despite seemingly impossible odds. The Darwin-based Aboriginal Cultural Foundation was set up in the early 1970s to support Aboriginal cultures under the control of traditional owners and managers. Governed by an all tribal executive committee drawn from across northern Australia and the desert regions, the foundation has strong support at the grassroots level.

         Its aims include promoting and protecting the rights of Aboriginal groups and clans to control their own ceremonies, to help provide instruction, and to organise presentations to the wider community. In fact, the foundation started planning the Dancers of the Dreaming tour five years ago in collaboration with universities in California, Arizona and Texas and the San Antonio Festival. Eight United States representatives flew to Darwin to meet with the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation in 1990. They then travelled to the Tanami Desert and to north-east Arnhem Land to see dancing and singing in a ceremonial context and to discuss the possibility of a tour.

         Finally, in 1995, the foundation assembled three distinct cultural groups for the tour which, together, would convey the richness and scope of indigenous heritage in northern Australia. The 1995 Dancers of Dreaming tour included people from communities along the east coast of Arnhem Land, from Gapuwiyak, also known as Lake Evella, in the north to Ngukurr, also known as the Roper River, in the south; the interior of the territory, through the Warlpiri people from Lajamanu, also known as Hooker Creek, in the Tanami Desert; and Tiwi dancers and singers from Bathurst Island.

        To provide that experience was the aim of the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation, and the clan leaders were very sympathetic to this goal.

The membership of the dance company, and the broad parameters of the program content, were decided out there in the field.

         For example, the Tiwi Islands contingent from the North West Northern Territory presents "The Bombing of Darwin, 1942," recalling their role in warning against a Japanese attack plus helping in defense and rescue efforts. Typically, they compress and distil the subject in key sounds and images, combining what we might call a child-like purity of concept with a powerful, adult physicality. This is dance deeply rooted in history and in the landscape, dance central to a society's sense of itself.

         When the dancers of Eastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, bound forward to the edge of the sand-covered stage, their stamping feet dig deep, and, in one sequence of restless twisting, crouching, clawing motions from "The Garnbulabula Spirit Beings," they confront the audience with images of violent death and a sky soaked in bloodâ€”not exactly affirming our sentimental notions of indigenous cultures' "oneness with nature."

Take this latest tour, for example. The foundation had to struggle for five years to come up with a paltry $7,000 from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council. ATSIC provided nothing. Eventually the cultural counsellor at the Australian embassy in Washington contributed $10,000. I am sorry to say that that was the extent of the Australian contribution.

The tragedy is that no-one in the federal government or, for that matter, ATSIC, gives priority to our traditional cultural heritage. Australia is allowing a cultural resource to slip into obscurity. Well may Texas governor George Bush write to the Dancers of the Dreaming wishing them `continued success in the future and come back soon'.

In 1990, for example, when logging was at its peak, some 494,700 hectares of forest were logged out. In many cases, the indigenous people only found out that their lands had been licensed to a timber company when the bulldozers arrived to put in a logging road.

         There is special mention in the report of the use of transfer pricing in the logging industry of Papua New Guinea. Here, the logging companies operate a cooperative arrangement with their overseas buyers. The logging companies officially `sell' the logs for a price which is below market value to an intermediary, who then sells the log on to a final customer at the true price. The difference between the two prices is held in trust in a tax havenâ€”usually Hong Kongâ€”and divided between the logging company and its company and its customer. Transfer pricing allows companies to declare a loss in Papua New Guinea yet make massive profits offshore. The report suggests that Rimbanan Hijau is heavily implicated in this type of practice in Papua New Guinea.

The list goes on. The report also cites a number of legal misdemeanours, including falsifying legal documents, bribing shareholders and breaking a court injunction, to name but a few.

I hope that it will be possible for me to put the report on the public record so that it can become a catalyst for a closer scrutiny of the operations that these companies partake in.

One thousand people are killed or maimed every month by landmines. It is a human rights issue. People are also concerned at the example that landmines have become of a trend in conventional warfare to target civilians instead of the military. The rules of war have changed and so have the players. Maimed people are seen as a strategy to burden a country with bigger compensation and health payments and a reduced economic output.

          Landmines damage the environment and create a staggering refugee problem for people who cannot retain their self-sufficient agrarian lifestyles. The amount of arable land abandoned due to the destruction imposed by landmines is enormous. In Angola, eight to nine million people cannot be repatriated on their lost agricultural land and many people have starved. In Afghanistan, for example, where 350,000 people have died from landmine blasts, this has created 3.5 million Afghan refugees. At the present rate of clearing, it is estimated it will take a further 4,300 years to clear the remaining mines so that people can resume normal lives. The situation creates a refugee problem that many other countries have to deal with. However, in many cases, they are an active part of the source of the problem in the first place by producing, selling and using landmines.

          There is no doubting how cruel and indiscriminate landmines are. Many of them cost between $US1 and $US3 to make. Mines may be cheap and nasty to manufacture but each mine costs about $1,000 to remove in a dangerous and painstaking process. Many are non-detectable because they are made solely of plastic and disguise themselves as a child's toys, as balls, plates, apples and saucepans. There is no recording or marking of mines and they are scattered widely and indiscriminately. They are also not self-neutralising and may last decades after a war is over.

          So how should the government best respond to community concern to achieve a total ban on landmines at home and abroad? The government's current strategy has failed. They have taken a compromise position in pushing for a partial ban that is expensive, a technological fix, unworkable for developing countries and more difficult to implement than a total ban would be. At the last meeting of the Vienna Review Conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention, countries could not agree by consensus on such an approach.

         As it turns out, in this case there may be very significant questions pertaining to privilege. It might be something we need to seek a ruling about in terms of the privilege of that document, particularly for documents that may be wanted for debate well outside this place. I would like to put that on the record, not that I expect leave not to be given in perpetuity. Indeed, leave may well be granted after there has been time to consider Senator Chamarette's document.

They contrast rather quaintly with the fact that recently he scrutineered the results of one of his own branches in that electorate, the Joondalup branch in the northern suburbs. He was provided with the results by the returning officer and asked to pass them on to the divisional secretary. But in the process, he had them typed up in his own office and changed the result to one which materially benefited him and benefited his prospects of preselection.

Mr Ian Viner QC, interestingly, got one vote. He seemed to be the only person who did not know he was not going to win. Mr Viner QC then appealed against Mr Filing on the basis that Mr Filing had corruptly sought to induce one of the delegates to cast a vote in hisâ€”Mr Filing'sâ€”favour on the basis that he would provide him with employment in the event he was successful.

I have no objection to that but I am told by dissident elements in the union who are very unhappy with Mr Ludwig's leadership that when the union's minute secretary, Lyn Hewlett, pointed out that this appointment had not been approved and was therefore in breach of union rules, Mr Ludwig pointed to the motion empowering his predecessor to hire an Aboriginal trainee and indicated that that was close enough for him.

         The fact that his son was not an Aboriginal person and that this action denied access to the job to someone who was an Aboriginal person and whose wages would be subsidised by the federal government did not seem to worry the AWU. It is sort of harking back to the roots of the old AWU, which was an historic bedrock of the ALP White Australia policy, which found its embodiment in its 1890 racist anti-Chinese and anti-Kanaka history. I suppose it is ironic that at the same time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is protesting about Mr Graeme Campbell and his alleged racism.

The Party Rules provide that a member of the Administrative Committee who fails to attend meetings persistently without a satisfactory explanation is subject to being reported for such non-attendance to the State Council. Your assurance that that Rule `will be all right' gives me no reassurance at all. Compliance with your direction would leave me open to denigration, ridicule and disciplinary measures in the forums of the Party.

No wonder so many people who were working under CRA preferred to make their own arrangements and their own direct negotiations with the companyâ€”which involved getting them more money than the union would have been able to get for them anyway.

         Since my comments about Mr Ludwig earlier today and the alarming drop in his union's membership in Queensland, I have been sent the most realistic guide to the number of members held by the Queensland AWU in the form of the election returns from the electoral office ballot held last August. These official figures show that Mr Ludwig's claims last week of having 80,000 union members appear to be absolute nonsense. Only something like 53,323 names and addresses of voters were actually submitted to the Electoral Commission. Something like 8,280 were apparently sent to a previous address and a further 3,736 had no address at all. I have not shown this to the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht).

         â€”They are Australian Workers Union election statistics as at 17 August 1995. Unfortunately, it does not have the name of the Commonwealth Electoral Commission on the document. I will not proceed to even seek leave in that event. I note that it shows Mr Ludwig now has only 41,307 genuine members left in Queensland, not the 80,000 he has been speaking about. This might be why so many people within the union are moving against Mr Ludwig, as I outlined earlier, when I revealed the letter from the Victorian secretary who is moving to require him to resign at the next meeting of the national executive.

         What is interesting to note is that Queensland has only 41,307 members as against New South Wales, which has 43,387. Queensland used to be the heart and soul of that union, which now has only 141,173 members spread throughout Australia. I simply want to say this about Mr Ludwig and his union: if there were to be an efficient, well-run AWU that recognised the merit of allowing workers to come to the best possible  deal with their employers which would be in the workers' best interests, that would be fine. But it is not good enough to have a union run by a union boss who prefers to stand over people.

        It is important to note that Australia's commitment to food aid is a special case. A liability has been incurred through our commitment to the Food Aid Convention of 300,000 tonnes of wheat or wheat equivalent per annum for the period 1995/96 to 1997/98. There is no specific allocation for food aid as such. Rather, our Food Aid Commitment is met through country appropriations, emergency and refugee appropriations, as well as the World Food Program.

        The commitments have been recorded in accordance with the accounting definitions specified by the Department of Finance in its guidelines to Commonwealth agencies for the preparation of annual Financial Statements tabled in Parliament. Obligations are recorded as liabilities, commitments and agreements equally proportionately unperformed (AEPUs). These definitions are explained at Attachment II.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Using these definitions, the levels of forward commitment as at 30 September 1995 are as follows: 1996/97â€”$1,055 million; 1997/98â€”$908 million; 1998/99â€”$678 million; 1999/2000â€”$595 million; 2000/01â€”$481 million.

        There are other programs/activities that are not covered by these definitions and therefore not recorded for the purpose of the Financial Statements, but which also place a high degree of obligation on Australia for moral or other reasons. While there are strong expectations that such funding will continue, these activities have not been included as development cooperation commitments for these Questions on Notice.

        These other obligations include core contributions to United Nations development organisations (eg. UNICEF, United Nations Development Program, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The contributions are voluntary and not covered by legislation as in the case of multilateral development banks, nor are they covered by the `assessed' formulae used for other UN bodies. There is, however, a strong expectation internationally and domestically that Australia's contributions to these organisations will continue, reflecting Australia's role as a good international citizen and the principle of burden-sharing with other donors.

        The category also covers: allocations to meet commitments where the Government has pledged support for specific programs (eg. Prime Ministerial multiyear pledges for development cooperation programs in Vietnam and Cambodia); provision for refugee and emergency relief; funding for Development Import Finance Facility projects where activities have been agreed between Australia and recipient governments; funding for the AusAID/Non-government Organisations Cooperation Program; funding for volunteer programs; and support for regional organisations such as the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. There is also an expectation of maintenance of support for bilateral country programs in key regions such as the South Pacific.

        There are, however, expectations based on requests on hand to a total value of $267.9 million, of which it is anticipated that some $60 million will be funded during the remainder of the 1995/96 financial year and the balance funded in out years. Funding is provided as contracts are signed in any year up to the total annual allocation for the Development Import Finance Facility program. There are expectations of funding from the countries concerned and Australian contractors for these projects and, on that basis, contract negotiations have commenced. It should be noted that not all the identified projects will necessarily proceed to formal offer by AusAID. The latter is contingent upon satisfactory appraisal by AusAID on developmental grounds, including an assessment against OECD criteria for mixed credits and the satisfactory conclusion to negotiations between the Australian supplier and the buyer in the recipient country. Attachment III provides the list of Development Import Finance Facility projects agreed with recipient governments.

The total commitment as at 30 September 1995, in percentage terms, assuming 1995/96 aid levels are maintained in real terms, are: 1996/97â€”65 per cent; 1997/98â€”54 per cent; 1998/99â€”39 per cent; 1999/2000â€”33 per cent; 2000/01â€”26 per cent.
