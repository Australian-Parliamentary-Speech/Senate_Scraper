        I will just speak very briefly to that motion. I have not moved that government business order of the day No. 9, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, be listed to be considered at lunchtime because, as I understand it, there is a concern—at least from Senator Harradine—that has been communicated to the government in relation to the listing of that matter. I do not intend to delay the Senate. I have moved the motion in respect of three orders of the day. I will have discussions with interested senators about the human services and health bill. There may be a need for me to inform the Senate at a later stage in relation to that particular bill, but at this stage I am not proposing that it be debated at lunchtime.

         —Basically we agree with that, with the proviso that there may have to be a little give and take in relation to the second reading of the appropriation bills, depending on what speakers are available during lunchtime. As I understand the arrangement, we will deal with the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the interstate road transport amendment bills. If there is enough time available we will then have some debate on the second reading of the appropriation bills. Whether we get to the appropriation bills before lunchtime is yet to be seen. If we do, we would continue debate on the bills during lunchtime. We would be interposing certain speakers who were available and were prepared to give their second reading speech at lunchtime. We would cooperate with that arrangement. All I am saying is that there will need to be a little bit of finesse in the handling of this matter.

I will just indicate that the policy issues in respect of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 appear now to be resolved. The only remaining thing is the division of that bill into one bill that deals with all of the matters except the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act, and I have a notice of motion that is designed to divide the bill.

         Both bills would then be able to proceed and I think it would only take a matter of 10 minutes to complete them. I hope that will assist with the consideration of this matter. I will not go deeply into the reasons for dividing the bill except to say that this is an omnibus bill containing matters that are totally unrelated to each other. Senator Lees adverted to that fact during the debate on the bill. I think it is very important for the Senate to not be faced with such a bill in the future. I am suggesting that we proceed to divide the bill so that the message gets to people that they should not attempt in future to place into an omnibus bill issues that are totally unrelated to each other.

         It would seem to me that it is not appropriate to complete the consideration of that message until the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has had time to complete its task and bring down its report. I would not have thought that that would make any real difference to the government's program because if that saves a few minutes we would go on with the next bill on the program. I ask the minister to defer the legislation while we give further consideration to this particular issue.

         —The Greens (WA) welcome the government's moves to protect the enforcement of human rights in response to the decision of the High Court in Brandy v the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. We support it and are gratified that the High Court handed down such a decision, which reinforces one of the few constitutional protections of human rights in Australia—the separation of powers. The separation of powers embodied in the constitution ensures that non-judicial persons cannot exercise judicial power. As a result of the Brandy case, the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act that were passed in 1992 have been found to have never been valid.

         We are pleased that, in response to this, the government set up what has come to be known as the Basten committee to look at restoring both the protection of human rights and the constitutionality of those provisions. We are less happy with the government's amendments under consideration here today, which revert to the pre-November 1992 arrangements. I will detail some of the concerns a little later.

         Obviously, the decision in the Brandy case did throw into disarray somewhat the determinations that had already been made since the amendments that were moved in this chamber were found to have not been valid. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has stated that 37 determinations were made between the passage of the amendments and the handing down of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. It is fortunate that the validity of those amendments was tested at such an early stage before the rights of more people were adversely affected through the passage of the invalid legislation.

         It would be easy to attack the government and its legal advisers for introducing amendments to these acts that were so clearly unconstitutional. However, that is not the point.

         In the short term, the government is simply amending the legislation to return to the situation before the 1992 amendments. While there is obviously a need to act rapidly, it is important that this be only a temporary measure. People may rightly say that we have not acted totally rapidly in this situation. Some measure of time has elapsed. My understanding is that the Basten committee has travelled quite a way down the path of providing some very good solutions to these problems. I certainly hope that that is the case.

         I believe that the measures that are being introduced here as temporary measures cause some problems, because we are putting in place what was felt by everybody pre-November 1992 to be an utterly unsatisfactory and undesirable arrangement. To that end, one of the Greens' amendments relates to a sunset clause. I thank Senator Spindler for his comments on it and the indication from the Democrats that they felt we were a bit unrealistic in the date we had set. We could have thrown things into a bit of turmoil if our sunset clause had come up at the time when there could have been elections in the offing or when, in some such way, the results of the Basten committee could not have been brought to this place for proper consideration and discussion and be put into operation. So we have delayed that sunset clause stage until 1 September 1996.

         Our reason for doing that was basically that there is a danger that, if we revert to the November 1992 position here, then it will stay like that for a long time. If there is an election and if there is a change of government or if there is the same government, there may be nothing that is a real incentive to look at the arrangements that were found to be so unsatisfactory then. That would be highly undesirable. The sunset clause stands in the place of an incentive to whomever is in government to redress what we believe to be a highly unsatisfactory situation.

         The reason we believe it was never satisfactory is that the pre-November 1992 situation involved a double hearing which was adverse to the interests of the complainants. It also put them in difficulties with legal costs. It allowed their case to be available for scrutiny and we believe that is the reason why—and I know this will not be new to my colleagues in the chamber—the unsatisfactory and invalid amendments were put in place. It was to remedy what was found to be a very negative situation for complainants because of the lack of enforceability of determinations in the pre-1992 acts. It was that lack of enforceability which led the government to attempt to create an alternative process, which has subsequently been found to be unconstitutional by the High Court.

         That is the reason why there are some other amendments which we believe are far more satisfactory as interim arrangements than the ones that are proposed in this bill. I regret to say that, apart from some measure of support from the Democrats, we have not gained support for this. So it may well largely be a flagging of what we believe is a far better option than the one proposed by the amendments. Even at this late stage, I would urge my colleagues to reconsider their capacity to support the amendments that the Greens are putting forward.

         In our view, since the previous amendments and alternative process were found to be unconstitutional, we believe it is clear that determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission cannot be used as an enforcement mechanism. A court mechanism must now be established. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Sydney has advocated the establishment of a `Human Rights Court'. Without wishing to pre-empt the recommendations of the Basten committee, the Greens (WA) would support the establishment of such a court. We made this statement in March this year, and we make it again now: this would give human rights and their protection the status that they require and which have been lacking to date.

         Under both the pre- and post-1992 schemes, persons whose human rights had been infringed could not go directly to the Federal Court for enforcement. They had to go through the conciliation and determination process conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. For many people, this would be seen as further barriers to the enforcement of their human rights. While HREOC has an admirable record in conciliating disputes, it is essential that any future regime allows people direct access to a court.

         We understand the difficulties faced by persons seeking to enforce their human rights and the differentials in power and resources between the victims and the perpetrators of human rights abuses.

It must also ensure that there is adequate legal aid and other support for people seeking to protect their human rights.

         The legislation which this parliament has enacted to protect human rights is a good first step; however, there has never been in place the necessary enforcement mechanisms that we believe are required. This interim situation, the one which I believe is being supported here today, is highly unsatisfactory. I urge my colleagues to consider the value of the Greens' amendments in which we suggest that an option be available to a complainant either to stay within the conciliation and determination provisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, in full knowledge that there is not an enforcement capacity, or to choose to go direct to the Federal Court after the completion of the conciliation part of the process.

Senator Chamarette has taken the government to task for not developing a regime that is fair and expeditious, which can be used at reasonable cost, in which there is not undue formality and which protects human rights.

         The Attorney-General and the people who work in the department who have given outstanding advice, not only to the government but generally over the years, have been asked to try to accommodate that. If the Attorney-General's Department never worked out a scheme which would accommodate the sorts of things that Senator Chamarette requires, then it would never make a mistake. If we want to see what the limit of constitutional power is for the Commonwealth—so as to accommodate good legislation; so as to make Australia a fairer place; so as to bring human rights within the ken of people who live in this country—we have got to test what it is that is constitutional.

         Nobody knows what is constitutional until a matter comes before the court. Even the High Court does not know what is constitutional until a matter is put before it. I suggest that people look at the judgment of Justice Brennan, as he then was—Chief Justice Brennan, as he now is—in the case of Theophanous and the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd when he goes into this very point of how the law develops. He says:

        Common law is amenable to development by judicial decision, subject to the Constitution and to statute. What is permissible development of the common law by the courts and what amounts to impermissible change is an issue on which minds differ most sharply.

        That is the common law. Then Chief Justice Brennan talks about the constitution. He states:

        Clearly the Court cannot change the Constitution, nor can it convert constitutional silence into a legal rule with constitutional force. I do not mean that, in changing conditions, the Constitution does not have a changing effect . . . that the denotation of its terms does not change . . . that the course of judicial interpretation does not reveal that a past constitutional doctrine is untenable . . . or that new situations do not reveal new doctrines inherent in the constitutional text. The Constitution speaks continually to the present and it operates in and upon contemporary conditions.

        I see some representatives of the Attorney-General's Department are here today. I know that they are people of outstanding legal ability, of great integrity and of great patience, particularly when they come before Senate committees.

         Clearly, given the sorts of things that Justice Brennan, as he then was—he is now Chief Justice—said and given the sorts of things that Senator Chamarette and others have said before about the need for a new regime, people have to go out and give things a go. If they do that, they might make a mistake. Given all that, the Attorney-General's Department should not be criticised for the result in Brandy's case. It is unfair to take it to task for doing what the government and what this parliament wants it to do. It was this parliament which passed the legislation that was held invalid in Brandy's case. What we should be doing instead is marking the debt we owe to the great advice we get from the Attorney-General's Department.

         One example of how much we owe the department is the Native Title Act, which was challenged in the High Court and which the High Court upheld. The High Court could have gone the other way on that but it upheld that act, which has advanced Australia's standing as a fair and just society in a very big way indeed. I conclude my remarks by saying it is good to see the Attorney-General's representatives here. They have done a great job and will continue to do so in years to come.

         In relation to the suggestion from Senator Vanstone that the fate of the scheme invalidated the Brandy decision indicates that the government is receiving poor quality legal advice, I make the point that the area of judicial power in the constitution is a very complex one and the High Court has great difficulty in defining the concept. In enacting the former scheme, the government had legal advice from eminent lawyers such as the former chief general counsel in the Attorney-General's Department—a well recognised expert in constitutional law. The scheme was also supported by, for example, Sir Ronald Wilson, currently President of the HREOC and a former High Court judge. When one deals with complex novel areas of the law there will be a divergence in views, and the High Court is of course the final arbiter.

         It was also suggested by Senator Abetz that the government should have permanently resolved this issue by now. I would point out to the Senate that on 27 February 1995, only four days after the High Court handed down its decision, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) announced the government's two-stage response to the decision. Firstly, as an urgent interim measure, it was decided to reinstate the pre-1993 scheme so that the determinations of the HREOC could be enforced. The government has been endeavouring to introduce these amendments since March. Secondly, the review committee which had been examining the role and structure of the HREOC was expanded and given the task of considering the options for a new permanent scheme and reporting to the government by June 1995.

The high cost of filing fees, the adversarial system and the lack of any special procedures to handle discrimination cases make this proposal quite inappropriate.

        As I have indications that there is not sufficient support for these amendments in the chamber, I will not be calling a division as I do not wish to delay the time of the chamber. I sincerely regret that there is not sufficient support to make the arguments against the government's position stronger. I believe that the government has not adequately addressed an interim arrangement that meets the needs of the complainants who will be disadvantaged by a reversion back to the pre-November 1992 arrangements.

         These amendments deal with the option that I am presenting on behalf of the Greens (WA). Instead of reverting to the situation where a complainant to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has an enforced double hearing which allows their arguments to be heard and which gives an undue advantage and a shift in the power balance to the person against whom they are making the complaint, our option is that at the end of the conciliation process the complainants are given a choice. They can say, `I want to proceed through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission process from conciliation to determination in full awareness that there isn't an enforceability capacity within the commission to do that.' I am not a lawyer—my legal colleagues may be more aware of this than I am—but my understanding is that, if people have proceeded through a conciliation process and they are coming to an almost mutually agreeable solution with the people whom they have the complaint against, they can suddenly decide that it is likely to be resolved without the need for enforcement. Therefore, there is no harm in proceeding at this level and taking that into consideration. It may also be that the penalty and the likelihood of the people whom they have the complaint against not agreeing with that response are so small that they would feel that it would be a waste of time and energy to go to the Federal Court. That option remains available to them. They can proceed to that point.

In that first option where people elect to go straight through with the commission from the conciliation to the determination process, if a contract is made during that determination process between the two parties there might be some capacity to register that contract in the arbitration court without contravening the constitutionality question of the separation of powers being violated. That is a finer point. I am not going to expand on it because I understand I do not have the support of the opposition on these amendments. The government has already indicated its stance.

That suggests this is, if you like, a quasi industrial matter. Yet I would like to think it adds some strength to the comments I was making yesterday; that is, that there ought be some requirement on a complainant who seeks to make a complaint against an employer under the vicarious liability sections to register a complaint with an employer in some formal sense and in some detail, so that six months down the track the employer is not told about certain things that occurred in the workplace of which the employer genuinely can say, `I'm sorry, I didn't even know it was going on.'

         For example, under the workers compensation guidelines—in my state at least—an employee has to put in a formal claim and advise the employer of it, and the process runs from there. I think it would add strength and merit to the system and provide some protection to employers under the vicarious liability sections of the various aspects of the legislation—that is, the sex discrimination, racial discrimination and disability discrimination legislation—so that there is some forewarning to the employers. I do not wish to delay the proceedings any further, other than to say that we on this side look forward to the recommendations of the Basten committee.

In fact, to use Senator Vanstone's words, it is not a question of getting it quickly; it is a question of getting it right.

        I will address the amendment because Senator Harradine has asked me a question about its wording. I am not sure whether the amendment has made the intention of the Greens clear. In my view it has, but that may not be the case for others. As I have already pointed out, we believe that, because the current situation which the chamber has supported is unsatisfactory and reverts back to the previously unsatisfactory provision that existed prior to November 1992, there should be an incentive for the government to implement the provisions that the Basten committee may consider which will address the issue far more satisfactorily for the complainants. I acknowledge that it should be fair and just for all parties.

         I want to clarify the intent of the Greens' amendment. It is not trying to tie this parliament down to any enactment of the provisions or recommendations sought to be implemented by the Basten committee. It simply says that, if through parliamentary consideration those new provisions are coming to the stage of enactment, then these amendments will lapse. That is fairly self-explanatory. We do not intend to tie the parliament into anything unknown ahead of time.

The minister has said that the government is concerned about the lapse of time provision. The minister said that we should not implement provisions that lapse simply with the passage of time.

If the Basten committee reports in 1995 there is not a big problem having a lapse at 1 September 1996.

         What is the problem?

That is why it is quite important to have a sunset clause.

Therefore, if we are saying that we should not have a sunset clause because it implies we are passing something that is inadequate, let us not forget that that is what we are doing. The incentive will then be on any government by September 1996 to implement a solution that is far more desirable than the one that will be passed in this chamber today.

         —The coalition does not support Greens amendment No. 1. Simply put, the recommendations of the Basten committee need to be  considered before we can go any further on this. In particular, I believe that Senator Vanstone outlined the point that the sunset clause involves a timetable that is too restrictive. When the coalition wins government, it will need some time to adjust to things in the first month and get its legislative program in order. Whilst September next year is 14 months away, allowing for a federal election in the meantime, even in the remote chance that the government is returned, we would need to take five months out of that. It really only leaves another nine months. The coalition's view is that it is really quite restrictive on the timetable. We look forward to the recommendations of the Basten committee.

         —The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995 and related bills aim to set up a new dairy market support arrangement in Australia. Essentially, this legislation replaces the old dairy legislation which was found to be illegal under GATT. Importantly, it will continue the phase-out of assistance to the dairy industry. I am pleased, therefore, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has come on duty to take important note of this legislation.

         The old legislation aimed to phase down assistance to the equivalent of a five per cent tariff by the year 2000. Based on a levy paid by dairy farmers on all milk, this money was pooled and used to assist export returns. The objective was to encourage companies to export rather than dump their product on the domestic market and risk forcing down prices. Under GATT, this assistance was seen as an export subsidy and therefore illegal.

         Industry, government and the coalition agreed that new legislation was needed—legislation that not only continued the phase-out of assistance but met Australia's obligations under GATT. Priorities for the federal coalition were the continuation of benefits to the dairy industry and a minimum of disruption to consumers and manufacturers. This package meets our criteria.

         It sets out a new levy on market milk, as opposed to all milk, and should amount to no more than the current levy. It will be based on protein and fat content rather than just fat content. The new levy will be paid by farmers supplying market milk. It is GATT legal because market milk is not generally regarded as an export oriented product. Under the new arrangement, manufacturers will pay a levy on domestic manufactured products instead of farmers paying a levy on the milk used in manufacture. These funds will be redistributed to farmers based on the amount of manufactured milk, as opposed to market milk, supplied. It means that assistance will now be identifiable as a domestic market support scheme rather than an export subsidy scheme.

         It is important to note that the effective phase down will continue at the same rate as the old legislation. The new scheme will terminate on 30 June in the year 2000 and any surplus funds will go to the Australian Dairy Corporation. The federal coalition sees no reason for the price of domestic dairy products to rise. The new arrangements simply transfer the levy paid on all milk to market milk and product.

         However, because the levy will be based on protein and fat content, there may be minor adjustments in the level of payments to individual farmers. ABARE, along with the Australian Dairy Corporation, will estimate the annual level of support under the 1992 plan, to enable the government to set an appropriate rate for the levy.

         The import offset provisions in this legislation will protect the amount of dairy market support flowing to milk producers in manufacturing. Without these, the system could be manipulated to gain unfair financial advantage. In other words, someone could export dairy produce that has already been imported or displaced from the domestic market and then claim an export rebate without paying the manufacturing levy. Therefore, an import-offset levy payable by direct importers, and an acquisition-offset levy payable by manufacturers acquiring product from importers who have not paid the import offset levy, will be imposed on an annual assessment basis. These levies do not represent a surrogate import levy; they are applied only against the export rebate. This conforms with the GATT-legal principle that indirect taxation costs on production can be legally rebated.

         The dairy industry is unquestionably one of Australia's great success stories. Just 10 years ago, the government was worried that, if the industry produced more than six billion litres of milk a year, we would have a glut and prices would fall. But thanks to the outward-looking nature of this industry, we are about to produce and sell more than eight billion litres of milk this year. Export income alone is expected to top $1.4 billion.

         Australia has gone from a country giving daily milk deliveries to a country where dairy products have use-by dates that are the envy of the world. The industry has achieved this through hard work and a commitment to quality assurance. It controls the quality of the product from the cow in the paddock to the plate in the house, thereby ensuring Australia's world reputation for high quality dairy products. Dairying is an industry in which growers can value add and look after their interests past the farm gate. Around 70 per cent of all milk produced in this country is handled by dairy farmer cooperatives. Despite some early problems with undercapitalisation, the industry has aggressively developed branded products, particularly specialised products for niche markets, and profitability has improved. This in turn has attracted investment, and investment has grown.

         The changes in these bills are required to implement the new policy to replace the current dairy market support arrangements so that they are consistent with Australia's commitments to the World Trade Organisation agreement. The package of this bill replaces the old market support fund with a new domestic market support fund for milk producers. The purpose of this new scheme, the domestic market support fund, is to give manufacturing milk producers the same level of support as under the old scheme that was against the World Trade Organisation.

Before it even comes to fruition it will have to be completely rewritten. It is a very complex bill, and we will be asked to deal with it in some detail at very short notice. The way we changed our legislation worries me. It worries me that we did not debate this whole concept last year.

         I make it very clear that some of us wonder why we bother when some of our friends are not abiding by the rules. It is a matter of great concern amongst the dairy industry in Queensland and elsewhere around Australia that some of our very close friends, most notably the United States, are busy dumping milk powder products into the Philippines market. This is a market which we have supplied for a long period, a market in which we have a very firm hold, a market where there was no subsidy from the Europeans and a market into which, as a result of dairy subsidies in the US, milk powder product is being dumped. The Americans cannot say they are doing this to counter the threat of European subsidies. If they are honest, they must admit that this will lead to only a further breakdown in the objective of unsubsidised free trade throughout this region.

         As Senator Tambling said so eloquently here today, the dairy industry is worth $1.4 billion to this country. It is very important that our producers get a fair return on their exports. It is absolutely critical. It is critical to the stability of the price of the domestic market. We are a very efficient producer of dairy products. We have to export those products in order to ensure that we get a decent price in Australia—that is what all the arrangements have been about—and, even when we do so, we can get them into markets cheaper than local producers overseas. I have seen that in supermarkets overseas.

         It riles me and the industry immensely when this sort of thing happens because all it does is reduce our return and reduce the value of the dairy industry around the world. That is the consequence of the American arrangements. As I said to the dairy industry in North Queensland last month when I opened its conference, it is important that we ensure, through whatever means possible, the message is taken to the Americans that their actions are unsatisfactory. I hope Senator Collins has done that this week. I hope to have an opportunity to do so myself.

         It is also important that in the long run we develop a market overseas for fresh milk and fresh dairy products, which we can supply at an advantage compared with the rest of the world. Our proximity and the good air communications between Australia and many other countries mean that we can get fresh product into the market cheaper, more efficiently and more quickly than any of our competitors. That ultimately is the long-term future for the Australian industry. It is tied to growing living standards overseas so that people can afford fresh product instead of a powdered product.

         One of the reasons why we are so susceptible in the Philippines market is that on the whole people do not yet have the capacity to buy fresh milk that has been brought in from overseas. They cannot afford it. That is why the powdered product comes in. The reason why the Americans subsidise the powdered

       <para>
        product is that their greater distance from the market does not leave them at a disadvantage when product has been processed and powdered because it keeps longer. Obviously, with a fresh product we can effectively, as our citrus producers have found, lock out people who are a long way away. A fresh product is after all a higher quality product because people are getting a product which is purer.

         I conclude by saying the Americans have to recognise that their friends are being hurt by their actions. Their friends have a limited tolerance for this sort of activity. I thought it was very peculiar that the Americans were suggesting that defence arrangements be one of the negotiating chips in their trade dispute with Japan. If we took that attitude in this country, I am sure that our American friends would be hopping up and down at the suggestion that we were going to blackmail them. I do not think our friendship should be taken for granted. I do not believe the Australian dairy industry should be taken for granted either.

         The dairy industry has rationalised itself over the last 20 years into one of the most efficient industries. Coming from a position of relative weakness in the rural perspective of our primary industry, it has developed into probably one of the most successful, if not in the first three most successful, primary industry. It has rationalised itself in Queensland, where there were thousands of small 40- to 50-acre dairy farms with 20 or 30 cows, into 1,600 very successful primary industry businesses. It has led the way in many instances for primary industry.

That is the background of why we are bringing this legislation forward.

We expected great things from the World Trade Organisation, and Australian primary industry made tremendous sacrifices in the interests of getting the GATT round and the next step, the World Trade Organisation, clarified.

We deregulated the wheat industry by deregulating the domestic price, which lowered the price of wheat in Australia.

         —In the 15th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation,

          Super guarantee: its track record
         </emphasis>
         , the committee addressed certain aspects of the small amounts problems and put forward a number of recommendations. Since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, the overwhelming concern of people contributing small amounts was the problem of the erosion of the capital contribution of the employer by fees and charges, especially for those people who changed jobs frequently or who were on low incomes.

         The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 and cognate bills, which are currently before the Senate, specifically address the small amounts problem. However, I believe it would also be useful to include in this debate the related further issue of the superannuation transfer protocol, which will be introduced not through legislation but through regulation. Therefore, to fully appreciate the total picture of the small accounts issue, I think we have to refer during this debate to both this legislation and the transfer protocol.

         As I said earlier, perhaps the greatest criticism of the superannuation guarantee charge surrounds the reduction of small balances by fees and charges. As evidence of the maturity of the industry, it is pleasing to report that the industry has been working with the government to devise further ways of achieving better outcomes for members with small account balances.

         In the past members have been faced with difficult administrative procedures in transferring their superannuation benefits, particularly when they change employment. The focus of the interaction with the industry and government has been to find ways to streamline and transfer processes as members change jobs—and I welcome that.

         The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation sees the lodgment of small amounts with the Taxation Office as an interim or short-term measure—and just how interim is a matter of some question. But the Liberal and National parties perhaps take a harder line, and I am foreshadowing a committee stage amendment of a sunset clause in terms of the role for superannuation of the Taxation Office in handling small amounts. But once the concept of the ATO was introduced in terms of handling small amounts, the industry responded very quickly, and it was perhaps the industry superannuation funds that took the lead in accepting small amounts without reduction of the capital contribution by way of fees and charges.

         This process essentially has meant some degree of cross-subsidisation, which is not always welcome but under the circumstances was deemed necessary and desirable. Naturally, other funds have followed some of the leading industry funds in adopting similar processes.

         Perhaps the most important bill in this package of bills with which the Senate is dealing is the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill 1995. This establishes a reserve, known as the superannuation holdings account reserve, to facilitate the collection of small amounts by the Taxation Office.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The cost of the establishment of such a reserve will be in the order of $5.6 million, while the annual cost of administration will be between $7 million and $7 1/2 million. Those running costs of between $7 million and $7 1/2 million will be offset by the earnings of the moneys in this reserve fund. But I must point out that there will be no erosion of the capital contributions made to Taxation Office holding accounts where an employer cannot find a fund that will accept small contributions. I must say that it would be fairly difficult for an employer not to find a fund nowadays, but this facility is there that will accept such moneys.

         Member protection rules will protect amounts under $1,000, and measures will be in place by 1 July 1995, hence the importance of getting this legislation through before the Senate rises. In fact, funds that decide not to operate under the new rules will not be able to accept small superannuation amounts from new members and, therefore, will be required to transfer existing balances below $1,000 to a fund which will protect employees.

         —The arrangements of the reserve will not be a superannuation fund and, therefore, not subject to the costly prudential standards of superannuation funds requiring trustees, et cetera. The reserve will accept both mandated—that is, award—and superannuation guarantee contributions plus voluntary employer contributions, referred to as deposits, on behalf of an employee. Moneys paid into the reserve will be allocated to an account of the employee and will be maintained for that employee's benefit.

         When the member's account accumulates to a sustainable balance of $1,200, the balance can then be transferred to a complying superannuation fund of the member's choice. This amount will be treated as an employer contribution to that fund and will constitute a taxable contribution of the fund.

         Generally, employees will not have direct access to their account balances. However, in order to facilitate and encourage the transfer of accounts that exceed $1,200 to a superannuation fund, interest will not be credited on amounts in excess of $1,200. However, deductions for employer contributions made to the reserve will only be available where those contributions do not exceed $1,200 per employee per year. On the other hand, amounts in excess of $1,200 can still be contributed but without the benefit of an allowable deduction to the employer. The Small Superannuation Accounts Bill therefore provides a legislative framework for employers to make payments to a superannuation holding accounts reserve, instead of making the small superannuation contributions to a superannuation fund.

         Perhaps this is an opportune time to raise an issue that was also raised in the committee's 15th report, which looked into the superannuation guarantee. Firstly, the committee recommended that the tax office's scheme should be limited to those employers unable to find appropriate funds offering member protection or unable to utilise existing employee accounts. Further, we recommended that PAYE forms should be utilised to simplify employers administration of their superannuation guarantee obligations. I trust that the government will pick up this recommendation, although it is not in the bill.

         It is also pleasing that the government has accepted the recommendation of appropriate transfer protocols, which will also be in place by 1 July. However, one committee recommendation still has not been addressed; that is, that the government should look at the removal of the contributions tax, particularly from the early contributions. I believe that would also alleviate the small amounts problem. In other words, the government has asked industry to bear a cost, and we think the government should bear a cost in taking away some of the tax, particularly from the initial contributions.

         The Select Committee on Superannuation that I chair undoubtedly received conflicting evidence about the acceptance of the superannuation guarantee system. However, I must say now that the emerging and perhaps dominant view is that the progressiveness of the superannuation guarantee system has been widely accepted. That acceptance is firming over time. The issue now is really to finetune the arrangement. That is important because we have to protect those funds. They are now worth approximately $200 billion and could increase tenfold into the first part of the next century. From a prudential aspect, the biggest challenge at the moment is therefore handling what I believe is the potentially explosive issue of derivatives.

         Only this week the Australian Retirement Income Streams Association submitted to the committee that perhaps one of the most effective ways of overcoming the problem of small amounts is for employees to be given ownership of their superannuation arrangements through the operation of an account with their chosen public offer fund to which all employer contributions are placed. It also points out that the bias towards industry funds actually runs counter to other areas of government policy where the government has sought to deregulate industries and public utilities and to encourage greater competition, and this has certainly been in line with the Hilmer recommendations.

         I introduce this point because I think this is one way of addressing the small account superannuation, but there are other ways of addressing it. One of the other ways of addressing it, as I have just mentioned, was put forward in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation by the well-informed Australian Retirement Income Streams Association. I acknowledge its pioneering work in terms of the particular products that it has developed for retirement incomes and, particularly, for what I call allocated pensions, which are a very valuable and useful product.

         The simple thrust of the submission form ARISA, the Australian Retirement Income Streams Association, was that the current system does not recognise the basic proposition that people should have control over arrangements which they themselves are funding, whether that funding is direct or indirect. So this sort of proposition is, of course, not far from the Liberal Party view, which is that there should be more competition in terms of giving people the same control over their superannuation fund and their right of choice. Certainly, the advance in electronic transmission of funds through the banking system or through Australia Post does provide a very low cost and efficient facility where funds can be dispatched almost instantaneously right across a number of funds from the employer.

         I think the coalition took a courageous stand when it decided that rather than making, for example, retirement savings accounts conditional on this legislation, it would leave it as an election issue. It is just so important to get the small amounts in place before 1 July that we really did not want to be seen to be hindering the timing of putting into place what I call the intermediate step of the arrangements of the holding accounts through the Australian Taxation Office system.

         The Liberal Party believes there is a role for retirement savings accounts. However, my personal belief is that they are better situated at the bottom end of the spectrum. Once the amount starts to grow, they should be subject to the same prudential guidelines and trustee control that most other superannuation funds are subject to. This is something that I think should be put to the electorate at the next election rather than holding up this important bill, and I commend Mr Connolly for acknowledging this. Mr Connolly is the coalition spokesman on superannuation and is doing a very good job.

         We should also look at this question of choice, because choice is inevitably involved in this whole question of superannuation. I must point out to the Senate that there are actually two aspects of choice. Firstly, there is beneficiary or member investment choice, which is allowed under SIS but which must be not only within the investment strategy guidelines laid down by the SIS rules and regulations themselves but also under a strategy determined by the trustees.

         The concept that the government introduced of providing temporary capital gains tax relief for those funds that rollover or merge with each other is indeed welcomed, but what the government must do is extend this exemption from capital gains tax where funds do decide to merge.

         Again, my time has run out, so I must conclude now. While the gains that leverage can make for investments are enticing, their potential to lose similar amounts represents, I believe, an unacceptable risk to superannuation funds. Superannuation, arguably more than any other form of investment, is an investment that recipients cannot afford to lose. In this debate on the small accounts issue, I have addressed a wider number of issues. They are all related to the safeguarding and security of an investment that is put away and which is so necessary not only to provide a stable, secure retirement income flow but also to increase national saving. I commend the bills to the Senate.

         These superannuation bills implement the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in June 1994 to establish a means of treating small amounts. The government's performance in this area has been tardy. In 1992, the Democrats warned that this would be a problem. Indeed, the problem would have been worse had we not raised the payment threshold from $250 to $450. We still believe that the problem could best be fixed by setting up a national fund for casual and part-time employees. In a sense, the ATO collection mechanism parallels or reflects that preference of the Democrats, but it is a second-best option.

         This is a worrying trend, especially as we will soon be in this place debating whether to reduce the disposable income of low income earners in compulsory superannuation contributions. The bill sets up an Australian Taxation Office collection mechanism and a superannuation holding reserve system. The object of the reserve is to allow small amounts to accumulate to such a level—that is, $1,200—that there is a viable account. Then the amount will be moved into a superannuation fund.

         Superannuation funds will no longer be able to accept small amounts unless they agree to member protect; that is, agree that their fees cannot exceed the earnings of the fund. This ensures that, after allowing for insurance premiums, individual accounts will not go backwards, but in many cases it means that they will not go forwards. It fails to address the key fundamental problem that superannuation funds are not providing, and probably never will provide, a fair deal for low income workers.

I do hope that success of the transfer protocol arrangements are redebated in this place in 12 months time and, if moral suasion has failed, then the big stick will need to be used.

         The second key failing of the proposed system is the exclusion of other financial institutions which are better suited to dealing with small amounts than the large super funds are. Credit unions, building societies—as I understand it—and even perhaps banks have, to varying degrees, signalled a willingness to set up savings accounts which would allow the funds to accumulate with zero or no fees and with small interest. This offer is superior to anything offered yet by a super fund. A payment of even five per cent interest with no fees is better than a guarantee of zero return offered by member protection.

         The Democrats do not believe that it is appropriate in this debate to discuss whether banks or other institutions should generally have access to superannuation. We have not been persuaded that this is the issue of competitive neutrality that the banks claim it is. However, we have been persuaded, based on representations from the credit union sector, that the financial institutions can offer a useful product to help low income earners and can provide a fairer deal for low income earners than that provided by the super funds.

         The Senate select committee set a series of criteria for a product in super savings accounts which we believed would be useful. The criteria are: no fees; an interest rate broadly comparable with term deposits—currently about five per cent or six per cent; access to the super complaints tribunal for complaints; and that funds be transferred to an aggregated fund when the amount of $3,000 is reached. The credit union sector has welcomed these conditions. I will be tabling later in this session a private member's bill to propose such a product.

         The final issue I want to talk about is the ATO mechanism, as it is still failing to provide what we believe would be a fair deal for low income earners. First, the earnings will be restricted to government and other trust account investments. In the long-term, this will reduce earnings by about one to two per cent in real terms. Second, the full running costs of the reserve will be deducted from earnings.

         In my view, this is unfair. Low income earners get little benefit from superannuation concessions. Of the $6 billion of super concessions, over a third flow to the six per cent of people earning $50,000 or more per year, while the 22 per cent earning $20,000 or less get just 3.3 per cent of that tax benefit. Surely the government could find $7 million in this massively regressive super system to help the lowest paid even up the score a little. Its failure to do so shows that it and the ACTU are just not interested in low income earners and the battlers.

         Third, the government intends taxing contributions and earnings at the full 15 per cent, yet private super funds, due to imputation credits, can get away with a tax rate of 10.5 per cent. So high income earners will be lower taxed on their higher super earnings than low income earners. The government has been very clever here. It ensures that it gets its running costs paid before tax, and then it taxes what is left. The ATO is guaranteed a good stream of money. The Democrats would prefer to see the tax rate set at the tax rate prevailing for private super funds, which is currently about 15 per cent.

The government assures us that the industry funds are the most advanced on the transfer protocol, but this only covers inactive accounts. It is totally silent on active accounts, which is the area that the ATO is supposed to fix.

         —The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) basically works on the adjustment of the Commonwealth super scheme for its own employees, the old Commonwealth superannuation scheme, and the newer public sector superannuation scheme. As far as I can make out, the changes are simply part of the ongoing adjustment of superannuation which is required under law for schemes to maintain their position under changing legal regimes. It also seeks to make the position of part-time workers more explicit, although it does so by regulation rather than through legislation. There are a number of other minor technical changes, including the elimination of sexist language.

         We do not see any problems with this bill, which is mainly technical change and correction at this time. We do, however, have problems in relation to the future of superannuation. The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill is a further substantive change to the super scheme. It is designed to address the problems that have been created for part-time and casual workers by compulsory employer superannuation. The problem is that when these workers have small sums paid into numerous different funds the money simply disappears, eaten up by charges. Obviously, in such a circumstance these workers get nothing from such measures. It would be better for them to get wages which are traded off against punitive gains such as super contributions.

         The Greens (WA) basically support the scheme. We do not believe anyone could fail to support the principle of a scheme that tries to ensure that there are at least no losses from superannuation payments, especially for the poorest workers. We do feel, however, there is still progress to be made on the issue, but this is a corrective step. Whether it is a step in the right direction raises the whole issue of the relative merits of national savings schemes, private superannuation or simply paying workers and letting them deal with their own situation. But within the superannuation environment this measure at least is progress.

         The essence of the scheme is that the employer super contribution will be made into an eligible fund nominated by the employer. If it is currently being funded into a fund which is not an eligible fund, the non-eligible fund must transfer the account to an eligible fund without charging exit fees. When casual workers have an amount of money under $1,000 in an eligible fund and are employed by a new employer, they must state there is money in their fund and have it transferred again without exit fees to the funds into which contributions are currently being paid. I am not sure what happens if a worker has more than one job and is getting money paid into two funds simultaneously. Perhaps the minister can expand on that. An alternative is that the employer can nominate to put funds into the Australian Taxation Office fund that will be set up. This will hold super contributions until they reach $1,200, at which time it is intended they may be transferred to an eligible fund.

         What do these funds do? They offer protection from having the contributions eaten away. Fifteen per cent of the contributions are taken in tax in any case. Funds and the tax office will pay interest if any money is left after fees are taken out. Both eligible funds and the tax office will not be able to charge fees in excess of the interest earned. The impact is likely to be that no benefit actually accrues, no money is made—the money just sits there. This is better than having it disappear but not a lot better. It is certainly not as good as having the money where it can be used or where it might generate enough interest to keep up with inflation.

         Some people have mentioned that the Australian tax office is more likely to generate some real return than superannuation funds. Whether or not that is true, one advantage of many private funds is that they offer life and disability insurance to their members. So there are some real advantages in being in some private super funds even where no interest is made on money.

         However, the Greens (WA) have a few major points to make about the Australian tax office reserve scheme. The first is that while, initially, the scheme will invest money effectively in only government bonds there is the possibility that, through the financial management and accountability measures, investments may be made elsewhere with the potential that the money could be used more explicitly to pursue government programs, even though bonds are essentially used in this way. The measure then makes it possible to create a pool of funds for government purposes outside the normal budgetary process of appropriations. Perhaps the government would like to respond as to whether that is ever likely to be the case.

         A second aspect is that there is the possibility that this bill, in establishing mechanisms for the Australian Taxation Office to deal directly with superannuation funds, may be used to facilitate the budget superannuation scheme of employee and government contributions. We are assured that Treasury and the Australian tax office would prefer not to have to deal with superannuation. The government has rejected notional savings, or superannuation schemes, in favour of private sector superannuation in spite of the plethora of regulations that are required to protect people required by law to be involved in superannuation as a savings and investment vehicle. I am still concerned that while the opportunities are there they may be acted upon. I do not feel we have enough time to ensure that this is not an implication of this bill.

         The government may think that a small party such as ours has many teams and that we can operate on each bill for months at a time. That is not the case. An amendment was circulated by Senator Watson today and I asked if it was possible for us to have the time to deal with that amendment—for the chamber to go on to the next second reading debate in order for us to be able to deal with that amendment and to assess its implications. The government said, `No, it's been around for a long time.'

         Even though we have not seen the amendment before, there was an amendment in the lower house. We are not in the lower house, and we do not get presented with copies of lower house amendments. Therefore, I find it a bit rich for the government to say, `You should've known it was in the lower house. Therefore, you should know everything about each bill before it comes even if it is not circulated to the Senate.' In terms of process, I think the public would be very disappointed to know that this is what the government thinks is the proper way to deal with legislation which is going to affect their future. This is what the government thinks is a good and proper way to deal with legislation.

         In spite of the obvious benefits of the act for people in broken unemployment, or underemployment, there are attractions in the opposition's amendments. I will say, however, that they would have been much more attractive if the sunset clause had been only for the Australian tax office's involvement rather than for the entire bill. As it is, a sunset clause on the act would probably on balance do more damage than good. I will be happy to hear the arguments presented by Senator Watson when that time comes around.

There will need to be some legislative mechanism, and perhaps the government could tell us when that might be.

         —I rise to speak reasonably briefly on these superannuation bills before the Senate today. I particularly want to speak in relation to the bill which deals with the small amounts problem and the government's attempt to solve that problem. The superannuation committee, which I have been a member of almost since my time of coming into this Senate three years ago, has been made aware of the problem of small amounts for a very long time. It seems as though the government itself has taken a long time to address that problem, which we know has been around for a long time.

         It is fair to say also that the work of that committee under the chairmanship of Senator Watson, who has been on the committee since its inception—and I know that Senator Sherry was the initial chairman of that committee—has been recognised for a long time. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill on that committee in making sure that, when we report, the recommendations we put forward are in the best interests of all Australians, particularly in the area of superannuation. That area is an ongoing problem throughout the community, particularly in relation to the community's awareness, understanding and education. Certainly in that area there is a lot more work to be done.

         I also come to the committee having spent seven years prior to my entry into this place working in the superannuation industry. Even before I came to this place I was made acutely aware, because I was dealing with some of the clients involved, of the problem that fees and charges were having on small amounts and the abundance of small amounts that each member had purely because of the direction of where their superannuation contributions had to go. Over a long period of time now we have had a vast array of submissions about the problems of small amounts. The government has been rather tardy in at least helping to solve those problems that exist.

         The need for addressing the small amounts problem is exacerbated by the government's overall attitude and philosophy towards the universality of coverage for superannuation. I know that in the eyes of most of the population there is a need for a universality of coverage. But it is taking it too far when that goes down to a contribution being made on the first dollar earned, particularly when at the end of the day the people who are having these very small amounts contributed on their behalf will receive little or no benefit when it comes to their retirement and any income that they may receive in retirement. Throughout my period in the superannuation industry that was one of the areas of concern that was always raised by people who were compelled to pay small amounts into funds which, at that stage, were charging quite outrageous fees and charges. I am the first to admit that.

         This issue also brings us to the debate regarding the threshold, which is part of the problem with small amounts. We have had hundreds of submissions presenting various points of view to the committee. There has been a wide range of submissions from Eva Cox of the women's economic think-tank, who could hardly be called an economic rationalist, to other employers who have put the same point of view suggesting that the threshold should be raised so that people at the end of day are likely to be able to provide in some way towards their own retirement—although we know that many people will be on a public and part private stream for a long time in the future. We get a broad range of advice that we should be looking at increasing the threshold. That is one area the government has failed to address and should address.

         In the 15th report of the Senate select committee one of the first elements in the proposal to alleviate the small amounts problem is for consideration to be given to changing the SGC threshold from $450 a month to a quarterly amount. This would mean that people in seasonal work may be able to avoid the problems being caused by having very small amounts put into a vast array of accounts from a variety of employers. I am doubtful whether the legislation put forward today will overcome that in any way.

         The other major issue I want to address which would alleviate many of the problems associated with small accounts is the adoption of member choice. If we could have member choice of funds it would mean that those people who have several employers could be sure that all of the contributions for the work that they do could be directed towards the one fund. If that were the case, it would eliminate a number of the small accounts. In these days of modern technology, with computerisation, where we can do a range of other things by transferring money electronically into a variety of accounts, if our money can be put into our bank accounts at the end of the month electronically, I am sure there is a possibility the same thing can be done with superannuation contributions.

         If we can introduce member choice of funds, which is another issue that this government has not addressed, it would eliminate the need for so many small accounts being placed in another facility—whether it be the tax office, small superannuation accounts, credit unions or any other organisations. We had submissions that Australia Post now has the facility to handle small amounts and superannuation accounts. It was very enlightening evidence.

         Once member choice is introduced—as I have said, it can only get easier in the future with the use of technology—then the problems confronting those people who have a variety of casual jobs and a variety of employers who currently insist that the contributions go into a range of different funds, each with small amounts, could be overcome. Once again, a number of those employees who have small accounts would find that they have much larger accounts which would be manageable by some of the industry funds.

         The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations believes that consumer choice should be at the heart of the government's superannuation policy. Allowing small amounts to be placed only with the tax office is hardly allowing consumer choice. A lack of choice is identified by the Federation of Consumer Organisations as the contributing factor to the small amounts problem. Being able to choose a fund that best suits an employee's needs and having the option of amalgamating multiple accounts would result in a single account that they could carry with them throughout their working career.

         I am quite sure that, if we get to the stage where the government adopts as part of its policy the situation where members own their own account, can watch their own account and have only one fund to check at any one time, then this government would be getting to the stage where the small amounts problem and all of the associated worries would be alleviated far more than facilitating payments being made to the tax office. Quite frankly, a lot of people in the community do not agree that the tax office is the best place for their money to be put. People are somewhat suspicious of the tax office. I guess that is just a natural happening amongst members of our community. Given a choice between the tax office, a credit union or a small savings superannuation account, I am sure that many people would choose not to use the tax office.

         However, that is the way the government has chosen to go in this particular legislation. As an opposition, we agree that we will support that move purely because, if we do not address the problem of small amonts right now and we do not have a facility for the payment of money, the general public and those who are involved in superannuation at what I would call the fringe level—that is, those with very small amounts—are going to become more disenchanted with superannuation than they are at present. When we see what has happened with investments, with the performance and erosion of funds due to fees and charges, there certainly is in the community a lack of confidence as to whether superannuation is ever going to provide people with benefits in their retirement.

         The important thing that we have to try to convince the community of is that we are talking about a retirement incomes policy; we are not talking about a superannuation policy. A retirement incomes policy is the only thing that we really ought to be concentrating on. As I said, we will be supporting the government's move to use the tax office, although somewhat reluctantly. I think there are other ways of addressing the problem. People should have a choice between using the tax office and using another vehicle. But the problem has to be addressed today or as soon as possible so that we can help put some confidence back into the superannuation system.

The measures before us do effectively deal with this problem. They include: member protection of smaller superannuation accounts; reducing the number of multiple accounts; the superannuation holding accounts reserve, which is established by two of the three bills we are considering today; and a range of other initiatives, including measures contained in the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill.

         —Margetts, sorry. I will deal with Senator Woodley first. The government will not tax the amounts in the superannuation holding accounts reserve. When transferred to a super fund, it becomes a taxable contribution of that fund and is taxed at the fund's rate, normally 15 per cent, less the imputation credits.

         We, like Senator Watson, do welcome the industry's initiatives in setting up the transfer protocol. The government agrees to report to the parliament on industry progress with the transfer protocol by the last day in September 1996.

         In respect of the sunset clause that Senator Watson raised, the government wants funds to do the right thing and to member protect. But we do need the superannuation holding accounts reserve to ensure a complete solution to the small amounts problem. For that albeit diminishing problem—we expect it will be less and less of a problem over time—we need the continuance of that holding accounts reserve beyond two years. To simply have a sunset clause to abolish the holding accounts reserve at the end of two years without knowing what would replace it, would remove one of the effective parts of the package we are presenting to the chamber today.

         What would become of moneys in those accounts? We do not know. What would happen to this holding accounts reserve? Would it be subcontracted to someone in the private sector? We do not believe an appropriate way to deal with the holding accounts reserve is to simply have it guillotined out of existence at the end of two years. That is not a responsible way to deal with moneys that are in that holding accounts reserve.

         Another issue raised is that of a person who has two jobs—part time, casual or full time—and is in two funds. If you hold two jobs, you will have moneys contributed to two funds, although there are some exceptions. For example, in the hospitality industry—and I was a trustee of the hospitality industry fund—you could work at a hotel and a restaurant in the same city, and so have two employers but, because the fund covers the hospitality industry, it is highly likely that you have moneys going from two employers into the one fund. You would more than likely be charged only one administration charge in those circumstances by the fund, but there are some exceptions. So just because you have two different jobs, particularly in the same industry, does not mean that you are in two different funds.

         —I am just about to get to that. Let us assume that you are in two, three or four different funds—and that is possible, particularly if you are a part-time or casual employee. If you have moneys going into different funds, by the nature of your employment it is likely that you move from job to job. Casual and part-time employment tends to be more transient than full-time. When you leave a job, you are able to transfer the money over from that fund or those two or three funds and consolidate it.

         I think one of the unfortunate things is that a lot of people are not aware of their ability to transfer and consolidate their money on leaving a job. The consolidation issue and protection of small amounts in those circumstances, if a person does not consolidate through lack of awareness of consolidation, is dealt with by the member protection of small superannuation accounts. We have recognised that particular problem.

         The general issue of small amounts will become less of a problem over time. Most funds charge a flat fee, which is usually between 60c and a dollar a week. That fee does not increase as the contributions increase. At the moment employer contributions are either four or five per cent, depending on the employer's payroll; that rises to nine per cent under the superannuation guarantee. With the recent announcements in the budget, there will be a further six per cent, taking the contributions going into the fund or funds to a total of 15 per cent.

         The administration charge does not rise as the contributions rise. So the administration charge as a proportion of contributions—anywhere between 50c and a dollar a week—will decline over time, and the problem of small amounts will decline over time. But there will still be a problem with small amounts, albeit less of a problem over time. That is what this package of measures is designed to deal with.

         Senator Margetts has also raised the issue of investment. We have indicated that the moneys will be invested in government bonds—securities of that nature. This government has no intention of investing the moneys in broader forms of investment—that is, in what may concern you as being of a more speculative nature. If it did, I am advised that the Senate could disallow any attempt to do so. We would obviously debate that issue, but the Senate would have the power to disallow any broader form of investment through regulation in this place.

         —I want to raise an issue that I raised at one of the committee hearings with the tax office. I am not sure what part of the bill will overcome the problem that I want to address. The situation is that a casual employee has three or four employers, and the amounts that are due to be paid into superannuation are so small that he chooses to pay them into the holding account at the tax office. Over a period of time, the amount from those four different employers builds up to $1,200. He can either leave it there, attracting no interest, or he can take that $1,200 out and put it into one of the four funds that he would have a choice of because the amount is up to $1,200. He would then have to proceed with the remaining three employers to start all over again with the tax office until he builds another amount up to $1,200. Can you clarify that position? Am I presenting it incorrectly?

         —With the moneys going into the holding account, there are no charges up to $1,200. If the tax office notifies the individual that there is now $1,200 in his account, the individual can choose any one of a number of funds to put the money into, provided he is legally able to access that fund. It could be that he transfers the $1,200 over to one of the three or four industry funds he can access. I think, in those circumstances, it is likely that the employee would go to the two, three or four employers—if he is still employed by them—and ask them to pay the money into the fund that he has directed the money should go to. I am also advised that, under the transfer protocol, if the employee decides it should go into X fund, any further moneys going into the superannuation holding account from the employers will automatically flow over. It will not be held in the holding reserve account.

         —In a sense my colleague Senator Ferguson is right. When you look at the legislation in relation to the holding accounts reserve plus the protocol you find that there is choice as to which fund the person who has the entitlements can put those funds into. However, if subsequently that person works in an industry that has an industry fund, under the arrangements at the present time, those funds do not go into the reserve account they go into the particular industry fund. In a very limited and narrow sense, where moneys are taken out of that holding account the person who is entitled to those moneys does have the choice to decide where to put them. I seek leave to move together opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2 to the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill 1995. These amendments were moved by my colleague David Connolly in the House of Representatives.

         I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to David Connolly. He initiated these amendments and has responsibility for this area on behalf of the opposition. David has indicated that he will be bowing out of the responsibility for superannuation by the end of June approximately. I must say that David has made a significant contribution over the years, as far as the opposition is concerned, to the whole question of retirement incomes policy and superannuation in particular. I think it is regrettable that, arising from the preselection process, quite eminent people from time to time either get dumped or get put in positions where they cannot necessarily win. Nevertheless, we all have fighting qualities and those of us who believe we have a chance obviously will be working to that end.

         In David's position, those in the Liberal Party preselection process in Bradfield have decided to seek a change. Certainly from the retirement incomes point of view I regret that David will no longer be with us after the next election. I have always found him a most congenial companion in terms of discussing superannuation issues. I always appreciate his contribution. I speak on behalf of a wide sector of the industry when I say that it has the highest regard for what David has done and what he is doing. I look forward to David's views on the opposition's policy that he is now finalising. I wish him well in that process. We will certainly miss him. As his representative in the Senate, I have moved on his behalf the two amendments that he initiated in the House of Representatives.

         It seems to us that that is really quite a foolish proposal, so we cannot support it. That is one reason. I also gave other reasons. Since everyone is giving indications about who might or might not succeed at the next election and be preselected, might I say that at least the Liberal Party in Tasmania has shown a little more commonsense in preserving the preselection of our current chairman. His wisdom and contribution in this place is very much appreciated by the Democrats.

I am sure that, once there is an element of choice, once people start getting their Australian Taxation Office letters to say that they have $1,200 and where they are going to put it, they are going to be asking a lot more questions of their superannuation funds such as: where does my money go?

Yes, I understand that many people have their pays paid into a bank account so there might not be a huge difference, but I am trying to work out whether or not all that has been thought out. I am not fully assured. The answers I am getting back from the minister are more like, `We think this is how it will work' or `It should work in this way.' I think it is going to be extremely confusing. I am wondering how any particular problems with small business might be dealt with as they occur or as they come up as soon as it starts to operate the system.

         The purpose of the bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where noise amelioration programs are being funded by the Federal Government.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable Senators will be aware that construction of a new parallel runway at Sydney Airport was completed during 1994 and the runway came into operation in November 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the recently installed air traffic control system is operating at full capacity, the traffic handling capacity of the new runway configuration will be about 80 aircraft movements per hour compared with 55 movements per hour prior to the commissioning of the new runway.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the operation of the new parallel runway configuration significantly reduces the overall number of people seriously affected by aircraft noise, particularly those to the east and west of the Airport, it significantly increases the level of noise exposure for residents of some other areas mainly to the north of the airport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recognising that this would be the case, the Government in 1991 commissioned a Steering Committee, convened by the Federal Airports Corporation, to prepare a Noise Management Plan for Sydney Airport identifying possible measures to mitigate the noise impact of the new runway operation. A Draft Noise Management Plan was subsequently developed with extensive involvement by the three levels of government, the community and the airline industry. The Draft Plan was released for public comment in June 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        After considering measures proposed in the Draft Noise Management Plan, the Government announced late last year that it would undertake a major program of acquisition and acoustic insulation of certain buildings in the areas worst affected by noise from the operation of the Airport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the Government has initiated a range of other measures, including mandatory flightpaths, take-off procedures for jet aircraft and tighter curfew arrangements to minimise the number of people affected by aircraft noise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The acquisition and insulation program encompasses voluntary acquisition of up to 113 residential properties within the 40 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) zone;  sound insulation of some 4,200 residential properties within the 30 ANEF zone;  and sound insulation of schools and colleges, child care facilities, hospitals and health care facilities and churches within the 25 ANEF zone.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The scope of eligibility for this program is at least equal to that of any major overseas airport where a noise amelioration program is in place.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is the Government's intention that the announced program be completed within a three year period. This again compares favourably with the rate of implementation of overseas programs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Based on indicative cost data developed in conjunction with the Draft Noise Management Plan, the cost of the program was originally estimated at some $183 million. Following a re-assessment of eligible buildings and the scope and cost of required works, the estimated overall cost of the program is now $260 million (in 1995-96 prices).
       </para>

        The airlines and their passengers will be the beneficiaries of the increased runway capacity created at Sydney Airport.
       </para>

        The levy will apply in the first instance to Sydney Airport only. This recognises the very significant change in noise patterns around the airport which results from the opening of the new runway.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government would similarly expect that, where new runway developments or extensions enabling a significant change in either the number or type of jet aircraft usage occur at other major airports, the need for a noise amelioration program will also arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable Senators will be aware that the Government has embarked on a program of leasing Federal airports. As part of the next stage of the disposal process, the Government will examine how best to ensure responsible environmental behaviour by users and operators of leased airports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Prospective airport operators will clearly have an interest in the development of environmental management measures, including noise amelioration, which may be warranted by significant runway works and changes in operations at the airports they will be leasing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These issues will therefore be addressed in the context of the airport leasing program which will see the first of our major Federal airports leased in 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Turning to the levy itself, the amount of levy payable per jet aircraft landing will be determined according to a formula developed as part of the Sydney Airport Draft Noise Management Plan.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The formula provides that the noisier an aircraft the higher will be the rate of levy payable per landing. For example, the amount of levy payable for a landing by a B747 will be some three to four times higher than for a B737 depending on the specific noise characteristics of the particular aircraft.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides for the levy to apply to landings by jet aircraft only. This reflects the fact that generally jet aircraft create greater noise disturbance than propeller driven aircraft. There will be some quieter small jet aircraft which are not liable for the levy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is a requirement of the bill that revenue from the levy at a particular declared airport not exceed the cost of the noise amelioration program at that airport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To spread the cost impact on airlines, it is not envisaged that the levy will necessarily be raised at a rate which keeps pace with spending on a noise amelioration program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The levy rate will be prescribed by regulation subject to the limitations established in the bill. It is proposed that there will be automatic annual adjustments of the levy rates in line with Consumer Price Index movements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The rate will also be periodically reviewed in the light of other parameters such as growth rates in jet aircraft landings and the costs of noise amelioration programs that might be established at any other airports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is the Government's intention that the rate of levy be initially set at an amount of $155 per noise unit. This rate will be adjusted as necessary so as to enable the cost of the Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration Program to be recovered over a period of up to ten years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1995/96, it is expected that the levy will raise some $32.2 million. This translates to an average cost per jet aircraft passenger landing at Sydney Airport of around $3.40.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, this is a landmark bill. It establishes a regime for recovering from aviation operators the costs of redressing the adverse impact of aircraft noise imposed on communities in the vicinity of airports—immediately in the case of Sydney Airport and at other Australian airports in future years.

         —I rise on behalf of the coalition to speak on the Loan Bill 1995. The coalition supports this bill. I wish to take the opportunity to point out a few facts to the Senate and to the Australian community about why the government is providing the means for additional borrowings. The bill makes provision for financing the budget deficit. This does not limit parliament's prerogative to make appropriations of public moneys; it is merely a means of authorising borrowings and making it the normal procedure for financing deficits and the consolidated revenue fund.

         This government has built up quite substantial debts over the last several years by running budget deficits. I have here a table of Commonwealth government own debts for the last four years. It shows that at 30 June 1991, the government's Commonwealth own debt was $32.8 billion—nearly $33 billion. The estimate by Treasury for 30 June, the end of this month, is $95.4 billion. So, while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been in charge of the government, the Commonwealth has made a massive increase in debt—from approximately $33 billion to $95 billion over just four years. This bill authorises the government to go ahead and borrow further for the next financial year. Why does it need further borrowings? Because it is running a budget deficit again.

         There is no doubt at all that this government has been very slack with regard to its running of the economy, the budget which has just been announced and is currently going through the parliament, and the last budget of the current financial year.

         It is just extraordinary that here we have an economy which is sucking in every month imports worth $2 billion or more and yet the government continues to go on borrowing, taking further resources out of the private sector. In this current budget we are increasing taxes by a massive amount—nearly 13 per cent. We are increasing spending by a similar amount. The government, instead of cutting spending and staying within its income, continues to want further borrowings. That is what this bill is all about.

         As I said before, the total Commonwealth debt at present is an estimated $95 billion. It will increase further in the next financial year. The interest payments on that debt are rising steadily. Last year they were $7.2 billion. The estimate for the next financial year is $9.4 billion. That massive sum of interest on borrowings is nearly equal to the total defence budget and only slightly less than the total education budget expenditure. So we have payments on debt by the Commonwealth of nearly a massive $10 billion per annum.

         The government should be running surpluses. We have known for years that we need to increase savings within the economy. We have known for years that we are basically building up to a current account deficit problem. What has the government done? There has been more taxing, more spending and further deficits. This government should be condemned. It has no concern about the longer term environment for investment, jobs growth and economic growth for this economy. I take this opportunity to condemn the government for the way it is handling the economy.

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has now become one of Australia's highest taxing prime ministers. He holds the undisputed record as the Prime Minister who has broken more promises than any other Prime Minister in our history. Some record! This Prime Minister simply cannot be trusted in anything that he says. His record, particularly in the field of taxation, bears eloquent testimony to that.

It contains the seeds of inflationary pressures and of interest rate rises.

         This is the budget of a deceitful and incompetent government of economic failure and broken promises. The budget itself is built on very dubious forecasts. In particular, the forecasts for the growth in the national product of 3 3/4per cent during 1995-96 is a figure that must be taken with an increasingly large grain of salt. There is clear evidence, in talking with businesses and business associations and their members, that the business climate appears to have weakened sharply in recent weeks. The 3 3/4per cent forecast could well prove to be optimistic, and the implications of that for jobs is of great concern. Even at a growth of 3 3/4per cent next year, an insufficient number of jobs would be created to meet the growth in the available work force.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that the Prime Minister, at the time of his One Nation statement, said that Australia needed 4 1/2 per cent annual growth to provide the necessary number of jobs to at least start to make a hole in the unemployment figures and to provide the necessary jobs for those coming newly into the work force. In the Treasury estimates the other day, the Treasury officers started to walk away from that commitment. They now seem to be saying that we can possibly get the necessary job growth to achieve a sustainable reduction in the level of unemployment with a figure perhaps of the order of 3 3/4 per cent—that is the one forecast in the budget. But the Treasury officers produced no hard evidence or data at all to support that backflip. It would be a major backflip from the Prime Minister's earlier One Nation statement if the government were to start down that tack.

Technically, the government says that they have been deferred and are going to be switched into a contribution towards superannuation for employees. But even if we accept that as a proposition, those tax cuts have been deferred for up to 45 years or more—up to 45 years or more—by the introduction of a compulsory employee superannuation levy to be matched in a few years time by government contributions.

It has cooked the books in various ways. The most important way in which it has done that is by including $5.3 billion—that is, $5,300 million—of once only asset sales.

According to the then finance minister, Mr Willis, a couple of years ago when the government sold off its second tranche of 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, the government had given a cast-iron guarantee that it would under no circumstances whatsoever contemplate selling off any of the remaining 50 per cent. Yet in this budget it has announced that it will sell off the whole of the remaining 50 per cent. It is doing that simply because it is desperate to find some cash to fill that gaping hole in its accounts. It has also been forced—the coalition does not object to this; indeed, we told the government a year ago that it would probably need to do this—to increase the foreign ownership provisions of Qantas in advance of the forthcoming Qantas float to try again in a desperate bid to get more money into its coffers.

The real outcome is a budget deficit is $8.3 billion. It is not a surplus of $718 million, as the government portrayed on budget night. That $718 million surplus is a figure that has been struck after adjustments from accounting tricks and fiddles; the proceeds of asset sales; and, as I said, the cancelling of the significant $4 billion to $5 billion tax cut that the government promised that Australian taxpayers would receive from 1 January next year.

         This is one of the highest taxing budgets that we have seen in our history. The real growth in revenue in 1995-96, as shown in the budget, is going to be 7.9 per cent. That follows growth in the year just being completed of 8.9 per cent. When you take account of inflation, the actual increases each year were several percentage points more than that. If we put together the figures for this year that has just been completed and the year we are just about to start, which the budget is all about, we have the highest growth in two consecutive years in government revenue—the government tax take—since the infamous Whitlam budgets of 1973 and 1974 which absolutely wrecked the Australian economy.

Personal income tax is set to rise by 13 1/2 per cent. Indirect taxes are going to go up by about 15 per cent. This budget, which will have an effect over the next four years, increases taxes by $17,000 million. Compare that with the Prime Minister's promise at the last election of $14 billion of tax cuts over four years. What he is going to deliver over that same period is tax rises of $18 billion.

         Mr Keating now has the uncontested title of the Prince of Broken Promises. I have already outlined some of these broken promises. He also promised before the last election not to put up tax as a proportion of national income. First of all, he said he was not going to put up tax at all and then he hedged his bets and said, `I really mean I won't put it up as a proportion of our total annual national income.' That is another broken promise. In the year in which he made that promise, tax revenue equalled 22.1 per cent of GDP; for the year ahead, the tax revenue is forecast to equal 24.2 per cent of GDP. So an extra 2.1 per cent of GDP is going to go in taxes and that, when translated into cold hard dollars, is more than $10,000 million of additional tax for that reason alone.

That was in the 1993 budget with effect over a couple of years, the next effect being from 1 July this year. We have seen the sales tax on cars go up in this budget from 15 or 16 per cent to 21 per cent, which is an increase of five per cent in the tax rate and an increase of 30 per cent in the amount taken in sales tax. We have seen certain building materials subject for the first time to a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax. Indeed, sales tax by the end of the coming financial year will have increased by 52 per cent since 1993 and, even after taking out inflation, it will have increased by 43.9 per cent—an absolutely staggering increase.

As the owners and shareholders of the wealth of our nation, the Australian public deserves a clear and unambiguous report of the nation's condition.

It is possible, I suppose, that the backroom staff of the Prime Minister's office may be better at predicting the future economic performance of Australia than the 500 staff of Treasury. It may even be possible that these same staff from the Prime Minister's office have superior economic skills to those of the entire private sector, such is the science of economic forecasting.

For the first three-quarters of this financial year, the income payable by Australia on foreign investments has totalled $16.9 billion. This is a disturbing and negligent situation to be in. A debt of this proportion is no gift to our future generations.

At present, on a trade weighted index, our currency hovers with a nervous pulse just above its lowest level ever.

         —The purpose of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is to amend the First Home Owners Act 1983 and other related legislation and the Housing Assistance Act of 1989. The decision to terminate the first home owners scheme was the result of a 1990 Hawke Labor government budget decision. As part of the winding down of the scheme, the bill removes the requirement in the First Home Owners Act of 1983 to report to parliament beyond the 1994-95 annual report. The bill also incorporates equivalent amendments to earlier first home ownership

         The first home owners scheme commenced on 1 October 1983 and provided assistance in the form of a subsidy towards mortgage repayments to those on low to moderate incomes to enable them to buy or build their first home. The coalition parties will not be opposing the bill as we have consistently believed the principle behind the devolution of the first home owners scheme to the states is correct and that these amendments are only to finalise a process begun by the First Home Owners Amendment Act 1990 which we did not oppose at that time.

         I will now turn my comments to reflect on the position of home ownership. I think it is important to note that home ownership dominates Australia's housing picture. It is well documented that 96 per cent of Australians aspire to be home owners, and there is evidence that around 70 per cent of Australia's population either own a home or are in the process of purchasing one. Therefore, this preference for home ownership by an overwhelming majority of Australians does play an important role in making housing affordable during the course of their lives. All governments must take this preference seriously when framing overall housing policies.

         Home ownership provides financial security for home owners and families and security of tenure. Home ownership also encourages savings and independence and instils a sense of pride and achievement. It is, of course, particularly relevant to people at the point where they retire or change their circumstances at a mature age.

         The main issue affecting home buyers, particularly the first home buyer, remains affordability. Affordability depends largely on interest rates, real incomes and house prices. Changes in these factors, any one of them, affect the borrowing and purchasing power of potential home buyers. Increasing the level of home purchase amongst low income earners would reduce the demand for public housing and the associated costs on government revenue.

         If we look for a moment at the Labor Party's economic environment and housing policy issues, there are a lot of issues that we need to address. We have now seen more than a decade of economic instability and volatility. We have seen a period of interest rate uncertainty and constant speculation. We have seen a sharp decline in housing finance commitments and building approvals. Building industry activity certainly is slowing, and this has become very obvious in recent time. As builders naturally rationalise their businesses, there are consequential job losses.

         In this decade of Labor we have also seen very inconsistent strategies on high deficits.

         Of course, probably one of the major recent factors that are in the minds of many people is that Labor's budget of several weeks ago imposed a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on certain building materials, higher sales taxes on vehicles, and higher company taxes—a double whammy, with accelerated payment schedules which may force smaller companies to lift prices further. We have also seen the announcement in the last week or so of significant changes in the area of termite control for housing activity. This will have consequential effects by again forcing up prices and housing. In the community there is a mistrust of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and his ministers on issues that relate to home purchase and the consequences that flow through to other families in the community who must rent their homes.

         Amidst this environment of instability and volatility, Australians want to, and must, embark on the road of home purchase. First home buyers in the 1990s face many crucial decisions to enable them to achieve home purchase. They are more than likely to be two-income households. The female participation and spouse employment issues have now become profound in the community. Today Australian families will be prepared to delay having children. They will be prepared to buy in the outer suburbs, where housing is more than likely to be affordable. They will trade the distance to work and home size to achieve home ownership. And many Australians acknowledge there will be a limited cash flow for recreation and leisure as a result of their decisions to be involved in home purchase.

        Home buyers in the lowest 40 per cent of income distribution are paying between 16 and 37 per cent of their gross incomes on housing, with many people paying over 30 per cent.

When did the housing minister make a statement on the decline of housing affordability and/or home ownership? His department and a number of agencies have done a lot of work in addressing a lot of reports, but not one bit of it has ended up on the action table of the minister or in the budget statements of the government. There is a plethora of reports. Mr Howe has buried himself in this plethora of reports, strategies, visions, inquiries, agendas and reviews. The lucrative growth industry in construction and housing these days is not in building activity but in the work of consultants under the housing minister, Mr Howe.

We will provide alternative options for those who choose not to own or whose circumstances prevent them from owning their own home.

         The purpose of this bill is to make minor administrative amendments to two acts—or, to be more accurate, to one act and a bracket of acts. The first act to be amended is the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The second is the First Home Owners Act 1983 and other legislation related to its purpose, namely, the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982, the Home Savings Grant Act 1964 and the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976.

         The amendments to the Housing Assistance Act 1989 extend a waiver, which was legislated last year, to allow the Commonwealth to provide the maximum level of financial assistance for housing it has set aside for a particular state without that state having to match the contribution, as is required under the act. The background to this is that the Commonwealth provides untied financial assistance to the states under the Housing Assistance Act to deliver housing assistance, predominantly for building or purchase of public rental housing stock but also for home purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The current agreement is at schedule 1 of the existing act; the agreement is currently up for renegotiation.

         Difficulties with matching have apparently arisen in recent years for states as a result of a number of factors, including that great euphemism `changed market conditions', which is code for messing up their schemes. New South Wales is the best example. The affected states just have to say that they have been unable to provide additional grant funding to meet their matching obligations.

         Prior to the amendments made to the act last year, the Commonwealth was required to recover financial assistance provided in earlier years from states which did not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance schemes. Similarly, where some states indicated that they were unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements, the act, prior to amendment, required that the minister not provide unmatched funds, reducing untied grants to the level that would therefore be matched.

         The government says it considered that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided was undesirable. The Democrats would certainly agree. We believe that the level of funding, particularly for public housing, is already too low. To claw back or reduce funding would further disadvantage those very Australians most in need of assistance. In fact, due to funding cuts, public sector housing commencements have fallen by about 25 per cent over the past three years—and that number is still falling.

Over the same period public housing waiting lists have gone from 202,000 in 1990-91 to 216,000 in 1991-92 and to 232,000, nationally, as at 30 June 1993, the last available figure. We have to ask the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe): whose responsibility is this, minister? Yours? The states? Does it fall somewhere between the chairs? Surely it is about time somebody put up their hand and actually took responsibility.

         The government did not expect at the time of the previous amendments that states would continue to have problems matching. Apparently they still do. So the amendments outlined in this bill extend these matching/waiving provisions for what is expected to be the final, and seventh year, of the current agreement. To coin a phrase, it is a matter of not matching/waiving, and the question must be asked of the states: why are they not matching?

         When the government announced its decision to abolish the first home owners scheme the Democrats did not oppose it. We were, however, critical of the government's commitment to that scheme and to housing assistance in general. Nothing has changed to dispel that criticism. The cuts continue—cuts to public sector housing grants and now also to rent assistance. Those cuts are compounded by the continuing effects of financial deregulation, the result of which has been for the government to blithely allow the banks to keep their rates far higher than they should be; and at the same time to jack up fees on a whole range of different transactions and, for a whole range of reasons, on bank accounts of ordinary Australians. Your policies have literally given the banks a licence to print money—that is, profits—for themselves at the expense of Australian citizens generally.

         —These bills establish the basis for a national uniform heavy road vehicle registration charging scheme. The collection of charges under the scheme will contribute to recovery of the costs of wear caused by the operation of heavy vehicles. Amounts equivalent to the charges will be paid to the interstate road transport fund and distributed to the states and territories for the maintenance and upkeep of roads used by heavy vehicles. This is part of the reform processes developed by the National Road Transport Commission under the mandate of the Australian Transport Council, which is made up of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers.

         This is an example of pegged legislation, where the Commonwealth passes legislation to apply in its jurisdiction and the states and territories pass similar legislation in their jurisdictions. It used to be called mirror legislation. The charges which are the subject of this bill are due to take effect on 1 July 1995. Similar legislation has already been passed in relation to driver licensing and the carriage of dangerous goods. The legislation will have no budgetary impact. However, it will result in charges increasing in some jurisdictions and falling in others. The charges will be calculated on an annual basis. They are set out in the schedule, which may be amended annually, but with no greater increase or decrease than five per cent per annum.

         The heavy vehicles agreement of the ministerial council foreshadowed the development of a more refined charging method following these initial changes. The new charging approach has the support of industry peak bodies, such as the Road Transport Forum, which wants a simple, uniform one-off charging system. The National Road Transport Commission has issued a discussion paper outlining options for more refined processes. This paper will be the basis of industry consultation.

         All states except New South Wales and Western Australia have strongly supported the changes. The previous New South Wales government expressed concern about the financial impact of the changes because the new charges were substantially lower than the existing charges. The new New South Wales opposition believes the changes will be revenue neutral and should proceed. However, Bob Carr, following the very poor example of his close friend, Paul Keating, promised before the New South Wales election to implement these changes by 1 July 1995.

         However, in true form, after the election he attached a rider saying that this would all depend on whether the other states and territories were in a position to proceed. Western Australia was originally opposed, due to the cost impact on intrastate operators. However, it has modified its opposition and is examining options for discounting the increase for intrastate operators. However, it may not be ready to proceed by 1 July. Victoria, Queensland and the ACT expect to introduce new charges by 1 July. South Australia and Tasmania are committed, but will not pass legislation until July or August. The Northern Territory will enact but not implement until other states and territories have legislation in place.

         Generally, this is a non-controversial bill which is supported by the opposition as an important part of the micro-economic reform process of the road transport industry. It is important that interstate truckers do not have to go through a raft of bureaucratic mazes to comply with differing state and territory laws. However, it should be pointed out that Bob Carr's about-face will cause significant problems. At the annual conference of the New South Wales Livestock Transport Association a few weeks before the New South Wales election, the ALP transport spokesman, Brian Langton, was asked whether a Carr government would implement these uniform registration charges by 1 July 1995, and his answer was that it would. Bob Carr indeed put this promise in writing to the Australian road transport forum coordinator. Now the New South Wales government is saying it will only implement it when the other states and territories do likewise. All I can say is that that is par for the course.

         It should also be pointed out that the National Road Transport Commission has calculated that a user pays charge for heavy road transport vehicles equates to 18c a litre in fuel excise. At present road transport operators pay 32.5c a litre in fuel excise. There has been no attempt by the government to rebate the excess. The average semitrailer operators pay $66,400 a year in taxes and charges to the Commonwealth and the states. The 5c a litre increase in fuel excise in the 1993 budget increased this impost by $6,000 a year.

         The government is significantly decreasing the amount of money that it is spending on roads. In the 1992 budget prior to the last election, the government said it would spend some $1,600 million on roads. In this year's budget it says it will spend only $840 million. Compare this with 1982, under a coalition government, when $150 million was spent on roads, and fuel excise was 6c a litre. With those reservations, we support the bill.

I wish to comment only briefly that both this government and the state governments have given so much attention to road transport and so little attention to rail. I draw attention to the way in which, within a week of the budget being brought down, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced in South Australia $130 million for 8 1/2 kilometres of freeway down through the Adelaide Hills—which amount was not mentioned anywhere in the budget—despite the fact that the railway which runs down through the Adelaide Hills was last realigned back in 1927 and is in desperate need of realignment to improve rail transport through the hills.

         Moreover, in the south-east of South Australia, the 220 kilometres of line to Mount Gambier would cost only $8 million to standardise but, because it is broad gauge, it has been cut off entirely by the standardisation of the Adelaide to Melbourne line, leaving the people and all the industries of the south-east without rail transport. Despite very considerable efforts on my part in the lead-up to the budget to get $5 million from this federal government to standardise and upgrade that line, the money has not been forthcoming. Yet the Prime Minister could pork-barrel in South Australia to the tune of $130 million within a week of the budget—an amount which did not appear anywhere in the budget.

Perhaps I should put on record here that it will probably come out of the road funding budget for Western Australia, like the $8 million last year that was put into the Subiaco oval. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Human Services and Health and member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) opened it and were grandstanding and congratulating the government about how good that $8 million for the Subiaco oval was.

         I welcome the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill which will standardise interstate road transport for heavy vehicles, that is, anything over eight and a half tonnes, as I have had a bit to do with heavy road transport. These bills come forward at a rather unique time as only last week the first standard-gauge train went from Brisbane to Perth.

         The amendment bill takes away the option of using the actual distance and goes to a flat licence for interstate trucks. I believe that is the way to go. For a start, measuring devices break down; secondly, they can be tampered with. There are a couple of measures I question, though. I understand there are to be no instalments for the 12-month payment of around $4,200, I believe it is, for one prime mover and one trailer. I understand there is to be one payment only. I certainly hope, if it is to be paid in one instalment—and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) can advise me of this later—that at least it does not end up being due on a common date, say, 1 January or 1 July each year. One might say that anyone in transport who cannot afford the one-up payment should not be in transport but, if you have 50 or 60 vehicles, or even two vehicles, it is an imposition to have all the payments due on the same day of the year.

         As Senator Alston said, New South Wales was a proponent of the scheme in the first place, although it never came in. Before the election in his state Mr Carr said that New South Wales would come into the system, but he is now having second thoughts. Of course, his second thoughts are because of finances. He believes that he will lose $75 million from having these cost charges, for one prime mover with a trailer, come down to something like $4,200 from around $8,000. I am disappointed that he has done a backflip, especially since WA is now coming on board. I suppose that is what we can come to expect of Labor governments: the federal government has done this at times.

         Let us look at the present road transport costs. The National Road Transport Commission has calculated road transport costs at about 18c per litre of diesel fuel used. Yesterday it was mentioned several times that road transporters are paying 33c per litre for on-road use, so we do not know where 14c is going. In fact we do know where it is going; it is going into government coffers. But the road transport industry believes that amount should be returned to it.

         Of the 18c—that is, 33c that they are paying, less the 14c it is costing them—only 7c per litre is going towards roads. We believe there should be far more than that going towards the upkeep of Australia's roads, and that that is the reason various states have had to impose their own tax. Western Australia recently imposed 4c per litre, and I believe New South Wales the same amount, due to the lack of federal funding. So this is another tax from this high taxing regime.

         Transport has improved a lot in the last 10 or 15 years with the advent, in Western Australia especially, of road trains with a second or even third trailer in various operations. Contrary to what a lot of people believe, it helps the road system because, per thousand tonne carted along a road, using multiple trailers that are lighter than a prime mover, the wear and tear on a road per kilometre will be far less than with one standard prime mover and a trailer. I do not think anyone can argue that.

The same will happen with Victoria. Not long ago, Victoria would not allow B-doubles on its roads. They were something new. Anyone would think they had spiked wheels or ran over people at every intersection. I believe they were used as a non-tariff trade barrier. They will now be allowed because Victoria has passed the legislation—or is about to. If New South Wales comes into this system, it will also get into the 20th century. That will be a great improvement.

         I welcome the legislation because transport is of vital interest to Western Australia and the remote areas I represent, areas where roads are the only means of transport of goods or people, because we do not have the luxury of rail. As does Senator Coulter, I support rail—I have always supported it—but these days, unfortunately, it can be profitable only for carrying bulk goods. I welcome the legislation.

         Another concern about portfolio bills is well illustrated by the present situation and has given rise to this motion to divide the bill. It may be the case that proposed amendments to acts in themselves appear not to be controversial. However, on closer examination they may have unintended consequences or may unexpectedly affect other areas of principal acts.

         A responsible senator must, of course, obtain copies of all the principal acts covered by the legislation and read often obscure or unintelligible amendments against those acts. Doubts or queries that are raised on the run can be satisfied only on such examination. In the meantime, certain clear and worthy initiatives, which all members of the legislature are anxious to see implemented—there are some of those in this legislation—may be in danger of being held up. This factor may force passage despite proper doubts because we are often told, `This is an urgent bill. It has an early start up date'. We are virtually forced into a position of Hobson's choice.

         My final point relates to accessibility once the law is enacted. This is important for students and persons who are administering the law. It is all the more important for those persons who have to observe the law. We all know how tardy consolidations of acts are. They may be amended several times a year—sometimes only in small amendments but cumulatively representing major policy and administrative changes to various schemes. It may be that the only remedy for the problem I have indicated is that the legislature should revert to amendments of primary legislation by individual bills. I do not have a firm view on this and would welcome alternative suggestions to overcome these problems for legislators and the public alike.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         requesting the House

        to make an amendment whose effect is to increase an appropriation in the bill. The bill, containing many provisions with which the Senate may agree, is not given a third reading until the fate of the request has been determined by the House. Depending on the bill, accusations of Senate delay or obstruction are politically easier to make than if the bill had been, say, divided into two self-contained bills and it made clear that one of them was agreed to by the Senate:  it awaited only the House of Representatives to agree to the Senate's amendments creating that bill and it would be law, whatever the fate of its twin.

        Or take the case of a House of Representatives social security bill designed to deliver a mix of increased and decreased benefits. For both practical and political reasons, such bills are sometimes scheduled to arrive in the Senate late in a sittings with an administratively "irrevocable" commencement date usually coinciding with the end of the sittings. If the Senate makes, and then insists on or presses, amendments or requests disagreed to by the House of Representatives it may be claimed that passage of the whole measure is jeopardised, the Senate is denying recipients their new or increased benefits, and injustice and chaos will result. In the predictable game of bluff, government in its rhetoric will hold the Senate responsible for an outcome vastly more detrimental to all beneficiaries than the proposed Senate amendments might have been beneficial to some. Again, a possible solution is to divide the bill into two or more self-contained bills, making it clear in the message to the House of Representatives that the Senate has given a third reading to one of the bills and postponed the third reading of the other, perhaps referring its provisions to a committee.

        Again, a House of Representatives bill may contain an assortment of mismatching amendments to one Act, or too diverse a collection of amendments to several Acts. To some of these, agreement or rejection may be easy, while to others overhasty acceptance or rejection may be irresponsible. Like the bill itself, Senate opposition to clauses, or amendments to strike out provisions, can amount to a reversed Hobson's choice. Often, the Senate would be agreeable to passing, say, half of the bill, and seeking time to consider the other half but without delaying enactment of the first half. Again this could be graphically signalled to the House of Representatives by dividing the bill in two, agreeing to one bill, deferring consideration of the other, returning the divided bill by message to the House, thereby placing the onus on it to agree the new bill.

        Perhaps the most dramatic recent example of this political Hobson's choice involved the 1993 budget legislation. An omnibus Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, proposed nine sets of major amendments to seven tax-related acts encapsulating the fiscal heart of the budget statement. Tax cuts were mixed with various tax rises. More than one latter-day Thomas Hobson in government demanded "that or none". The constitutional validity of the bill was challenged by independent legal opinions which concluded that the bill simultaneously
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         imposed tax
        </emphasis>
        , dealt with
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        and dealt with matters

         other than the imposition of tax
        </emphasis>
        , in contravention of section 55 of the Constitution. Eventually the bill was withdrawn and redrafted by the government, ultimately in the form of
        <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         eleven
        </emphasis>
        bills. In any event, attempts were made in the Senate, as a matter of principle, to divide some of these bills in order to place distinct subjects of taxation in separate bills (see appendix 2).

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similar problems may arise in the future. The Minister of Finance, Mr Beazley, MP, (ALP)  has been reported as suggesting that "the political tactic of presenting the [1995] Budget as an interlocked package [will] help the Government put pressure on the Senate to agree to its fiscal plans". It was proposed, he said, to use a deficit reduction structure `very cleverly and very highly focused" to produce such pressure (Financial Review, 6 February 1995, p 5). Indeed, when in 1993, the omnibus taxation bill was recast by the government into eleven separate bills, one was described, drafted, and enacted as
        <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         a test bill
        </emphasis>
        (the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2) 1993). It contains a mixture of provisions similar to those considered by the Senate, its legal committee and independent lawyers as possibly breaching section 55 of the Constitution. That the 1993 test bill was never tested may embolden the government in 1995.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Dividing a bill is one Senate procedure specifically designed to deal with this and other examples of Hobson's choice in legislation—a way to reshuffle the horses at the stable door by dividing the bill into its constituent parts in the form of, say two self-contained bills and then making it clear that no. 1 is agreed to but no. 2, being unpalatable, is not. Agreement to the provisions of the no. 2 bill can be postponed while it is examined by a committee prior to being agreed to, amended or rejected. Such a process can be used without jeopardising the major structure of the original bill which, in the form of the no. 1 bill, will have been agreed to by the Senate and returned to the House of Representatives for its agreement. Such a new bill, having as part of the original bill received its first, second and third reading in the House, does not need to repeat that process—the division of the original into several bills is merely an amendment to which the House can simply agree, thereby enacting the no. 1 bill.

        Before explaining further, a word of caution—this is not a procedure for the merely results-driven politician, the architect of great reforms, impatient with democracy and its inevitable tedium of mere process. It is a procedure, therefore it is all process—the reductive process of identifying the bare essentials of political disagreement rather than exaggerating them. Governments use rhetoric and exaggerate. Senates are at least more inclined to use process and reduce. Public opinion should be aware of the difference and its consequences.

This was the course adopted in 1975 on the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill whose length and complexity made it very difficult for the Senate drafter to divide into several coherent bills. A limitation of this approach, however, is that the bill does not reach the stage at which the Senate can demonstrate its agreement to those agreeable portions of it. Thus, it does not reach the third reading stage in the Senate before being returned to the House of Representatives and the Senate's action is, therefore, easily confused with rejection or obstruction.

Odgers notes that "[l]ong and complex bills do not lend themselves easily to division" (6th ed., p 461). (This may justify returning the bill to the House of Representatives seeking (in effect from the government) its redrafting as two or more bills: see the Report of the Ninth Conference of Presiding Officers and Clerks, Parliamentary Paper No. 223/1978, p 215).

        In any event, if the motion for an instruction is agreed to, the committee of the whole is under an order to carry it out, ie to divide the bill. The actual division requires a further motion, in committee of the whole, to bring about the drafting needed to physically create two (or more) bills from one, by a series of amendments. If agreed, a subcommittee of the committee of the whole could be appointed to draw up the amendments forming the two bills, if this was politically acceptable to the chamber (Odgers 6th ed., p 466). Usually though, the Senator moving for the instruction has had the amendments drawn up. Once divided, the committee can agree to further, substantive amendments (or requests) to either or both bills, or report progress on one bill and resume consideration of the other.

        The Senate has never actually agreed to an instruction to divide a bill though numerous motions have been made to achieve the same end. For example, on 4 December 1991 (but using suspension of standing orders rather than an instruction) Senator Parer (Lib) moved to divide the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 into two bills, one relating to political broadcasts, the other relating to political disclosures. His purpose was to separate provisions banning certain political advertising (which he opposed) from provisions requiring disclosure of political funding (which he supported). The attempted division was, therefore, a direct challenge to the Hobson's choice built into the bill—"the combination of both proposals or none". Senator Parer's motion provided that the first bill consist of the enacting words and certain Parts and clauses of the original bill; that the second bill consist of a certain Part of the original bill; that the first bill be amended to have an appropriate title and renumbered clauses; that the second bill be amended to insert clauses etc; that the two bills be printed and be considered separately on the next day.

When this motion was negatived, Senator Parer used the more usual contingent notice, given on 2 December 1991, to move that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the bill. The rationale was that the Senate having rejected
        <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         his
        </emphasis>
        proposed division of the bill would have a second chance to propose its own division.

        Similarly on 9 December 1994, Senator Harradine (Ind) moved to suspend standing orders to enable him to move a motion for an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 to incorporate in a separate bill a schedule dealing with parliamentarians' remuneration. He thought this schedule should not have been intermixed with this bill. The original bill, without the schedule, dealt with uncontentious coal industry reforms which he wished to support while postponing the third reading of his proposed "new" bill dealing with remuneration.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the 1978 Presiding Officers' Conference, Odgers stressed that "dividing a bill is nothing more than amending it" but he characterised the procedure as an "essential" power of "profound" importance to a house of review, the antidote to unfair practices like tacking, combining unrelated matters, mixing popular and unpopular measures—in effect the answer to Hobson's choice (p 213, 214 and 216). The Tasmanian and South Australian Parliaments have divided bills and agreed to the resulting new bills. The President of the South Australian Legislative Council, AM Whyte, told the 1978 Conference that "the right of the House to split bills where it sees unrelated matters, some of which can be passed without great consideration, and a matter which needs detailed debate and detailed research, is most necessary" (p.233) .

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Senate (in spite of the efforts of some tactically minded senators), while recognising the procedural possibilities of dividing bills, has not yet agreed to divide a bill. But when the circumstances arise the procedure is available as a powerful answer to Mr Hobson's "my bill or none"!

         —The government will impose a total of an additional $13.9 billion in taxes on Australians next financial year. Unlucky 13 seems to have been the government's number in this year's budget. There will be no second round One Nation tax cuts. The l-a-w tax cuts are no more—it seems there is one law for average Australians and another law for the Keating government.

         The Medicare levy, which is a tax, will increase again despite the government's assurances that this would never need to happen. The tax office is to crackdown on certain labour relationships, which it does not like because they have revenue implications, even though those arrangements have been entered into by Australians as a result of this government's previous taxation policies. Company tax will increase by three per cent to 36 per cent. This is a 10 per cent increase in tax for Australian businesses, a vast number of which are still struggling to recover from the recession we had to have and the recession that this government actually manipulated.

         New sales taxes will be introduced for a large range of building materials. This will have serious implications for an important sector of the economy. A 30 per cent increase in sales tax will be applied to non-luxury motor vehicles. This is a cynical act that exposes the illegitimacy of the government's actions taken in 1992 to bring the rate down to 16 per cent. In fact, there are 13 pages of revenue measure changes in the budget which will add to the previously announced measures that increase all sales tax rates by one per cent and bring forward corporate tax payments.

         On the expenditure side the government has triumphed its tight fiscal outcome. That outcome will see government outlays rise next year by $1.3 billion, if you include asset sales, which is not fair, or by $6.3 billion if you excluded them. This is the most difficult point for the ordinary person to appreciate.

         Receipts from sales of physical assets are recorded as offsets within outlays to assist the measurement of the net stock of capital assets in the economy. Thus the proceeds from the sale of the assets serve to reduce outlays, which is a measure of the government's economic activity. So this year, after raising taxes by an historical level and increasing outlays, the government has still been forced to turn to asset sales to balance the books. After taking more and more money from the pockets of Australians, this government has found it necessary to sell the nation's assets just to make the books balance. What a sale!

Whether government expenditure is high relative to other nations or not, it continues to limit the potential of this country to grow at a sustainable rate to allow for employment growth and low inflation. At present, as soon as our growth rate exceeds three per cent, the fear of inflation pushes up our interest rates and chokes our industry. At the same time, without growth of around four per cent, our unemployment queues lengthen and social misery increases.

         What does this budget bring for the Australian people? It brings higher taxes, lower economic growth, more debt, the sale of the country's assets and more pain for the productive and employing small businesses of this country. This is a budget that only a 13-year-old tired government could have produced. This budget, like the ministers and government backbenchers who will hawk it to the Australian public, is full of rhetoric and hollow, empty promises. Let no-one be in doubt that this budget is a cynical and complacent exercise. While the coalition will not oppose these appropriation bills, let no-one be in any doubt that the coalition believes this is a budget that has failed Australia.

         —I want to make a few comments on the appropriation bills, with particular reference to Antarctica. I will refer to comments I made the other night at an estimates committee hearing. My colleague Senator Gibson has just talked about taxation and the inappropriate way in which the government has tackled the budget. I must say that the Antarctic division has been pruned rather severely in the last two years. I have been concerned about the effect that will have on research projects and the day-to-day running of the division. It has also forced the division into a situation where it has reduced its two ship option to one ship.

         I have been concerned for quite some time about the effect that might have on the safety of our expeditioners and researchers in Antarctica. I found out at the estimates committee hearing that the budget this year will be cut by almost $1 million. Although it will not have an immediate effect, the director informed me that it will have an effect further down the track. As I said, I have had a more than passing interest in the one ship option and the contracts regarding shipping and the building of the

After having been told last year that it was going to be a one ship operation and that it would employ another ship every three years, lo and behold, less than 12 months later, the division is looking at chartering the

The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has gone again now. As I said, I am concerned about the result of this bill in relation to safety in Antarctica.

        I noticed during the week in an AAP release in Melbourne that a report was tabled in the parliament by the Victorian Auditor-General. He, too, sounded his concerns about the confidentiality of some of the executive officer contracts. He said that he was initially refused access to the required documents on the grounds that the contracts were confidential between the employee and employer. They are not quite the same as a contract between a government department and a shipping company, but the principles of commercial-in-confidence and making these things available still apply. So the Auditor-General in Victoria has raised the same doubts.

It is most appropriate that we now focus on the budget after enduring all this week the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with turning this country into a republic. We can now get back to what really is important to ordinary Australians—that is, the state of the economy, taxation and unemployment. As most of you know, only one per cent of Australians think the republic is important; the majority think that what really matters, and what is really concerning this country, is the economy.

         The budget that this government has presented, and that we are debating, is a classic financial statement from the Labor Party. It is a tax and spend budget. We have in this budget the most extraordinary increases in taxation which have not yet sunk into the psyche of the Australian people as they try to get rid of the cloud put upon them by Mr Keating and his republic. But the tax effect of this budget will sink into the Australian psyche and will destroy this government at the election.

         There has been a 13.9 per cent increase in personal income tax in this budget; a 15.4 per cent increase in company tax, which ends up being paid by consumers and taxpayers; and a 13.4 per cent increase in sales tax, which is paid at the end of the day by ordinary Australians. Total revenue to the government is increasing 12.8 per cent. That total is up nearly $14 billion, which works out at $700 for every man, woman and child in this country. That is the effect of a Labor government—an extra $700 per annum for every one of us, including my two young sons who will effectively be paying another $700 a year to this government.

Despite all the evidence that what is required is a public sector contribution to savings, we have more government spending. Outlays excluding asset sales are up 5.4 per cent in this budget, which is about $6 1/2 billion of extra government spending. As a result, the public debt interest bill is up nearly $2 billion a year to over $10 billion per annum just on interest on the bankcard which this government has subjected us to. As my colleague Senator Vanstone pointed out in question time, we are now spending nearly as much on interest on debts racked up by this government as we spend on defending the country—an absurd situation.

That is all going to recurrent expenditure, which is the equivalent of selling the backyard so you can pay for your friends to come over and have a barbecue with you. That is what this government is doing. There is absolutely no attempt to fix the underlying structural deficit in this country. When all the assets are gone, Australians will start to wonder what this government will do. There will still be the problem of a major structural deficit in the budget. The proceeds of asset sales should be going directly to reducing the massive debt which this government has been building up.

The proceeds of asset sales in South Australia are all going to reduce the debt built up by its previous state Labor government.

It is a direct attack on the problems in South Australia and worsens the problems in South Australia. In particular I point to the one-third increase in sales tax on cars from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Yet another per cent will be added on 1 July to take it to 22 per cent, which will add $1,000 to the price of an average Holden or Falcon.

         The government dropped this sales tax down to 15 per cent in the lead-up to the 1993 election only because the GST of 15 per cent that we were proposing would result in cheaper motor vehicles. This panicked the government into making a sudden and electioneering drop in the sales tax rate to match our 15 per cent. Of course, at that time the government dressed it up as a permanent reduction. The word `permanent' was used by the Prime Minister. He talked about how this would help the environment by helping Australians buy more fuel efficient vehicles.

Despite all the evidence of the discrimination which we have brought to the parliament's attention, despite the community activity on this subject and despite the Cass report which resulted from the government's very own National Council for the International Year of the Family and which highlighted the discriminatory operation of government policy, the government has done absolutely nothing.

         If we are to believe press reports, there was considerable anxiety and division within the government on this issue. But, clearly, there was a stalemate and a failure to do anything. So the discrimination continues to exist. It exists in the fact that a mother of two in the paid work force who places her children in child care will receive twice as much from the government as a mother of two young children caring for them at home. That is the bald fact. They receive twice as much. There is no income test for the mother in the paid work force with her children in child care who receives money under the child-care cash rebate. She can earn a million dollars a year and she will still receive support from the government. However, there is a quite severe income test on what was the home child-care allowance which has now been converted to the parenting allowance.

         I draw attention to the budget increase in the tobacco excise, which is clearly nothing more than revenue raising by the government. It is predicted to raise an extra $70 million in 1995-96. Most of this is taken out of the pockets of what has been described this week as that class of Australians called battlers. Many of the three million Australians who regularly smoke are battlers. I have never smoked in my life and I am not here to defend the act of smoking, but these Australians, many of whom are on very low incomes and whose one joy in life is smoking, are now being hit yet again by this latest government impost.

The government laid out a plan for tobacco excise increases in 1993 with six monthly increases of five per cent finalising in a five per cent increase in August of this year. The government in the budget brought that five per cent increase due in August 1995 forward to budget night, doubled it to 10 per cent and said to all three million Australians who smoke, `Tough luck,' catching all the smokers and the tobacco companies completely unaware in a most capricious, unfair and unjustifiable manner.

         The ultimate failure is this government's admission that it cannot allow the Australian economy to grow fast enough to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels.

That is the ultimate indictment of this government's economic policy. Instead of fiddling around with our constitution, the government should spend its final few months before it is turfed out of office trying to repair the damage that it has done over the last 12 years to the Australian economy.

         —I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the discussion of the appropriation bills. I took the opportunity of having a look at the speakers list, and it is noteworthy that only coalition and Democrat senators have listed themselves as being desirous of speaking in relation to these bills, other than a summary from the minister. It is quite clear that the Australian Labor Party, particularly its backbenchers, have shied away from this debate because they are aware of the difficulties in trying to sell their budget.

I would have thought one of the most important functions of this parliament was to have a proper discussion and a proper analysis of the federal budget. What Labor senators are saying is that, if they were to contribute to this debate, they would be wasting time. That is implicit in Senator Carr's comment. I suppose I would have to agree with him on that score—that any contribution made by him would be a waste of time. Let me suggest to Senator Carr that, if he listens to me, he might learn something and he will not be wasting his time in this chamber.

         One thing I want to debunk at the outset is the assertion that the government has been running round with that there is somehow a $700 million surplus in this budget. Although it takes a very long time to find, if we read through budget paper No. 1—quite a thick volume—and we go about nine-tenths of the way through, on page 7.3 we see that there is a table called `Table 2—Adjusted ABS budget deficit'. That tells us the true story—that, in fact, there is an $8.2 billion deficit in this budget. That is something that needs to be debunked. The people of Australia need to be advised at all times that this is not a surplus budget but, as ABS points out, an $8.2 billion deficit budget.

         The Labor government has sought to tell us that it will make this a budget in surplus by the sale of assets. Let us just remember that, over the last three years, the government has managed to sell only $3.3 billion worth of assets. This is the fourth occasion on which Qantas has been in the budget papers to be sold. This is the fourth attempt that Labor has had to try to sell Qantas. Of course, the Commonwealth Bank sale is in defiance of undertakings given by Labor. Every indication is that the Commonwealth Bank sale was rushed into the budget at the very last moment to give us what the Treasurer accidentally called the `psychological surplus'.

         This budget is a budget of tax hikes. It may be worth while to list some of the taxes, because virtually each and every one of them that I will list is a complete repudiation of Labor Party promises. The first one, of course, came about when St Carmen—as the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is sometimes known—came into the federal parliament and became the minister for health with a great degree of fanfare. One of her first undertakings was: `There will be no increase in the Medicare levy.' She was absolutely firm. Her credibility was to be determined on that undertaking.

This sales tax increase is nothing other than a GST in disguise. It is the same sort of approach that Paul Keating was frothing at the mouth about during the last election. One wonders why he railed and ranted so strongly against a goods and services tax when he is now taxing these goods of Australians, such as new cars, higher than we on this side were proposing at that time.

The fraud is the huge total tax rise of $30 billion, or about 33.3 per cent, during the short time that has elapsed since Mr Keating promised before the 1993 election that there would be no tax rises. This is the highest ever level of sales tax in Australia's history. Sales tax is Labor's hidden, sneaky consumption tax.

         —I particularly want to deal with sales tax because sales tax demonstrates the lie to its greatest degree. Sales tax is a consumption tax. It is the tax the Labor Party would not wear. The Labor Party attacked violently the whole concept of consumption tax during the last federal election campaign. Yet since that time there has been this massive increase in sales taxes—the greatest increase in sales tax revenue in Australia's history, lifting sales tax revenue to its highest proportion of gross domestic product ever.

         Let us look at the history of sales tax—this tax that the Labor government opposed violently and on which it is now relying more and more for its revenue. I think the government will be collecting something like $14 billion from this sneaky consumption tax which is on almost everything that most Australians pay for, even some foods. Sales tax, interestingly enough, and I suppose it is natural, was first introduced into Australia by a Labor government with effect from 1 August 1930. This tax the Labor Party violently opposes as a dreadful consumption tax was introduced by Labor, has been increased by Labor, has been used by Labor and has been the basis upon which Labor has mounted a deceptive and dishonest campaign against a reform of that consumption tax during the last election campaign.

         Only a few countries maintain the operation of a wholesale sales tax along Labor's lines. Australia is the only developed country persevering with the operation of this tax—Labor's sales tax, as I said, introduced by Labor. Naturally you can trust Labor when it introduces a tax not to increase it—much! When it was first introduced it was 2.5 per cent. Only a year later the then Prime Minister increased it to six per cent. He had this to say:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        has proved most unsatisfactory, but I recognise it is inevitable that we should not only continue to impose it but should increase the rate from 2.5 per cent to six per cent. That alone is sufficient to indicate the unfortunate financial position of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was so right. It is exactly the same now. Here, once again, Australia is in what could politely be described as an `unfortunate financial position' as a result of this government's incompetence. How is the government solving it? By whacking up sales tax—Labor's own tax. What did Mr Chifley, Labor's icon, have to say when he tried to improve the sales tax system? This is back in the 1940s when he reduced the number of different scales of sales tax—it had been three. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is recognised that considerable work is involved in the classification of goods into three separate groups and it is hoped that a substantial measure of relief will be afforded by the reduction in the number of rates of tax from three to two.
       </para>
       <para>
        So what is Labor doing? I suppose Ben Chifley would be rolling in his grave because the current rates of sales tax are as follows: there is one lot at nil; there is one lot at 11 per cent; there is another lot at 16 per cent; there is another lot at 21 per cent; there is another lot at 24 per cent; there is another lot at 31 per cent; and another lot at 45 per cent.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is Mr Chifley saying, `You mustn't have this big range of sales taxes' and what does this government do? Exactly the opposite, because this government believes in secretly ripping off the ordinary battlers of Australia by hitting them where they cannot see it, by putting taxes on things like toilet paper, soap, ice-cream and so on that they do not realise exist. As if that is not bad enough—this huge range of different categories of sales tax, which involves a whole lot of very convenient prosecutions for the government as the tax office keeps fining small businesses, in particular, for putting the wrong rate of sales tax on whatever it is they are selling—these rates are to go up from 1 July.

All those sneaky, secret sales tax rises take place at the end of this month. Would you trust Labor with any tax? You certainly would not trust it with tax promises.

         It is secretly lifting consumption taxes because, frankly, it has to. It has not got another option—unless it wants to whack more out of workers' pay packets overtly, and they would see that happening. It does not want to do that. It would much rather do it by deception, because that is its style.

         The Treasurer of three years ago, just before the last election, said that he was going to try to fix things up. He announced that the government had agreed to a major series of measures to simplify and improve Australia's wholesale sales tax. Simplify? In a pig's ear! I suppose that is appropriate in view of the Prime Minister's enthusiasm about pigs. The booklet also says:

        That is only one element of the disaster of Labor's sneaky sales tax. Studies clearly show a poorer person will be worst hit by this kind of sales tax—this selective sales tax. As the booklet points out:

         —The other people affected by this tax are those in business. There is a huge input cost on business. As a study points out, more than half of the initial incidence of wholesale sales tax is on business inputs. In the end consumers have to pay, but businesses are trying to compete with overseas and are having to pay something like 49 per cent for initial sales tax costs. This burden is passed on to consumers by businesses. However, foreign companies—the companies that some of our companies are competing with—do not have that kind of burden. It is a disincentive to business. It is a disgrace.

         This government has done absolutely nothing to stop that. In fact, it is like a carrion crow feeding off the people of Australia, the businesses of Australia, the battlers of Australia, the small businesses of Australia, the ordinary consumers of Australia, with this hidden, sneaky sales tax which the government pretended it opposed. It is Labor's consumption tax. As Senator Abetz said, it is the government's own secret GST. That is what it is.

         Recently, there has been an increase in drought relief to northern New South Wales, parts of Queensland and parts of Victoria. I am glad that at last the government is accepting that drought has a big effect on the state of the Australian economy. When the Hawke government was first elected in 1983, it would never recognise that the reason the economy was down at the end of the Fraser government was the massive drought the eastern states had in 1982 and the drought that followed in Western Australia in 1983. It was a very big, hard, long drought to go through.

         The eastern states drought of last year was almost as bad. The government recognised that fact and through the drought relief, which I welcome, made available low interest loans, household support, et cetera. I, along with all my colleagues, said that that aid was nowhere near what was required. With the massive population in New South Wales, the bottom of Queensland and the top of Victoria, this government finally listened to their plight and did come up with a certain amount. It then followed up with some more aid in this budget.

         It is interesting to hear what Senator Gareth Evans, who represents the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this place, has to say when the balance of trade figures are not as good as expected. On half a dozen occasions in the last few weeks, he has blamed the drought for those figures. Everyone in the Labor government has always refused to acknowledge the drought at the end of the Fraser years. Former Senator Button was always comparing the situation of the economy but he would never answer an interjection of mine, `What about the drought of 1982?' Finally the government is admitting that drought does knock around the economy and Australia's export income. That is very interesting.

         While the government has recognised the eastern states, it has completely left the Western Australian drought affected areas of East Gascoyne and Murchison out in the cold. I did a big tour of those regions in around mid-March, just before Cyclone Bobby went through. Although they had a very wet season in 1989, they have had continuous years of no rain, let alone little rain, ever since. There was mostly cattle in those areas, and the cattle numbers went down and down.

         If you look at the pastoral industry in Western Australia in the Gascoyne, Murchison and Kimberley regions—there is also some pastoral industry in the Pilbara region, which is where most of Australia's iron ore is mined—you will find that not one station has gone into liquidation since the inception of the pastoral industry in those areas, and to my knowledge the pastoral industry started there in about the 1880s. They were resilient people; they are still resilient people. While those pastoralists are in this situation, the government should do something to help them such as offer them low interest loans or what could be better described as an interest subsidy.

         There are not many people in this place who may know that those pastoralists in those areas can never borrow from a banking institution. The simple reason is the tenure of the property of those pastoralists. They are on finite leases and they will all expire in the year 2015. Whether they will be renewed in 2015 will have a lot to do with the Native Title Act, which went through this parliament some time back. But that is not the debate at hand today. We will have plenty of opportunities down the track to debate that. Because the pastoralists' properties are on finite leases—the banking institutions will not take a station as collateral—they have to borrow on the stock at hand: cattle, sheep or whatever they may have.

         The only lending institutions for that are the stockbrokers—for example, Elders, Wesfarmers in Western Australia and Dalgety or whatever it is called over here. They are the only ones. Those institutions have to charge higher interest because they do not have the access to low interest money that the banking institutions have. So those pastoralists are in a harder position than most other pastoralists or farmers who have to borrow.

         The government continually refuses to help them. I have spoken to Senator Bob Collins about the situation at various times. I have spoken in this place. The Western Australian government has taken the issue up for those people. Over the last five years, they have had four years of almost nil rainfall. So their stock numbers have got down to 25 per cent. A few stations received stewardship grants, which are about $20,000. That amount means nothing to stations of that size. Mind you, when things are running normally, these stations turn out 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 head of cattle per year. They are not small figures.

         What is more, they are taking up that very important export market of live cattle. One of the reasons there are more and more live cattle going out of Western Australia is that the abattoirs of the north have closed. The antiquated industrial relations system took all the abattoirs out. I believe the only abattoir working now in all of the pastoral industry of Western Australia is at Broome. The nearest one is in Geraldton, or in Perth or in Katherine in the Northern Territory. So they are in a very tight economic situation.

         Worse still for them, as far as the economic situation is concerned, is that they have had these drought-breaking rains, up to 12 or 15 inches in some places—Halls Creek has had 30 to 40 inches, but I am talking more about Gascoyne and Murchison—there is feed as high as this table and they do not have enough cattle. You would think the government would have some commonsense. It does not matter about compassion; leave the compassion bit out. The commonsense approach is that the low interest subsidy could be put into those places. A hundredfold reward would then be reaped when they start moving their cattle out again.

         Beyond those stations is the big danger that we will lose those markets in South-East Asia. The Prime Minister keeps telling us that our direction is towards South-East Asia. I agree with him that more and more trade with them, without selling our souls, is all the better for us. They are right on our doorstep. But if we lose those live cattle markets to, say, South America or even America itself—and they like their live cattle—the only other viable place is South America.

         I would like to point out to the chamber and the rest of Australia that, under this new legislation, general purpose grants will continue to be separately identified. That is something I have always wanted. This government has gone away from untied grants to local government. Most of my colleagues accepted the untied grants. I certainly never did, and I have been proved to be right. There were only two or three of us who did not accept those untied grants. This new legislation seeks to have those general purpose grants separately identified, and there is a move to tie them too.

         What worries me is that, when these grants are distributed to state government commissions, the interest rates will still be done by those state government commissions but the allocations will be performed on the basis of national principles declared by the federal minister. I am afraid that we will have another Kelly whiteboard situation if this is not looked at carefully. I urge those people who wish to talk on those bills to look at that. I can assure you that in the weeks and months to come I will make sure that we will not go down that line as directed by the federal minister. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        The legislation passed by the Parliament last year as Acts Nos. 146 and 159 of 1994 set the new rate of charge at $27 in respect of departures from Australia after 1 January 1995. At the time that legislation was being considered by the Parliament, the Government also made known its intention to commence negotiations with international air and sea passenger carriers to have them collect the PMC as part of their ticketing arrangements, thereby removing the need for departure tax stamp booths at international departure points.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Negotiations with airlines are in their final stages and the airlines' representatives have given their in principle agreement for the airlines to enter into arrangements to collect PMC from passengers departing after 1 July 1995. For the first 12 months of the new collection regime, when airlines will still be establishing collection procedures, the PMC stamp booths will remain at international airports to ensure that those passengers who have not prepaid the PMC as part of the price of a ticket will be able to pay before departing Australia. The airlines understand that at the end of this transitional period the booths will cease to operate and the airlines will assume sole responsibility for PMC collection. A further arrangement will be negotiated with the airlines for the long term.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As part of the new collection regime, this bill will replace the existing 24 narrowly defined categories of exemption from PMC liability with 12 broadly defined categories of exemption; both to facilitate collection of the PMC by airlines and shipping companies and to clarify the operation of the new collection scheme. In particular, item 4 of the Schedule to the bill provides that a person departing from Australia will not have to pay the $27 PMC in relation to his or her departure, where that person is:

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The purpose of the bill is to establish the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) as a Commonwealth authority with responsibility for aviation safety regulation. A separate bill, the Air Services Bill 1995, has been introduced in the Senate to establish Airservices Australia as a government business enterprise to operate Australia's national airways system and associated services. The two bills provide the legislative framework for the creation of two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed arrangements build on the Government's announcements of 20 July 1994 and 12 October 1994 on new aviation safety arrangements. This included the  decision to remove the aviation safety regulatory function from the Civil Aviation Authority and place it in a separate and entirely independent statutory authority; the decision to fund that part of the safety regulation function which had been identified as  "public goods"; a direction to the CAA to establish a formal system which automatically triggers an increase in safety surveillance of operators who are known to be in financial difficulty; approval for the CAA to recruit an additional 57 staff to resource adequately its safety regulatory function in terms of both staff numbers and requisite skills; a request to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to conduct an inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors of the industry; and an increase to $500,000 per passenger in the maximum compensation available to fare-paying passengers in the event of an aircraft accident for Australia's domestic and international airlines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will provide the regulatory framework for civil aviation in Australia. CASA's regulatory functions include standard setting, safety surveillance of the industry and enforcement of standards, entry control and licensing. Its additional responsibilities include regulatory oversight of the national airways system, air traffic services and aviation rescue and fire-fighting services provided by Airservices Australia and administration of the carriers' mandatory death or injury insurance arrangements which the Government announced on 12 October 1994. CASA will also be required to place much greater emphasis on safety awareness and education.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia constitute a tripartite structure for providing safe aviation, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. The Government also intends to introduce separate legislation to increase BASI's capacity to conduct more sophisticated, systemic investigations and analysis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The target date for the establishment of CASA and Airservices Australia is 1 July 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The separation of the regulatory and service-provider functions, as proposed in the two bills before the Senate, will provide a much clearer focus on aviation safety regulation and ensure that there is no conflict with the more commercial goals of the service provider.

        On 28 March 1995 the Minister for Transport referred the bills to the House of Representatives' Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for comment. The Committee sought comments on the bills and took evidence at a public hearing during the week commencing 24 April. It issued an advisory report on

        The House of Representatives' Standing Committee's 11 May advisory report noted that there was broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority and endorsed this approach. It said:

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         "The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised board and a new director is a far better solution for the troubled world of aviation safety regulation in Australia than any reorganisation within the existing Civil Aviation Authority."
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The importance of safety is reinforced in both bills through a requirement that, in exercising powers and performing their functions, CASA and Airservices Australia must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        CASA's leadership, strategic direction and management of aviation safety will be considerably enhanced through its establishment as an independent authority, the appointment of an acknowledged expert on aviation safety as its new Director and the subsequent appointment of a small, expert Board. CASA's Board will comprise a Chairperson, the Director of Aviation Safety and up to three other members. A major priority for the Board and the Director of Aviation Safety will be to address the various management problems that have emerged over the last twelve months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister may give CASA written instructions as to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers but, in respect of the performance of CASA's regulatory function, the directions shall be only of a general nature. The bill also provides that the Minister may give CASA notices about its strategic direction.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill makes provision for CASA to produce a corporate plan that includes objectives, strategies and performance measures, an analysis of aviation safety risk factors and human resource and industrial relations strategies. The Minister must respond to the plan and may direct the Board to vary the plan. As recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee, the legislation has been amended by the House to require the corporate plan to be tabled in Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government believes that the proposed responsibility and accountability framework in the bill provides a proper balance between the exercise of Ministerial strategic direction and accountability and the day-to-day exercise by CASA of its functions and powers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Subject to safety being the most important consideration, CASA will be required to have regard to the environment in the exercise of its functions. This will ensure that, as far as possible, the community will be protected from any adverse effects of aircraft operations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the importance of Air Operators' Certificates (AOCs) as a safety regulatory tool in respect of commercial operators, the CASA legislation brings together the main requirements relating to AOCs in a single integrated set of provisions. Currently these provisions appear in a variety of regulatory documents and consolidation of the provisions will make them more accessible both to industry and the regulator.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Provision is made for CASA to be the body responsible for ensuring that all carriers of passengers are insured against their liability for death or injury to passengers. The Government has already introduced legislation to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act to make it mandatory for all operators to be so insured.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As announced in October 1994, the Government will continue to fund that part of aviation safety regulation that has been identified as the public benefit component, for example, standard setting, enforcement and provision of safety awareness information. Other aspects of aviation safety regulation, which primarily benefit the travelling public and the aviation industry, will continue to be met by a combination of charges and levies on the aviation industry. These proposed cost recovery arrangements for CASA will be reviewed prior to preparation of the 1996/97 Budget.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has agreed to a number of initiatives for CASA to enhance its effectiveness in providing safety regulation to the Australian aviation industry. The most important include the Aviation Safety Surveillance Program (which will provide an assessment of the safety health of the aviation industry and enable implementation of follow up responses) and a review of the system of flight crew testing.

        Provision has been made in the bill for the transfer of assets and for the transfer of staff, under the same terms and conditions that apply at present, from the Civil Aviation Authority to the new Authority. The Government also intends that rights, debts, liabilities and obligations (including insurance aspects) will be allocated to CASA in accordance with the functions transferred.

        The legislation provides that both CASA and Airservices Australia must, where appropriate, consult with Government, industrial, commercial, consumer and other relevant bodies and organisations, including the International Civil Aviation Organization and bodies representing the aviation industry.

        In relation to the House of Representatives' Standing Committee's Aviation Bills Inquiry, the Government has accepted ten of the twelve recommendations totally or substantially. As appropriate, the bill has been amended by the House to give effect to the recommendations accepted by the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, CASA's functions have been reclassified to avoid any confusion between the object clause and the functions clause. The bill also includes a number of technical amendments by the House to accommodate, inter alia, suggested changes proposed by the Senate's Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of bills.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The House of Representatives' Standing Committee noted that item 28 of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill omits subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act. That subsection requires the Authority, in so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, to "have regard to any costs that would arise from complying with the standards". Some industry representatives indicated concern that the ultimate issue of cost might not be addressed and that a focus on enabling more people to participate in aviation would recognise that regulation has its costs without explicit reference to costs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee proposed that the object clause be a broad in-principle statement of purpose which should include reference to the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation and that, pending the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill, subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act be retained.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government considers that the Committee's proposed changes to the object clause run the risk of diluting the safety intent of the bill. They seek to establish a dual mandate for CASA by requiring CASA not only to regulate aviation safety but to foster the aviation industry. They introduce uncertainty as to how CASA should "recognise the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation" and they could be used to challenge the validity of safety rules on the basis that they may have an economic impact on industry. In short, they involve the inclusion of the concept of "affordable safety" under another name.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments also present a real danger of what the Committee described as "regulatory capture"—which could happen if CASA (the regulator) is seen to be "accountable" to industry (the regulated). As the Committee itself noted:

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government considers the question of costs is most appropriately addressed through the relevant provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill. Under this bill, CASA will be required to put in place a mandatory consultation process before any civil aviation regulation is made to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunity to comment. CASA will also be required to prepare a Legislative Instruments Proposal which contains a summary of the proposal and its objectives, an analysis of alternatives to meet the objectives, an indication of relative costs and benefits to Government and the affected public of the proposal and alternatives and reasons for the preferred approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In response to the Committee's concerns, the object clause has been amended in the House so that it is a broad in-principle statement of purpose as follows:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A written direction will also be issued to the CASA Board immediately upon its establishment requiring CASA to comply with the relevant provisions in the Legislative Instruments bill, pending its enactment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommended that the purpose of clause 28(2) be elaborated. This clause provides that the financial position of the applicant is one of the matters that CASA may take into account in issuing an Air Operator's Certificate. Clause 28BC(3) enables CASA to take into account the financial position of an AOC holder when making a decision to impose or vary AOC conditions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As part of the broad strategy to improve air safety regulation in Australia, the Minister for Transport issued a written direction to the Civil Aviation Authority that it should establish a formal system which would trigger an automatic increase in safety surveillance of any operator found to be in financial defaults.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides that CASA has a safety regulatory role: it does not provide CASA with the powers of an economic regulator to control the entry and licensing of operators in the industry or to monitor their financial affairs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill, nevertheless, allows CASA to take into account information about financial viability in order to assess whether the applicant can meet other provisions, for example, the requirement to maintain an appropriate organisation, with a sufficient number of qualified personnel and an effective management structure.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Financial problems do not necessarily imply that safety standards are not being met. However, the bill empowers CASA to have regard to information about the financial viability of a particular operator in deciding whether or not to conduct a detailed safety audit of the operator. To make it mandatory to consider the financial position of an operator would interfere with CASA's responsibilities as a safety regulator since CASA would be required to undertake a financial viability test before it could suspend or cancel an AOC, with consequent, and potentially damaging, delays in CASA taking the necessary regulatory enforcement action.

        Section 20A of the Civil Aviation Act contains offences in relation to the flying or operation of aircraft in a manner likely to endanger life or cause danger to person or property. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it was difficult in some circumstances to obtain a conviction under this section, principally because the risk of danger that would have to be proved would be substantial or probable danger, even to the extent of actual injuries being sustained. The bill therefore contains amendments to section 20A along the lines proposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

        Finally, senators will be aware that there are a number of inquiries into aspects of aviation safety at present, including the Standing Committee's Aviation Safety inquiry and the Staunton inquiry into certain aspects of the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to Seaview Air.

        Because of the significance of the structural changes encompassed by these bills, the Government is unwilling to delay their implementation until the outcome of these inquiries is known. However, the Government will give careful consideration to the findings of these inquiries and report to Parliament on its proposed responses, including any necessary legislative amendments. I note that the House's Standing Committee accepted the need for the two bills to be passed in the current sittings.

         In my second reading speech introducing the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, I said that the two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia, together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, will constitute a tri-partite structure, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system.

        Airservices Australia will be established as a government business enterprise (GBE). Its functions will include the provision of airways facilities and air traffic services, an aeronautical information service, a national aviation rescue and fire-fighting service, an aviation search and rescue service and radio navigation and tele-communications. Additionally, Airservices Australia will be required to undertake specified environmental functions such as noise monitoring.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the performance of its functions, Airservices Australia, like the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration.

The application of all State and Territory taxes to Airservices Australia, consistent with the Competition Principles Agreement agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory leaders at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in April 1995, will also be considered.
