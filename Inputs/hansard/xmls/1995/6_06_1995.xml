         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's infamous promise before the 1993 election `not to put up tax', which was later redefined to mean not to put up the tax burden as a proportion of GDP. In the light of this, I refer the minister to this year's budget which reveals that taxation to GDP has risen from 22.1 per cent in 1992-93, the year in which the Prime Minister made that infamous promise, to a forecast 24.2 per cent in 1995-96. I ask: does the minister agree that this 2.1 per cent of GDP—over $10,000 million—increase in the burden of taxation represents the value of Prime Minister Keating's electoral tax fraud and deceit?

There are more competent authorities in this chamber than I am. However, having disposed of that, it is a question of Senate craft on your part, Senator: you actually ought to learn how this chamber runs. But that is an aside point. Let me go to your actual question. As I understand what the Prime Minister said, and it has been reiterated in this chamber numerous times by my colleague the Leader of the Government here, Senator Gareth Evans, we are within the range that the Prime Minister referred to when he made that undertaking. So no promise has been broken. As much as you would like to pretend it has been, no promise—and I repeat: no promise—has been broken.

         If you want to debate us on tax, we will go to the opposition's record on taxation when it was in government. The first and plainest thing that anyone can see is that you are a high taxing party; we are not. We are a low taxing party. The total level of taxation in Australia in terms of the OECD puts us down the bottom of the table. Your levels of tax when you were in power were higher than ours.

         —I understand Senator Evans's concern. Allowing this crowd to deal with industrial relations is like giving a child a box of matches, and it is causing very serious concern. There is a very immediate concern about what it is doing to the trade performance directly, and there is a very immediate concern about those Australian businesses whose particular trading relationships have been affected. The concern I particularly want to refer to is the damage it has the potential to do to our overall international reputation as a reliable and efficient international trader. In international affairs and in trade, as in other matters, images are quick to form and slow to change. The decade and more that we have had of record industrial peace in this country is slowly starting to impact on the perception of international business about Australia's industrial relations.

The positive results of all this work can be very easily damaged. It only takes one set of provocative actions, like those of the Western Australian government, to put at risk that very long, slow process of changing the entrenched image of Australia. A lot of hard work and a lot of cooperation mean that industrial disputes are now 65 per cent lower than when the opposition was running industrial relations. It is a very serious cause of concern to everybody who wants Australia's international trading performance to improve.

         We spent a lot of money trying to change Australia's image, trying to lift the perception in the public eye of Australia as a reliable trading partner for commodities and, in particular, for manufactures and services. All the work that this government has done, not by itself but with the trade union movement, with business and with most of the state governments has helped to turn this image around. It has meant that eventually the reality of the low level of industrial disputes in Australia is starting to impinge on the consciousness of business internationally. It will be a terrible tragedy if the ideological blinkers of the Western Australian government and its commitment to seek to destroy the trade unions and the wage standards of Australian workers put all this at risk.

I urge the Western Australian government to reconsider and not continue with this provocative course of action.

Why, then, Minister, did Senator Schacht state in the Senate during a personal explanation on 30 May that he told small business people in Townsville that `the increase in wholesale sales tax would increase the cost for a more average house of up to $1,000?'

         The changes the government proposes to the tax on building materials is expected to provide $215 million in the year 1995-96. It is true that some building associations have contested whether that figure is accurate. I do know that the Treasurer, the tax office and others have consulted with them about the figures that they have, but at this point no compelling case has been made by them to encourage the government to believe that its figures are wrong.

It is not possible to give a precise estimate about the size of the impact because it depends on the type of house and the relevant fittings in the house. For a median new house costing $155,000—that is a house and land package—the impact may be around $500 to $800. For a modest house and land package of around $100,000 to $125,000 with modest fittings, the impact may be around $400, with the house being around 55 per cent of the cost.

I am sure if they are, they will be taken notice of, but at this stage no compelling case has been made by the industry.

         So far as Mr Costello is concerned, let me state for the parliamentary record what I have already said publicly. I accept absolutely Mr Costello's statement to me that there is not a shred of truth to these allegations. Michael Costello is one of Australia's finest public servants, with an outstanding public reputation. I have the utmost confidence in him and no intention whatever of standing him down, as I was urged to do by Mr Aldred.

         Like Mr Costello and Mr Leibler, who has also been grossly and irresponsibly defamed, I welcome a full and rigorous examination of these matters by the Australian Federal Police working with their international colleagues. I have no doubt that this inquiry will establish that the allegations are utterly without foundation and will as well also help to expose something of the motivations of those responsible for producing this material in the first place and putting it on the public record.

         So far as the alleged paedophile activities are concerned, let me confirm some of the basic points that were put on the record by Mr Bilney in the other place last night. First, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not, does not and will not ever condone paedophile activities by any of its officers. Secondly, when some allegations were drawn to attention in the past, in 1988 and 1993, they were the subject of full investigation by the Australian Federal Police and were found not to be substantiated. When allegations were made again in April this year, the AFP responded to our request for advice and for investigative action as appropriate, but there was no new information warranting an investigation. If new allegations are made with sufficient precision by Mr Aldred or anyone else to enable them to be investigated, then of course we would want that to happen. If Mr Aldred has any specific evidence, he should hand it over immediately to the AFP.

         I should also make it clear that my department has not let matters rest there. It may possibly be that, irrespective of whether criminal activity is involved, conduct may have occurred which should properly be subject to Public Service disciplinary proceedings. The department has, accordingly, some weeks ago, set in train an internal investigation, which is still under way, to consider those questions. Mr Costello has himself put out a much more detailed statement on all of this today, and I seek leave to incorporate the text of that in

        In a statement to the Parliament yesterday, Mr Aldred MP, raised a number of allegations of alleged paedophile activity in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. One specific allegation he makes is that I, as Secretary of the Department, did not veto the promotion of an officer to a senior position in the Department even though I was allegedly aware of that of officer's paedophile proclivities. That allegation by Mr Aldred is a foul, loathsome, cowardly lie.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Aldred also alleged in Parliament yesterday that the senior management of DFAT, not only tolerates known paedophiles in the Department but actively promotes them. That is also a foul, baseless lie.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Aldred goes on to say that there are approximately 20 senior executive service officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who engage in paedophile activities within Australia and overseas. He refers specifically to Mr John Holloway by name and identifies another serving DFAT officer by reference to his current position. Similar allegations were reported in the Australian media sourced to a Philippines anti-paedophile activist some months ago. The Department immediately wrote to the Attorney-General's Department and to the Federal Police to ask them to investigate the matter of these allegations involving these two officers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Department has received advice from both the Federal Police and from the Attorney-General's Department that following their enquiries there is no evidence to support any allegations of involvement of either of these officers in paedophile activities. To be absolutely sure, however, I instructed our Embassy in Manila to pursue with the source of the Philippines allegations whether there was any concrete evidence that would support action against those officers under the Public Service Act, as distinct from the Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our Embassy in Manila has now reported to me that Embassy officers there have had discussions (in the company of officers of the Child Welfare Department) with Dr Zaide the source of the earlier allegations. Dr Zaide, after a long discussion, acknowledged that she was unable to provide any specific evidence or substantiation of allegations that Australian diplomats had been involved in paedophile activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Aldred also refers to a former DFAT officer currently working in Hanoi. That officer has not been a member of this Department for a decade. Any questions, therefore, relating to him should be addressed elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Aldred also specifies a former Australian Ambassador stationed in Hanoi in the late 1980s. He also, without specifying names or current positions, levels the accusation of paedophile behaviour against another 15 or so officers of the Department. In all these cases he should give all details in his possession to the Australian Federal Police as a matter of urgency. He should supply all names, evidence and data in his possession. This Department will cooperate to the absolute maximum extent possible in the investigation of any such allegations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I reject utterly the suggestion by Mr Aldred that the Department is obstructing or attempting to prevent examination of any matters in this regard. We are, and we will continue to take the initiative in examining such matters and ensuring that the police and any other relevant body are involved in a full and complete investigation.

         The second thing that has to be said is about the role of the press in this particular matter. I think it is time for some sections of the media to take a long, hard look at themselves. If ever there were stories crying out for caution in their treatment, it was these. No doubt they had crude news value, but equally obviously there was potential for the stories to cause enormous damage not only to the officers identified directly by name or by job but to all those SES members who might be thought to be one of the 20 described by Aldred as engaged in paedophile activity. If anything should have made the press profoundly cautious about running the paedophile story in particular, it was it appearing on the same day as the other extraordinary thing about Costello.

I remind you of the current situation: the four big banks already control 65 per cent of total assets; banks enjoy margins nearly twice the average of other industrialised countries; and, as we established yesterday, they are not passing on to consumers the one per cent fall in wholesale interest rates. Add to that the fact that the four big banks are starting as favourites to take over Bank WA and the Bank of Melbourne. Do you agree that such a further concentration in the banking markets in Western Australia and Victoria actually limits the opportunity to deliver further competition and the lower interest rates you talked about yesterday? In reality, hasn't the trend since deregulation been towards fewer, bigger banks? And how does this really help deliver those customer services and interest rates that you talked about?

         The third point I make about this is market entry. This is a complex and difficult field to enter, but there are no restrictions on market entry for real competition here and that adds to the wider competitive nature of the financial market. This is a dynamic market. Mergers show that it is dynamic and there are still a number of players which do provide competition between one another. Yesterday I referred to Aussie Home Loans and the AMP Society deciding to extend its operations into home mortgages. They are signs of greater competition. That competition is not just in terms of the headline rate for interest being charged on particular things, but also competition between banking products and the diversity of detail and products offered.

         One always wants to see greater competition. It is the government's desire to have a competitive domestic economy. We believe that by doing that we will be able to be more effective, become stronger and become more internationally competitive. But I think we would have to say that, if this question swings on whether some regional banks will consolidate, then the bottom line is that out of that the new entities created will provide far better competition to the big four than they would if they remained separate and regional.

No doubt it would be of interest to many senators that some of the programs included in this program are two innovative studies to assess the impact of snorkelling, swimming and other tourism activities on the Great Barrier Reef and the provision of protective infrastructure at a number of key ecosystems, including the Fitzgerald River, which is a national park in Western Australia, and the West Alligator Head in the Kakadu National Park.

The ABC agreed to provide Australia Television until at least 30 June this year as a condition of receiving $5.4 million in government support in 1992-93 to assist with the establishment of the service.

I did say—what I said was quoted, I think accurately, yesterday—that it would be extraordinarily arrogant and insensitive on the part of developed countries, after the degradation we have wreaked on the environment over 100 years or more, to be making too many outrageously hypocritical demands on our developing country colleagues in this respect.

It is just that we have to get the balance right in terms of the precise rules that are applied to all the countries in the world, both developed and developing. It is important that, as we struggle to get that balance and the rules right, Australia play its fair and equitable role in making a contribution to the resolution of the problem and is not unfairly and inequitably burdened by contrast with the burdens falling on other developed countries, and not unfairly and inequitably burdened by having to shoulder all the responsibility that should be at least partly shared by those in the developing world.

         —This is a quite remarkable question, particularly given the contribution and concession that this government has made to the so-called battlers that those opposite want to claim. Australian families have benefited enormously under Medicare like they never benefited under the opposition. Two million Australians had no private insurance cover when we came into office. Those two million Australians now have cover. They are protected under Medicare. That is the greatest thing that they can have by way of health insurance under this government.

Most importantly, when they finally got a bill back under their private health insurance, there was a huge cost to them. Private health insurance was not delivering what was there to deliver. Thousands of people have written to me, and I am sure to many of those opposite, saying, `I have had private health insurance all my life, when I finally went to use it I got a bill for $3,000 from the doctor, the theatre or somewhere or other.' That is what people found. They got out of it because it was working for them.

It will be made clear to the consumers what their costs will be before they even go into surgery or have medical treatment in a hospital. There are huge benefits in the changed legislation.

If so, is the government aware of concern within the industry that this fee will act as a disincentive to keep food standards current; will have a harsh impact on small food and beverage producers; and will discourage innovative food producers from developing new types of products, both for the local market as well as the export market?

After considering an IDC report on the options for introducing cost recovery at the National Food Authority, the government took the decision in December 1994 to introduce charges for applications to vary the food standards code. The National Food Authority has been implementing this decision and has been consulting with food industry representative associations, with interest groups and with state and territory governments about the structure of these charges.

By way of a supplementary question I ask: Minister, who are the three suspects? Will the minister make available to the parliament for examination the CJC's Operation Wallah report to the AFP and the subsequent report by the AFP to the government? If not, why should we have any confidence that this is nothing but an attempted government whitewash in the run up to the election?

The forum has been initiated by the Centre for Rural Social Research at the Charles Sturt University and it brings together women from around Australia. Importantly, financial support has been provided by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Office of the Status of Women.

         About 70 women are attending the forum, including representatives from rural women's groups and governments, journalists, and so on. The main theme is the status of rural women and the needs of all women in rural communities. A particular focus will be on issues affecting women in agriculture. It is believed that there is something like 80,000 women in Australia working as farmers or farm managers, and some further 13,000 working as farm hands and assistants. In broad terms, women represent about 30 per cent of the agricultural work force in this country.

         It is also important to recognise the value of off farm work done by women in rural Australia. Certainly, one of the challenges rural women face is the changing perception of their work and what they do. I quote Mary Salce from Victoria at last year's International Women in Agriculture Conference:

It is a major concern and it is one of the reasons child care is such an issue of importance for rural families.

         This inquiry by Cathy McGowan particularly addressed assistance for rural families.

         I thought I might also mention briefly some of the other things we provide for families in rural Australia: mobile children's services, multi-function children's services and, in particular, the recently announced 100 places in all family day care schemes which may be accessed by seasonal workers in rural and remote Queensland. That is already available in Shepparton and other parts of Victoria. Again, it is a very important area of concern for rural families who depend on seasonal work. We are as concerned to assist rural families with child care as we are urban families. We appreciate that child care has to be flexible to meet the different needs of rural families. That is the sort of thing I will be talking about at the conference tonight.

He then went on to say that the market has not yet weaned itself off the view that Australia is on a long-term, low-inflation course. I do not want to quote him because I cannot recall his words directly but, as I recall what he said, he referred to market behaviour being formed by expectations of high interest rates, that they have not yet realised that we are a low-interest rate economy and that the government is committed to maintaining low interest rates. He then concluded, in the normal way in which Mr Evans gives his views, by saying that that was his view.

As was explained in parliament last December, the statement made by the Prime Minister in 1992 was that the government would be keeping tax within the tax to GDP ratio of the previous few years. Between 1989-90 and 1991-92 the tax to GDP ratio was between 22.7 per cent and 24.7 per cent. The budget estimates that in 1995-96 tax revenue to GDP will be 24.2 per cent increasing to 24.6 per cent in the 1996-97 years and then declining. The government is therefore meeting its undertaking.

         As to the suggestion that the administrative oversight is being used as a basis of appeal against a private sector litigant, this is a wrong accusation. The appeal in question relates only to the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; it is not an appeal on the merits against a decision in favour of a private sector litigant. The administrative oversight is included in the grounds of appeal for those sound ethical reasons. I table the documents I have referred to.

        I refer to the letter of 5 June from Mr Umberto Torresi of the Australian Government Solicitors Office (at Attachment A) which outlines the basis on which the ground of appeal dealing with the failure to table the finance scheme guidelines arose. This ground was that:-

It has taken a long time to compile the answer. It has not been neglected. I have asked the minister, and I will ask again in response to the senator's question, to be assiduous in this. I am advised that the department is researching the answer and I will continue to pursue it and provide it as soon as it is available.

         That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill on 5 June 1995, relating to the failure to table research and development finance scheme guidelines.

        I only need a couple of minutes. I want to point out how astonishing the explanation is that Minister Cook has just given. He has sought to plead his own default as a basis upon which the court should find in his favour. That is what he has done in this instance. It is really quite amazing. He came in today and argued that it would be unethical not to do so, unethical not to plead his own default as a ground for which he should win the case. Have you ever heard such an amazing argument!

         What happened in this instance was that the taxpayer bought an action before the AAT and the AAT made a decision, based on the guidelines under the R&amp;D tax concession provisions, against the government. The decision was made against the government. The government then became aware, in fact, that the guidelines were invalid because it, the government, the  minister's department, the minister responsible, had failed to table the guidelines. So it went back to the court on appeal and said that now the government should be successful because there are no guidelines in force and the court should therefore find against the taxpayer.

         What the minister said today is, `I really had no choice but to do that. This was the interim period between my becoming aware of my default and seeking to take action to overcome that default. Therefore I acknowledge that in that period'—apparently for the first time today—`the guidelines were in fact invalid and I sought to rely on that invalidity.' `To do so,' he said, `would be immoral.' Failure to plead his own default would be immoral and therefore, for sound ethical reasons, he took that absolutely astonishing course of action.

         That is appalling! What faith can the ordinary taxpayer have in government in this country when ministers are prepared to act in that way? What sort of fair go are they going to have when ministers rely on their own default to demonstrate invalidity in a guideline and therefore to argue against the taxpayer? This minister should be ashamed that he has come in here today. I can only presume that somebody has written this extra answer for him and he failed to read it before he read  it out here today. He should be ashamed of what he has done today. It only compounds his default in this whole sorry saga that we are going to hear a lot about even later today when we seek to get on the public record the relevant documents and start to explore how a default of this consequence could have possibly occurred and how for a year—apparently it was a year before it took any remedial action—the department was aware of the default. This is just another step, but it is a sorry and disappointing step that the minister came in with an answer of that type today.

        Senator McMullan, in seeking to explain why no response had been given to question No. 2123 within 30 days, stated that the question I had asked was of a detailed nature and required a lot of research. I ask this question—for Senator Cook's benefit I ask it in a rhetorical fashion, not in a `rhet-rical' fashion and I hope that Senator Cook accepts that.

         The situation is that the National Media Liaison Service seems to have this absolutely unique capacity to do research on everybody else other than itself. It has not been able to come up with the answers to these questions in 30 days, and they are fairly easy questions: firstly, what was the name, designation, office location and remuneration of each member of staff as at 31 March 1995? That is not a matter of great research, I would have thought. Secondly, which staff members are permanent public servants, and what was each person's level prior to taking up the present position? I would have thought that that was not a very difficult question.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, what is the entitlement of each staff member for telephone or car allowance, Commonwealth car, for personal uses, and what are any other entitlements? Once again, I would have thought that that would all be readily available. Fourthly, in relation to ex-ministerial staff members who have been employed with either the National Media Liaison Service or the Ministerial Media Group since 1 January 1990—and all we are really asking about, as I understand it, are seven people—what are their names, their ministerial designations, their remuneration, and things of that nature?

         It is noteworthy that, when I first raised the issue about ex-ministerial staff in the National Media Liaison Service, Mr Epstein indicated that he thought there was only one. He then had to write to me to confirm that that answer was wrong. If he knew that that answer was wrong when he wrote to me, one would anticipate that Mr Epstein—the on-again, off-again Director of the National Media Liaison Service—would have had the capacity to tell us why he was able to tell us that it was wrong. The fact that it was wrong was undoubtedly because he had researched the issue himself and had come to a determination.

         The questions I have asked do not, with respect, in any way require a great degree of detail. In fact, the answers to the first three questions should all be readily available, and only a very small amount of research would be required for the fourth question. What all this indicates is another chapter in a very sorry and sad history in trying to get information about the National Media Liaison Service. We on this side of the Senate are being obstructed every single step of the way when we try to get to the truth of how the National Media Liaison Service is conducted.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware of the very real concerns we have on this side that the National Media Liaison Service, which is funded to the tune of $1.5 million by the taxpayers of this country, is being used for party political purposes by the Australian Labor Party and the government. The Auditor-General sought to have an inquiry into the National Media Liaison Service and was told that, on technical grounds, he could not inquire into it. So, at Senate estimates, we requested that the National Media Liaison Service be considered and discussed.

         At those estimates hearings, we had the most unedifying experience of the minister at the table, Senator McMullan, not even being able to tell us what the total budget was for the National Media Liaison Service. That is the sort of preparation that this government comes to estimates committees with. If the government does not even know what the total budget is, you cannot really get much further in an estimates hearing. As a result of that, this Senate moved a motion requiring a further and supplementary hearing of the relevant estimates committee into the National Media Liaison Service.

         We then had the degree of obfuscation that has now been widely reported in the media where people such as Mr Epstein, despite having signed letters as the Director of the National Media Liaison Service, have now tried to deny that he ever has been or was the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. Completely unbelievable! Even his own minister, Kim Beazley, when he wrote on 9 February to the estimates committee inquiring into the National Media Liaison Service referred to Mr Epstein as the Director of the Ministerial Media Group and Director of the National Media Liaison Service. His own minister refers to him as such, but he still denies it. Indeed, at the last lot of estimates that we had just a few days ago, Minister McMullan was still seeking to deny that Mr Epstein was the Director of the National Media Liaison Service.

         The thing that concerns us on this side of the house is that the National Media Liaison Service is such a rank abuse of public funds. We had the pathetic spectre of David Epstein and the minister seeking to deny that the National Media Liaison Service was engaged in propaganda. We in fact have on the public record Barrie Cassidy, the former press secretary to the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, confirming and acknowledging virtually every single allegation that we on this side of the house have been making for the last number of years—that is, that the National Media Liaison Service is a propaganda unit and it peddles the government's line for political advantage.

        I referred the minister to the infamous promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before the 1993 election not to put up tax. That is what he said baldly and then he subsequently refined that to say that he would not put up tax as a proportion of GDP. The minister waffled around at great length today and tried to say that what the Prime Minister was saying was that it would stick within the ballpark figure as a percentage of GDP. He claimed that an increase since that statement of 2.1 per cent in the proportion of GDP that the tax takes up is a figure within the range. And 2.1 per cent is more than $10,000 million.

         So in this year's budget tax is forecast to increase from 22.1 per cent—the figure in the year of the Prime Minister's promise—to 24.2 per cent of GDP this year. That is in excess of $10,000 million—equal to $1,700 per household, or almost $600 for every man, woman and child in Australia. That is the extent of the election deceit and the tax fraud deceit that the Prime Minister rorted on the Australian electorate prior to the 1993 election.

And so far as tax promises are concerned, he is the greatest tax promise fraud in Australia's history. The figures for this budget reveal that in stark terms.

The great danger that underlies this present budget is that we are going to see a repeat of yet more of those disastrous policy failures that we saw under the Whitlam government which took years and years, if ever, to correct in the Australian economy and which are sowing the seeds for major future damage of the Australian economy.

This table shows, for example, that tax as a proportion of income has increased over time for both family groups and single income earners, with tax for the single person increasing from 15.5 per cent to 23.7 per cent and, for the family, increasing from 5.9 per cent to 16 per cent of income.

The marginal tax rate has generally increased over the period: for families, from 22.1c to 36.9c in the dollar; and, for single persons, from 27.8c to 36.9c. For both, the rate peaked at 47c in 1984-85 and 1985-86. The proportion of family tax to single person tax increased from 38 per cent in 1966-67, peaked at over 75 per cent in 1988-89 and dropped back marginally to 67 per cent by 1993-94.

         The conclusion from this table is that the gradual increase in tax as a proportion of income has been due predominantly to bracket creep, whereby increases in income either move the income earner into a higher marginal tax bracket or move a greater amount of income into the marginal tax bracket. This has had a more dramatic effect as the number of tax brackets has decreased.

         Until 1973-74, there were 29 brackets. This was reduced to 14 in 1974-75, seven in 1975-76 and four from February 1978. Since that time, the number of brackets has varied up to a maximum of six. The family group has also

         The figures clearly demonstrate that what Senator Cook said was untrue. The facts speak for themselves. Legally, what I said can be proved. The table clearly demonstrates that when we were last in government the proportion of average weekly earnings was 22.9 per cent for the single income earner; it is now 23.7 per cent. For the average family earner it was 14.1 per cent; it is now 16 per cent as a proportion of total earnings. That gives the lie to the statement made previously.

        Let us look at the Labor Party's performance on the waterfront and shipping reform. A lot of light, noise and heat have been developed—by Senator Collins in particular, when he was the minister. His activities in the area culminated with the now famous meeting with then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Senator Collins giving funny interjections about getting lung cancer because Prime Minister Hawke smoked so many cigars that night. We all remember Senator Collins saying he would resign if he did not reform the waterfront.

         The reality for Australia, for its exporters and importers and, therefore, for Australian consumers, is that Australia's waterfront has not improved compared with the situation of our trading partners and competitors. What the Western Australian dispute is about—and it needs to be stated, because I believe Senator McMullan misrepresented it and used his ideological blinkers to put his ideological spin on the facts around the dispute in Western Australia—is that the Western Australian Stateships organisation and the managers of that organisation, whom I do not know, sought to ensure that the most competitive quote from a stevedoring company won; and was used to provide that service to Stateships.

         Senator McMullan has come into this place on many occasions when I have asked him questions about Commonwealth owned business entities and said that they must be independent and must behave in a competitively neutral way that ensures that they do not compete unfairly against the private sector. He is now coming in and saying that Stateships should not be allowed to enter into a contractual obligation with a stevedoring company. The person in this chamber with the ideological blinkers on in this dispute is Senator McMullan. I also suspect Senator Chris Evans, but I will not accuse him of that because his views are not yet on the record.

         Stateships or any other state organisation or quasi-government business enterprise cannot go out into the marketplace and say that it needs services provided—in this case, it is a shipping company—and then look at the tenders, contracts and bids. Stateships chose a company which I understand is owned by Len Buckeridge. This company employs non-union labour.

         The union monopoly in Western Australian ports, particularly in Fremantle, has ensured that, regardless of the commercial nature of a negotiation between Stateships and the stevedoring company owned by Mr Buckeridge, it cannot be done. It is not a free world when you enter the ports of Western Australia; it is a closed world. We go back to an old world where there is a monopoly. Regardless of the democratically elected government or the contractual obligations and negotiations between commercial entities, being Stateships on the one hand and a stevedoring company on the other, the trade union movement was prepared to close down the ports of Western Australia because it was not happy with the situation.

         In other words, any agreement that is done in a port in Western Australia must get the approval of the unions that operate on awards in Western Australia. It is like getting an agreement and taking it down to the stamp office when stamp duty is paid. It is not an agreement until the state stamp duty is paid on it. In the ports in Western Australia, one has to get the unions in the workplace to do that.

         The sad thing about that is that ultimately Western Australia is held to ransom. The business interests of Western Australia said to Richard Court, the premier, `You have to get this sorted out. You are killing us.' But it was not the government or the premier that was killing business; it was the trade unions. This handful of people have had their special place in legal affairs in Australia enshrined by this federal Labor government. They have a position at the bargaining table even when they are not part of the bargain. They are prepared to hold to ransom the whole of Western Australia until they get their way.

         This is a disgraceful set of affairs. This government has stood by the trans-Tasman accord, which has meant that shipping between Australia and New Zealand is far more expensive than it needs to be. It stands by a system of cabotage, which ensures that coastal shipping in Australia is far more expensive than it needs to be. It has created a waterfront monopoly that is very little better than it was in the early 1980s. We still have the most expensive waterfronts in the world. That costs Australia's consumers. That reform is crucial if Australia is to create opportunities for people to gain employment in this place.

        Senator Ian Macdonald's question highlights the fact that the Australian people have been misled in terms of the impact of the sales tax on building hardware. Budget paper No. 1 indicates that the government will extend the wholesale sales tax to building materials. But the government and the budget papers have not told us that the wholesale sales tax will not only apply to materials but also, in many cases, to the labour component and to oncosts, particularly in the joinery workshop. Even the honourable Senator Murphy has been misled by the government's propaganda on this. If in doubt, I ask him to refer to the Australian Taxation Office or any joinery workshop. One could be completely misled in relation to this matter by the budget papers.

         Take, for example, the ordinary joiner who completes a cupboard arrangement to put into a new home. If prepared in the joinery shop, this may have to have sales tax applied to the material content added value. Then there is a cost allocation problem between certain of the material which he might buy as green timber and other timber which the joiner processes through cutting and planing on the job in the joinery. The joinery then adds labour cost and also factory service cost.

         This means, of course, that there is a major problem, because the work done in the joinery is going to have the sales tax applicable to the labour content in addition to maybe some of the materials—if not all of the materials—depending on their origin and how the component parts are put together. It is no use shaking your head, Senator Murphy—the sales tax does apply to the labour cost of gluing and fixing and putting together in the joinery shop. That is well understood and has been confirmed by all appropriate authorities. However, this is not stated in these budget papers, and could be where there is a discrepancy between Senator Cook's sales tax estimate and the figure Senator Schacht provided.

         We all know—ask any joinery around town—whose figure is more correct, and it will certainly be in the order of $1,000 or more. That is the figure that Senator Schacht has quoted. The figure for sales tax on hardware that is in the budget papers is hopelessly inadequate for a normal family home and shows the inability of the government to get down and consult with reality—the people who produce the cupboards for the kitchens and bathrooms.

         This hardware sales tax extension is going to create all sorts of tax audit difficulties between the tax office and the small joinery shop, because, for instance, there is no sales tax on the installation costs in the home. Therefore, the shonky builders will take all their basic materials along to the client's home and try to construct the kitchen or bathroom renovation there and argue, `This is an installation cost, thereby avoiding sales tax. It is not a joinery cost.' There will be problems of avoidance compliance—

It is true that the installation costs are not going to be subject to sales tax, whereas the costs of putting work together in the joinery shop will be subject to sales tax. It is in the joinery operation where cost efficiencies occur—not in putting the fixture together in the client's home.

         If a client orders a kitchen package off the shelf, it has a 12 per cent tax applied on the wholesale or the nominal wholesale price including labour. Admittedly, there are not a lot of builders who engage in this particular type of activity, but there are some—and it is usually the larger ones. Again, this whole activity has the sales tax applicable not only to the material components—the nails and the screws and the bolts, as we were led to believe—but also to the labour components other than for installation.

         I put it to you that we are going to have a new era of backyard builders doing renovation work, doing it outside tax audit verification paperwork, and with a lack of disclosure to the tax office in terms of non-disclosure for income tax purposes. We are going to see a situation of backyarders doing the job and not reporting their income as required. So the government is actually creating a situation of potential tax avoidance. This government believes it has a credible record in trying to wipe out the cash economy. However, I tell you here and now that the government has introduced something in this budget that is going to create a massive problem in terms of the black economy and is going to result in a lot of honest builders losing their jobs.

        The sorry saga of Australia Television International joins that stable of other nobbled horses of David Hill, who was the Managing Director of the ABC and innovator in the area of ABC products and programs. We have already seen, within a period of three months since a major inquiry into the ABC earlier this year, a number of David Hill's innovations to commercialise ABC operations go belly up.

         We had the case of BNA—Broadcast News Australia—which was set up as a rival to AAP. Three months ago it had glowing prospects for the future but now the government is about to wind it up. In his answer today the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) mentioned the prospect of Australia Television International also being in huge difficulties and facing, as one alternative, the possibility of being wound up. One waits with some trepidation to see the fate of pay TV, another venture into the commercial world by the ABC. The prospects of pay TV are under some sort of a cloud given the ABC's track record on commercial operations.

         Initially, the government tried to fund Australia Television International with a seed capital of $5.4 million—which was obviously greatly inadequate—and make up the rest by commercial sponsorship. The marketing program was grossly inadequate in trying to work out whether it had markets and audiences. Sponsorships were supposed to be the main mechanism of finance. While they have not gone down significantly, they have certainly not fulfilled their projections.

         Probably the greatest worry for the parliament is where the whole operation goes from here. One of the rather disturbing options that came out of the Senate hearings was the idea of combining the whole thing with Radio Australia. The danger in doing that is that we are combining a charter core activity, which is funded under the ABC budget, with a commercial activity which is supposed to be in the main funded by commercial sponsorship.

         The cultures of the two organisations are quite incompatible and the government should think very carefully if it is to go down this track. At hearings of estimates committees the government was a little coy about this. I suggest to the government that it might consider a different option altogether. It should declare Australia Television International part of the core activity of the ABC and fund it properly with a $4 million injection per year. It could have some commercial sponsorship as additional revenue. In that way the whole thing could be done properly and not on a shoestring. That will help us to have a window or a showcase on Australian products.

        The Australian people are not satisfied with the government's handling of health; nor should they be. In particular, the continued decrease in the number of people taking private health insurance has to be addressed if our current health system is to survive. The recent decrease in membership to just over 35 per cent should be sounding alarm bells to the government. It is the biggest fall since the March 1994 quarter when a 0.8 per cent fall was recorded.

         In 1994 the drop in private health insurance membership was 2.1 per cent. Calculated on the latest quarterly figures, 1995 will see a further drop of 2.8 per cent. When Labor came to power, private health care membership was over 60 per cent. It has now dropped well past the critical point of 40 per cent referred to by the former health minister, Graham Richardson. Bearing in mind that each percentage point fall represents $100 million extra burden on the public health system, the situation is at crisis point.

         The present Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, is attempting to rescue the public health system by increasing the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent and, in doing so, has broken another Labor promise. This government's reforms have failed low and middle income earners, the very people that the Labor Party claims to represent.

         Interestingly enough, 74 per cent of people felt that senior politicians, such as our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the health minister, should have private health insurance. But why would they have private health cover when this government offers no incentives to encourage private health cover membership. For people in country and regional areas, the nearest hospital or specialist might not have a contract with their health service, so those with private health cover may be prejudiced and not able to utilise fully the current arrangements between the government, hospitals and specialists.

         The reason the Prime Minister cannot be persuaded to join is that the services provided are entirely unattractive, even to him.

         —That is right. The latest OECD report identifies the fact that Labor's health insurance viewpoint is confused and has no real idea about whether private insurance should be a substitute for or a top up of public funding arrangements. What kind of message is this government sending out to people? It is a message that this government is tired, unsure of what it should do with its health care system, and incapable of meeting the problems in health that it has created. It is certainly not meeting the expectations of low and middle income families who are looking to a situation where they can have appropriate, proper and good health cover.

        —by leave—I wish to comment on that briefly. I would prefer that this notice of motion be deferred until tomorrow, in which I case I would support its then being taken as formal. I do so because, as I informed Senator Hill yesterday before the commencement of Senate proceedings, I have no objection at all—in fact, I fully support the idea—to all documentation that is relevant to this issue being properly tabled. The only issue that I have is that I am under advice that there are four categories of documents that are confidential: documents that are commercial-in-confidence; documents that have been asked by the Federal Court to be kept confidential; documents that should be protected under section 47 of the R&amp;D Act; and documents which should be protected under section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

        Rather than amend the motion, I would much prefer to find a way in which we can ensure that any confidentialities that need to be observed here are observed while the Senate is fully apprised of and has access to all the relevant documents that it seeks. I do need some time to be informed by legal opinion as to the best way in which that might be done. Hopefully, I can confer with Senator Hill so we can agree on that. Therefore, the documents that are being sought are produced without invading anyone's privacy or rights under those acts. They are a matter that I would hope to pursue during the course of this day or overnight with Senator Hill so that we can clear this matter up tomorrow.

         At the estimates hearings last week I gave notice that I wished Commonwealth Bank officers to attend the hearing to answer questions relating to staffing matters and headquarter arrangements at the Commonwealth Bank. I gave due notice and heard nothing from the government or the bank until, at the committee hearing, I was informed by Senator Cook that the Commonwealth Bank officers were not in attendance and, rather, that Treasury officers would be available to answer questions relating to the Commonwealth Bank.

          In fact, in the past, of course, the Commonwealth Bank has appeared. The last time that I can recall that happening was in June 1993. Honourable senators might ask: why an estimates hearing and not perhaps a more general and special reference to a Senate committee? The answer is that these are issues which I believe relate to staffing and headquarters matters. They are matters which are of public interest and it is appropriate that these issues be raised before an estimates committee, given the huge level of investment of the Commonwealth in that particular bank, even though the government in due course intends to privatise the bank.

          Of course, ministers are worried about it. Unlike at an ordinary meeting of a Senate committee, the minister will be in attendance. Senator Cook is looking confused. As it happens to be an estimates committee hearing, the minister will be in attendance, and that provides, I suspect, some comfort for the officers of the Commonwealth Bank.

          I have a particular interest in this because I am a Victorian. It is very clear that there have been massive retrenchments of Commonwealth Bank officers in that state and a large number—some hundreds, maybe up to 1,000—of forced redundancies. I am anxious to put straightforward questions to the bank—not to intrude into any issues of commercial-in-confidence but to put straightforward questions to the bank as to precisely what is happening with its staffing arrangements and what has happened in the past—so that the public can be aware of the consequences of this particular bank merger and the people who are Commonwealth Bank officers will have the chance to feel that the Commonwealth parliament is starting to address the very real concerns that they have.

          I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the standing orders make it quite clear that the Senate has the right to require the presence of Commonwealth Bank officials at an estimates hearing. For the sensitivities of those opposite who may be worried that somehow this will lead to an abuse of the system, Commonwealth bank officers have appeared before Senate committees before but, in this particular case, they will have the additional protection of a minister being in attendance.

The government will be arguing that it is an independent organisation, but it is not a matter in the end for the government. The government cannot argue on the one hand that the bank is an independent bank and, on the other hand, instruct the bank not to appear before a Senate estimates committee. That is a dilemma that Senator Robert Ray will have to effectively address.

          The Commonwealth Bank, I believe—and the figures demonstrate this—has got itself into one awful mess in Victoria. It has in an arrogant way been carrying out a massive restructuring of the bank without properly taking the public into its confidence and involving itself in compulsory retrenchments of workers, quite contrary to the promises that were given by Mr Keating and, at the time of the merger, the assurances given by the Commonwealth Bank.

          As there is an informal agreement to keep this debate fairly short, I put it to the Senate that this is a responsible motion. It is a motion that will ensure that there are proper protections available to the Commonwealth Bank officers. At the same time, it will ensure that the Commonwealth Bank officers and the Commonwealth Bank answer valid questions to the Senate as to precisely what is happening with the staffing arrangements at that bank.

          —Let me make it clear that I have no objection to the Commonwealth Bank appearing before that committee. My objection lies in their appearing in the estimates process. The estimates process is about expenditure of government money and the accountability of it; ministers sit at the table and answer the questions—presumably only about the current financial year. But with a degree of agreement and tradition, we let those questions develop right across the line into a whole range of policy areas, quite properly. That is the tradition. What Senator Kemp is doing today is setting a new precedent. He is saying that government businesses enterprises, whatever their nature, should appear in the estimates process.

          —That is what you are saying. You are saying that a government business enterprise whose employees are not public servants should be brought before the estimates committee and be cross-examined. I say to you, Senator Kemp: if you want to talk to the Commonwealth Bank about all its plans, do it in the context of its annual report to this parliament. Then, quite properly, you can ask exactly the same questions. I am sure no-one is going to object to your asking those questions—with no minister present—because they have to report and be responsible to this parliament.

          Things are not the same with the Commonwealth Bank now as they may have been five years ago. The bank is now 49 per cent owned by shareholders. So you want to bring non-public servants into a process that traditionally has ministers and public servants, and cross-examine them in that context when they have got responsibilities under such things as the Companies Act. It is no use saying at this stage, Senator Kemp, that you want to quarantine this. I believe you want to, but I have also seen the way things start to move out.

          My view is that you are entitled to cross-examine the Commonwealth Bank in the context of its annual report. You can do it any month of the year—you can do it tonight, you can do it next week—and you can use your powers on a Senate committee to bring whoever you want to into the room and ask them whatever questions you want. Obviously, if you stray into those areas of commercial-in-confidence, you will not get an answer. Let me tell you this: no minister is going to be mug enough to sit in the same room and take total responsibility for the veracity of arguments and evidence that they do not have any fundamental responsibility for. If some officer, be it of the Commonwealth Bank or of some other GBE, misleads, why should a minister be responsible when they are not within his employ?

          For heaven's sake! You are setting a precedent here that you are going to live to regret. You have an easy opportunity to get exactly the answers you want. What you are doing is picking the wrong process—you are picking the estimates committee process rather than the powers those committees have been generously granted under consideration of annual reports. You might say that standing orders say that that is a mistake, frankly. In my view, that is a translation—because of the restructuring of the committee system—that left powers in that were never conceived, or believed, to apply to estimates committees.

          —Yes, I did. I remember that I was also involved in all the discussions around the restructuring of the committee system—all of them. It was made clear by us that Senate estimates committees did not have the power to bring witnesses. Leaving that aside, what you are doing today is saying that a minister in an estimates committee process has to have sitting next to him witnesses whom he does not employ. If you expect the minister to then be responsible for the answers they give, when he has no power to know whether they are true or false or otherwise, you are setting a very bad precedent.

          We have made the offer of a totally alternative, legitimate process covered by standing orders in which you can pursue these questions this week, next week or the week after. Why won't you? What is so magical about the estimates process? Estimates are about government expenditure, the bills that authorise government expenditure, and accountability therein. That is what they are about. It has nothing to do with cross-examining or witch-hunting GBEs—nothing at all. I believe that what you are doing here is in breach of all of the agreements we had—not that you were necessarily party to them—when we redesigned this committee system to make it work effectively.

          You believe that you will be in office within a year. If you carry this today, I look forward to you setting the precedent where every government GBE comes into the estimates process. You will totally regret it. It is a short-term opportunist gain, and it is unnecessary because there is an alternative approach equally able to be exercised by any Senate committee; that is, the consideration of an annual report. If I were the minister in charge of that estimates committee, I would refuse—and rightly refuse—to appear before an estimates committee for people who are not in my employ giving evidence. I know short-term opportunism will probably prevail again today. All I can say is that one day I will say, `I told you so.'

If you have got no power over the officers of a particular department, it is a bit bizarre to refuse them permission to attend an estimates committee.

          It is quite possible for any estimates committee to call witnesses. It is not compulsory, I believe, for a minister to attend; it is the choice of the minister if he wishes to protect a particular area under the minister's portfolio. But if the particular minister whose portfolio related to that government business enterprise chose not to attend, then so be it. That would probably give those senators on the committee access to more honest replies from the people whom they are questioning.

          In my estimation, it is wrong for totally owned government business enterprises to not have a clear line of accountability to those people whose resources they are using; that is, taxpayers. Whatever you and the government like to say, if they are wholly owned government business enterprises, it is taxpayers' funds that they are using. The way they use them interacts with various budget items. In fact, there are particular areas in a budget estimates program—the Defence program springs to mind—in which the interactions of governments with government business enterprises ought to be questioned.

It is possible, according to the answer given to me during debate on the corporations bills, for the Senate or for the estimates committee to call a government business enterprise to present evidence to them. If that is not possible, then perhaps we all ought to refer to the

          I do not wish to speak for very long, but it is quite clear that over time, whilst we still have government business enterprises which are wholly owned by the government—it is not the government that owns them; it is in reality the taxpayers of Australia—they ought to be accountable to someone. The minimum responsibility of accountability in relation to major expenditures which may impact on revenue ought to be on the elected representatives of the parliament, especially when there are government plans to sell most government business enterprises and their actions impact on the price that a government business enterprise eventually gets on the market.

          It may not be that the Greens agree with the wholesale sell-off of government business enterprises, but if the actions of government business enterprises may be impacting adversely on their selling price, that of course should be of interest to the taxpayer, who will be impacted upon by the outcome. Therefore government business enterprises have the right to, and should in a reasonable situation be required to, present evidence to a Senate estimates committee if the elected majority of this place should so require them to.

This motion was worded in an attempt to try to get a consensus in this chamber that we should proceed down this direction.

          I welcome the concession by Senator Ray that the Commonwealth Bank has a responsibility to report to this parliament and that the Senate is perfectly entitled to summons the bank before the relevant committee and request that it respond to issues raised in the annual report. I think that is an important concession and is certainly welcomed. I thought we could bring them before the estimates committee process because the estimates committee process is now in train. My questions were particularly specific and it seemed to me that the fairest and easiest way to move in this direction and to address any concerns of commercial-in-confidence was to use this process as the appropriate vehicle.

        Science in Australia is in a very parlous state as a direct consequence of the attitude and policies of this Labor government. Without a rapid and significant change in this attitude it is clear that basic and strategic scientific research will continue to decline in amount and quality thus removing the very base on which much of our applied research depends. Even more importantly, the role of science as a cultural building block of a scientifically literate society will be further weakened.

         The fundamental fault with this government is that it has conceived many activities which have a wide social context, such as education and scientific research—and, one might add, even the arts—merely as elements in its economic program. Education is about more than shaping the human cogs to fit into an economic rationalist's dream of his perfect but mechanistic and inhuman world. Science is about more than being the handmaiden of a more productive industry and, like the arts and general education, is about the creations and satisfactions of the human spirit and the understanding of the world in which we live.

         This is not to say that education, science and the arts have no place to play in economic life or profitability, they do, but it is to say that their importance extends far beyond this narrower focus and to attempt, as the government has done, to confine these activities in this way is to lose much of their value. Paradoxically, the spontaneous and the creative, the serendipitous, provide the wellspring from which the applied and the technically profitable derive. Thus these elements which have become so neglected under this government are the very elements which will continue to sustain the technological efforts of Australian industry in the future.

         Perhaps just one indicator of the very low status given to science by this government is that on budget night several weeks ago the computers in our parliamentary offices were provided with over four megabytes of information on the budget at exactly 8 p.m. immediately after the budget speech had concluded. This material consisted of nine files, the contents of two of which were not immediately available. A quick search—and one of the advantages of computers is that you can do this—of this four megabytes of material contained not a single mention of science. The word science did not appear once in any of that material. And, incidentally, the word environment appeared only once in relation to the natural environment.

         Turning now to some of the figures: it is estimated that Australia spends approximately 1.3 per cent of its GDP on scientific research. I know the government will try to maintain that the figure is 1.5 per cent, but this depends on allocating an arbitrary percentage of higher education funding to research.

         It is doubtful whether the percentage used can be supported. For while the total amount going into higher education has increased since the Australian Labor Party came to government in 1983, the numbers of students have risen at a faster rate, so the amount available per student has actually declined and the pressure on university lecturers and research scientists has resulted in less money and time for research.

         Talk to any university lecturer in science and this is precisely what you will find. According to the Australian vice-chancellors, in 1991 the per capita student allocation in universities had fallen 11 per cent compared with 1983 and was still eight per cent less in 1993. It was 10 per cent less than it was in 1975. Thus the percentage of funds available out of this pot specifically for research from the higher education allocation is certainly less than the arbitrary 30 per cent, which is the figure that I am sure the government will shortly use.

         Comparison of the entry scores of students into 36 Australian universities shows that while medicine attracts the best students, science is among the least attractive. On a scale of one to five in which one is the highest, medicine scored one in every university while science did not score one in a single university. In other words, we have not a single university in this country with a reputation in science so high that it attracts the best students. Put another way, while medicine takes 99.8 per cent of its students from the upper quartile and none from the lower quartile, science takes only 22 per cent from the upper quartile and 24 per cent from the lowest. On the one to five scale, averaged across all universities, science scored 4.2, only marginally above nursing which scored the lowest at 4.5.

         One measure of the output of scientific research is the number of papers published. However, the quantity of published papers varies widely and a much better measure of productivity is the rate of citation of papers. This is the number of times that other scientists quote a published paper; that is, its use of results to build on to their own output. A paper which breaks new ground and opens new fields for inquiry may be cited many hundreds of times by later workers, whereas one that fills a relatively trivial corner of an established discipline may be cited only a few times or not at all. The citation rate is thus a direct measure of the quality and importance of science and of the published work.

         Burke and Butler show that, while Australia's share of world scientific publications fell marginally in 1992-93 from 1.95 per cent to 1.9 per cent, our share of citations fell more steeply from 1.95 per cent to 1.55 per cent and that this was especially steep in the years 1988-91. In other words, there has been a very steep decline in the quality of Australian science since 1987.

         Based on a calculated relative citation index, these authors showed that, averaged across all disciplines, there has been an eight per cent decline in the index—but with a wide variation between disciplines. When asked about this decline, some witnesses at our CSIRO inquiry last year pointed out that this may be due to the fact that more of their work was directed towards local problems. However, in the agricultural area, Australia's work has held up quite well.

         Returning very briefly to funding, one finds that Australia spends relatively small amounts on its science. While the ratio of government to private funding favours the government, compared with that in many other countries, the absolute amount as well as the amount expressed as a percentage of GDP does not compare favourably with that in many other countries. Non-government spending on research has been growing strongly in recent years, but from a very small base. Government has not recognised that most of the very large firms in Australia are foreign and conduct most of their research overseas.

         The US Congress, late last year, adopted a science appropriation budget of 2.6 per cent of GDP, exactly twice that of Australia. One might remark, in passing, that South Korea has a budget of five per cent of GDP, which it spends on science. Compared with a number of other countries, we are not performing well in terms of our expenditure, the education of our scientists, the opportunities given to science or the amount of basic and strategic research which is being conducted in this country.

         The other cheap shot in Senator Coulter's opening remarks was the reference to budget night. He said that on 9 May, budget night—a Tuesday—there was no reference in the budget to science. Senator Coulter, you would know that the document I am now waving in the Senate was tabled on the Thursday after budget. It is a statement by me, as the responsible minister. It is headed, `Science and Technology: budget statement 1995-96.' It runs to over 180 pages. It was not out on budget night but it was out on the Thursday after, in the normal manner of these things. That paper is a comprehensive statement of the government's position on science. Dare I say that it was a cheap shot to say it was not given on the night. You omitted to tell the chamber that it was given two days later and was comprehensive, stand alone, and open to criticism and analysis.

         One of the reasons the government cannot be condemned in the way the motion proposes is that it is now public knowledge, and has been for many months, that we intend to bring down a major statement which will address science and technology capacity in this nation. We intend to do that in August or September this year under the heading `Innovation Statement'. We have had over a thousand consultations about it with leading companies, organisations and individuals around Australia in all capital cities and major provincial centres. We have published a book reporting all of the input. The major organisations consulted and the science community are manifold but I cite particularly the CSIRO and the Academy of Science. Both have been consulted and both have given their views.

At the annual dinner of the Academy of Science I was moved to observe—it was an observation, not a criticism—that the content of the innovation statement, in terms of what scientists had been able to put forward, was still a bit light on from the science community and I asked scientists to please consider what further information they could provide.

         When we hear talk about lack of government commitment we can cite the international arbitrators, the journals that comment on world science quality and excellence. We can look at what we have done in the budget. In Senator Kernot's response to the budget and in the response by Senator Hill, the shadow minister for science, on the Thursday following the budget, neither Senator Kernot nor Senator Hill mentioned the subject of science. That may be some indication of the priority that both the parties, which seem hell-bent on condemning our government for its record, assign to the issue of science. No-one chose to mention the subject on the very day we had put down this 180-page document saying what our record was; and what the future goals were.

It is on the public record that on many occasions I have clearly said, and I clearly state it now in the context of this motion, that Australia—and the government of Australia, as long as we are in power—is committed to proper expenditure on long-term fundamental research in this country and to developing a very active and strong applied research community. That has been the goal. We are moving towards it and we are delivering on it.

         How do I know that? Let me go to another international arbiter of performance by countries. We are a member of the OECD. What has it said in its most recent figures? Referring to GERD, gross expenditure on research and development—an index the OECD keeps and which includes scientific expenditure—Australia has moved up in the list of OECD countries from, as I recall, 16th to 13th on overall expenditure in the economy, as ranked in the OECD on research and development.

         But what is the government's proportion of that expenditure?

We have leapt over a number of other countries. We now have only three countries ahead of us in terms of total public sector expenditure on research and development.

On those clear figures, it is idle—in fact, it is improper—to criticise the government's performance. I would have thought that, with his reputation and standing in the science community, Senator Coulter would be praising that performance and holding it up as a shining example. Perhaps he would even be attending an estimates committee from time to time and putting the CSIRO scientists under scrutiny to see how, for their part, they are delivering on this sort of expenditure.

         I cannot conclude the presentation on the OECD statistics without referring to the private sector. Frankly, a lot of poor comment has been made about the private sector's performance. It is true that the private sector was ranked 17th overall in the OECD on research and development expenditure. It moved up because, in the private sector in the last two OECD years, Australia increased expenditure by 28 per cent. That is a major increase in the private sector. It has moved up to the ranking of 16th. The direction of change is for further improvement to be captured and made. The private sector needs to be commended on that.

         It needs to be recognised that we are undergoing massive economic restructuring in this country. A key element of that economic restructuring has been building a manufacturing and services base for this economy so that we are not entirely reliant on agricultural and mining exports and we have a manufacturing dimension. Every economy in the world that is ahead of us on private sector expenditure on R&amp;D is a major manufacturing or services economy. These things go together. Where there is major manufacturing, there is major research and development. As we are evolving a manufacturing base, so are we evolving higher levels of private sector expenditure on research and development.

         But the motion goes back to our performance. While we are talking about figures, it is worthwhile comparing the Labor government's expenditure on research and development with the expenditure of the previous Liberal government in this area. It is worthwhile because voters may make a decision about this. In real terms, expenditure by this government is 67 per cent higher than the same level of expenditure under the previous Liberal government. That is, expenditure has increased in real terms by 67 per cent under us compared with under the Liberals. In dollar terms, $1.7 billion more in real money is available to Australian science under us than was available under the previous Liberal government.

         Basic long-term research, the subject of this urgency motion today, increased in that period by 62 per cent in real terms. Condemnation of the government obviously involves massive condemnation of the opposition, if the motion is to be held to be true. Therefore, if the opposition votes for it, it will be condemning itself by way of extending the principle that it has put. If it does, it will need to explain that. Senator Hill will be speaking next; he may be able to do it. He is quite an articulate spokesperson, but it may well be beyond his capable articulation to explain how the performance of the previous Liberal government, which is 62 per cent poorer than ours, is somehow to be held up as a shining example.

         In the moment left to me, one of the other issues covered in Senator Coulter's comments today is students and the attraction of science for students in the Australian system. We have been conducting a major science awareness program around Australia. I hope that we can continue to expand it in the future to encourage students to see the virtue of scientific study. It is wrong to criticise performance by where the benchmark tests are set in terms of entry levels. Look at the top 10 per cent of all students at Australian universities. Twenty-five per cent of them are studying science and technology issues. Irrespective of entry level qualifications, a high level of the very best students go into this discipline. Senator Coulter should look at that figure.

There is no doubt that the issue of the government's failures in relation to science and technology policy is of public interest and very significant national interest. It is important that the debate take place in the parliament, because we all have a responsibility to communicate to the Australian public not only the extent of the government's shortcoming in this area but also how critical to the future prosperity, security, wellbeing and quality of life of all Australians the issue of science and technology is.

         This area has not received sufficient priority not only from this government but from governments that have preceded it. To that extent, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), in seeking to address the past, had some basis for expressing concern. This country as a whole has understated the importance of science and technology to our  future. It is time that we redress that issue.

         Senator Coulter raised the issue of the profile of science in the eyes of the government. The best way to assess that is really where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other senior ministers put science. We can see how they assess their priorities by their major speeches. How many major speeches have we heard from the Prime Minister on the issue of science? We hear him talking about his dream of a republic, Australia in Asia and various other things. But do we ever hear him talking about the importance of science to the future of this country?

Go back to the years of his predecessor, Mr Hawke. I can remember his so-called famous science speech in 1989. From the image of this government in the community, we can see at a glance that science and technology does not rate highly. If we can do something from a parliamentary perspective to change that, that is for the good.

         Look at the priority of the government in terms of its outlay of funding. In the last budget, for example, science and technology funding declined by 0.4 per cent in real terms. The government sets its priority by a decline in funding. Total outlays on general research in 1995-96 are estimated to decrease by 1.5 per cent in real terms. That is a further demonstration of the government's priority.

         Look at CSIRO, our foremost scientific institution. It is a body of which we all should be proud for its record in the past and achievements for the benefit of Australia. In this budget for 1995-96, its appropriations declined by 13 per cent in real terms. That provides some demonstration of the government's commitment to that very fine scientific institution. We are reminded that the government decided to cut CSIRO's funding by $60 million in three years. That is not a government that is really committed to that institution or to science in this country. This Prime Minister has no trouble in finding huge sums of money—hundreds of millions of dollars—for projects to which he gives priority. He did this with the recent cultural statement. I am not knocking the fact that he dropped into South Australia the other day and found money for the airport and a new tunnel under Mount Lofty.

It is prepared to see the end of the Commission for the Future. In the estimates the other night, the government said that, with a bit of luck, Monash University or the private sector might take over the funding. But when we questioned how much private sector money was being attracted into the Commission for the Future, it was negligible. So what that demonstrates to me is that the government has made the decision that the Commission for the Future can go.

But this government also, by its policies of running down the research infrastructure in universities, needs some $120-odd million a year to bring it back to where it was.

It is, at this moment, a depressed environment, and it is depressed because of a lack of commitment and a lack of application of this government. It is about time it improved its game.

We would see a $134 million cut over a triennium from the CSIRO if that sort of policy were implemented. We would see a $62 million cut in terms of the Australian Research Council.

Those opposite can table all the books they like in this place, but there is no lead from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) down in talking up science and technology.

         The government does not seem to appreciate the incredible opportunities that are there for the taking for nations which are scientifically and technologically advanced. The government has done nothing to create a science culture in Australia. There is no way in which the government could be seen to be publicly promoting science as the way forward for Australia. While our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region are forging ahead in science and technology, spending more than we do on R&amp;D, the government has cut CSIRO's funding, put the squeeze on university research and failed spectacularly to kick-start the private sector R&amp;D.

         Only last month I visited Taiwan as part of a space delegation led by my colleague Senator Chapman. I have seen at first hand Taiwan's commitment to science and technology. It is very important that people note that Taiwan is on the same longitude as Australia and we have some very important common areas of interest. To say that I was impressed with what was happening in Taiwan would be a massive understatement.

But no thanks to this government! It must be embarrassing for the minister and for the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht—who is responsible for the space program—that it was a coalition senator, Senator Chapman, who initiated this delegation to Taiwan over a long period of time.

         Finally, I want to comment on a statement that Senator Cook tabled at that estimates hearing. The minister states that it is wrong for non-government senators to talk about a $60 million cut to CSIRO's funding because, trotting out the old argument, he says that the $60 million was one-off funding which CSIRO always knew would come to an end. What a pity the minister did not mention the fact that, in the years prior to 1989, the Labor government ripped the guts out of science funding and it was only when the scientists protested long and hard that something was done about it.

         The former minister for science, the member for Lalor, Mr Barry Jones, convinced the government to have a change of heart, and in 1989 the science statement effectively restored the $60 million to that funding. Senator Cook is conveniently ignoring what happened pre-1989, but the opposition will not buy that. The minister stated that 25 per cent of the top 10 per cent of tertiary students are enrolled in science courses. There is no doubt that we have very bright students enrolling for science degrees who go on to work in CSIRO. But the minister is ignoring other vital information. The fact is that only 25 per cent of students enrolling are from the top 25 per cent and 25 per cent are from the bottom, as Senator Coulter has said.

         The thing about knowledge is that you cannot tell what it will be good for before you have done it. The implications for basic research only become clear once you have done it. If we have any pretence to being a clever country we must have basic research. The areas of commercially productive application are obvious to most scientists, especially if they are obvious enough to convince bureaucrats. Every nation has identified them and is working on them. The areas where real jumps will be made are the areas where applications are not obvious because no one is looking. The people who do the basic work are liable to be the first people to see the hidden implications.

         CSIRO funding is mostly funding for application. Corporate research is all about application. The only sphere for basic research is universities.

It means simply that the success of research is increasingly measured by its immediate economic return. As this becomes a measure by which research is judged and funds become available, less and less basic research will be done. Universities become the research arms of industry, and commercial research players in their own right.

Science is a communal activity and the sharing of ideas and information is central to the advance of our common understanding, undertaken ultimately for our common good. The reward of a scientist has always been recognition by her or his peers rather than monetary gain. The push for patenting undermines that and works against the common good.

        The role of government is therefore, first and foremost, a strategic one: to ensure policies across the range of portfolio areas are integrated to provide the optimal framework to encourage and facilitate research and development. In present circumstances there is a significant role for government in removing the impediments to research and development which are inherent in present policy settings.

        The culture statement makes this point:

        If there is any evidence that the government has not done that, let them put it on the table. We certainly have achieved those objectives. The statement further reads:

        —This matter has already taken up much of the Senate's time. Senator Chamarette has actively pursued the same subject matter for most of last week and previously in the estimates hearing of 26 May 1995. The senator clearly continues to believe that some secret deal has occurred between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), ATSIC and other parties. The fact that no deal did occur and the fact that the senator has no evidence of such a deal has not stopped her, with the support of those opposite, from wasting the time of this place and from continuing to make unfounded accusations.

        Let me again make it very clear that the Prime Minister gave no undertaking or made any decision in respect of how much ATSIC should set aside for land acquisition in the Northern Territory. The ATSIC board made its own decision on how it would allocate its funds. In many ways this tabling motion is a farce. It is clear from her own admissions that Senator Chamarette has already obtained a copy of a number of  documents which should have been treated with confidence. She would therefore be well aware that there was no secret deal or any secret agreement. Certainly, those papers did refer to discussions with the government and to negotiations. These discussions did not embrace financial allocations but referred to parallel programs and limitations of the ILC land purchases being claimable under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. There is nothing sinister or secret in those discussions.

        Senator Chamarette and those opposite would have us believe that ATSIC's recent decision to set aside $10 million in each of the next two years for land acquisition in the Northern Territory was the child of this so-called secret deal. I am advised that considerable discussion took place at the board meeting with particular debate on whether funds should be set aside for the Northern Territory and, if so, the level of those funds. This level of discussion and debate within an independent board, which occurred, is inconsistent with Senator Chamarette's hypothesis.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Clearly, the ATSIC board was concerned that under section 191U of the legislation establishing the ILC, any land purchased through the ILC funding cannot be claimed under the Northern Territory land rights act. This means that Aboriginal groups wishing to acquire land and subsequently claim such land for conversion to inalienable freehold title under the Northern Territory legislation can only do so if the necessary funding support for the acquisition is not provided by the ILC. Therefore, until 1997, which is the sunset time for claims under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, ATSIC will be positioned to continue to provide funding for acquisition in the Northern Territory.

        Despite the illogical nature of the arguments put forward over the last week, the government acknowledges that Senator Chamarette has obtained numerical support for her motion. Therefore, the government has agreed to table a range of documents. Additionally, I put on the public record for those opposite that their support for Senator Chamarette's motion will result in the tabling of a number of documents which will breach confidences understood by various parties during negotiations on the ILC and the ILF.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I also put on the public record that those opposite clearly do not recognise or accept the principle that consultation processes leading to policy development are normally a matter of confidence between the various parties. Many of the documents contain material in the nature of giving or receiving of opinion, advice and recommendations, which are a fundamental part of the deliberative process of both ATSIC and the government. Additionally, the public disclosure of the views of individuals and groups put to ATSIC and government on a confidential basis may well impair the negotiating effectiveness of the commission and governments in the future.

        The fact is that those opposite are willing to put all of that at risk and to establish a standard for which they themselves will be judged should they ever come to government. What is all the more disappointing is that they are prepared to put all that at risk because Senator Chamarette has a false suspicion.

        As forecast yesterday, it is not proposed to table certain categories of documents. In particular, documents have been excluded which canvass matters before cabinet or which disclose any deliberation or decision of cabinet. In any event, none of the excluded documents reveal any discussions of a deal of the kind alleged by Senator Chamarette. Normally the government would not release legal advice provided to it by its solicitors on the ground of legal professional privilege. However, due to the gravity of the allegations made by the senator, the privilege in this instance is waived. The basis on which documents are being withheld is consistent with official guidelines and consistent with the government's general position in respect of such matters.

         I will not be spending a great deal of time taking note of this Auditor-General's report. I felt it is necessary because members of this Senate would know that I am usually the last person to stand up and congratulate the Department of Defence. I have been very concerned about levels of expenditure and accountability and policies and programs. However, I felt it is only fair that in areas where Defence is doing the right thing that I also do the right thing and acknowledge that it is.

          In relation to the first part of this report—the project audit on energy management in Defence—the Auditor-General's office has made a fairly critical assessment of the way Defence has undertaken its obligations in relation to energy saving across departments. It is critical; it is not 100 per cent positive. But Defence has started that program. It is not something I can say about many other departments. The important thing also is that Defence has implemented or taken steps to implement the majority of the recommendations in the audit report. This seems to coincide with the information that I received on asking questions of Defence during the recent estimates hearings about its defence housing program. In relation to housing and regional development, I had already asked about the entire government's housing program and its efforts to implement energy standards within its program and was given very short shift in saying, `We don't know if we can do this. It might cost more money. We really don't want to be prescriptive on the environment.' For people who know, most of this can be regarded as nonsense.

         An energy audit was done and only now, more than two years later, is the recommended system being installed. So we are actually delaying saving money.

          At a recent estimates committee hearing I asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) why performance is so poor in the area of integrating such things as energy goals or greenhouse goals into other departments. He said that it was not the role of Canberra to be involved with demand management. I reminded him that demand management was one of the responsibilities of his department. He changed the wording after that. He realised that perhaps he had said something pretty silly. In fact, we have this role. We could be doing it. Government could be leading the way instead of dragging its feet and costing the taxpayers money every time it delays implementing its own policies of demand management in its own facilities. So, well done, Defence for starting. If you can do it, so can everybody else. Let us see all the other departments getting on board. It is about time.

I think praise is due to Defence, not only in the energy management field, but also in the environmental field where, for many, many years, long before environmental concerns became fashionable, Defence took a long-sighted view and recognised its responsibilities in maintaining training areas in land that it had around the country.

          The point should be made that there are limited opportunities for energy savings within Defence. Certainly with respect to the purchase of new equipment and the design of buildings, those are matters that can be dealt with at the outset, but military platforms per se are designed for specific performance and fuel efficiency and energy efficiency are not the prime concerns. The other problem that the department has is that there is not much predictability from year to year.

          Defence has estimated that the ten ships will now cost $5837 million in current (December 1994) prices, an increase of $1471 million over the base price established during April 1988. Of this amount, $1294 million is for price increases and exchange rate variations related to the prime contract with Transfield. The remaining $177 million relates to real increases associated with the larger gun, New Zealand spares, currency swap adjustments and a reallocation of travel funds.

         Most of the report deals with that minor amount of a few hundred million dollars, and ignores the increase of $1,471 million, which is a huge increase—33 per cent-plus—in the contract price. The government and Transfield go around boasting about how we have got a fixed price contract for the ships, yet here we have the first evidence presented in public, that I know of, of an increase in real terms—because the taxpayer has to pay for this—of 33 per cent in the cost of a ship.

          When we look at the history of this Anzac frigate program, we see that there were two contenders in it: a very good Dutch design, and the Blohm &amp; Voss Meko design which was accepted. The price differential, when the contract was accepted and we were told that the contract was awarded purely on price, was minuscule—I think it was about $5 million or $10 million per ship. That was the difference. I said at the time that would be eroded through the life of the contract, and so it has come to pass. We have got this increase of $1,471 million, about 33 1/3 per cent, giving us a figure of around $600 million for each of the ships.

          Recently, the government announced that there was going to be a major increase in the number of weapons sensors and weapons on the Anzacs. This is because the ships, as they were contracted for, are absolutely vulnerable. Again, the government was told that at the time. The philosophy that the government adopted was that the ships would be designed for, but not fitted with, what are really essential weapons sensors and armaments and the electronic command and control systems to integrate those, which systems are essential for the survival of the ship in a hostile environment.

          The ship that was bought because it was cheaper than a better competitor has now blown out to $600 million, and it may well be on the way to requiring another $100 million to be spent on it. Even if we take the figure of $600 million, and given the fact that defence resources are so short and will never be adequate for our needs, you have really got to question what we could have done with $600 million for one ship and consider the defence capability that we could have bought in other areas. For $600 million, we could have bought a great deal more flexibility; we could have bought something that was far more potent; and we could have bought something that was far more survivable than an Anzac ship. Putting that in contrast, we could have bought a squadron of F18 aircraft.

          While the roles of ships and aircraft are not the same, the effectiveness of alternative weapons systems—which is the way you have got to consider it in today's modern warfare—has to be considered when you have got limited resources. The Anzac ship program is very expensive, with limited defence capabilities for us. I am very disappointed that the Auditor-General chose not to explore this rate increase of one-third in the contract price and moved on to what was really the minor part—the increase in armament.

          The third and final part of the Auditor-General's report deals with overseas visits by Defence officers. It makes the point that, in the last financial year, 1,746 Department of Defence officers travelled overseas for a cost of $15.8 million. Most of the people in this parliament do travel overseas, but that average is a figure of $9,000 per trip. I would think that is a very high figure for what is probably an average of about a 10- or 14-day visit overseas. I would have thought that we could have got better value for money and shaved some thousands of dollars off that.

          I do not expect the officers of the Public Service to stay in the equivalent of Salvation Army hostels or anything like that. I think a reasonable standard of accommodation and reasonable food is what they are due. But I think all that could have been met for an average figure considerably below $9,000 a visit. The Auditor-General does not comment on that point, but on page 41 of the report he makes this point:

         The Department's documentation cites a longstanding government requirement that only those overseas visits that are strictly essential to the requirements of specific work programs necessary for the conduct of Government business should proceed. In practice, however, this appears not to be the criterion, with some visits approved as desirable rather than essential.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, the Auditor-General is saying to Defence: `You are not conforming to the government guidelines which apply to all departments, not only Defence, and business overseas should be crucial to the program that it is related to and should not be taken on the basis of being desirable only.' Clearly, in the view of the Auditor-General, Defence has broken those guidelines and not observed the rule that visits have to be strictly necessary. I would be very surprised if all government departments were not similarly breaking that rule, and I do not think that Defence ought to be singled out on that. Clearly, where funds are short—and this applies to all departments—and when rules are set, they should be obeyed.

In particular, I express a little concern that the Auditor-General has decided not to proceed to a full audit of some of the matters raised. For example, in the Anzac ship matter, which Senator MacGibbon has just dealt with, the Auditor-General, on page 32, paragraph 1.8, concludes:

         I notice also that, as a result of a study, the audit office decided not to proceed with a full audit of the procedures of overseas visits by Defence officers. The other matter which is included in this report, and which has nothing to do with defence, is the national landcare program. The audit office decided not to proceed with an audit of this and decided that further audit coverage should be deferred to enable implementation of provisions of a new arrangement between the Commonwealth and states. I do hope that it is not a shortage of funds that is prompting the audit office not to proceed with those audits.

          —As Senator MacGibbon says, maybe the audit office is so busy paying such a large amount of rent to the Labor Party for its new building that it has not got any money left over. I do hope that these decisions are based entirely on audit criteria rather than on shortage of funds, although there is no doubt, from what the previous Auditor-General particularly has been saying so publicly, that the government does appear to have been squeezing the Auditor-General for money, clearly not liking the sort of supervision of government spending that the Auditor-General's office, particularly under the previous Auditor-General, has been implementing.

          There is no doubt that the role of the Auditor-General is absolutely crucial to effective management of the enormous volumes of government spending which are financed by taxpayers. Just as the government has shown an extraordinary reluctance to finance the activities of the Auditor-General, and a great enthusiasm to limit its powers, so the government has similarly tried to restrict the capacity of Senate committees to examine the expenditures of the government. In the latest budget figures, there has been an extraordinary cut in the expenses available to Senate committees to perform this kind of similar audit function—to examine the expenditure of government departments and agencies.

          However, there is no doubt that the audit that the Auditor-General has conducted in these specific matters is of some benefit, although I must say that I share Senator MacGibbon's concern about the substantial increase in the Anzac frigate program. What is evident here is that the first ship, HMAS
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Anzac

          , is scheduled for delivery on 29 March 1996, and the other nine are to follow it at almost yearly intervals until 2005.

          I wonder what further cost rises may well take place. As Senator MacGibbon said, although Defence has now estimated that the 10 ships will cost $5,837 million in December 1994 prices, there is clearly some risk that by the time the last one is delivered in the year 2005—in 10 years time—there will be considerable further cost increases, hopefully not in real terms. This is the real problem. If there are increases after we take inflation into account, then we have serious problems. It is of some concern that the $1.47 billion increase Senator MacGibbon noted had been built up since the April 1988 basic price. I note that the Auditor-General's report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Of this amount, $1294 million is for price increases and exchange rate variations related to the prime contract with Transfield.

        </para>
        <para>
         That is something like a 30 per cent increase. However, the Auditor-General points out:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There had been some 600 contract amendments to the prime contract at the time of audit. The Project Office has a set of business rules with Transfield that have restricted real . . . cost increases on the prime contract, to costs associated with the Torpedo Decoy System upgrade and the purchase of additional spares.

        <para>
         However, I must say that it seems hard to go from that conclusion to the one the Auditor-General next comes to—that is, that `there was no need to proceed with a full performance audit of contract amendment procedures' because clearly there have been very significant rises.

          I want to deal very briefly with the question of overseas visits. As Senator MacGibbon pointed out, an average cost of $9,000 for overseas visits by Defence personnel does seem fairly large when visits to nearby countries—which one would expect would involve minimal expenditure in terms of travel cost, such as to Papua New Guinea or New Zealand—are included now in this total. It is curious that at some stage they were not. There was confusion about whether they should be included. This is a matter that the Auditor-General has brought to the attention of the parliament, because there seemed to be different criteria used by different sections of Defence about what constituted an overseas visit. The audit office states:

        </para>

         I would have thought that that would have underlined the need for some kind of performance audit. In any event, the Auditor-General states:

        <para>
         They are the main points raised in this matter; although, as I said, I do hope that in these matters and with the national landcare program the audit office's decision not to proceed with detailed audits certainly is based on auditing criteria and not on the shortage of funds. The government continually appears determined to squeeze the audit office for money.

        DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill amends Defence legislation for the following purposes: to enable senior acting appointments to be made at ministerial level rather than by the Governor-General; to replace provisions under which officers hold their appointments at the Governor-General's pleasure; to implement recommendations of the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review; to extend the home loan assistance application deadline for a limited group of former members; and to ensure that the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme complies with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The bill also amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to fill a gap in the entitlement to compensation for the unintended consequences of medical treatment provided at Commonwealth expense.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I will deal with these matters in turn.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first amendment will enable the appointment of officers to act as the Chief of the Defence Force, Vice Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force to be made by a minister rather than the Governor-General. This will streamline the procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden from the Governor-General.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second group of amendments concerns retirement and termination of appointments. At present, the Defence Act, Naval Defence Act and Air Force Regulations provide that officers hold their appointment at the Governor-General's pleasure. Under the existing provisions, officers could be retired or have their appointments terminated at any time and on any grounds or for no grounds at all. The Defence Force is the last major Commonwealth career group subject to the concept of holding office at pleasure. This concept is no longer appropriate to a career service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act replace the current blanket provisions with provisions that specify the grounds on which an officer can be retired early or have an appointment terminated. The amendments also introduce specific procedures for the management initiated early retirement of officers, and enable the promotion of senior officers on limited tenure where they accept a promotion on that condition. Corresponding amendments will be made to the Air Force Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While these amendments will give the Defence Organisation management flexibility, they also increase the level of protection available to affected officers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the proposed provisions an officer could only be retired early or have an appointment terminated where one of the specified grounds is made out, or where the officer is subject to the management initiated early retirement procedures.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Where appropriate, an officer to be retired early or have an appointment terminated would be given the reasons in writing for the proposed action and an opportunity to show cause why it should not proceed. The main exception would be where the period of fixed term appointment had expired (often referred to as Short Service Commissions). Affected officers would also have the right to lodge an application for redress of grievance under the Defence Force Regulations and are entitled to submit a complaint to the Defence Force Ombudsman.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similar safeguards apply to the management initiated early retirement procedures. In addition, I would emphasise that management initiated early retirement would only occur after all attempts to redeploy or retrain an affected officer had been exhausted and would be accompanied by the offer of a financial package.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The third group of amendments is to the Defence Force Discipline Act, which provides a scheme of discipline for all members of the Defence Force. When the legislation came into operation, provision was made for a Board of Review to review its operation after three years. The Board found that the scheme was generally adequate but made a number of recommendations to enhance its operation. The proposed amendments to the act would achieve this and also bring the act into line with Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions for the investigation of offences.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Perhaps the key amendments are those which enable the appointment of discipline officers to deal with minor infringements of discipline. The Board found that the present procedures for dealing with minor infractions are unnecessarily complex and administratively burdensome. A discipline officer will have the power to decide, with a minimum of formality, matters which do not have any element of criminality and to impose minor punishments. These will not carry the stigma of a criminal conviction.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should emphasise that a discipline officer will only be able to deal with uncontested matters and a person who wishes to defend a matter will have the right to a full hearing under the ordinary provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act. Where an accused person does wish to have a case handled by a discipline officer, there will be no entitlement to representation but the right to call evidence in mitigation of punishment will apply.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Three new offences are created: unlawful discharge of a weapon; and refusal to submit to a medical examination, or supply a specimen, where a medical examination is being carried out as part of the investigation of a service offence. The latter offences will assist the prosecution of offences involving drug abuse. The Defence Force has in place a firm `no drugs' policy and the maximum penalty for use and possession of cannabis is to be increased from a fine equivalent to seven days pay to a fine of fourteen days pay for a first offence and dismissal from the Defence Force for a subsequent offence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Sentencing options for minor offences will be enhanced by introducing the punishment of extra drill (to a maximum of 3 hours spread over 3 days), increasing the maximum period of extra duties (from 3 to 7 days) and enabling suspension of the payment of all fines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently, members of the Defence Force who are suspended from duty pending the investigation of an alleged offence or suspended while awaiting trial for a civil or criminal offence are entitled to payment of salary and allowances. This entitlement will be removed where a suspended member has been charged with an offence. Such a member will, however, be entitled to engage in employment outside the Defence Force during the period of suspension. These changes will parallel the provisions applying to the Australian Public Service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The remaining amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act will streamline existing procedures for the conduct of investigations and hearings conducted by service tribunals, and bring certain provisions in the act, such as those dealing with confessions, into line with current Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fourth amendment is to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act to overcome a defect in the administration of the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1992, the act was amended to provide access to the Home Loans Assistance Scheme to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force after 14 May 1985 and were discharged because of a compensable disability before 15 May 1991, provided these persons applied for an entitlement certificate by 1 September 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the changes to the act were publicised widely through Service and ex-Service channels at the time, it was nevertheless considered that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to attempt to contact every former member who might benefit and who might otherwise not become aware of the benefit. Unfortunately, some former members received late advice of the changes. As a result, some 17 applicants were debarred because the cut-off date of 1 September 1994 for lodging applications had already passed. Accordingly, the bill extends the time limit from 1 September to 1 December 1994 so that these persons will not be disadvantaged.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fifth group of amendments is to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act. This act establishes the current superannuation scheme for members of the Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments will allow the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) legislation, which provides for enhanced prudential supervision of superannuation funds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments are of a technical nature and relate to the decision making powers and roles of the Board of Trustees and the Minister. They are similar to amendments made last year to the superannuation legislation relating to the Commonwealth civilian schemes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) legislation requires, among other things, that trustees of superannuation entities not be subject to direction by any person and that the approval of the trustees must be obtained for any change to the governing rules of the scheme. In the case of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme the governing rules would include the Trust Deed and Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments remove the present requirement for the Trustees to have regard to statements of Government policy in exercising their functions, provide that financial statements be in a form agreed between the Board of Trustees and the Minister, and require the agreement of the Board of Trustees to any changes to the Trust Deed or Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The final amendment made by the bill is to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. In 1994 various amendments were made to that act in association with introduction of the Military Compensation Scheme. One amendment provided an entitlement for compensation for an injury that arises from medical treatment provided at Commonwealth expense where the injury is an unintended consequence of the treatment. Defence Force service (or specified Defence-related service) attracts the entitlement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An unintentional effect of the amendment was that it did not cover the period between the enactment of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988 and introduction of the Military Compensation Scheme in 1994 (although the entitlement in question applied under the legislation that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act replaced). The proposed amendment fills the gap so there is no period of service for which the entitlement does not apply.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable senators will appreciate from my comments on the individual measures that this legislation is essentially part of the ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force. With this in mind, I look forward to the Senate's support for the legislation. The estimated cost of the amendment to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act is approximately $1 million although there will be considerable offsets in the avoidance of litigation. The other amendments are not expected to have a significant financial impact.

        SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 1995
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This bill amends four acts dealing with superannuation for Commonwealth sector civilian employees, the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1994. It also removes gender-specific terms from the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The main purpose of the bill is to make amendments to continue the process of ensuring that the two superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees  comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and regulations under that act (SIS). I expect the Boards of Trustees of the two schemes to elect that the schemes become regulated superannuation funds under SIS with effect from 1 July 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will also make some technical amendments to the acts to name the schemes, the Boards of Trustees and the Funds as the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the CSS and PSS Boards and the CSS and PSS Funds. This will ensure that the generally used names have a legal basis and will enable ease of reference in other legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The opportunity has also been taken to include amendments to correct anomalies that have arisen and caused inequities. For example, to provide restoration of an invalidity pension that had been cancelled on a return to work that is terminated in the probationary period because of ill-health.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill includes amendments to restore the original intentions of the 1976 act as a response to the changing employment conditions in the public sector. For example the change to the definition of minimum retiring age in that act formally  recognises that most members of the scheme are able to retire from age 55.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Also included are some amendments to assist administrative efficiency, for example, the Boards will be able to rely on advice from employers rather than have to check personnel records for over 200,000 members. These amendments will not prevent the Boards from correcting errors in such information nor interfere with members' appeal rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill includes several technical amendments and drafting corrections resulting from previous amendments and to remove gender-specific terms.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. The amendments to correct anomalies will increase the cost of the schemes slightly;  most of the provisions designed to assist administration efficiency will decrease administrative costs or prevent increases in such costs;  and a further administrative amendment will reduce the cost of the CSS but not the overall cost to the Commonwealth as there will be an offsetting compensation cost.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because the anomalies occur only in unusual situations, it is likely that there would be no overall cost to the schemes or the Commonwealth from the proposed amendments.

        —Last night I was presenting the argument against the government's motion that the motion was a reflection of the government's failure to properly manage the program and therefore its requirement at this stage that the Senate sit extra days and, really, that the government ought to have been addressing how it got itself into such a legislative mess, how it could have allowed their process to fail in the way that it has.

       It goes back to the trouble that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, got himself into at the end of the last session when he dropped the ball because of his failures in his own portfolio area of environment and really allowed the management of this chamber to pass and bills that should have been dealt with in the last session were not—they were not on the red and there was no organisation. This government does not seem to understand that it is its program. If it puts the program, we will respond to it, but we will also meet other national responsibilities that we have. We will raise matters of public importance—matters of urgency such as the Australian Democrats raised today on the lack of an effective science policy in this country.

When the minister was berating us last night, did he tell you that we offered you an extra week at the start of the next session so he could get through some of this backlog? Did he mention that? No, he did not mention that because you were not interested in an extra week. As you know, an extra week before the House of Representatives comes back is one of the most effective ways of dealing with a backlog.

Commonwealth responsibilities relate to its role in providing domestic meat inspection in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. A high level of compliance with established standards is achieved by the presence of AQIS inspection staff supported by regional administrative structures. AQIS's Compliance, Legal and Evaluation Branch is responsible for compliance investigations and consequential action, and program evaluation at appropriate intervals. For States other than New South Wales, compliance with nationally established standards is achieved through arrangements made by those States.

        (1) The Australian International School, registered with the Hong Kong Education Department, opened in February 1995. The school was set up in response to growing demand by Australians based in Hong Kong for schooling for their children in the face of insufficient places in the Hong Kong English school system. The Australian Consulate-General has been active in supporting efforts to create a community, non-profit school. It was involved in meetings with Australian community organisations in Hong Kong to consider proposals put forward to establish an Australian school.

        The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, in his capacity as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, wrote on 20 January 1995 to the Governor of Hong Kong, The Rt Hon Christopher Patten, asking him to consider allocation of a permanent site for the school. I also raised the matter when I subsequently met the Governor in London. This request is currently being considered.

        Early liaison with the Hong Kong Government was carried out to establish the school as a community-based non-profit international school. As part of this evaluation, endorsement of the school by the Australian Consulate-General was sought, and was subsequently provided. The School Board judged it appropriate, in the light of this endorsement, for a representative of the Consulate-General to be appointed to the Board, at least for the initial stages of establishing the school.

The need for the Consulate-General to continue this role beyond the initial stages of establishing the school will be kept under review.
