        Some of the amendments confer wide discretions on the Minister. Subregulations 180(6) and (7) and 181(4) and (6) provide that, if the Minister is satisfied that there is insufficient information to enable certain costs or profits to be calculated, then the Minister may determine an amount having regard to all relevant information, and may disregard any information that he or she considers to be unreliable. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the exercise of these significant discretions, as well as the others in the Regulations, is subject to independent review.

        These amendments confer significant discretions on the Commissioner. Proposed regulation 51 provides that the Commissioner may determine Reasonable Benefit Limits at a rate higher than the Regulations provide in special circumstances. Also, the Commissioner may permit registration of a transitional RBL at a date later than the specified cut-off-date. Each of these decisions might have significant financial consequences. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the exercise of these discretions is subject to independent review.

        Amending regulation 36.2 adds subregulations (4)-(6) to regulation 108. These amendments confer important discretions on the Secretary to suspend and recommence the payment of benefits. The subregulations also omit the Note to regulation 108, which advised of a right of appeal to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal. Elsewhere, the Regulations confer the review functions of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that regulation 108 decisions by the Secretary will be reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Committee has also asked for advice on some minor drafting errors.

        Given the Committee's previously expressed view of the operation of s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, that a regulation may incorporate matter contained in a non-statutory instrument only as that instrument is in force at the time the regulation takes effect, this would seem to prevent the incorporation of "subsequent Temporary Revisions" in the Directive. However, the Committee understands that s.98(3A) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 enables regulations made under that Act to incorporate other written instruments as in force not only at the time the regulation takes effect, but as in force from time to time. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to the effect of s.49A on instruments such as Airworthiness Directives, which are not strictly regulations, but are made by virtue of regulations.

        In a number of cases these amendments confer discretions on the Authority. For example, an amendment to subparagraph 6.1(c) proposes to replace the objective phrase "overseas aeroplane type endorsement that" with the subjective phrase "overseas aeroplane endorsement that the Authority is satisfied". These discretions may be of considerable commercial value. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that their exercise will be subject to some form of independent review.

        New paragraphs 30A(3)(cc) and 30G(3)(fb) provide that an application for certification must, among other things, state the number of employees covered by the agreement who are included in each of seven classes of person.

         —by leave—I thank the Senate for granting me leave to talk about this matter. It is my intention to speak to the opposition, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine about what would be suitable programming in terms of which nights we negate the adjournment before the conclusion of these sittings. There will be a need on a significant number of the remaining evenings for us to sit later than the usual time that the adjournment is moved at 7.20 p.m.

         It is my intention to talk to senators about their availability to ensure that we deal with the program but it is my intention to try to be as flexible as I can. Senators would be aware that we have fallen behind in our program of business for these particular sittings. As senators may wish to plan ahead, I indicate it is not my intention to propose a negation in any sense on the Wednesday nights—unless that would suit senators around the chamber—because traditionally that has not been the case.

         I wanted to indicate to senators that I will talk to the various parties and to the independents about their availability. Over the last few weeks I have flagged with everyone the necessity for us doing this on a number of occasions over the next sitting fortnight. Tomorrow it would be my intention to give notice of the government's intentions in respect of negation of the adjournment to give all senators maximum notice of the possible implications for their own diaries.

         —by leave—I understand the concerns of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner), but it would be helpful if he could indicate what he regards as necessary in terms of the number of hours. He is obviously flagging that he wants us to consider what evenings we might be prepared to forgo, but in order to make any sensible judgment on that we need to know what quantum of hours is involved. I would hope he might at least be able to put some sort of indicative figure on that, and then indicate whether he is proposing that we spread that out over whatever period of time it might be but not beyond 10.30 or whether he is proposing that we try to knock it all off in one hit beyond 10.30 p.m.

         —by leave—Why does the government consistently leave this to the last minute in each sitting period? Why can't it get its program in reasonable order so that bills can be dealt with during the course of the sittings rather than constantly building up to this backlog at the end of the sitting? The consequence of that, whether we sit late or not, is that bills are not dealt with in the way this chamber would like to handle legislation; that is, to do it properly. This is the house of review, the house of scrutiny of legislation in the Australian parliament, and we should be given reasonable time to do our job properly.

         The government changed the procedures to three sittings each year and said that bills would now be introduced in a way that they might be dealt with orderly and that such time would be allowed. But in each instance since giving that undertaking to the Senate we have still ended up with a backlog at the end of the sittings with a consequential loss of our capacity to properly scrutinise the legislative program. With proper management on the part of government, that should be unneces sary.

         We will cooperate. We are sitting this morning, which is an additional period of time.

         In actual fact, as Senator Reid knows, we had to press the government at the end of the last sitting week for a list of the bills that it wanted to deal with in this sitting and for an estimate of how long the government thought it would take. Why is it our job to press the government for its program? Why can't it get its affairs in order? It is in charge of programming in this place. Senator Faulkner has had a lot on his mind in this particular sitting in relation to his own portfolio and the difficulties that he has got himself into in that regard. We understand that he has been distracted from his role as manager of government business. But if he feels he is not up to the job then there are plenty of others who would like to have a go at it.

         —The record of managers of government business on your side, Senator Faulkner, has not been a happy one. It has not been a success story. Nevertheless, that is not an excuse for not attempting to get it right. For you to come in here on the first day of the last sitting fortnight and suddenly reveal to the Senate that further time is going to be necessary and that you want to start the process of negotiation is just leaving it all too late. It is not sensible and orderly management, and that is all we constantly seek of you. Over the years you have been in government we have simply not been able to achieve that objective. We regret that.

         We will cooperate, but we will also remain true to our responsibility to perform the job of scrutiny properly and to take the time that is necessary to do it properly. If there is not time in this sitting to do it properly, then our attitude is that unless the bill is of utmost urgency it should be put over until the next sitting, which is only a couple of months away in any event. That is the way we will approach the detail that apparently you are going to bring to our attention some time in the near future.

         —by leave—I appreciate the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) taking the Senate into his confidence and giving us some warning about the matter. I would also say to him that, as I see it, there are 18 pieces of legislation to be determined between now and the time we get up. The second reading debate has already finished on at least a half a dozen of those pieces of legislation. Most of the legislation is now at the committee stage. I imagine there will be one other—and that will be the Land Fund Bill—that is not listed here for consideration and presumably those for which you have sought exemption from Senator Chamarette's cut-off motion of November last year.

         I believe that the manager of government business, when discussing the matters with us, should canvass whether or not those particular pieces of legislation are urgent. I agree with what Senator Hill said. Those that are not urgent should be put over to the next session and we can then deal with them at that particular stage. I feel that the extra time should be sought on the basis of what are the urgent pieces of legislation and what are the times that the government considers need to be devoted to those particular pieces of legislation. I emphasise to the minister through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he should now set down what are the urgent pieces of legislation and what are the times that the government considers those pieces of legislation deserve for debate in the second reading stage, in the committee stage and so on. Then he should let us have a good talk about that.

         As to the particular times that we might have to extend to, my preference is to have an additional day rather than going late at night and into the wee hours of the morning. I have been here long enough to have seen the effect that that has on people. I know Senator Herron has done a medical report on that particular question, as I think the manager of government business knows full well. I am sure that he is not terribly anxious to extend the sittings of the parliament into the evening. I think those three matters that I mentioned ought to be considered: what are the urgent bills; how long does the government propose that we spend on those bills for the second reading stage and for the committee stage to conclude the passage or otherwise of the legislation, and; finally, is there any other way that we can deal with extra hours that are thus required other than sitting until quite late?

         I take account of the point that Senator Alston made. It is very difficult to predict what will occur in terms of some parts of the Senate's routine of business. I do not think it is possible for any government, or really any senator in this chamber, to rub a crystal ball and predict what is going to occur. We had matters such as urgency motions and MPIs and the like in the last sitting period. We had a situation where the sitting of the Senate was suspended for a day as a result of the death of Senator Zakharov. It is not easy to be able to make assessments about these things early in the sittings. At this stage, of course, we have had 60 per cent of the sitting time and dealt with about 30 per cent of the legislation.

         What I want to do in response to Senator Harradine's question—he and other senators have the value of the forward legislative program for these two weeks of sittings—is to talk these issues through in terms of senators' availability for evening sittings. It is not my intention to have extra sitting days, unless that were absolutely necessary. I believe that, if we approach the task with some determination, we can actually see the program achieved with perhaps three or four moderate negations.

I would be proposing three or four moderate negations to allow us to complete our program. That is what I have in mind.

         That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chamarette moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1392 standing in her name for this day, relating to the consideration of the Racial Hatred Bill 1994.

        I will speak only briefly on this matter. I do not intend to delay the Senate but I believe this is a matter of urgency. I will not be debating the content of this notice, but merely the need for urgency; the need to pass this motion today. I gave notice originally on 6 March as follows:

         That further consideration of the Government Business order of the day relating to the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 be postponed to the day of sitting immediately after the release of the findings of the committee established by the Attorney-General to review the ability of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to make determinations following the decision of the High Court in

        The reason for giving that notice—and it was requested that it be considered as a formal motion—was the obvious concern that the operations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have been affected by that determination in the High Court. It seemed obvious to me that, because the Racial Hatred Bill is so dependent on the operation and constitutionality of the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, it was appropriate that that question of its constitutionality be resolved prior to debate on the Racial Hatred Bill 1994.

         It was pointed out to me that if the Attorney-General's committee was to do a thorough job it might take a considerable time and this might constitute an unreasonable delay, especially in light of the fact that the Attorney-General's Department has been working on some amendments to restore the constitutionality of the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That is why the amendments merely add, `or the day of sitting after the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 has been amended by the parliament to ensure its constitutionality in the light of the decision of the High Court in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, whichever is the sooner.'

         for today both those bills appear in sequence with the first being the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 and the resumption of the second reading debate. I believe the government is putting amendments that would, in its view, restore the constitutionality of operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. However, we have not been through that consideration and those amendments have not been supported in the Senate. Neither, as yet, have we heard any assurance about the reception they might get in the House of Representatives. For that reason it is urgent to put this motion that we successfully deal with the first matter which I believe will affect the consideration of the second matter, the Racial Hatred Bill.

         The fact that the Racial Hatred Bill comes immediately after the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, in my view, does not necessarily deal with the concerns because there may be a delay or a deferment of that first matter in which case we would move to the second. Because that is inappropriate, I wish to move urgent consideration of the motion that we delay considering the Racial Hatred Bill until after the successful completion of consideration of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. The motion is self-explanatory. I trust that my colleagues will see the logic of it and accept that this is a sensible motion in relation to having logical and sequential debate in this place.

What they are basically saying is that we should not be asked to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 until these matters have been resolved one way or the other. We need the release of the findings of the committee established by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) or to have the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act amended in such a way as to fix the errors isolated by the Brandy decision.

         Rather than support this motion and lock us into following its exact wording, we would prefer to maintain a degree of good faith with the government. When the human rights legislation comes on for debate, we will say that it is fine for the government to introduce its amendments but after that we want the matter postponed. We want it postponed because it should go through the proper processes. It is one thing to deliver some amendments and have some officers of the department and officers from the minister's office say, `These amendments are all okay,' but it is another for an opposition to say, `Yes that's all right. Parliament will sit and just rubber-stamp this little private conversation that we had and that I had with some officers this morning.' I was offered a telephone brief on Friday I think on these amendments. That is clearly not the way parliament should work.

         The amendments are in response to a decision of the High Court. Parliament is not only entitled but also obligated to go through the amendments and ensure that they are what they purport to be, which is a simple turning back to the pre-1992 position. I spoke to the officers this morning and asked, `Is that all there is?' One said, `It is just going back to 1992.' I asked a simple question: what about the delegation powers? I was told that there were a few minor extra things. They might be right in that the extra things, the changes, over and above shifting back to 1992 might be minor. Senator Chamarette, Senator Harradine and I might agree with them. We all might agree with them. All we are saying is that parliament is entitled to look at them first and give them proper assessment. For my part, I want to take them to my shadow ministry and then to my party room. I want to give everybody who is elected, paid as a member of parliament and obligated to look at these things properly the opportunity to consider what is in these amendments.

         There should be no difficulty in dealing with that course. If, as the government says, the amendments it wants to move to that bill are relatively minor in that they either simply put it back to the 1992 position or make some very minor inconsequential amendments, there will be no problem. They will go to my shadow ministry on Monday, be dealt with on Tuesday and could be debated here Tuesday afternoon. I do not think that is a lot to ask for amendments that were delivered to me on Friday. In fact, it is improper of a government to ask for them to be dealt with any sooner.

It clearly sees by the listing it has put on the order of business that it is sensible to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill after the human rights legislation has been dealt with in this chamber.

         We agree with the government's scheduling and ordering that the Racial Hatred Bill should come after that. On that point, I think Senator Chamarette is in agreement. What she is concerned with is that it will try to proceed in any event if there is a problem with the human rights amendments. We are saying, `Why don't we wait and see? Why don't we assume good faith? Assume that the government is simply wanting to put it back to the pre-1992 position. Assume good faith on the part of the officers I spoke to this morning who said that the other amendments are minor and inconsequential.' If all that is the case, there should be no problem in proceeding with this next week. I say to Senator Chamarette that, if we find that the government does not want to play ball and be sensible, we might have to look at dealing with this in another way on another day. Just for today, we are happy to say that we will put some good faith in the government and see whether it is prepared to deliver.

It was only recently that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looked into the Racial Hatred Bill and, in the course of that inquiry, took evidence from the Attorney-General's Department. Extensive evidence was given as to the ramifications of the case of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The ramifications are such that the determinations of such commissions do not have any sanction attached to them and that there are great problems in relation to the enforceability of those civil sections of the Racial Hatred Bill.

         This government has had some considerable time to develop a racial hatred bill. In fact, it had one before the last election, withdrew it and reconsidered it. Although it is on the agenda of this country, it cannot be argued that it is of absolute vital importance it be dealt with today as opposed to next week. I do not think there is an argument for urgency. Nevertheless, there is an argument to ensure that it gets dealt with in due course.

          —If I may put my point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, the suggestion that the bill I produced came out of a brown paper bag is a clear implication by the minister that I have produced a bill under someone else's instructions, possibly for money. In common usage, the meaning of the term `out of a brown paper bag' is `Go around and do what people paying you money say.' If the minister does not want to take the good faith that is offered on this side—if he wants to misunderstand the nature of this debate and say that he can come in here with amendments that no one saw before last Friday and that parliament should then debate the matter—let him say so, but do not let him abuse me at the same time. Do not let him attribute to me bad faith that is not there.

Nothing could be more offensive and nothing could reflect on her more adversely than that. I would have thought that that was clear.

Certainly, for those of us on this side of the chamber, it is clearly unparliamentary because it is a reflection on a senator's character. It has been withdrawn and, therefore, the matter is at an end, but I am concerned about the precedent of the ruling.

          —As I was saying when this motion was last before the Senate, this is certainly an issue for which there is a desperate need for more information. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that back in 1992 the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology recommended that Queensland not be included in the initial assessment of the possible national electricity grid extensions until it could be demonstrated that its inclusion could be achieved economically. The government response to that recommendation of the committee was as follows:

         The main concern of the Committee over the Northlink proposal derives from the view that transmission losses could erode the environmental benefits of the sharing of spinning reserve, with consequent fuel savings. The economic benefits of new links are addressed in response to Recommendation 6. However, such grid augmentations or extensions should only proceed where they can be demonstrated to be economic.

         A major part of the assessment work being carried out by the States is to determine the economic merits of various proposals. At the present time Queensland is considering the construction of new generating capacity to meet the State's projected electricity needs from the end of the decade and beyond. The Commonwealth considers that this evaluation should also consider the merits of Northlink, which would enable the construction of expensive new capacity in Queensland to be delayed. The link would enable some of Queensland's power needs to be met by New South Wales which has considerable excess capacity.

         That was how this matter was first raised. There is no doubt that many people in my state of Queensland have a very great concern. I know my colleague Senator Boswell and my other Senate colleagues Senator MacGibbon, Senator Herron, Senator Parer and Senator O'Chee, and I believe all of my Labor Senate colleagues as well, have received a great many letters and a great many representations from people about this issue. There are a myriad of those. I will quote some words from a submission that a person made to the Senate standing committee considering the Eastlink proposal. The excerpts from that letter I refer to indicate some of the concerns being expressed. The letter indicated that the writer was concerned about, and I quote:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . injustices imposed upon a minority in the name of progress supported by the majority. Eastlink will also have severe environmental effects, both physical and aesthetic, and the decision-makers do not have to live with these effects every day of their lives as people in and near the path of the cables are expected to do.
        </para>
        <para>
         The letter goes on:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The so-called consultation going on now is no more than a public relations exercise to try to placate opposition as the important decisions have already been made.
        </para>
        <para>
         The letter continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The level of compensation spoken of is TOTALLY INADEQUATE. Farms and properties are being made inoperable by restrictions on land use in the vicinity of the cables which can only get worse if overseas experience is any guide. People's lives and futures are being destroyed. To many ageing farmers their farm is also their future retirement and reflects a lifetime of effort.
        </para>
        <para>
         The letter further states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If this project is to go ahead, and it should not for a host of reasons, TOTAL BUYOUT of all affected properties where owners want that, at prices that include a premium on PRE-EASTLINK and pre-drought prices, plus compensation for dislocation/relocation is the only way for fairness to apply. If this is not done, the minority bear the cost while the majority get the benefits.

         Those are just some excerpts. Further, a number of petitions have been forwarded to all members of the Senate in which the point is made by petitioners that the proposal is contrary to the recommendations of the Senate standing committee to which I have referred. One of the petitions further indicates that Eastlink:

          This matter was raised in the estimates committee hearings in February because it was of great concern to me and involved the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth seemed to have little understanding, knowledge or even interest in the proposal at all. My understanding of the Eastlink proposal is that it is to be a third funded by the Commonwealth government. If that is the case, one would have thought that the Commonwealth would be intricately involved in what is happening with Eastlink.

          As a result of an enormous number of representations received from Queensland which indicate to my colleagues and I that work is about to commence, resumptions had begun and the procedure had gone to the point of no return, I tried to ask the Commonwealth government some questions about the matter at the Senate estimates committee hearings. When I asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, about the Eastlink process at the estimates hearing on 15 February relating to the primary industries and energy portfolio, he said—and this is page 101 of the

          Having pursued the matter quite unsatisfactory at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 15 February, I then raised the matter with Senator Faulkner on 16 February at the environment estimates committee. I asked Senator Faulkner whether his department had been involved in any way in the path of the proposed major transmission lines. Senator Faulkner said:

         Dr Kay, the relevant officer, then came to the table and answered by saying:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Yes, we have had some involvement, as the Queensland electricity authorities have made public a number of proposed options and sought comment from us and from a whole series of other authorities on that. The proposed electricity transmission routes, or at least some of the proposed routes, have a proximity to the central eastern rainforests world heritage property. Our comment has really been in relation to that issue and that issue only. My understanding is that comments are still being sought on the report.
        </para>
        <para>
         Later on in the hearing I asked whether those proposed routes traversed world heritage listed forests. Dr Kay said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Yes, it includes several world heritage forests. The central eastern Australian rainforest is a single world heritage property. There are several compartments making up that single world heritage property. The range of routes have different impacts on different parts of the property. Some of the options, of course, are quite distant from the rainforests.
        </para>
        <para>
         There was some understanding of the issue. Later on in the estimates committee hearing I asked some further questions. In answer to a question on where the actual routes went, Mr Carbon from the department said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         May I indicate that there is not a proposed route.
        </para>

         That is what a senior officer from the department said. Mr Carbon then went on to say:

         The minister for the environment has yet to make a decision about how the Commonwealth will be involved in that.

         In answer to a further question, Mr Carbon went on to say:

We can then find out exactly what the Commonwealth's involvement is; where the Commonwealth has got to; what expenditure the Commonwealth has made; and what power the Commonwealth has in relation to the matter. Senators would then be fully informed of all those aspects.

All those people have supported Senator Woodley's motion for a Senate inquiry.

        I understand there is a strong level of support for this motion in the chamber. In fact, the government amendment to the Senate cut-off order of 29 November replaces the two government notices of motion which were given on 7 February 1995 and on 6 March 1995. The Senate order of 29 November last year sought to give effect to the objective of making bills available for public scrutiny and consultations as early as possible. It reflects the government undertaking that had been given by Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, on 18 August to work towards the objective of managing legislation on an introduce-one-session debate-the-next basis.

         The application of the order as currently worded has prevented, as I have mentioned on many occasions in the chamber, debate in the current sittings of the Senate on bills which have been introduced or passed in the House of Representatives in previous sittings. Strict application of the order as it currently stands would mean that it would take at least three sittings for such a bill to pass through the parliament. The government amendment to the order seeks to allow debate in the Senate on such bills in order to ensure that the passage of bills will not be unduly delayed in the parliament.

         It is a motion that is entirely consistent with the government's commitment to the objective of making bills available for examination and consultation as early as possible prior to debate in the Senate. The Senate order, if it is amended as proposed, will fully meet the objective of the principle of introducing a bill one session and debating it in the next session. The government will still need to seek exemption from the application of the order on a case-by-case basis, as senators are aware, for urgent bills and budget bills to be introduced and debated in the same sittings. This is a motion that will allow for good management of legislation in the Senate. It comprehensively allows us to meet and to manage the commitment that we made in relation to the introduction of legislation in one session and for debate in the next. I commend this important motion to the Senate.

         —The motion, if carried, modifies the provision that is currently in place. Basically, the argument is put that if a bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives during a previous session then that is adequate notice for this chamber and gives senators warning that they can anticipate that it will be coming up in the next sittings of the parliament and they can be prepared for that debate. We, on this side of the chamber, accept that argument. That reasonably satisfies the issue of notice.

         The other issue, however, is proper planning. The Senate simply having had notice that a bill is likely to be debated in the following sittings does not mean that the government will, within its planning of the program, allow adequate and proper time for the consideration of that bill. That is our disappointment.

         Before the quorum I was arguing that, whilst the motion before the chamber may be sufficient to give the Senate notice of the government's intention to move in this place a piece of legislation, it does not of itself ensure orderly planning and sufficient time for proper consideration of that legislation. The government's practice has been to stack bills at the end of the session, which inhibits the capacity of the Senate to do its job properly. This motion, unfortunately, is not a step towards resolving that shortcoming.

         We have, from time to time, moved various motions—referred to commonly as cut-off motions—which have required the government to have matters debated in this chamber in an orderly way during the course of a sitting of the parliament. Those motions have been vigorously opposed by the government. In fact, the most effective motion that we moved and had passed in that regard brought down the wrath of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) upon the House of Representatives. In effect, he closed out most of the opposition's democratic rights to hold a government answerable.

         He unilaterally decided that there would be no right of the opposition to move censure motions or to bring on matters of public importance. He undermined the capacity of an opposition to meet its constitutional responsibility. That is the attitude of this Prime Minister when the parliament seeks to resist his somewhat unique method of government. He fails to recognise that government in this country includes the parliament as an essential part of the process—and the parliament has a right and responsibility to debate legislation and to have adequate time to do it properly. He might regard us as unrepresentative swill and a nuisance in his legislative program, but we have a responsibility to the Australian people and we will not be bullied by him.

         Yet he used his numbers in the House of Representatives to take out his wrath on the capacity of that chamber to fulfil its constitutional responsibility. That was a dark day in Australian democracy and the people ought to hold the Prime Minister accountable for that. I simply say in passing that whilst we support provisions that give this chamber more notice of the government's program, it does not resolve the fundamental problem that the government still will not meet an obligation to have orderly planning and will not bring bills before this chamber in a timetable that will allow proper and adequate consideration of them.

         When the time is appropriate we will try again to introduce and have carried cut-off motions that will enforce orderly programming. I presume the Prime Minister will act as he did on the last occasion, which was to the detriment of democracy in this country. But we are determined, one way or another, to ensure that this government is forced to orderly programming. It has a responsibility to manage the place. Sometimes we think it likes to pass that responsibility to us. It is its legislative program; it controls the business before the chamber. We have always said that we will meet that responsibility according to the government's program. It is about time it started to get that program in order. So I support this motion but I nevertheless say that it does not address the fundamental problem before us in relation to procedural matters.

It is not a debate about the politics of the issue and whether the government legislation is the best way to address a particular problem in the community.

That has precluded us from the normal opportunity to consider those amendments at a shadow ministry level and in the party room process, and we seek to do that in accordance with normal process.

         If the coalition wishes to amend its motion and put it in two separate parts, we will certainly vote for deferment of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, but not for deferment of the Racial Hatred Bill. If it does not do that, the Democrats will oppose the motion.

         —I want to make some remarks in support of the motion moved by Senator Hill. I understand in a sense what the Democrats are saying, except I think that they missed one fundamental point. It seems that the majority of people here agree that the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill should be postponed until the amendments that everybody received only last week can be properly dealt with. There seems to be sufficient majority agreement on that. The Democrats, Senator Harradine and the Greens agree with that.

         The question we now face is whether it is appropriate for us to, at the same time, defer the Racial Hatred Bill. Senator Spindler says, on behalf of the Democrats, `You don't need to defer that.' I am at a loss to understand why he said that, because an integral part of the government's bill that Senator Spindler wants debated is the civil remedies and the possibility of enforcing those. We have discovered—via the Brandy decision, and as Senator Harradine said in the committee hearings on this bill—that the government was quite confident it was going to win that case. Now we find a different situation: amendments have to be dealt with.

         Opposition senators who participated in the committee that Senator Harradine went along to—and those who did not participate—are very interested in this bill. They very much want to comment on the civil remedies and the enforcement procedures. They do not want to simply come in here and tack on a few remarks in the committee stage. They want to have the proper time to amend the speeches that they might have prepared—either on paper or in their heads—on the racial hatred legislation. They want to include in their speeches in the second reading debate comments vis-a-vis the enforcement procedures. We do not think it is reasonable that they be asked to do that without the enforcement procedures having gone through the proper processes. That, of course, brings us back to where we were this morning.

         Senator Bolkus will undoubtedly say, `Look, all we are doing is returning this back to 1992.' I have already established this morning that that is not the case. Government advisers freely admit that. There are a few other changes. The government says they are minor changes but, as Senator Harradine pointed out, it also said that the Brandy case was not going to get up. So what confidence should we have in the view that the government puts?

I said, `Perhaps I could have a copy of that as well. I'd like to be informed when this matter is considered.' But I could not have a copy of that. Why not?

         We think it is fair enough that the government clearly thinks the Racial Hatred Bill should follow the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. That is in its programming this morning. It is the sensible ordering of the two bills. The reason it is the sensible ordering of the two bills is that there are several provisions in the government's Racial Hatred Bill. The enforcement of those provisions was thrown out of the window by the High Court's Brandy decision. The government now says it has some amendments that will at least be a holding position to fix that problem. The government wanted us to deal with those today, without proper consideration and just by taking its word for it.

         Given that those enforcement procedures need to be fixed, we think it is unreasonable for the government to ask us to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill before we have ascertained the propriety of those amendments to the enforcement procedures. It is important to postpone the human rights legislation in order to establish the propriety or otherwise of the enforcement procedures that are now going to be suggested so that we can check that everything is as the government advisers say it is. It is sensible to make sure of that before the government proceeds with the second reading speech on the Racial Hatred Bill.

         The reason for that is that the second reading speech is not meant to be bits and pieces of information pulled out of the air that will do today because it suits the government to deal with this bill today or because the Democrats do not care whether it is dealt with today. The second reading speech is meant to refer to the problems that the government thinks are in the bill. The basic principles behind the bill can be included, but the second reading speech is designed to give the government the opportunity to outline what it thinks are the problems. Until the enforcement procedures are settled, how can someone refer to that in their speech in the second reading debate? They simply cannot.

         There will be plenty of bills where we could split the second reading debate and the committee stage—bills where a matter is looked at by a committee and then comes back, there having been adequate time to consider the committee's report, and we proceed. But an integral part of the Racial Hatred Bill is the civil remedies, and an integral part of those civil remedies is the enforcement procedures. Surely it is appropriate to get those settled before we ask people to debate the second reading of the Racial Hatred Bill. For that reason, I urge the Democrats to reconsider their position and to recognise the need for people to make sensible comment in their contributions to the second reading debate that refers to both the criminal and the civil remedies and the enforcement procedures for both. I urge them to do the sensible thing and at least get the enforcement procedures settled.

         We are prepared to meet the government halfway. We had the opportunity to support the Greens and refuse to debate any of this until the human rights legislation amendments had been completely dealt with by both houses. We thought that was an unreasonable request because, for one reason or another, there might be a scheduling problem, but all parties might be in agreement—I emphasise `might be in agreement'—that the amendments the government seeks to move are nothing more than what it says they are. There may be no problem with them. Had we supported the Greens' motion this morning, simply because of some minor scheduling problem we could be held up from debating the Racial Hatred Bill. We do not want to be in that position.

Once that is settled, after we have all had the proper time to consider this—for us that will be Tuesday of next week because that is when we will have taken those amendments to our shadow ministry and to our party room and probably got independent advice; we will probably seek that because, as the government admits, it is also making what it describes as some minor technical changes—and it has gone through our proper processes and Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette, Senator Margetts and the Democrats have had the time to consider it, then we think it will be fair enough to start the Racial Hatred Bill.

For that reason, we think it is very sensible on this occasion to keep the second reading debate and the committee stage together rather than separate them in some way for whatever reason.

That is what all this is about. Let us not shy away from that.

However, you are not prepared to confront this issue this week because there is an election in New South Wales and you do not want to be exposed on the issue of race and exposed to the ethnic communities. I can tell you something—you have been. That has been acknowledged both inside and outside the Liberal Party. There is a chorus of voices out there in the community saying precisely one thing, `The Liberals do not care about race and they do not care about our multicultural society.' This cynical manoeuvre this morning has reinforced that view. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has come in wishing to make a new profile for himself. Every step he has taken with respect to race issues has reinforced the past.

         Those opposite say that they have not had time to look at the issues. Let us look at the time they have had in respect of this bill. This bill was introduced late last year at the end of some three or four years of discussion, debate, parliamentary committee hearings and broad consultations with the community. For instance, we had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the ALRC report on multiculturalism and the law and the National Inquiry into Racist Violence. All these inquiries were conducted in 1991-92 as predecessors to this legislation which was introduced before the last election. The government followed it up last November.

         This legislation has had a very long gestation period. What has happened in the meantime? The only thing that I have seen happen in the meantime is a rise in the incidence of racial hatred. There was a demonstration of this in the streets outside the bureau conference in Adelaide a few weeks ago. This hatred hurt a lot of people in a very personal sense. We witnessed the igniting power of racial hatred when we saw scenes from the football in the United Kingdom a few weeks ago. Racial hatred was very much at the core of the violence there.

         Those opposite say that we have had the bill, but what about the amendments and the final outcome of the court case? That has been considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It has taken the approach that any reasonable person who does not have something to hide or does not want to run away from this debate would take in relation to this matter. The position that that committee took is outlined on page 20 of its report and goes to the core of what this debate is about today. The other incidental amendments go to other aspects of the bill.

They have sat back for four years wondering whether it will get through this place.

         The Racial Hatred Bill is relatively short; nevertheless, it is complex. It was interesting to hear the minister quote Mr Victor Rebikoff from FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, a man for whom I have a general high regard, who is a great advocate for the ethnic communities within this country and who has done a lot for the ethnic communities. However, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was looking at the Racial Hatred Bill, even Mr Rebikoff made an unintentional error—nevertheless it was an error—as to how this legislation would apply. The

         It is not wise for the minister to seek to rely on that sort of advice in condemning the opposition's version of the bill, which I might add is only a draft exposure at this stage. Unlike the government, we on this side of the chamber are willing to say that we will take into account community opinion; that we will consider the views of the ethnic communities as to the best way to deal with a problem which clearly offends all decent Australians. I would have thought discrimination on the basis of race is abhorrent to everybody within this chamber regardless of their party or political persuasion.

         In fact it introduced a bill, as I understand it, before the last federal election. The bill lapsed because the government did not pursue it. It then introduced another piece of legislation, which is currently before us. So it is hardly appropriate for the minister to assert that the government has acted with all due haste when we are talking about years of delay on the government's side and we, on this side, have given a date—namely, 28 March, seven days time—for reconsideration.

         Why have we asked for that seven-day delay, Mr Acting Deputy President? The reason, as outlined by you from the chair just a few moments ago, was that, technically, there are no amendments to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill before the Senate. They have not hit the Table Office as yet, as I understand it. If that is the case, then the minister is asking us to consider this legislation before the proposed government amendments have been tabled and presented to backbenchers such as me who do not necessarily get the advantages that the shadow minister obtains by getting an advance copy of them.

         If I am to take my role seriously in an issue that I believe, in my short time here, I have shown a very real interest in, it is appropriate for me to at least have the proposed government amendments before me in relation to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. Those amendments will have a substantial impact on the way the Racial Hatred Bill will be implemented and provisions of it enforced. Before I consider the whole regime of the Racial Hatred Bill, I want to know exactly how provisions of it will be enforced and implemented. I would have thought seeking a seven-day delay of that so that especially we on this side of the chamber can satisfy ourselves as to those amendments is a reasonable, sound and proper stance for us to take if we are to take seriously our role as reviewers of legislation in this house.

         The enforcement procedures clearly are an integral part of the legislation. Indeed, why have the legislation unless there is some enforcement aspect to it which will give some teeth to what the government is trying to achieve? That makes sense, but we on this side want to know what those teeth are and how they will be implemented. It would be quite improper for us to accept in a sealed envelope from the government certain amendments and to say that we will just accept them without having read them. It would be inappropriate and it would not be a proper way for us to conduct our business.

The House of Representatives is not sitting this week, so they would not have the opportunity to make comment during the debate. This is a week in which only the Senate is sitting and, of course, the minister could not think of one senator he could mention to support his argument.

         This is a serious matter. It has taken considerable time for the government to get itself together in relation to this legislation. This is the second attempt at the legislation. In fact, during the hearings of the legal and constitutional committee, I was convinced that, although the Brandy case was about to be considered, we ought to proceed anyway because the government was confident that it would win. Clearly that advice was incorrect, as Senator Harradine pointed out earlier. The score was 7-0 in the High Court.

The importance is that we get it right, to ensure that those who have to live under the law have certainty and know what it is all about. That is the best way to achieve a good and cohesive society. Certainty under the law is one of the most important principles for a democratic society that is governed by the rule of law.

Essentially, the Greens' position on the motion moved by the opposition is a mirror image of that on the motion presented by the Australian Democrats. We do not have any objection to entering into a consideration of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. We feel that it can certainly benefit from a seven-day delay, which has been requested by the opposition and by the Democrats. We would not seek to oppose that.

         We do object to dealing with the Racial Hatred Bill prior to the consideration and resolution of the anomalies raised by the Brandy case in relation to the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Obviously we want to see that logical sequence followed and we would not agree with the amendment proposed by Senator Spindler that we defer only the first bill, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill for seven days, but nevertheless go into the Racial Hatred Bill. It has been stated that we should just go ahead into consideration of the Racial Hatred Bill, even if it is only the second reading debate, because the constitutionality questions over the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission can be resolved later.

We have an interim series of amendments which reverts back to the November 1992 operation of the commission. Whether those amendments are accepted or not, whether the commission reverts back to the pre-November 1992 operation or not, materially affects the consideration that we will be giving to the Racial Hatred Bill.

         The operation of that commission, which is so crucial to half of the Racial Hatred Bill, has not been and will not be resolved until such time as the amendments being considered in relation to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill are resolved not only in this place but also in the House of Representatives, which as we know meets next week. For that reason, in my view there is an irrefutable logic that connects the two bills and says that we should deal with one before the other. If we defer the first bill for seven days, the Greens feel that it is utterly appropriate to defer the Racial Hatred Bill for an equivalent period. That was essentially the meaning underlying the motion I proposed this morning which was defeated.

         It is interesting that there may well be, as Senator Bolkus mentioned earlier, political motivations involved in this deferral. As Senator Vanstone said in the earlier debate, it may be that opposition members felt it totally appropriate to defer the human rights legislation amendments because they had not had sufficient notice but that they did not wish to be seen to be delaying the Racial Hatred Bill. That is why they did not agree with the kind of connection that I raised in the motion we put forward earlier. It may well be that they want to avoid the kinds of political insinuations that Senator Bolkus was so free with in his comments.

I had no idea until Senator Bolkus spoke that the New South Wales election at the end of this week is very important to the government's timing in relation to its consideration, even to the second reading, of the Racial Hatred Bill. If he can say that the opposition has a political motivation to delay it—I do not actually think that has been evidenced by the opposition, but it may be so—he has certainly put it on the record that the government is motivated to bring it on before the New South Wales election.

Surely it has nothing to do with the New South Wales election because New South Wales has a perfectly adequate piece of racial vilification legislation in place already. Instead of seeing it as support for what has been rightly mentioned as today's International Day of the Elimination of Race Discrimination, it may be that there is going to be some politicking at a federal level that may be ascribed in some way to and have some part in what happens in the New South Wales election. I do not think that is a very good reason either for delaying this legislation or for making it urgent.

         —by leave—I want to respond briefly to comments made by Senator Vanstone, Senator Ellison and Senator Chamarette. Much is made of the fact that we have not resolved the consequences of the so-called Brandy decision of the High Court. It would be useful to briefly traverse just what the substance of the situation is. In the pre-Brandy situation, it was possible for decisions or pronouncements by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to be registered with the Federal Court, thus ensuring enforceability. The High Court decided that was not appropriate. We have now amendments before us. For a minute I thought that Senator Abetz said he had not seen them, but I think that was clarified. We have certainly had them before us since Friday. We consider that inadequate timing but they were certainly available.

         Those amendments substantially return us to the pre-1992 situation where separate action needs to be taken in the Federal Court to ensure enforceability. We rather regret that because it means that more cost is incurred by people seeking civil remedies before the human rights commission. No doubt in time some way around it will be found which is easier for people who take their case to the human rights commission. However, it seems to me that in this particular situation whether we have enforceability one way or the other does not really touch on the substance of the Racial Hatred Bill. I think it would only have some relevance if either the coalition parties or Senator Chamarette suggested they might be happy not to vote for the amendments ensuring post-Brandy enforceability by returning the situation to the 1992 position thus leaving us with no means of enforcement for civil remedies before the human rights commission.

         I must say that the other thing that has convinced me to vote for the motion is the speech made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) in opposition to the motion. In fact, if there was any politicising of this very important matter, it was by Senator Bolkus. He should really think about that. If he is going to use the refugee situation and the question of racial hatred as a political football—as he and Senator McKiernan are doing—the chamber should discuss that. That matter weighs very heavily on my mind at the present time. I will not discuss in detail—because I would be out of order—my concern that has been developing over the last three or four months with what Senator Bolkus is doing and how his statements have divided the community. A minister in his position should not divide the community.

         We are trying, as a country, to create a society in which all persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue their spiritual development and material wellbeing in conditions of equal opportunity. This is particularly for persons who come to Australia from other lands and for persons who are given international protection because they have a well-founded fear of persecution if they are returned to their persecutors and torturers. This minister is not doing this. This minister is injecting a political element into the arguments on those life and death issues, and I cannot condone that in any shape or form.

         As I said this morning, I am inclined to support the racial hatred legislation. I have found it rather fascinating that the government, over a period of time, has denigrated the concept of the educative role of the law. I have sat here for 20-odd years and listened to government senators and other senators denigrate the idea of the educative role of the law. That is what the Racial Hatred Bill is all about, to a large extent. To that extent, I support it.

         Obviously one cannot legislate to make people moral, but we ought to have a framework of legislation in which basic human rights principles are upheld. One of those human rights principles is that not only should you not treat people as objects for utilisation for some other purpose but also you should always affirm the person as a person. That is a matter that should be beyond politics.

         Here we have the minister, as Senator Chamarette pointed out, virtually admitting that the reason that the government wants to have this debate this week is the New South Wales election. So what! New South Wales elections come and New South Wales elections go. To be quite frank, I could not care less about New South Wales elections. This is a matter which should be above party politics and the grubby politicking of politicians.

         As has been quite rightly said—I cannot remember who it was but one of the opposition speakers mentioned this—an essential element of the racial hatred legislation is the matter of civil remedies and enforcement procedures. They all depend on what occurs with the human rights and equal opportunities legislation. I ask the minister to find out from his advisers whether I was informed at all about the proposed amendments to the human rights and equal opportunities legislation. Was I? If I was, I did not get a copy of them.

         Apparently some people have privileged positions in this chamber. I do not recall receiving any proposed amendments to that legislation. That is another reason why I am not prepared to support even a second reading at this particular juncture. So much depends on those amendments, in my view. Under those circumstances, I support the motion that has been moved by Senator Hill. I hope we can give mature consideration in a non-partisan way to the matters that are before us. I believe these measures deserve to be treated in a non-partisan way.

         I urge all honourable senators to treat this matter in a non-partisan way—not try to make political points for a tin-pot election in New South Wales. They should bear in mind the importance of this matter for the future of a harmonious society in Australia. They should bear that in mind also when it comes to the other matter: the attempt that is being made by the government to send back people to their persecutors and to send back people who are under threat of coerced abortions, coerced sterilisations and other grave sanctions. I ask honourable senators to bear that in mind because if we pass that sort of legislation, as the government wants us to, we can make no claim to being a civilised country.

         —Today I want to raise a matter of some significance relating to the financial capacity of the Australian Labor Party and in particular the New South Wales division of the Australian Labor Party, which is technically bankrupt. We know it is morally bankrupt; we know it is intellectually bankrupt; we know it is politically bankrupt. We see evidence of that every day in the newspapers. We see it all through the election campaign presently going on in New South Wales. But the fact that it is technically bankrupt financially says a lot about the sort of government we would get in New South Wales if the Labor Party were given the opportunity of getting back into the position of power that it had some years ago when it became renowned throughout Australia for the level of its corruption and its incompetence.

         The Labor Party simply cannot be trusted with money. That is evident from the way that the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party has got itself not only into debt but also technically bankrupt. Its assets are massively outweighed by its liabilities. If that is the way the Labor Party runs its own party, how would it run New South Wales?

         We have seen examples in other states of how the Labor Party runs a state. Generally, the word `runs', in the Labor Party sense, means `runs down'. In Western Australia, WA Inc. ran down the state to a situation where significant people—even the former Premier—were indicted, put in gaol and so on.

         In Victoria, we saw what Labor running a state meant. It meant the collapse of the state's bank. There were a whole series of financial disasters resulting in the state itself becoming the poor relation of the rest of Australia. Fortunately, Mr Kennett and his Liberal government, in association with the National Party, have been able to rescue Victoria. We have seen a similar disaster in South Australia.

         Let us see how much of this financial incompetence—and, one must say, regrettably in some instances evident financial dishonesty—directly relates to New South Wales. At the moment the New South Wales Labor Party owns a building which is worth only a fraction of what it paid for it. As a result, the New South Wales Labor Party is hugely in debt—some $10 million—of which more than half is owed to the Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank.

         One can wonder why on earth the Commonwealth Bank became the lender of so much money to such an incompetent crew. One wonders how it is that this bankrupt organisation, the Labor Party in New South Wales, can be financing the biggest advertising campaign that has ever been seen in a state election in New South Wales. It is outspending the Liberal Party enormously. It appears to have a dominance of television commercials of something like seven to one on my quick count last night. Whatever it is, there is no dispute about the fact that the Labor Party is massively outspending the Liberal party and it appears to be able to spend something like $4 million on advertising alone apart from all its other costs.

         The federal Labor Party president, Mr Jones, let it slip that the federal body of the Labor Party was thinking of intervening in New South Wales. I understand it has already put up about $1 million to help the state out, but there is the suggestion of intervention which Mr Jones has since resiled from by saying that when he said `intervention' he did not mean intervention; he meant intervention. To what extent this means taking over the state or simply trying to bail it out is a matter that will be found out on 31 March—conveniently just after the New South Wales state election.

         A whole series of questions is now emerging that, quite frankly, the Labor Party must answer if it is to have any credibility at all in New South Wales. At the moment all that happens whenever this matter is raised, as it has been by the media, particularly by Mr Alan Ramsey who wrote a very interesting article in Saturday's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         , is that the Labor Party says, `That is just an organisational matter. The fact that we cannot run ourselves has nothing to do with our incompetence and inability to run New South Wales.' That is the Labor Party's response. Until it answers these questions, the Labor Party in New South Wales should not be trusted with pocket money, let alone the treasury of the state.

         What we have to ask—and I think we have a right to ask—is: what deals have been done to stop the Commonwealth Bank foreclosing on Labor over its debt in New South Wales? I do not know what has been done. All I do know is that the Commonwealth Bank has foreclosed on many people in New South Wales who seem to have a far better debt to asset relationship than the New South Wales Labor Party, but it has not foreclosed on the Labor Party.

         The other question is: how will Labor keep financing its rising debt? How is it paying the $10,000 a week interest bill on its debt—over half a million dollars a year? Where is the  money coming from? If the Labor Party will not tell you where the money is coming from to pay the interest on its own debt, you can ask: where is the money coming from to pay for its political promises? It will not tell you that either.

         I submit the reason the Labor Party will not tell you where the money is coming from to pay its interest bill on its huge debt is, quite frankly, that it would be very embarrassed to reveal the sources of that money. Maybe we could look at some sources of funds that have been revealed in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Courier-Mail

         recently to examine that. I will deal with that if I have time on another occasion. How is the Labor Party financing this huge $10,000 a week? It will not tell you because it would be far too politically embarrassing to reveal it.

         Where is the money coming from to fund Labor's election campaign which includes, as I said earlier, something like $4 million in advertising expenditure?

         Where on earth will this kind of expenditure, only part of which will be refunded by the state for electoral funding, come from? Will it come from the union movement? Let me remind the Senate that the union movement is owed about $2 million in New South Wales in back rent by the Labor Party. Is the union movement prepared to forgo what it is owed and put even more money into this bottomless pit in New South Wales? This incompetent bunch could not run a lolly shop. I say that because, according to the way in which New South Wales Labor governments have been run in the past, they have regarded government as a sort of lolly shop where you get your lollies while you can. This is what intrigues me.

         If the Labor Party has been able to avoid foreclosure because the Commonwealth Bank says, `Look, we'll wait till after the election,' what is it that would prompt the Commonwealth Bank to think that a New South Wales Labor government would somehow significantly change the financial capacity of the New South Wales Labor Party to pay off its huge interest bill and pay off its debt? Why would this magically happen? Why would an election win mean that all of a sudden the Commonwealth Bank's losing investment in Labor could be paid off?

         It seems to me that there is no honest reason whatsoever why Labor coming into power in New South Wales, if such a terrible thing were to happen, would mean that it would suddenly be able to pay off its huge debt and emerge from its technical bankruptcy. I presume that the Commonwealth Bank must take the view that it expects the Carr government to be like the previous Labor governments in New South Wales—back to the good old days of graft, corruption and lolly shop mentality. The ALP will be able to make enough out of being in government to pay off the debt. Otherwise, why is the Commonwealth Bank giving the Labor Party this special benefit that it does not seem to give so many other debtors?

         We can also ask quite reasonably whether or not the particular style of the classic New South Wales right wing, which would dominate any Labor government if people in New South Wales were unfortunate enough to end up with one next Saturday, has already been foreshadowed. I refer to the way a Labor government `will hand over the Sydney Showground to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for a planned film studio complex without a formal tender'—that is, if it wins Saturday's election. The New South Wales Labor Party spokesman on finance, Mr Michael Egan, said at the weekend:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the Labor Party did not believe it was proper or necessary to have a formal tender. A Labor Government would negotiate directly with News Corporation to ensure the film studio complex was built on the Showground site.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that other people are interested in that site, but the traditional way that the Labor Party in New South Wales does deals is with a mate, and one way or another some benefit to the Labor Party emerges out of that deal. Is this the sort of deal that the Commonwealth Bank has in mind when it thinks that it might be able to resolve the loss that is staring it in the face if the Labor Party is to win the next election? I am overjoyed to see the editorial in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        today, which reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Treasurer and Arts Minister, Mr Peter Collins, is right to reject the private threat from Fox Filmed Entertainment (a wholly owned subsidiary of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation) that it could move its planned film studio from Sydney to Melbourne if the State Government insists on retaining the tendering process.

        Exactly the same sort of deal that bankrupted those states would be imposed on New South Wales if the bankrupt state ALP were to get its hands on the lolly jar. I can understand why the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to let the New South Wales Labor Party maintain its huge indebtedness until after the election.

         One wonders in that context what the Labor Party would do about the Sydney casino. What sort of secret deal would it come to in that situation? We have, in fact, a clear warning to the people of New South Wales. If they want to go back to the days of those secret deals—particularly secret deals, I might say, in this instance; both of those things I have mentioned could bear some relationship with media proprietors—and I do not believe they do, then clearly to get that they would vote Labor.

         It is interesting that the Labor Party's subsidiary company, Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd, has not yet lodged its annual return. The latest on record is for 1993. There is no annual return for 1994. It is in breach, yet again, of Australian Securities Commission requirements. It breaks the law. It does not pay its bills. It does secret deals. That is what the Labor Party in New South Wales is all about. That is the party that, frankly, has no credibility, particularly when it is outspending the Liberal and National coalition in New South Wales in this election campaign.

In view of the tirade we had from Senator Bolkus just before 12 o'clock in which he accused honourable senators on this side of being racists and all sorts of things, I thought it might be appropriate to examine the government's credibility on the issue of race discrimination.

         Race discrimination is not combated by what you say so much as how you behave yourself. I want to tell the Senate today how the Labor Party tells the ethnic community of this country one thing in relation to a commitment to do away with race discrimination but then quite happily tolerates behaviour by members of its parliamentary party which is quite contrary to the standard it would have the ethnic community believe it supports. In other words, the Labor Party is hypocritical when it comes to the issue of race discrimination.

         The evidence I wish to present to the Senate is contained in a radio interview conducted on 6PR on 10 March this year in which a Labor senator alleged that there was some dark, sinister conspiracy between the Liberal and National parties, the National Civic Council, the refugee associations and the legal profession to populate northern Australia with Asians. This ludicrous nonsense—it is quite simply ludicrous nonsense—is part of a long-running saga in which this senator has shown himself incapable of examining issues of migration with an open mind. I will read to the Senate portions of this interview that demonstrate the point that the Labor Party is quite happy to tolerate less than satisfactory behaviour from its own people. The senator in question, when speaking in relation to Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4), said to the interviewer:

If it is not a disturbing manifestation of a psychological disorder, then it is quite clearly the case that what we have is a Labor Party that is doing this sort of thing for deliberate political purposes. In other words, it is trying to whip up a little bit of anti-Asian sentiment in Western Australia for its own political purposes, yet it comes to this parliament and berates the coalition and says that the coalition is not fair dinkum about race relations in this country and that the coalition does not understand the issue of race.

         —I take this opportunity to speak on a matter of public interest. It is Seniors Week in both New South Wales and Victoria. The week of 19 March to 26 March is the week in which we in those two states celebrate with seniors, acknowledge their contribution to our community and make a commitment to the needs of seniors in our community. As I mentioned in the notice of motion this morning, there were 2,109,109 Australians aged 65 years and over as at June 1994. That represents 11.82 per cent of the population.

         We need to address this issue because, as we will see over the next 35 years, the number of people in that age group will increase to 2.52 million or to over 20 per cent of the population—that is, one in every five people in Australia will be over 65 years of age. Many issues are of great concern to seniors today. Many seniors are pioneers who are actually paving the way for those of us who are going to be in that age group in the 21st century. They are making a mark and making it easier for those of us who will follow.

         The issues that concern them are age discrimination in the work force and compulsory retirement on the basis of age; retirement incomes and superannuation; the area of social security—you only have to listen to talkback radio, as I was doing over the weekend, and hear how long people have to hang on to the telephone when they are ringing up the Department of Social Security; health, health funding, health insurance, access to health and waiting lists; community care that enables real choice for older people when they need assistance to either have care in their own homes or live in residential care; those who care for older people, many of whom are old themselves and, in particular, older women; residential accommodation and its funding; and mental health such as the increase in the number of people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

         As I said, this is a week and a time when we should celebrate and take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution seniors have made to our great nation. Many of them fought in wars. Many of those gallant young men and young women who gave up their lives and their health to fight for the security of Australia and to fight for the freedoms that we enjoy in Australia and take so much for granted are in their twilight years—the older years of their lives. It is through them that we have this freedom which we so easily and often forget about.

         We also acknowledge the contribution that they have made through their participation in the paid work force. Many of them are working now in their 60s, 70s and 80s. In fact, I met a man the other day who said to me that he had just retired from his butcher shop at 86 and that he was missing the contact with his customers. So many of them are working and contributing to our community at what many would have considered some years ago to be a very old age.

         Not only are older people in the paid work force, but also they are doing unpaid work as carers of other older people, as carers of grandchildren—and many grandparents now take enormous responsibilities in caring at home for young children whose parents are out working—and as voluntary workers in the community. We see examples over and over again of older people playing their roles in hospitals and community organisations. They also undertake work in respect of interacting in their families. I was talking to a colleague only today—and I will not obviously discuss who it is—who told me what an important role the grandparent had played in a particular issue that faced their family in the last few weeks. Often we forget the role that they play in giving guidance and assistance and sometimes being a linchpin or a conduit between the younger person and their families when communication breaks down.

         We find that the government has done much to undermine the certainty and lifestyle of many seniors. In the area of superannuation we have seen continual changing of the goalposts, with complicated and constantly changing sets of rules. There is increasing uncertainty with the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge that there will be adequate superannuation for the majority of Australians. For women, the situation in regard to superannuation is even more grim. It is generally acknowledged that, because of the broken work patterns of women, lower incomes and the effect of taxes and charges on superannuation accounts, many women will be severely disadvantaged in their senior years.

        That is a very poignant example of the fact that a significant proportion of people who make up the older population, those over 85, are women. The government has not addressed the issue of women and their particular needs with regard to superannuation retirement incomes. It is a sad reflection on this government that it really has not done enough to address that issue, particularly in respect of the many women born during the baby boom who will come into that age group and who will be faced with inadequate incomes to live out their older lives.

         The other area in which the government has failed seniors is in regard to the income and assets tests for the assessment of pensions. Time and again in this chamber we have pointed out to the government the inequities associated with the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. We might have seen a decline in the number of letters coming into our offices from pensioners on this issue because of the state of the share market, but once those shares start to increase again we will start to see a fluctuation in income for pensioners that is totally intolerable. When the value of shares was going up, my colleagues and I received letter after letter from people with a small amount of money, $20,000 or $30,000, in shares pointing out the huge effect that this was having on the flow of their income from fortnight to fortnight.

         There has also been a failure by the government to address the needs of older people with dementia. Various groups are coming together and saying to the government, `It is intolerable. It is impossible now to run a dementia specific unit. If you run a dementia specific unit, you can do it more cheaply than you can in a nursing home but it is more costly than a hostel.' The government fails to acknowledge that and very few, if any, organisations are now venturing into the area of caring for people with dementia in residential care because it is not financially viable to do so. The government has failed to address that.

         Nor has the government addressed the need to have flexible respite care. It is not always appropriate for older people to have respite care in a nursing home or a hostel. Many carers find that it is not worth the effort to get the people for whom they are caring into respite care in a nursing home or hostel because after two or three weeks respite care they have to settle them back into their own environment. It is more than it is worth having the two or three weeks off. Yet we do not see the government addressing creative programs.

         If a person who has dementia used to like to go fishing at Victor Harbour, then what that organisation might do is find a volunteer or a couple who would take the person away to fish at Victor Harbour—back to where he used to go when he was younger. Some of the earlier memories of many people who have dementia are much clearer and they are not as confused if they go to somewhere they know. People do not see that they have failed by having to say, `My husband or my wife is in residential care while I go on holidays.' They can say, `I have never liked fishing. My husband has gone fishing,' so they do not perceive themselves as having failed.

         We have had report after report on the HACC program and the need for review. Some of the COAG meetings and the meetings of relevant ministers have pointed out the need to actually reduce the overlap. I think Mrs Tehan, the Victorian Minister for Health Services, told me that there are 39 various programs in the home and community care program. Because of the lack of case management, an overriding organisation and good cooperation between the state and federal governments, we find that people are falling between two stools. What we need to ensure is that the service is not there for the bureaucrats, for the service providers and for the state or federal governments, but that it is there for the individuals who need the care.

         As I said before, one of the things that older people face is age discrimination. We have compulsory retirement. The government has done nothing. Mr Connolly and I have introduced private members' bills into the parliament to eliminate age discrimination in the Commonwealth Public Service. Nothing has been done about it. Why should we fix the retirement age at a particular age? It makes no sense and makes no allowance for individual differences in fitness or capacity in older people. The government has been very tardy in addressing this issue.

We constantly hear how it is hot shot on women's issues, but where is it when it comes to age discrimination? When I was teaching at the Lincoln Institute I remember seeing an advertisement for furniture which showed an older lady sitting in a four-sided structure drinking a cup of tea.

         If you go through advertising material, you can often find such age discrimination. Fortunately, it is being reduced. My students wrote quite a heated letter to the people who put in that advertisement. You can still see discrimination in the media in particular, and also in government policy, where older people are portrayed as being dependent, frail, inflexible, passive, unproductive, mentally deteriorating or even needing institutionalisation.

In this matters of public interest debate I want to give recognition to the fact that today is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This international day was agreed to in 1966 pursuant to resolution No. 2142 of the 21st session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Australia voted for that resolution. It is noteworthy that at that time it was a Liberal-National government which controlled our vote at the United Nations for the purposes of designating today as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

         When we look at placitum (xxvi) of section 51 of our constitution, we note that in 1967 an amendment was made deleting the words `other than the aboriginal race in any State'. In other words, the Aboriginal people were incorporated into the Commonwealth constitution—once again another initiative of the Liberal side of politics. That referendum won the overwhelming support of the Australian people.

         Given the earlier debate in the Senate today, it is with a note of sadness that I feel it necessary to get up and talk on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In the past there has been what I consider to be a fairly bipartisan approach, as was taken with this amendment to our constitution to give Aboriginal people the same status as those of us who have a different coloured pigment in our skins or lack pigment in our skins. It is important to note that the Liberal Party has a very strong and proud tradition in this area.

         We were submitted to some revisionist history earlier today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who suggested that it was a former Labor minister who had, in effect, got rid of the White Australia policy. It is worthy to note that the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was a great supporter of a former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang. The current Prime Minister moved within the New South Wales division of the Labor Party to allow Jack Lang's membership to be reinstated. Indeed, the Prime Minister comments about the fact that he sat at the feet of Jack Lang and that Jack Lang had a great impact on his life.

         The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs sought to impute improper motives to the opposition when we sought earlier today to delay—for only some seven days—the discussion of a bill so that we could consider it.

However, we on this side of the house take the view that no matter how obnoxious those views are, people ought to be allowed, in general terms, to express them. Nevertheless, we will work without ceasing to ensure that there is, within the community of Australia, an acceptance of all the different racial groups as full Australians and as a part of mainstream Australia without trying to marginalise them by treating them the way the minister has.

         The Commonwealth is certainly concerned about the uncertainty relating to the new titles issued in Western Australia since 1993. Premier Court has deliberately ignored the processes that were set down in the Native Title Act. He has to take ultimate responsibility for the effect of his decision in Western Australia. He has to take responsibility for the waste of at least $4 million of taxpayers' money and for the uncertainty that now surrounds some thousands of titles that have been issued since 1993. The uncertainty, such as it is in Western Australia, is wholly of that state government's doing—and it is up to it to decide how best to fix the mess it has created. We are nevertheless prepared to work with the Western Australian government to ensure that issues arising from this decision can be addressed cooperatively. Preliminary talks have already been held at ministerial level with the Court government and further discussion at both official and ministerial level will obviously be needed.

Nor will we accept any prescription from the opposition that goes to the spirit of this law or anything else we have been doing so far as Aboriginal legislation and social justice programs are concerned. The heart of this legislation is the spirit that we understand to be at issue here as far as Aboriginal people are concerned.

I hope that he will at least attempt to be a bit more honest in his answer to this question than he was in his previous answer to Senator Hill. I refer to the sudden, sharp fall in the value of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar and the trade weighted index, which includes most other currencies, including the Japanese yen, against which we have now reached a record low. Has the US merchant bank Goldman Sachs compared the Australian economy with the Mexican economy and predicted a further large fall in the value of the dollar because of the blow-out of the current account deficit expected in the next six months and the government's inability to deliver on its responsible fiscal policy? Does the plummeting value in the dollar and a continuing concern about its prospects greatly increase the likelihood of further interest rate hikes and tax increases once the New South Wales election is out of the way, or will you categorically rule out these increases in interest rates and taxes?

However, what I am also saying and what this government has been saying since day one is that the government is committed to a significant tightening of fiscal policy in the May budget in order to boost national saving and, as a result, reduce Australia's call on overseas capital.

         The growth in the Australian economy is perfectly sustainable when you take into account the enormously strong productivity performance that this economy has accumulated.

         The nonsensical notion that somehow interest rate strategy is being governed, or directed, or somehow influenced by current political events utterly fails to acknowledge the reality that the government does not single-handedly control interest rates even if we were irresponsible enough to want to behave in that way. That is a function of the Reserve Bank's decision making authority, in consultation with the government, but in its own authority and based on its own sense of monetary responsibility. To make the accusation of the kind that you continue to make and have been making over the last few days and weeks is to demonstrate an absolute contemptuous lack of respect for the credibility of those people who make up the Reserve Bank board. The point is that we have a responsible monetary policy. We are determined to put the primary weight of the necessary economic adjustments on fiscal policy for the reasons that I have explained, and we have a sustainable deficit target that will be reached as a result of that budgetary process.

Over the last few months our ambassador in Saudi has had a series of meetings with the Acting Minister for Agriculture and Water, the deputy minister and other key officials regarding the Saudi requirement for the importation of Australian live sheep.

         Here, I am responding to the uncertainty that was created by the Gunns decision about the application of the act to ongoing operational decisions. For example, one of the potential consequences is that each individual coal shipment from a coal mine that has been assessed under the act needs to be designated and reassessed. I think nearly everyone would accept that that is undesirable, that it is unworkable and that it is not consistent with the government's understanding and interpretation of the act. It is also contrary to plain, good old-fashioned commonsense.

         There is no doubt that he was held responsible in the sense that he had to assume the commander's responsibility for the acts of those subordinate to him, which responsibility he did accept.

What steps has the bank taken to achieve a reduction of the principal of this massive debt or has it in fact blown out in recent weeks?

         It is, of course, the case that the ALP lost a considerable amount of money on that transaction as a result of the collapse in the Sydney property market. Lots of people lost money in property investments and have been in some financial difficulty as a result of those events. The Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, knows all about that because he is in charge of the state superannuation scheme which has had a write-down of $1 billion as a result of the collapse of the Sydney property market in the early 1990s. That is $1 billion of taxpayers' money that has been written down as a result of that little exercise in property speculation; $1 billion of taxpayers' money in New South Wales has been put at risk by the property investments of the state superannuation scheme under John Fahey.

         The Premier, Mr Fahey, said that the cost of these 26,000 places would be about $116 million in one year and the liability for the state would be about $58 million. What this means is that $60 million of that liability would be the Commonwealth's. So Premier Fahey is making a promise to the New South Wales people that is contingent on this Commonwealth finding $60 million recurrent each year for child care when he has not even signed the national child-care strategy for the last five years. It is pretty bold of the Premier to go around promising to spend Commonwealth money—$60 million of it recurrent each year—when he has not been prepared to sign the national child-care strategy for the last five years.

I ask senators why he is proposing this idea of 26,000 places. It is because this issue is about to be something that matters to the people in New South Wales. They have been duded of over 8,000 places over the last five years because the New South Wales government has refused to sign this strategy. Now, on the eve of an election, not only is the Premier promising the heavens but he is promising to spend $60 million of Commonwealth money recurrent each year. That is a promise he knows that he cannot make. He is just not serious about this issue. He has ratted on families in New South Wales, and he has certainly betrayed the women.

If the Reserve Bank, in consultation with the government, decides that it is not appropriate to raise interest rates at this time, that is the decision of the Reserve Bank and that is one that we will readily accept because of course we would prefer that the economy is managed without the need to go back to further interest rate rises.

         —I am, of course, aware that the proposal to build an international film studio in Sydney—which was initiated not by the Fahey Liberal government, it did not have anything to do with starting the proposal, but by 20th Century Fox—is in some doubt and as a consequence there is a concern that millions of dollars of investment in the film industry and all that that entails in terms of creative opportunities, infrastructure opportunities and job opportunities for Australians might be lost to Sydney. Senators would be interested in the history.

         The proposal was first announced by the Prime Minister in Creative Nation in October of last year. The Prime Minister said at the time that the Fox proposal would need to be discussed with the New South Wales state government—this gave us some cause for apprehension because we did not know whether it would ever go ahead; nothing goes ahead once the hand of the New South Wales government gets on it—which owns the proposed site, the Sydney showgrounds. Given the importance and significance of this proposal, the Prime Minister was quick to commit the Commonwealth government to assisting with site development preparation.

         It was interesting to hear twice today Liberal senators from New South Wales contend that sleazy deals are involved in coming to an agreement of exactly the sort that Mr Kennett has proposed. I do not think that is a reasonable criticism of Mr Kennett or any of the other states that would love to have the opportunity to have this investment. But rather than grab this initiative which the Commonwealth made possible, the Fahey government decided not to negotiate with Fox but to invite competitive expressions of interest to implement an idea that somebody brought forward.

         This is a very difficult prospect for people who have been in opposition for a long time to understand. Obviously, the originators of the idea would not be encouraged to come to the state with ideas if all their ideas are going to be held up for tender and their competitors can come in and bid for their ideas. Obviously, Mr Kennett understands that this is not a proposal that would be attractive to anybody wishing to make a serious investment. He has come forward and sought to steal this project out from under the nose of New South Wales, putting at risk the possibility that Sydney and New South Wales might gain significant employment, investment and creative opportunities.

         It is not a question of this being a terrible Labor attack on the Liberals because Mr Kennett is an equally enthusiastic Liberal. He is putting forward this proposal and he wants to attract this proposal to Victoria. This is not inconsistent with the experience of every minister who has ever had to deal with a proposal that requires cooperative proposals from a state. From Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania you can get an interest, a response and some sort of initiative that leads to a venture proceeding, but if it gets into New South Wales nothing happens. Every time you get a proposal that requires a hand from the New South Wales government, the proposal stalls and stops dead.

         The point about my answer to you last week or whenever it was, Senator Coulter, is that you were suggesting that solar energy could be the answer in itself to North Korea's nuclear needs. The point of the matter was that in order to generate the kind of power that is going to be produced by the two 1,000 megawatt stations that will be supplied under this negotiation to save us all from having bombs dropped upon us, you will recall, Senator Coulter, and in order to pay for the energy equivalent of that in solar energy, you would have to spend something like $15 billion on solar heating appliances scattered around the landscape, and that is on the assumption that there is enough sunlight in North Korea to play upon these installations in order to generate the wattage that is required.

         I think in a first class feat of diplomatic endurance the United States did negotiate such an agreement with the North Koreans, the trade-off for which was that North Koreans would be assisted with their energy production needs in the future. On a transient basis, pending the construction of those energy power plants, there was going to be the supply of heavy fuel and Australia's contribution was to assist to pay for that, as I said, as essentially a symbolic contribution to the larger peace deal.

The key thing is that, under the Uruguay Round, we have got agreement to reduce them in the United States and even more importantly—we should not forget this—to reduce them in Europe. Budgetary pressures in Europe and the United States will reinforce the impact of those Uruguay Round commitments and should lead to opportunities for Australian exporters in dairy and other agricultural products to be significantly enhanced during this decade as a result of the Uruguay Round.

         —I thank Senator Colston for his question. In the Uruguay Round we did have, amongst the other important initiatives that I was able to outline in the response to Senator Boswell's question, an important commitment from the Japanese government to institute the graduated opening of Japan's agricultural market, particularly with regard to rice, although there were important market opening opportunities in other products which hopefully I will have time to comment on briefly. But we should not underestimate the significance of that. The percentage figures are small—rising from four per cent of domestic consumption in the base year period in 1995 up to eight per cent by the year 2000—but that means 380,000 tonnes of imported rice this year and 758,000 tonnes by the year 2000.

         Australian rice growers and the Ricegrowers Cooperative Ltd are understandably optimistic about winning a significant share of this because, in the temporary market opening recently caused by the 1993 crop problems in Japan, Australia's rice was very well received on the Japanese market. The type of the rice, the japonica style, and its utilisation and quality were very well received. If the processes that are instituted to implement this commitment enable fair and open competition for that 380,000 tonnes this year, Australia will win a very big share of it. It is not excessive for our rice growers to think they might win half of it. It certainly is a very reasonable objective for them to set themselves and they have been going about the promotion intelligently. A similar opportunity on a smaller scale arises in Korea.

         There are other agricultural market opportunities for Australia in the market opening in Japan in wheat, in barley and in dairy. We are already starting to do well in some of those markets. That opening—small as it is and only a first step in what needs to be a much more substantial market opening—could be very important for Australian primary producers and will generate a lot of export income for Australia and a lot of income for many Australian towns. In conclusion, for all those who say that there is a serious problem with the Uruguay Round and that we should not have entered into it—and there were some in the Senate who said that—they should go to Leeton and explain to the rice growers why it is not a good idea that Australia signed up to the Uruguay Round.

I have been provided with the following information. I am advised that the bubble boy card series produced by the Queensland AIDS Council was funded by the Queensland Department of Health from the AIDS matched funds program, known as the MFP. Under the national HIV/AIDS strategy, the Commonwealth allocates funds to the states and territories on a matched dollar-for-dollar basis for HIV/AIDS activities. Funding is provided to the states under the MFP for education, prevention, treatment and care, training and evaluation activities conducted by state AIDS councils and other non-government groups as well as state developed and administered HIV/AIDS programs. Responsibility for allocating MFP funds rests with the relevant state health authority within the framework of the national HIV/AIDS strategy.

         —Earlier today, the Temporary Chairman of Committees, Senator Colston, agreed to refer to me a ruling which he made concerning remarks made by Senator Bolkus about Senator Vanstone. Senator Bolkus said that Senator Vanstone had produced `something out of a brown paper envelope'. Senator Vanstone submitted that this remark raised an implication that she had improperly taken some action in return for a consideration, and that the remark was therefore a personal reflection on her within the meaning of standing order 193. Senator Colston said that he was unsure that the remark was unparliamentary and that he was not convinced that there was a personal reflection intended, but he required the minister to withdraw the reference to Senator Vanstone.

         transcript of the exchange, like Senator Colston, I am not convinced that the personal reflection perceived by Senator Vanstone either was intended or would be perceived by a reasonable listener to the debate. The chair has regard to the context in which remarks are made and, having regard to the context of the remarks in question, it would appear that the expression `brown paper envelope' implied secrecy and lack of consultation rather than receipt of improper considerations. If a senator believes, however, that remarks constitute a personal reflection, the chair leans towards requiring a withdrawal of the remarks; and that is what Senator Colston very properly did on this occasion.

As Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Minister for Justice, was leaving the chamber he said to me, `Somebody from my office is going to ring your office and the answer will be forthcoming tomorrow.' I am pursuing the matter because on 6 January 1995 my office requested a response to that question which had been asked in October.

        During the recent overseas jaunt of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), he demeaned his position and that of the Australian nation by disgracefully breaking the long accepted convention of not pursuing domestic political issues whilst representing his country overseas. I am sure no-one will ever forget his elbowing aside of the Prime Minister of Singapore on the steps of the parliament house there to mount an attack on opposition leader John Howard.

         When the Prime Minister was not so paranoically and embarrassingly engaged, which was the case most of the time, he made himself look even more ridiculous by telling the Europeans how to run their economies. He told Germany of all places, with the strongest economy in the world, how to do business with Asia, how to rebuild its cities and how to reshape the global power balance. While Mr Keating was feeding his ego by strutting the world stage, sounding every decibel more like a dictator in the making, the Australian economy continued to plunge into further balance of payments deficit, the foreign debt continued to soar and the Australian dollar plummeted against virtually all other currencies, including the deutschmark, the currency of the nation whose chancellor Mr Keating had the arrogance to lecture on economic management.

         Today, when I pointed out to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) that the fall in the Australian dollar and our chronic balance of payments problem made further interest rate and tax increases inevitable unless the government acted swiftly and surely to put its budget house in order, he refused even to comprehend that situation. The simple fact is that the government is attempting to sweep this inevitability under the carpet until after the New South Wales election next Saturday. That is a quite disgraceful abrogation of the government's responsibility to manage the affairs of state at the national level. It is almost an exact repeat of what the Hawke government did in 1988, when the Prime Minister was Treasurer and when the then New South Wales Labor government under Premier Barrie Unsworth was fighting for survival—unsuccessfully as it turned out.

         The delays in taking responsible economic action at the federal level in 1988 simply in a totally unopportunistic domestic political attempt to save the skin of a colleague government at the state level in New South Wales—the delays that were caused for that very reason alone—were what led directly to the then Treasurer pulling on the recession that he said we had to have. In reality, it was a recession we should never have had to have if there had been one ounce of economic responsibility and acceptance of that responsibility at the federal government level. We are seeing the same thing again this year in the 1995 election for the New South Wales government. I am absolutely certain that the result will be the same as that of 1988: that is, desperate attempts by a Labor government in Canberra to save their Labor mates—and I use the word advisedly—in New South Wales will be as unsuccessful in 1995, and deservedly so, as they were in 1988.

The unemployment rate is 38 per cent, but if we take into account those who are working for the dole on Commonwealth unemployment programs, 54 per cent of Aborigines are unemployed.

Certainly, when I travel, it is quite common for people to compliment the Australian people and the Australian government on the changes that have been made to indigenous policy in this country. A number of people, particularly from Canada and the United States, are extremely impressed with ATSIC and the way it operates. But all we ever hear in this place is criticism of the commission and—

         —I want to add a few remarks to Senator Gareth Evans's response to the question of native title legislation. The response made by the Liberal Party to the decision of the High Court the other day is of concern, a concern highlighted by Senator Hill's contribution today. I took his remarks as a re-run of the mark 2 position on the land fund, which talked about amendments addressing issues of education, health, housing, et cetera. That was the Downer position, as different from the Hewson position, as different from the Howard position, which is now to claim that the legislation is unworkable. That shows the total disarray in which the Liberal Party finds itself in relation to Aboriginal issues.

         The High Court found the other day that the Western Australian legislation was invalid. It ruled seven to nil on that issue. It is quite clear that the Commonwealth's legislation has been upheld while the Western Australian legislation was found to be invalid and, in my view, essentially racist.

          The Liberal Party has to come to terms with that. It cannot continue to bow to the Liberal rednecks in Western Australia who want to pretend it never happened. The fact is that the Mabo decision did happen; the federal parliament responded and legislated in accordance with that decision.

It seems strange, now that the state has finally forced the government to make concessions—only weeks before the state election, in which Labor is not looking good—that Senator Crowley is now holding off signing the agreement. One would almost be led to the conclusion that she is more concerned with playing political games with her state counterparts than actually being concerned about child-care places.

         The New South Wales government had not previously signed the agreement, because it was not convinced that the strategy was in the best interests of children or their parents. It was particularly concerned that the Commonwealth's emphasis on child care for children with working families did not adequately address the needs of vulnerable children.

         New South Wales accepted the Commonwealth's offer of additional child care places after three points were conceded: firstly, when new places were promised for disadvantaged families, which Labor was not prepared to fund under the previous guidelines; secondly, when the Commonwealth finally ensured that administrative agreements were streamlined, which reduced bureaucratic delays; and thirdly, when long day care places were added into preschools, which is surely making the best use of resources. In negotiating for those concessions, the New South Wales government was not being obstreperous. It had simply taken great pains to work out an agreement that appropriately addressed the needs of families in New South Wales and ensured a high standard of care for children.

These problems included insufficient baby places, insufficient child care places in rural areas, the cost of child care, a lack of flexibility in care arrangements and so on. Parents continually complained about the lack of places, the long waiting lists and the unsuitability of the opening hours for centre based care.

         This report, which is the second report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, was tabled out of session due to the pressures of business during the last sitting week. This is a report on the first annual report of the National Native Title Tribunal. It is worth noting that this report of a parliamentary committee relating to Aboriginal affairs is again a unanimous report. The committee has representatives from all parties represented in the Senate except the Australian Democrats. I would like to thank the committee members and the staff, and also acknowledge the cooperation we received from the tribunal president and its staff. As always, they conducted themselves in a very professional manner. I think they are doing an excellent job.

          The process undertaken to complete this report was very constructive. This point is highlighted by a submission from Mick Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner. He made some very constructive criticisms about the operation of the tribunal, but he did it in a constructive and positive way and contributed to the debate rather than use it as a point scoring exercise.

          The overall conclusion contained in the report is that the Native Title Tribunal is soundly established. The early teething problems about which we received evidence seem to have been addressed satisfactorily and the tribunal is playing a very good role in liaising with all the interested parties. The president has established liaison committees in each of the states and is keeping in close contact with industry and the Aboriginal interests to make sure that the tribunal is kept abreast of developments and is sensitive to the needs of both industry and Aboriginal communities.

          The report deals with two major issues, but I will not go into them in any great detail. Firstly, it deals with the acceptance process for applications. Secondly, it deals with the president's first suggested amendments to the act. In terms of the acceptance test, there were arguments from industry that the threshold of the test was too low and that Aboriginals were being allowed to enjoy the benefits of the right to negotiate regime without fully establishing their claim to native title. Aboriginal groups were concerned about the delays in having their claims accepted, the pre-acceptance discussions the tribunal was having, particularly with state governments, and the allegation that they were being required to go through hoops that were not envisaged by the act.

          The committee in its conclusion unanimously agreed that section 63 of the act, which governs the acceptance of applications, was being applied correctly by the tribunal—that is, that it was appropriately applying the tests set down in the legislation. In essence, the committee therefore rejects the view that the threshold had been set at too low a level. However, the committee noted:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The need for the Tribunal to ensure that the pre acceptance consultation is confined to questions of a factual nature and does not amount to mediation or negotiation with parties.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is a recognition by the committee of the concerns and criticisms raised by the Aboriginal parties with what, on occasions, they considered to be quite long delays at the acceptance stage. We are pleased to note that the president in his submission to the inquiry has responded to those concerns and is amending the tribunal's procedures to respond to the evidence presented to the committee.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the other issue of the president's proposed amendment to the act, the committee took the view that it was too early, given the formative stage of the legislation and the need for more practical experience, to make a definitive judgment on this proposed amendment. The committee concluded at the time that we ought to await the decision of the High Court. As senators would be aware, that decision has now been handed down. The decision upheld the Commonwealth legislation and struck out the Western Australian legislation as being invalid.

          In normal circumstances it would be appropriate to consider that early amendment suggested by the president. I must say, however, that the debate has now very much moved on, not only because of the High Court decision in relation to the WA legislation but also more importantly, in my view, because of the decision of the High Court in the Brandy, case which has implications for the Native Title Tribunal. The changed public stance of organisations like the WA Chamber of Mines and Energy and the comments reported in today's
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian
          </emphasis>
          by the head of CRA in Australia are indicative that the whole debate has moved on. I think a discussion of the president's amendment is really not very helpful at this stage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The president has submitted to the government a range of further amendments which address the Brandy decision and the implications of that decision for the Native Title Tribunal. The government will have to seriously look at those suggestions in responding to the difficulties posed by the Brandy decision. They ought to be the focus of discussion about amendments to the native title legislation. It is still the case that it is too early to look at whether or not the principles underlying the legislation have been successfully applied. That is due to the uncertainty brought about by the WA High Court challenge and the fact that most parties have held off proceeding under the Native Title Act until a clear decision had been made.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There are also issues relating to pastoral leases about which judicial decision is awaited. Quite frankly, the states have played a negative role in a number of cases by taking technical legal points during mediation proceedings which have not allowed the tribunal processes to run as smoothly as one would have hoped. All these factors, together with the basic fact that the development of common law in relation to native title will be a long process and will evolve over time, mean that, in my view, it is too early to properly assess and review the legislation and the impact the Native Title Act is having.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The challenge now is to respond to the Brandy case decision to ensure that the tribunal processes and procedures are altered to reflect that decision, but to allow the basic principles of the act to stay in place. Hopefully, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title will play a constructive and positive role in examining the need for those changes and making recommendations to government and to the parliament. I would hope that all the acrimony that has surrounded Aboriginal issues in this parliament since I was elected to the Senate can be overcome. There have been some good signs during the work of this committee where, despite some differences of opinion, we have managed to produce two unanimous reports. Hopefully, when we get to more contentious issues, that trend will continue.

       I think I am required to give reasons therein. I am advised of the following. As the Senate is well aware, it passed an earlier version of this bill with some 70 amendments last week.

        A new land fund bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 28 February with amendments acceptable to the government and was passed by the House on 8 March. The Senate is of course very familiar with the provisions of the bill, having debated the earlier version at great length. The new bill is identical to the earlier bill as introduced into the Senate subject to the inclusion of 29 amendments agreed to by the Senate.

         —I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 and by our support for the previous motion we were indicating that we are anxious to have this matter passed through the parliament as expeditiously as possible. We do so on the basis that, whilst we have taken a position of principle—and, indeed, I think to a significant extent we have been vindicated by the number of amendments that the Senate managed to achieve to the legislation which the government from the outset maintained did not require any amendments—I think we have demonstrated that the time spent in this chamber has been well worth while.

         Having reached the deadlock position as a result of intransigence on the part of the government in relation to at least some of the balance of those amendments, it seemed clear to us, as Mr Howard spelt out in the House of Representatives on 2 March, that no point would usefully be served by further delay because it was clear the government was not proposing to go down our path and we were not proposing to go down its path. In those circumstances, the only losers would be those who are intended to be the beneficiaries of this legislation.

         In those circumstances, we therefore have made plain that we will support the land fund. Once that is in place, we will obviously monitor progress through to the next election but at that time we will again seek to introduce those amendments which we achieved successfully in this chamber and which we think do go a very significant way towards improving the lot of those who are meant to benefit from the legislation.

         It is significant that this time around, as opposed to the time when the Mabo legislation was debated, a significant number of Aboriginal communities and a number of organisations, particularly the New South Wales Land Council, have made it plain that they do not agree with the government's approach or with the position outlined by ATSIC spokespeople. That does not necessarily mean that those who were criticising ATSIC were right. It also does not mean that ATSIC was right. What it does mean is that there is room for intelligent disputation in the Aboriginal community, and so there ought to be in national politics.

         It is a great tragedy that whenever an issue relating to Aboriginal affairs surfaces—as we all know, it is a very emotive subject—the Prime Minister takes every opportunity to imply that only he is on the side of virtue and that his critics are hard-hearted, selfish people who are seeking to deny the improvement of the Aboriginal condition. That is clearly not the case. There are a number of ways in which progress can be achieved. I would hope that, in the spirit adverted to a moment ago by Senator Chris Evans, there can be honest differences of opinion.

         At this stage, I pay tribute to the work of two of my Senate colleagues, Senators Ian Campbell and Chris Ellison. After considerable consultation, it became clear that there was a significant demand amongst members of the Aboriginal community for much more direct involvement. They did not want to have things decided by so-called official representatives and they did not want to have land simply transferred to corporations. They wanted the approach to be broadened so that individuals would be of paramount importance.

         Senators Campbell and Ellison travelled around the country during January, when Senator Ray and I were at the cricket. It was clearly a very important exercise in ascertaining what it was that the Aboriginal community wanted. I do not think we came up with any single view, and nor should we. But we did discover—I hope the government will acknowledge this—that there are very many different approaches that can be taken in good faith. Therefore, the amendments which were carried by the Senate but which the government will now not pursue are ones which we will certainly seek to reintroduce as soon as the opportunity arises, and that will certainly be after the next election. When we go down that path, we will find that the approach that we are proposing will have a much more holistic impact on the Aboriginal community. It will not simply be focused entirely on land, as important as it is. It will also address other fundamental factors which are necessary for human wellbeing.

         We all know the extent to which the Aboriginal community is greatly deprived in the areas of health, housing, education, welfare and employment opportunities. Unless and until we focus on those greater criteria, it is unlikely that we will see significant improvement in the Aboriginal condition. One of the great tragedies is that, after 12 years of government and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of additional dollars, it is very difficult to demonstrate that Aboriginal health has improved. Indeed, the statistics would indicate quite to the contrary. In those circumstances, the last thing that a Prime Minister ought to be doing is running around pretending that somehow a land fund designed to assist perhaps five per cent of the Aboriginal population is really going to solve any significant problems.

         The problems on the ground relate to very basic human needs which need a lot more attention. They do not just need dollars. They need a lot more experimentation in terms of involvement by the Aboriginal communities themselves. There needs to be a lot more sensitivity on the part of those who are responsible for the administration of those funds. They need to fundamentally address the needs of the local communities. They should not simply be told that land is the answer or that without land they cannot make any progress. The argument has some validity undoubtedly but to suggest that, unless and until you are able to restore to the Aboriginal community an entitlement to land that is tantamount to the freehold that is held by many non-Aboriginal Australians, is almost verging on a cruel hoax.

         The fact is that you have to approach these things in a number of different ways and you have to ensure that you are making progress on a number of different fronts. So we will be, in due course, in the announcement of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy, ensuring that we address all of those issues and that, at the same time, we spell out our commitment to ensuring that the land fund operates in the best interest of Aboriginal communities.

         It is important for at least a couple of government senators to speak to this bill. It is a fact that we occupied a large part of the debate when we debated the previous bill and I do not really wish to traverse all that ground. I acknowledge that Senator Alston did not do that, and that is appropriate, but it is important that we say a few things about this bill because it is important to put it in context. It is the second stage of the government's legislative response to Mabo. It is part of a package of measures the government has initiated to try to respond to the dispossession of Aboriginal people from their land. It is about their relationship with land and about trying to allow them to assert their independence and to assert their relationship with the land.

         The land fund will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way to promote economic, social and cultural benefits. It will address the needs of those who will not benefit from Mabo and the native title legislation—that is, those dispossessed of their land who cannot meet the criteria laid down in the Mabo decision, which requires a continuing connection with the land and waters. The High Court Mabo decision and the native title legislation will always be seen as the landmark, the symbolic recognition of Aboriginal preoccupancy of the land by Australian society. In a practical sense of making land with commercial viability and ongoing benefits available to Aboriginal people, the land fund and the measures contained in the social justice package may prove to be more significant in the longer term.

         The resounding rejection of the Western Australian government's land legislation in response to the Mabo decision and the discriminatory way that legislation  operated has obviously reinforced the Mabo judgment and the correct approach that this parliament adopted. We can now seek to have those native title laws implemented and properly applied and I think we will make significant progress in the next year or so in developing native title. But it will be a long process. It will rely on judicial judgments and the evolution of common law. There are no easy solutions or quick fixes involved in that native title route.

         Despite the rhetoric of some political leaders such as the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, the amount of land that will eventually be found to be native title land and granted to Aboriginals will be quite limited in its extent, because the tests applied by the Mabo judgment and reflected in the native title legislation are quite stringent. It will not be a boon to a large number of Aboriginals in terms of granting them land. Nevertheless, it is a highly significant and symbolic decision and it will result in real benefit to a whole range of Aboriginal communities.

         Justice French, of the Native Title Tribunal, in his ruling on the Waanyi application recently, highlighted some of the problems that Aboriginal groups will have in establishing native title. Because of these problems, it is imperative that the land fund as proposed by the government be implemented and that we start to address the dispossession issue for those Aboriginal people who will not have any opportunity to prove native title.

         These developments will also generally assist in reconciliation within the Australian community as people come to terms with recognising Aboriginal people as people with rights. By recognising Aboriginal dispossession, by acknowledging their right to the land and by purchasing land to be held by Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal people can help regain their self-respect and force non-Aboriginal people to deal with Aboriginals as people with rights. That is a very important development in Australian society. By recognising Aboriginal rights and by people having to deal with Aboriginal people as people who possess rights, a whole new understanding can be developed in Australian society.

         At the risk of repeating remarks I made earlier today in a previous contribution, it is very heartening to hear the chief of CRA, one of Australia's largest mining companies, hailing the Mabo legislation as an opportunity for partnership between mining companies and Aboriginal people, expressing the view that he was satisfied with the central tenet of the Native Title Act and generally being quite positive about the role that mining companies can play in dealing with Aboriginal people as people with rights over land. That is a very encouraging development and represents real change in the climate in Australian society. I have also been heartened by some comments by the Western Australia Chamber of Mines recently, which indicate that it too is beginning to come to terms with native title as a fact in Australian common law, especially now that the Western Australian government's challenge to the native title legislation has been ruled out.

Needless to say, it has been a convoluted and quite confusing path that they have trodden to reach their current position. It is pleasing, nonetheless, to see that we will now get the legislation passed. The government's intention has always been to have the legislation passed rather than to have it provide a double dissolution trigger.

         I want to make some brief comments about one set of amendments which really troubled me—amendments supported by the Liberal Party and the Greens in the discussion of the earlier bill. These amendments sought to have the ILC allow individuals and trusts to own property acquired through the land fund and allow grantees of land fund acquisitions to dispose of that land at any time without the consent of the ILC. I was particularly troubled by those amendments, and I am very glad that the government has held firm in opposing those amendments.

I am sure that has some appeal to those with an interest in rugged individualism, as the Liberal Party has always had, although I am not quite sure what the appeal to the Greens is—but I will have to ask them about that privately.

         My major concern there is that that clearly militates against the central aim of building up an indigenous land base and maintaining it for future generations.

         I cannot begin to imagine what would occur the first time an individual Aboriginal sold land granted under the land fund and used those funds for personal consumption purposes. I have listened to Senators Panizza and Crane over the years making repeated attacks on what they see as wasteful spending in ATSIC programs. They have continued to highlight what they say are real concerns about accountability and the expenditure of money in Aboriginal affairs. Senator Kernot referred to this problem in one of her earlier contributions.

         For the Liberal Party to seriously suggest that it would support granting land to individual Aboriginals, land which they could then on-sell and use the proceeds for personal consumption, and that the Liberals would not be the first to be screaming blue murder in this chamber, alleging misuse of funds and carrying on a treat, is unbelievable in my view.

I would like to acknowledge that the land fund will not be the last step or the last word in this process. The native title legislation represented the first step and the land fund represents the second. The third step is the social justice measures. Some of the ideas coming out of the debate regarding the social justice initiatives may be the most challenging and innovative in dealing with the problem of dispossession of Aboriginal people from their land and taking measures to help Aboriginal people regain their connection with traditional lands.

         There have been a number of suggestions about making available other crown land, about regional land management agreements and about a range of other initiatives that involve a lot of lateral thinking. That lateral thinking has been possible only because of the way the native title legislation, the Mabo decision, and the land fund debate have pushed forward the debate about these issues and the recognition generally that land is very important to Aboriginal people. The cultural and spiritual relationship with the land that Aboriginal people enjoy is a much stronger one than that which Europeans have. It is a very special relationship that we have to recognise in responding to Aboriginal needs.

Contributions by Senator Hill earlier today and Senator Alston in this debate leave me in some doubt as to whether they have yet come to terms with that special relationship with the land and the need for the parliament to recognise that. We always come back to the debate about what this means for education, health and so on. I do not think the Liberals necessarily grasp the central nature of that Aboriginal connection with the land and the fact that, while those other issues are very important, the relationship of Aboriginal people with their land is, in itself, a very central and important issue. I welcome this second bill and hope the Senate supports it.

We have talked widely about what constitutes consultation and dispossession. Those have been important discussions to have had in this place.

I welcome the public comments we have seen so far from ATSIC and the council of reconciliation on what should be in the social justice package.

         However, the coalition had a difficult decision to make. When it became apparent that the land fund bill might not succeed if we stuck it out with our amendments, the question was whether to pass a bill which provides a land fund of some sort or whether to oppose it and thereby thwart the process completely. Mr Griffiths believes that something has to be in place. He was in favour of the New South Wales Land Council amendments, which the coalition has adopted. Rather than lose out on the whole lot, he was saying that he would prefer a land fund in any event—if it has to be that way. That was the decision the coalition had to make. I believe that, in the end, it was an unavoidable decision.

         I notice that the government had to make a decision as to what it did with the 67 amendments and the one request which were put forward in this chamber. The government decided to adopt 28 of those amendments. It would seem that the process of debate and inquiry by the committee concerned was of value. It was of value because the government accepted that there were amendments worth taking on board. I caution those who are somewhat overoptimistic about the working of this land fund. Having heard the evidence, I think it would still have been desirable to have had those amendments as proposed by the coalition.

         There was a great body of opinion in favour of having the land vested in individuals, Aboriginal trusts and the like. It was regarded as patronising to have said to Aboriginal people, `You can only have it in the form of a corporation because we don't trust what you might do with the land.' It was put to the committee that in the wider community individuals were able to hold land and dispose of land, but in this case we had ties imposed upon the recipients, ties being that the Indigenous Land Corporation has some sort of control over the land.

         Most importantly, I believe the question of regional strategies verses national strategies will prove to be one of the most troublesome aspects of this bill. I believe that in a year's time we will again be debating this bill. I believe that we will then have seen 12 months of activity which will show that we cannot place more emphasis on the national strategy than the regional strategy. I fully agree with those witnesses, numerous as they were, who said to our committee that we had to start from the grassroots and work our way up.

After all, there is a limited fund and there will be competing interests. We will have Aboriginal groups vying with each other for land grants and grants for land maintenance.

         I make those comments for the record because I believe this bill proceeded without sufficient consultation and that the select committee which travelled around this country demonstrated that quite vividly. I say to the government that, if it is going to tackle any further bill of this sort, if it is going to embark on any further social legislation, it must consult and consult widely. That was not the case with this bill or the Native Title Bill. The government seems hell-bent on achieving a political agenda; that is, getting this bill through before the next election so that it can go to the Australian people and say, `We did this, that and everything for those in need and for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.' The real question is whether the government did what it did effectively. Did it really provide an instrument whereby those who are dispossessed will be adequately recompensed? That has to be the question at the end of the day. It is not a question of whether the government consulted with some major entities or main role players in the Aboriginal industry, went away and then came up with a political solution. The question is whether it really addressed the needs of those who have been dispossessed over the course of time.

         There has been some comment that this bill is for those who have lost their traditional ties with the land. That is so because the Native Title Act provided in the preamble that there should be a provision for those who could not claim native title. I say to the government that it would be totally unfair if there were a biased view that this land fund bill should be used only for the more remote areas of this country. This land fund is available for all Aboriginal people, including those who happen to live in suburbs in densely populated cities, not just for those who are living in the more remote areas. It seems to me that there is some misconception about this matter.

         In the course of our committee's travels to built-up areas, there were Aboriginal people living in such areas who had long since been dispossessed of any land but who are just as entitled to be considered under this legislation as any other member of their race. I will be monitoring that aspect very carefully to make sure there is an even-handed approach; that those in the city are catered for, those in the country are catered for and those in the remote areas are catered for.

         I support the bill. However, there is one flaw, and it is something that the government might take on board. As stated in annexure A and in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), amendments 36 to 40 as proposed by the coalition and the Greens were to be adopted. There seems to be some problem because in the bill amendment 39 relates to clause 192D(3), which states:

        As I recall—and I am referring to the list of amendments as contained in the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill—amendment 39 was in fact put forward by the Greens to omit the word `Minister' and substitute `Indigenous Land Corporation Board'. This bill was supposed to be a replica of the original bill and was supposed to have adopted word for word those amendments which have been set out in annexure A to the Prime Minister's second reading speech.

         I am telling the Senate that there is a mistake because, when you read that amendment and its brief description, it states that the ILC board, rather than the minister, is to approve certain terms and conditions for ILC directors. The bill that I have been provided with via the chamber certainly has that flaw in section 192D(3). If the government does intend to adopt that amendment, it is going to have to change the wording. If it had intended this to act as a trigger for a double dissolution, it would have been in trouble because this does not incorporate the amendment word for word that was put by this chamber.

I suggest the government not be biased in its approach to this bill. If there are some aspects which do not work, then address them. The Native Title Act has demonstrated to a large degree a lack of efficacy. In fact, there is one view in the west that it is totally unworkable. My view tends to that view.

         —I rise briefly on this new Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill to support my colleague Senator Ellison and to try to answer some of the smirks or points Senator Chris Evans made on the other side. This bill is for indigenous people who have been dispossessed of land in the last 207-odd years since European settlement in Australia. The bill enables the same people to purchase land, acquire land—whatever you like to call it—where they cannot make a claim under the Mabo legislation.

         An amount of $45 million will be set aside in a perpetual fund for the Indigenous Land Corporation to make these purchases. The allocated $45 million is not a very big sum, but it is rather symbolic. I will certainly be waiting to see what will be done with it. That money is there for Aborigines to acquire land, to manage that land and to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits. We have been told that in this case the Indigenous Land Corporation will be setting up a national strategy to carry out the tasks ahead.

         If I can go over each of the points I have made, firstly, acquiring land is quite easy if you have the necessary finance and, of course, if the land is available. Secondly, to manage that land is a bit harder. As one who has been on the land—managing land, acquiring land but not selling it very often in my time in business—I can tell you that managing land is slightly different from acquiring it, and Senator Chamarette is nodding in assent. You manage land to provide economic benefit.

         Some of those corporations might have a few surprises coming. I do not know what type of land they have in mind, but I presume it is mostly pastoral land, the sort of land that Aborigines prefer to wander over and carry out their cultural activities. If anyone looks today at the pastoral industry in Australia and the difficulties it has been having, they might think twice as to whether it is such a good idea to buy these big pieces of land. Pastoral stations are especially quite cheap to buy, and there are quite a few willing sellers these days, but when you acquire land that is when the work starts, that is when the thinking starts and that is where the extra finance has to start.

         It is all very well to say that there is a pastoral station on the market down the road in the Kimberleys, the Pilbara or the eastern goldfields of Western Australia. Excuse me for using the Western Australian regions, but they are the ones I know best. When buying a pastoral lease for $1 million—that is, one forty-fifth of the amount available—you have to look at ongoing costs and at paying the wages bill. I presume that if Aborigines are going to run a lease themselves—and there are not too many pastoral leases that they have bought that really run themselves—they will still have to pay themselves, so there will be a real wages bill.

         Paying that million dollars to pick up a pastoral property with a few head of cattle or sheep on it is only the beginning. There is a lot of ongoing cost.

         On the subject of social benefits, I am sure there will be some as a result of Aborigines being able to live in areas where their forefathers lived and with which they have cultural associations. But on the social side things might not be so rosy. Most Aboriginal people these days live in urban areas. Plenty of ordinary Australians would not trade the easy life of urbanised areas, especially in places like Canberra and Sydney and in the south-west of Western Australia, to go to the stations and outback life. Our pastoral industry is kept going by a dedicated few. But that is something we will see in due course.

         What do people want? Our legislation in Western Australia does not stand up. We have 10,000 applications a year. When we try to put matters before the federal tribunal we are told that we are trying to plug the system up. You tell me where else people can go. I do not know how many mining titles are issued in Victoria and New South Wales, though most are on private land where native title is already extinguished. You tell me where Western Australia can send those 10,000 applications every year. You tell me where there is a tribunal. How many applications has the federal tribunal dealt with? You can count on your hand the ones it has dealt with in two years. What will you do with the 10,000 applications in Western Australia every year? And of those 10,000 that are held up every year, who will recompense the investors in mining and the people that are employed in mining? There are four times as many people employed in the manufacturing sector which supplies the mines as in mining itself—for example, the surveyors and the transport people who rely on mining for their income.

         Since Richard Court got into power in Western Australia unemployment in Western Australia has dropped from 11.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent. He has created employment. He was elected to provide more jobs and better government.

         What will happen to those titles? There is no reaction coming from the other side. Someone has to give us some answers before long. The government had better get some pretty good advice before long. The best thing it can do is to take on Justice French's other suggestions—except that he thinks Western Australia is going to try to clog the system up and wreck the system. The government had better take up some of the ideas about speeding up the situation so that those 10,000 titles will be dealt with. It is not only the Western Australian economy that will suffer.

         As Senator Ellison and Senator Alston said, we are supporting this bill. But I believe that, as Senator Ellison said, it will not be very long before we are back in this chamber looking at further amendments—as we will for the Native Title Bill in time also—because it will not work. I certainly hope the Native Title Bill works. With my experience in land management, I will be looking at it carefully. The bill has our blessing and we hope that it is going to work.

         —A lot of words have been said but I want to put my words on the public record to indicate the Greens' view of this new presentation of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. I acknowledge that the legislation is part of the government's three-stage package in response to the High Court's decision on native title, the first stage being the Native Title Bill. It has been said that approximately five per cent of Aboriginal people may stand to gain from that native title legislation. At this point, 12 months or more down the track, we have not had any Aboriginal people gain, so the number of people who do gain by that provision may be much smaller than five per cent.

         The second part of the three-stage package concerns the land fund and the bill that we are looking at at the moment. The government said on this fund that it would deal with the land needs of the remaining 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who do not stand to gain from the native title legislation. Of course, we are yet to see a full response to the social justice package that has been proposed in recent days by the reconciliation council to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Greens have expressed repeatedly our disappointment with the proposal and its total failure to meet its aim to address the dispossession of 95 per cent of Aboriginal people over the last 200 years.

         The land fund is so small and its operation so constricted that only a small number of people will benefit from it. I am delighted to see that in the presentation of the bill and the second reading speech the language was far more restrained than in earlier times. We did not have the obnoxious reference to the $1.4 billion land fund. I wish the media could recognise the same inaccuracy and restrict their language about it too. The reality of this land fund is that at the very most it will provide $240 million in the next 10 years and extra on what is already available. There will be a draw down of $45 million a year indefinitely as a result of the amount put aside in the consolidated revenue, but that will be largely eaten up, as the debate earlier has showed, not only in management costs but also in administration of the fund itself. So we see a small amount developing.

         The government has developed a strategy that has been looking at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as three groups. One is those who have been least damaged by the impact of colonisation, seizure of lands and extinguishment of native title. That is the group of people who are fortunate enough to still be on their land and be able to disprove any claims by governments that their native title has been extinguished over the last 200 years. The second group is those who may be able to gain assistance from this land fund and gain access to this fund to buy back some country, and presumably pastoral leases will be the main target of these, as we can see from the comments of Senator Panizza: a pastoral lease could be expected to be gained for maybe $1 million, but we know that land in the city and in places where urban Aboriginal people live would scarcely be available. That means that the amount that is available will primarily be used in the country.

         I am indebted to Senator Panizza for having far greater experience on this matter than me. He pointed out the total inadequacy of the amount, the way in which it will be eaten into by management requirements and the way in which the environmental concerns and the capacity to support numbers of Aboriginal people will be severely impeded by the lack of funds.

         The third group are those who have been totally removed from their country and sometimes not even able to acknowledge what part of the country they were taken from. This is because, over the last 200 years, a lot of them were taken in childhood. Those who have been most damaged by colonisation will be last in the queue for this land fund. It is highly unlikely that they will ever gain anything from it.

         What we basically have is a land fund that will meet the needs of a very small number of people. Obviously there have been different views across Australia amongst Aboriginal people, and they revolve around the same dilemma that the Greens have expressed: do we put in place legislation that satisfies a small number—it may be a key number, but it is a small number—who stand to gain, and leave the large percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people dispossessed and, with their dispossession, unaddressed?

         Accepting the land fund means accepting the fact that we will fail to a large degree to address those Aboriginal people who stand to gain nothing from this land fund. In fact, the existence of the land fund penalises them, because it allows the government to pretend that it has redressed the injustice of that dispossession. Senator Gareth Evans referred to this bill as a bill which establishes:
        </tab>

        . . . a very substantial perpetual fund, and an Indigenous Land Corporation to use and administer that fund.

       <para>
        I think the key test of the amount of the fund is how much impact it has on the budget deficit this year. Because if it is a $1.4 billion fund—which, fortunately, most people realise it is not—it would presumably have a $1.4 billion impact on the deficit. If it is one-tenth of that amount, it is a similar amount. The reality is that the budget will increase by $24 million this year and each year after, and the budget deficit will diminish by $24 million for the next X number of years beyond the 10 years.

         That is the symbol of what this government is prepared to do to redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people. That is why I feel a great disappointment with the opposition for its unwillingness to hold out a bit longer on this government and support the amendments that were raised and supported right around the country during the process of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. I think it is a disappointment. I can only assume that the opposition believes that tying Aboriginal people down to a pittance is better than nothing. I will quote from a statement by the Jandu Yawuru Women's Group, because I believe it sums it up very adequately. The women said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With this piece of legislation Aboriginal people find themselves "caught between a rock and a hard place". It's tempting to grab whatever it is that is offered, especially when nothing was being offered to begin with. Country must be protected now, and land acquisition may be the best way to do this. Culture and tradition associated with that land must be protected and maintained now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The women in that delegation went on to make some very cogent points. They stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whilst supporting the intent of the amendment bill, several of the amendments need to be reviewed. The point must be made that organisations such as ATSIC have the most to gain from both the original and amendment bill, and have the resources to lobby Aboriginal people in this matter. What other alternatives to the Indigenous Land Corporation have been put to Aboriginal people that reflects less centralised and more regional control, and that are true to Aboriginal self-determination?
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is a very valid point. If this bill is passed as it is, it will be a great disappointment to all those people who appeared before the committee and urged us to assert the inadequacy of the amount. In fact, that point was unanimous. I do not think there was anyone who did not refer to the inadequacy of the amount in the land fund and want more. Several submissions stated this; I cannot actually count them. One submission which was put at the Dubbo hearing of the Senate select committee urged us to reject the bill as proposed. It said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Senate amendments improve what would otherwise be very paternalistic and regressive legislation, the funding is far too inadequate for the Bill to be treated seriously. The original Bill undermines all the struggles of Aboriginal peoples in the last forty years to end Government paternalism and to demonstrate that they are capable of making their own decisions and that they should be allowed to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The funding currently proposed for the Fund is completely inadequate. It represents an increase of only $25 million per year on what is already provided. The inadequacy of funding is likely to create conflict between Aboriginal communities and may see a disproportionate amount of the funding spent on management rather than on acquisition. This will disadvantage people who have no land.
       </para>
       <para>
        We think the amount of the fund, because of the agreement between the opposition and the government, will not be addressed. Nevertheless, while Senator Evans has expressed the view that he would like this bill to pass unanimously in the chamber, the Greens cannot allow it to go by in that way. We will flag amendments that relate to the size of the land fund, the restrictiveness caused by it being held only by corporations, the disposal of surplus land, the fact that there is no statement which says that this is not to be regarded as compensation for dispossession and the revival of native title.

         A final point was also raised by the Jandu Yawuru Women's Group relating to the gender balance on the ILC board. I will discuss that now because it has not been raised before. While the Jandu Yawuru Women's Group was making its statement to the Senate select committee, it presented something that had not been presented before. Certainly a question had been asked about gender representation, but basically the group recommended that there should be three Aboriginal women selected amongst the Aboriginal members of the board in order to ensure that those who stand to gain from this land fund are able to reflect on women's concerns, contact and connection with the land.

         So that is a further amendment that will be introduced into this bill for the very good reason that Aboriginal women took the trouble to come to the committee. Two delegations of women appeared before the committee: one in Darwin and the other in Broome. I believe that it does them justice to at least flag that point; whether or not it gains support is a moot point.

         Again, I repeat the fact that the amendments that the Greens will move are largely designed to place on the public record our disappointment with this bill, the land fund and the government's response to the land needs of Aboriginal people. In his speech on this matter, Senator Evans said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The original bill, with all the Senate's amendments, has been laid aside in the House of Representatives, and will expire when that house is prorogued for an election. So, the decks have finally been cleared for the parliament to approve this great measure of social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why the Greens will be presenting just a small number of the amendments that it presented earlier. In the main they are not the ones that had support, although some are.

         As I indicated before, the Greens are disappointed. But we feel that the opposition's bipartisan support with the government does two beneficial things: firstly, it reassures at least some Aboriginal people that a token attempt has been made to look at their land needs and that this may augur well for bipartisan approaches that should not be used as political footballs in election processes; and, secondly, it prevents the government from taking, quite unjustifiably, a high moral stand on this particular land fund. Government senators cannot complain that they are the only ones who want to see the land needs of Aboriginal people addressed.

         Unfortunately for the Greens, the opposition is willing to tolerate the low level of funding available for Aboriginal people through this land fund, but at least it means that it is bipartisan and will not be used as a political football. I put on record that I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) make his first election promise, which was that, should the coalition be elected, it will support the amendments as passed in the Senate.

I think their work has been first class in terms of seeking to achieve a better result in the legislation. It is to the government's shame that it ignored the recommendations of the Senate—the Senate's amendments.

         I make it very clear that, as far as the National Party is concerned, there are manifest defects in legislation which says that Aboriginal people are not to be trusted with freehold title to land. Earlier in the second reading debate, Senator Chris Evans from the other side of the chamber said that this legislation was important because it was the first time there was a recognition that Aboriginal people had rights. Leaving aside the mammoth political hyperbole in that, I doubt the extent of a right we give to people if we do not trust them to exercise judgment in relation to their rights.

         My friend on the other side of the chamber Senator Cooney may wish to think about how valuable a right is if it is a right which is curtailed. Senator Cooney and I could get into an interesting philosophical discussion here. A right which is limited in a fashion such that it is less than a right that somebody else may have in similar situations is not much of a right at all. That is my concern. This government legislation says that Aboriginal people are not to be given freehold title to the land in question which is purchased—it is to be under the control of a corporation—and they are to be precluded from enjoying the benefits of a freeholder.

         Here there is a problem in the government's arguments because the only defence for that is saying that we do not trust Aboriginal people not to sell the land. If one argues that we do not trust Aboriginal people not to sell the land, it becomes very difficult to continue sustaining the argument that there is a particular special significance. Surely if there is a special significance for Aboriginals in holding land, it is appropriate that we trust them to preserve that special significance.

There is the conundrum. Ultimately, the government is condemned forever and a day to a paternalistic attitude that says, `We don't believe Aboriginal people are capable of exercising proper judgment in relation to these issues.' There is a yawning gulf between the Labor Party, the government, on that side and the coalition, the opposition, on this side because we believe it is time that we ended the era of paternalism.

         This legislation seeks to perpetuate paternalism for political motives. If one accepts the argument that we should search for a form of land-holding which is, in as close a sense as possible, consistent with the land tenure that Aboriginal groups had prior to white settlement, the way to do it is not to put the land in a corporation but to entrust the land on trust to elders. Surely that is more consistent with traditional Aboriginal concepts of the holding of land. Yet, we have this argument that we have to have a corporate structure. A corporate structure is entirely alien to traditional Aboriginal concepts of holding land, but a corporate structure is very useful for the government because it lets it utilise corporations for political advantage. Make no bones about it: that is exactly what will happen.

It denies individuals the opportunity to have control of their own destiny. That is what the government will do with the passage of this legislation.

Our point of view is that there should be no special laws for people on the basis of the colour of their skin. The government cannot say that this is a special law for people on the basis of the colour of their skin because, after all, the government has said that this is to rectify wrongs which occurred in the past. So there is no argument—no moral argument, no political argument, no argument based even on utility—which can justify the government then saying that it will make things special. Special laws really advantage the people at whom they are aimed. Special laws—this is an experience around the world—marginalise. Special laws condemn groups of people to the periphery of mainstream society.

I do not wish to delay the further passage of this legislation through the Senate, but I put the Labor Party on notice by saying that after the next election things will change and the Aboriginal people of Australia will soon realise that the government has sold them a pup and in many ways it has not taken a real and genuine interest in their needs. This legislation is proof of that and we will rectify that situation.

Her position is that the community ought to give one per cent of government receipts to Aboriginal people. That would not be sufficient to make up for what has happened over the years. We have to look at the current situation and see what can be done to improve it.

         If we took Senator Chamarette's argument to its logical conclusion, we would find that she would say that we should give the land back to the Aboriginal people. That is inconsistent with her proposition that, at the same time, we should bring in more migrants and help the boat people who come from overseas. That might be a logical proposition when taken on its own, but it is an illogical proposition when taken with the proposition that Aboriginal people should be entitled to what they lost in the past.

I will mention, no doubt to their embarrassment, those who were part of the team that has prepared this legislation that has been so well received, will be voted on soon and will be passed by an overwhelming majority of senators.

         —It is gratifying to the government that the coalition has finally seen the sense of the situation and agreed to pass the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 in a form which will be efficient in practice and defensible in principle. It is a matter of regret that the same still cannot be said of the Greens. One would have wished that the opposition's motives in this matter had been a bit more exalted than simply the fear of fighting a double dissolution election in a policy area in which they continue to feel profoundly embarrassed—or if they do not, they should.

         It would have been preferable if the opposition had approached this issue with a real sense of understanding of the significance of the issues involved and a sense of grace about the great changes that are involved, with the enactment of both the native title legislation itself and this companion piece of legislation, the second stage of the government's response to the historic Mabo decision, establishing the land fund and recognising and making provision for recompense for the dispossession which has been suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

         It would have been nice if the opposition had shown the same sort of grace and acknowledgment of the issues of principle involved as was shown in the speech yesterday by the new chief executive of CRA, Leon Davis, who did say—in what was clearly a groundbreaking change of position for his organisation and one which I hope will signal a similar change of direction for the whole mining industry—that he was `satisfied with the central tenet' of the act. He said further that the Native Title Act:

He said further that the statement:

Next it'll be John Howard.' One hopes that it would be John Howard next. So far, unhappily, there has been no sign of that in terms of the basic response of this opposition to the Native Title Act, which it is still talking about fundamentally amending when it gets the chance.

         There has been no fundamental change of heart, it seems, in what those opposite are saying about the proposed land fund act, because they are talking about making further amendments to that, if and when they get a chance. There has not been a change of heart in the attitude to Aboriginal cultural sensitivities, as is revealed by the extraordinary saga over the Hindmarsh documents affair over the last week, where Mr Howard continues to stand behind his former front bench spokesman, Mr McLachlan, after Mr McLachlan engaged in what must be the most tawdry and unpalatable little exercise in recent Australian politics in distributing and photocopying sensitive documents, as he did, for crude political advantage in circumstances of the utmost sensitivity for the Aboriginal people involved.

In the end, a good piece of legislation does seem to have triumphed.

I do not think there is any question of gilding the lily in that respect. That is simply the case. ATSIC has been a very strong and effective supporter of this legislation from the outset. Of course we gave very significant weight to the views of ATSIC, the only organisation capable of representing indigenous opinion nationally and the government's adviser on indigenous matters, but we also took into account, and adopted wherever it was possible to do so, the views of other indigenous organisations.

        As I said, the first amendments relate to the size of the land fund. Just very briefly, for the public record, I will go through the reasons for them. Under the legislation, the government will contribute around $1.28 billion to a trust account in the Commonwealth public account called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund over the next 10 years. The Greens (WA) are concerned that the fund will not be sufficient to meet the land ownership needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that the fund will not be self-sustaining.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Greens also believe that the fund is unlikely to provide any degree of historical justice for the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who will not gain anything from the recognition of native title. So our amendment proposes that the House of Representatives amend the bill so that one per cent of total Commonwealth government revenues will be placed in the land fund per annum for 10 years. This would see the government contribution exceed $11 billion at the end of 10 years.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Why have we stipulated the one per cent? There are two reasons that I will briefly put here. The first reason is that it is a substantial sum. It really is the kind of substantial perpetual fund that Senator Evans referred to in his speech. However, it is not substantiated by the amount in the bill we are considering. Therefore, $1 billion a year is a substantial sum which would more satisfactorily address the land needs of Australia's indigenous people. One per cent of total revenue would see a government contribute about $1.12 billion per annum—a genuine billion dollar fund.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second reason for the one per cent is a historical one. In 1890 when the British handed self-government to Western Australia there was a clause placed in the constitution to ensure that the new government of Western Australia fulfilled its obligations to protect Aboriginal people. Under the clause, one per cent of total government revenue had to be spent on Western Australian indigenous people. The clause disappeared in 1904 and early this year a group of Aboriginal people began a challenge on this issue in the High Court.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It seems to us that if we are addressing historic injustice we ought to look at the historical attempts to redress that injustice that unfortunately have not operated in any way, shape or form within this country. So we felt that one per cent of total government revenue was a really good amount to be put in a land fund when we consider that that government revenue is derived from Australia and from the land of its original indigenous owners. That is all I wish to say about the size of the fund. The amendments come in the form of amendments and requests for amendments. I just leave it to the minister or anyone else to comment.

         The annual draw downs from the fund from 1995-96 will be $45 million per annum. This is more than double the $21 million spent by ATSIC on land acquisition and management annually.

That will allow significant capital injections into indigenous land based enterprises over and above existing sources of capital.

         We really do believe that these amounts represent a significant commitment of Commonwealth moneys consistent with responsible economic management. The Greens' proposal, which is aimed at providing a fund of around $15 billion after 10 years, is completely unrealistic and fiscally irresponsible. The land corporation will be simply unable to handle the sum of about $450 million a year it would have available to spend on land acquisition and management. The availability of such an amount would artificially drive up land prices to the detriment of indigenous interests.

         The Commonwealth currently provides around $1.5 billion annually to ATSIC and other agencies to address the needs of indigenous people. If the Commonwealth were to place one per cent of Commonwealth revenues in the land fund, this would amount to around another $1.5 billion annually. While we cannot be certain of Commonwealth revenues collected far into the future if the land fund were outside the public account, this amendment would contribute about $1.5 billion annually to the deficit and that would represent an addition of over 10 per cent to the budget deficit this year, rising to more than half the projected deficit in 1997-98. If the land fund were to remain in the public account, this amendment would add up to $270 million annually to the deficit.

The government has agreed to a Democrats amendment, it will be recalled, which will guarantee a four per cent return after inflation on investments over 10 years. The guarantee of that return is an addition to what is already a pretty sizeable allocation by the government.

         We are committed to the reconciliation process. Mabo itself, the decision, the native title legislation and this fund have all advanced that process, but it has to be acknowledged that reconciliation is in its early stages. If we were to irresponsibly allocate around $15 billion to the land fund with no regard to the effects on the broader economy, there is a strong possibility that the reconciliation process itself would be put in jeopardy. I think that adds another dimension to our response to this. I think that point has been made clear enough.

         As to amendment No. 2, which goes to the method of investment of land fund moneys and the percentage to be  invested, it does appear to us inconsistent to repeal section 193A, as you are proposing, while retaining subsection 192W(3) which provides that land fund moneys have to be invested in accordance with section 62B of the Audit Act. Proposed new subsection (1) adds forms of investment permitted under state and territory laws to those permitted under section 62B of the Commonwealth Audit Act. It really appears that this would provide the lowest common denominator for prudential investments; it would not improve the bill. It is likely to create confusion rather than assist the fund to operate efficiently. In particular, it will never be clear which legislative authority is the basis for fund investments. In the event that the states amend their legislation, the legislative basis for long-term strategies could be undermined conceivably resulting in losses to the fund.

         There are similar difficulties with proposed new subsection (2). It would, under the funding arrangements currently contained in the bill, provide a total annual draw down of only $36 million instead of $45 million, that is to say 25 per cent of $121 million. However, the new subsection is no doubt predicated on the bill being amended to provide for the massive funding sought by the Greens in their proposed amendment to section 193A, which the government cannot agree to. It might make sense in the context of such an increase but in the absence of that increase it just makes the bill go backwards.

         The proposed new subsection (2) also seems to involve a drafting loophole. As drafted it would allow the ILC to spend the previous year's allocation since the 75 per cent limit here proposed only applies to the year the allocation was credited to the fund. So there are a whole variety of substantial reasons why the government opposes that amendment.

         Amendment No. 3 and its companion piece No. 4 are also unacceptable. They, in our judgment, will result in a quite unworkable scheme and the government opposes them on that basis. In removing sections 193B to 193H, as is proposed, this amendment removes from the bill provisions for payments out of the fund to the ILC and ATSIC. It would appear that this would leave no legislative basis for the making of payments out of the fund. The assumption appears to be that the ILC will control the fund and not need some legislative basis. That is an inadequate assumption.

         These amendments would remove the requirement for the accounts and financial statements of the fund to be in a form determined by the Minister for Finance, which is presently provided for in section 193H. That again, in our judgment, is an unattractive proposition that further contributes to making the bill unworkable in this form. For all those complex reasons—at least it should show the Greens that we are taking them seriously—the government opposes these amendments.

         I wish to respond to Senator Evans's concerns about amendments Nos 2 and 3. The assumption was that there would be an increased amount and not the 75 per cent of the $121 million that the government is intending to put aside by way of this bill. There is the possibility that an increase in the total amount of the fund would be addressed.

         As a final comment, I refer to Senator Evans's statement. I am glad he is acknowledging that no substantial hole in the budget deficit is produced by this fund. It is only one of $24 million. We would like to see in a so-called billion dollar land fund at least an attempt to put $1 billion into it, but with the draw down it would be considerably less. It would make clearer the logic of the government in its statements as to how it is addressing the needs of 95 per cent of the Aboriginal people in this country.

        These amendments relate to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Under the bill, the ILC can carry out its land acquisition functions only for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. The Greens believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be able to own land as they see fit and that the bill is far too restrictive on this issue.

         This topic was raised with the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. Many people felt that Aboriginal people should determine the capacity in which they held the land. While some felt that the corporations model, which has worked in other areas through ATSIC, has been a workable one for them, they felt that there was a legitimacy to other means being available and for the communities to be able to make that decision.

         We believe that acquired interests in land—that is the purpose of these amendments—may be granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, or Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, or trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts. We have moved these amendments because we believe that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders should be treated like any other citizens and be allowed to hold their land as they see fit.

         The only outstanding issue would be the definition of `trust'. The Greens WA have adopted a definition which ensures that each person who benefits or is capable of benefiting is an Aboriginal person, a Torres Strait Islander or an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation. It is our view that the reason why the government has been so restrictive in allowing only corporations to have it is, in a way, imposing a bureaucratic structure upon Aboriginal communities that makes it easier for corporations to be administratively handled. Presumably, if they fold, it makes it easier for the government to reacquire anything that the corporations have had in the time that they have been established.

         Many committee hearings noted that Aboriginal people feel that corporations have in some ways done them an injustice. They have forced people to adopt this white bureaucratic convention of a legal entity. Those who are better able to understand those mechanisms have been able to benefit from them, sometimes to the detriment of some Aboriginal families and people within communities, when the corporation has perhaps folded through mismanagement or other problems. It is for that reason the flexibility of these amendments was proposed to be included in this bill—not, as has been publicised, to allow the land to be given to individuals but to prevent the bill from being so restrictive as to allow it only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations and to allow Aboriginal communities to make their own determination of the entity which wants to hold any land that may be acquired through this fund.

         —On this group of amendments the government's position remains implacably hostile because grants to individuals and trustees threaten to undermine the bill's fundamental purpose, as we see it.

         The Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill failed to find any consensus among indigenous peoples about this amendment, although a number of witnesses did explicitly endorse the government's original approach to the issue. The coalition's stated rationale for this amendment, and that again now by the Greens, is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be treated like other Australians and should not be required to incorporate in order to have title to land.

         Of course, other Australians do not have access to the land fund. This is a special case of unashamed positive discrimination designed to redress a past injustice. The land fund provides for indigenous people an avenue in addition to that available to all Australians to purchase land. Indigenous people will still be free to pursue the ordinary means of acquiring land if they do not wish to be bound by the restrictions on title to land acquired through this fund.

         It all really goes back to the fundamental purpose of this whole exercise, which is to give indigenous people back their land and to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can enjoy the benefits of their land—land granted to them on this basis—for generations to come. Vestment of ownership incorporations will ensure that the land remains part of the Aboriginal land base for the use of future generations of indigenous people.

         Aboriginal people did invariably hold in the past a communal form of title which was inalienable. They are familiar with operating on a collective basis. The Senate select committee purported to establish that individual ownership was traditionally accepted in some indigenous communities and based its argument on the testimony of one Torres Strait islander witness, yet it is abundantly clear from that gentleman's evidence that even he was in no way talking about individual ownership. He was referring to former familial ownership in which the structure of the owning family clearly extended well beyond what we would call a nuclear family.

         Grants to individuals run the risk of potentially excluding the rightful traditional owners—I am using the word `traditional' here in a loose sense because we are not talking in this context about people with native title claim as such—who are likely to be communities or groups. Besides being consistent with the fundamental purposes of the land fund bill, ownership by corporations does have some practical advantages. Corporate ownership does strengthen accountability through the statutory requirements which are placed on such bodies, including the need for them to report publicly on their activities. Allowing grants to trustees would mean that non-indigenous individuals and corporations could acquire legal ownership of land under the bill. Even though beneficial ownership would be with indigenous interests, there would not necessarily be a full indigenous ownership contemplated by the bill.

         That is a miscellany of points, but they all move in the same direction, which is that of the non-acceptability not so much this time in terms of workability but basic principle—the basic principle being that we want the land base to be maintained and retained for future generations. We see that corporate ownership is not only consistent with known Aboriginal tradition but also by far and away the best way to ensure that that in fact will be the case.

         —It is the case that this legislation is primarily designed for those who have been dispossessed and who are unable to recreate a claim in relation to some particular piece of land with which they have maintained traditional attachment. Of course, we have had this discussion often enough. That does not mean, however, that it is inappropriate to think in terms of the closest thing we can get to communal title as being the way to go when we are vesting land in these people. It is not a matter of white bureaucracy; it is the best that white bureaucracy can do to get close to what we are trying to do—that is, to recreate some kind of land base for those people who cannot establish a land base in any other way.

         It is not just hung on that particular notion. It is also to do with the business of preserving that base as intact as possible intergenerationally for the future. It is linked with the question of alienability, which we are dealing with separately. But the point is a very important one: we want to create from the outset a sense that this particular legislation is designed not to benefit individuals but rather groups—groups of people who are trying by this means to recover some of the heritage which has been lost.

         —One of the reasons I supported the previous amendments—and these are similar to those—is that they give flexibility. I have a very great concern, shared by a lot of Aboriginal people, about the decline of job opportunities for Aboriginal people. I think it is fair to say that a greater percentage of Aboriginal people were working during the Great Depression than are working now. That is a very real concern. Admittedly, some of the Aboriginal people working at that time were working in very substandard conditions. That would absolutely not be tolerated and should not have been tolerated then. Nevertheless, in 1995 a great percentage of Aboriginal people are unable to find employment but want it. They want to be able to be creative.

         I supported the proposals that Senator Chamarette is giving another run to precisely because they would give flexibility to the management of the fund to ensure employment opportunities would be created in its administration. Thus, I believed it was necessary to have a more flexible arrangement than the inflexible one that appears to be in the legislation at this time. I apologise to the committee for raising this matter again but it worries me very much that a number of Aboriginal people who want to be employed and engaged in creative and income generating work do not have the opportunity. Could the government now, or at some stage, give the Senate its views about that very important issue?

         —One of the aspirations we have is that property will be able to be vested for income earning and job generating purposes, for enterprise development purposes. I take very seriously the point Senator Harradine makes. I hope the ILC will bear that objective in mind in disposing of its funds. That said, I do not think the requirement that it be vested in corporate structures rather than individuals would necessarily inhibit flexibility in pursuing that enterprise objective to quite the extent Senator Harradine suggests. It is an interesting point he raises and one that can certainly be kept under review when we look at the way the legislation operates. If there is any unnecessary inhibition of the objectives he is pointing to, we might usefully debate that at some future time in the light of any accumulated data.

         I do not think Senator Harradine is astray at all in suggesting that that should be a legitimate aspiration for the use of the fund. If employment opportunities can be generated, so much the better. It is not the only objective. The use and enjoyment of land for purposes approximating traditional purposes is a very legitimate usage as well, giving people a sense of space and access to land which urban, dispossessed Aboriginal people might well be craving. It does not necessarily have to have an economic component but there is certainly no reason why it should not and every reason why, at least in part, some funds should be directed to that objective.

         —The point that I was trying to make—and I think it has been borne out by Senator Harradine's comment—is that by restricting the fund to corporations the bill could penalise or disadvantage some Aboriginal people in urban areas for whom a corporation is a very artificial entity—an excessive administrative hoop. They may have natural entities that are more amenable to allowing them that independence. I want to complete this section by reading two quotes that illustrate the dilemma in the Aboriginal community. One is the testimony before the Senate select committee by Sharon Firebrace, the Director of Palm River Pty Ltd and a councillor for ATSIC's Tambukka region. She argued:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the ILC should have the flexibility to make grants of land to individuals, groups and families, as well as corporations. Whilst acknowledging the long-held principle of indigenous community ownership, we must be conscious of the changing place, role and contribution of Aboriginal people in contemporary Australia, particularly urban localities . . . We have fought long and hard for equal rights; let us not be constrained by traditional ownership practices that are foreign to many in contemporary indigenous communities in the south-east of Australia.
       </para>

        The other comment was from the Ballarat and District Aboriginal Cooperative Ltd which maintained:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . land [should] be owned by the indigenous people with no conditions or restrictions of their right to make all decisions in respect to the land including the right to sell even after a short period of time . . . Although traditional Aboriginal culture has been for community control/care of the land, we assert that the Aboriginal people should have the same rights as other Australians . . . be it as corporations, individuals, groups of individuals or trustees . . . The argument of Corporations being answerable [to the ILC] is further evidence of government desiring to keep control of and take decision making away from Aboriginal people.

        That is the point of these amendments. I concede that the government is not going to move on them but I want it on the public record that it is a paternalistic measure, intended to restrict Aboriginal people from being able to have a real say on how they will own and manage their land.

        These amendments relate to the disposal of surplus land by the ILC. The bill as it stands permits the ILC or its subsidiaries to dispose of land that it no longer needs to hold. As in the case where the ILC should own or acquire land for the purposes of making a grant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the Greens WA believe that it is appropriate that relevant people and bodies be consulted before the ILC disposes of any land.

         We believe that the bill should require consultation with relevant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations or Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders or trustees of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander trusts before disposal of any land bought for grants to indigenous people. I was confused about amendments 14 and 15 because we were still including the concept which we have just lost in the previous amendments, a concept of wider ownership possibility than corporations. The bill permits the ILC to gain land that it uses for other purposes to raise money and so on.

         The amendments relate to when the ILC has bought land specifically to grant it to an Aboriginal and Torres Islander corporation. We believe that it is only reasonable for those people to be consulted if the ILC decides to dispose of that land prior to granting it. So it is really a mechanism to permit the efficient passing over of the land to the people for whom it has been acquired. It removes the capacity of the ILC to hold on to it or to dispose of it without consulting those people.

         We see the power to dispose of surplus land as likely to be used in the following situations: first, where the ILC has purchased a parcel of land, only part of which is required for granting to indigenous people. You might well have a situation where part might be required to be sold to assist in the financing of the other part. A second situation which could easily arise as a matter of routine is where land which was originally purchased by the ILC is surrendered to the ILC for disposal on behalf of the land-holders. Another situation could arise where the ILC is unable to find an appropriate body to hold title to land which it has purchased. In the event that there were people affected by the disposal, we would certainly expect the ILC to consult them as a matter of good administration. I think it reasonable to anticipate that that will occur without the need to multiply legislative strictures of this kind.

        I think these amendments are the most exciting amendments because they have not been seen before in the debate. I move them on principle, not that I am unduly unrealistic about the outcome. They relate to the gender balance on the ILC board, and they arise from the views of Aboriginal women in Broome who appeared before the Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. I believe a reference was also made by Aboriginal women who appeared in Darwin. They wanted to make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women were equally represented on the ILC board. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to increase in the bill the minimum number of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders from five to six.

         I am putting these amendments on the record for the Jandu Yawuru women's group. It was one of the best moments in the debate and in the committee's consultations when they asked some questions and made this suggestion regarding representation on the board. They were followed by a group, whose name I cannot immediately recall, I believe from Kununurra. Its members stated that they felt it only just to have three Aboriginal women on the board, but they wanted the male representation not to be penalised by the constriction of up to five Aboriginal representatives on the board of seven. They wanted the number increased to six so there could be three men and three women.

Is it at all possible for the consideration of this amendment, or is that process so far advanced that it would not be possible to include it? I urge him to do that because right throughout the committee proceedings we heard people saying that they did not mind the minister appointing persons provided he received nominations perhaps one from each state or from various regions of Australia. The idea that he might arbitrarily appoint a number of people was not contemplated by or did not impress many.

         As to the proposal of at least six indigenous members, the bill allows for a board that could be entirely indigenous but it does not make that a requirement. It is likely that the board will be all indigenous when there are indigenous men and women with the appropriate level of expertise available to be part of it. But it is important that the ILC is able to use the skills and experiences of non-indigenous experts when it happens to be the case that there are no indigenous people available or when there is an insufficient number to play that role.

         The bill is based on the indigenous commercial development corporation model, which provides that five out of the nine board members must be indigenous. I think it is worth stopping for half a second to note that a number of quite vital contributions have been made to that corporation by some of its non-indigenous members who have been appointed because of their expertise in financial and business matters. I do not think in this context it is invidious to name some names. I am thinking of people like Brian Wright of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Lawrie Willett, who is head of the Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, and Professor Bob Walker, who I think is widely regarded as Australia's pre-eminent independent expert in public sector accounting. As it stands, we think the bill provides the correct balance between the need for indigenous direction and self-determination and the need to ensure that there is appropriate expertise on the board. For that reason, we will not support the amendments. But I recognise the aspiration. We are not unsympathetic to that, and in practice we will try to get there.

        This amendment inserts at the end of clause 3 a new division concerning dispossession. Currently, the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1995 does not make clear whether compensation is intended for dispossession. The Greens believe this bill should not be seen in any way as compensation, and nothing in it should prevent claims for compensation being made in the future. The Greens are concerned that the associated rhetoric from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) might lead people to understand that this is the major act of compensation for dispossession. It has been repeatedly stated that this is the major financial component following from the High Court decision on native title. It may then lead to the land fund being taken as compensation for the dispossession of the last 200 years.

         Compensation for dispossession does not come at $45 million a year, or $24 million a year more than is currently available. Compensation for dispossession would be incalculable. The Greens see it as important that the legislation leaves the option open for compensation to be sought at another time. Thus, the legislation should include a clause which specifically states that this is not compensation for dispossession and that nothing in this bill prevents claims for compensation being made.

         We have already talked about how many people are going to benefit from this fund. The reality is that those who already know that they will never get access to that minute amount want some kind of guarantee that they will not be regarded as having gained some kind of compensation at a governmental level for which they have not received anything. It is for that reason that they want it stated within the bill as a disclaimer that prevents them from being disadvantaged in any way by taking that stand.

         The amendment here creates a new division at the end of part 4 of the ATSIC Act which deals with the extinguishment of native title on indigenous held land. This amendment statutorily sets aside any extinguishment of native title on any land which has been acquired, set aside or dedicated for the benefit of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders. In doing so, it provides for the revival of native title similar to the revival of native title on mining leases under the Native Title Act 1993.

         If the object of this bill is to restore land to Australia's indigenous people, it is important that the land be restored to them in terms which are appropriate to them.

         In an earlier discussion, Senator Evans used the words `communal, inalienable title' in order to justify corporations having the land as being the closest equivalent to the `communal, inalienable title' of Aboriginal culture. We are proposing that the revival of native title allows that inalienable aspect of land that is acquired under the land fund to be made available to Aboriginal people. It would offset the concerns, which I have not agreed with, which have been referred to by Senator Evans as wanting to keep control of the Aboriginal estate by using corporations as the means by which the land is held rather than actually giving it to Aboriginal people in whatever form their community feels is most appropriate and then allowing them to revive native title in such a way that that communal, inalienable title is really reflected. That is the purpose of that final amendment.

As to amendment 19, it is wrong to claim that nothing in the bill is intended as compensation for the dispossession indigenous people have suffered. The provision of $1 1/2 billion for the acquisition of land is intended as one step in the process of recognition of indigenous possession and some compensation for that dispossession.

         The Greens are mistaken in their view that the government considers this as the totality of a final settlement. It has been stated over and over that this bill is only part of the government's broad response to the Mabo decision. There is nothing in the bill which states that this is the government's final position or action, and I can assure Senator Chamarette it is the government's view that a good deal more should and will be done to address the issue of dispossession.

         As to prior extinguishment being disregarded, can I say—it is a little complicated but I need to put the government's position clearly on the record—that this proposal means that, if any land is acquired or set aside for the benefit of indigenous people for any purpose, any previous extinguishment of native title over that land will be disregarded and presumably native title re-established.

         This section would apply to any acquisition or dedication of land under any Commonwealth law whether related to this act or not. It is at least arguable that the provision would apply to state laws. This section would provide for the non-extinguishment of native title even over land which has been freehold title for over 100 years.

         The amendment shows a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of native title which exists only where indigenous people have maintained their connection with the land. There will also be major difficulties in determining who the native title holders are, if any, when the extinguishment occurred a long time ago. That again raises further potential for significant dispute and conflict among indigenous people.

         The proposed section differs from section 47 of the Native Title Act in the following ways: section 47 only applies to pastoral lease land, not to all land; section 47 builds in the requirement of continuing attachment to the land; and section 47 also provides for pastoral leases to remain in place and coexist with native title. There is nothing in this proposal to provide for the situation where the revived native title and the acquired interests are not in the hands of the same indigenous people. This is another potential source of conflict and division between Aboriginal groups: for example, where the corporation attempts to assist a group of Aboriginal people by granting it land to which it had no prior connection and the native title to that land, as re-established, is held by a different group.

         One can imagine a number of examples where this provision will create extraordinary difficulties. For example, if the Commonwealth funds the purchase of land to set up a health centre in the middle of Sydney for the benefit of the Aboriginal communities there, the native title to the land on which that centre is situated may continue to be held by the so-called traditional owners. If the ILC purchased an office block in a CBD for investment purposes similar to the New South Wales land funds purchase in Parramatta and then later wished to realise that investment, it could not do so. If the ILC wished to rationalise a number of purchases through swaps of land, linked sales or acquisitions, similarly there would be difficulties.

         Again, complex compensation issues may arise for the ILC and other Commonwealth agencies especially where land acquired for the benefit of indigenous people is subsequently used for some other purpose or disposed of. The ILC and other bodies may be precluded from granting land or using it for the purpose for which it was acquired because the possible existence of native title makes that act an impermissible future act for the purposes of the Native Title Act.

         The proposed amendment is completely at odds with the Greens' previous support for the removal of controls on the disposal of land in section 191S because native title land is, by its nature, inalienable. There are a number of strikes there which Senator Chamarette might conceivably be prepared to acknowledge. I think I have covered the terrain in more than adequate detail to indicate why it is that the government cannot accept that amendment either.

         Having regard to the ATSIC provision remaining in force for the next three years, there is a concern within the Northern Territory that, in view of that limited time, that money would be devoted mainly to acquiring properties in the Northern Territory and that that would deplete funds available to purchase a property in other parts of Australia. Can the government give an undertaking that that will not be the case, that during the next three years you will not have a heavy concentration on the acquisition of property in the Northern Territory?

         The abuse of arbitrary power corrodes the quality of any community. Criminals misuse such power when they murder, rape, maim, steal and blackmail. Monopolies do so when they ply their trade in defiance of consumer rights. Contractors follow that course when they oppress their workers. So do parents when they violate their children. Partners do likewise when they excoriate each other on parting. Governments abuse arbitrary power when they jail a class of people indifferent to the particular circumstances of each of its members.

         What happens to law enforcement in New South Wales may in the future spread to other states and the Commonwealth.

         Three questions face a judge about to sentence a convict: firstly, what has this criminal done; secondly, who is he or she; thirdly, what ought be done with him or her? From what Mr Fahey and Mr Carr have proposed, the courts will be allowed to answer the first question only. Parliament is to take the other two away from them. This usurps the proper role of judges. To attach a maximum penalty to a crime is a function of parliament. To impose an appropriate sentence on a particular individual for a specific wrong he or she has perpetrated is a duty of the judiciary. Were the legislature to invade the proper province of the courts as advocated in the current election, the right balance between them would be grossly disturbed.

         A long sentence is not necessarily a wrong one but a judge ought not award it automatically. A judge ought to take into account a number of matters when sentencing convicts. These include their role in the crime, the harm they have done, what efforts they have made to redress it, their character, their social and cultural history, their age and the quality of their remorse. When parliament fixes a mandatory rather than a maximum term of imprisonment for a crime, it puts at risk the free, democratic and liberal society most Australians want. It countermands the imperatives arising from the uniqueness of each individual and those of fairness, compassion and propriety. People subject to the criminal justice system are treated as little more than automatons.

         —I wish to raise a very serious matter in the adjournment debate tonight; that is, the conduct of senior executive officers within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The matter in question relates to issues first aired by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Senator David Brownhill, and myself in the estimates committee immediately following the last federal election. We had details of financial impropriety which was alleged to have been committed by a number of senior executive officers within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.

         To cut a long story short, extracting the information on these improprieties was a bit like pulling teeth: getting the officers to acknowledge that there was even reason for concern was a very difficult process. As a consequence of that, the estimates hearings relating to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service were particularly protracted sessions, and they did not bring a lot of satisfaction to any of the people who were involved in the whole process.

         In May last year, charges were brought under the Public Service Act against one officer—an officer by the name of Phillip Corrigan. As at November last year, the official inquiry under section 61 of the Public Service Act into those charges had only just commenced, and the inquiry officer had not been able to do anything in the interim.

         What Senator Brownhill and I were not told on 29 November was that that officer in question had obtained permission from the secretary to the department to have extended leave of absence so that he could take up a high paying job in the United Kingdom. That high paying job in the United Kingdom was to head the operations executive of the new meat hygiene division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

         It is our understanding from information provided to us that Mr Corrigan may have been aided in obtaining that position by references provided by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service itself, and not by individual officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service personally writing references.

         Given that the officer was under investigation on six charges of impropriety under the Public Service Act which carry penalties of up to dismissal, it is particularly disturbing that that possibility may even arise. The estimates committee was not told on 29 November that this was the case. Nobody even attempted to tell senators attending the estimates committee that Mr Corrigan had already obtained approval for his extended leave of absence.

         Mr Corrigan is now the subject of questions in the House of Commons because word has travelled over there about the charges against him. Members of parliament in the United Kingdom take a different view about financial propriety to that which was expressed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). He seemed to think at the estimates hearing on 15 February that it was all well and good that Mr Corrigan should have obtained this job in the UK and that it was a great feather in our cap. Parliamentarians in the United Kingdom have a different view.

         This is turning into a scandal in the UK.

It should never have happened. It happened only because there was a failure of proper management.

I understand that Mr Corrigan has been advised. I also understand from journalists that Mr Corrigan does not want to answer any questions about the results of the findings on those six charges. I can only surmise why Mr Corrigan does not want to answer any questions. I can only assume that, if Mr Corrigan had been found innocent on all six charges, he would have been very happy to answer questions from journalists. I understand from a journalist who contacted Mr Corrigan that he was not particularly keen to talk about the issue at all, which suggested to me that Mr Corrigan has not had the benefit of six verdicts of innocent. I am concerned that these matters, which I was told were finalised on 15 February—

He concluded that I was not here. The information that I have from other people in the building who were here was that his language was strong. I understand it was much stronger than the words that were recently challenged in the chamber about being outrageous.

         —I wish to add some remarks to those already made by my colleague Senator O'Chee about AQIS. The Senate estimates process is designed to obtain information from an assessed performance of the commonwealth Public Service. Over the years it has been used in various ways by various senators from various political persuasions. During my period in the Senate the officers who have come before Senate estimates committees have become increasingly adept at avoiding issues and so skilled at providing information that has so little substance that it renders the estimates process rather difficult.

         In May 1993, a series of questions were asked of officers from AQIS and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It was a simple line of questioning based on information conveyed to the Queensland parliament about travel irregularities involving senior officers within AQIS. The concern of senators at the time, including Senator O'Chee, was that this department was in the process of moving to full cost recovery and was, in this case, predominantly in the rural sector and there were allegations and evidence to suggest that certain officers were abusing the system.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I will not waste the time of the Senate by outlining the exhaustive process that followed, suffice it to say that my office and Senator O'Chee's office pursued the issue largely as a result of the stonewalling we received in the first estimates hearing and subsequent hearings in September and November 1993. We learnt through our investigations that several officers had breached Public Service guidelines. We uncovered a range of inappropriate activities, a series of cover-ups and a total lack of cooperation by officers both within AQIS and the wider the department for the estimates process.

         During our inquiries and as a result of the mismanagement that we exposed, the head of AQIS was transferred and an officer from another department was brought in as the head of AQIS. Obviously, the department was hopeful that the matter would be dropped. I am afraid it was not. As Senator O'Chee has advised, one officer involved in that original line of questioning was purportedly found to be in dereliction of his duty resulting from issues we raised nearly two years ago.

         Quite coincidentally that officer is no longer in Australia. It is of some concern to me and other senators that this officer is now in a senior position in the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. How he obtained that position and on whose recommendations he was sent from Australia is yet to be determined. Obviously, the ability and the willingness of the Australian authorities to pursue those charges, of which I understand he has found to be in error, also needs to be examined.

         The other point I wish to raise is that when changes were made to the organisation in November and December 1993 we were given to understand that a new regime and a commitment to service had been adopted. During the rural and regional affairs committee hearings into the legislation relating to domestic meat charges there were calls from inside and outside the parliament for an inquiry into AQIS. That should have happened. It was generally agreed that it would be more appropriate to wait to allow the new management to establish itself and to allow time for the promised reform regime to commence, so we waited.

         The inquiry was finally established late in 1994 and the first hearings were held earlier this month. I must say that we have not had a very auspicious start. Our first witness, Mr Don Ford, refused to provide details of the allegations he had mentioned in the media. He claimed that he had passed his concerns on to the minister and was awaiting the minister's response before proceeding further. The minister has told the Senate that inquiries are proceeding. I think it interesting for us to note that fact. I think that that may be contempt of a Senate inquiry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second hearing of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee provided the opportunity for AQIS senior officers to demonstrate a new cooperation with the parliament. They too refused to comment on Mr Ford's allegations claiming, as we have seen happen with the minister, that they did not have the details. I believe that that also put us in a rather difficult position.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         All the allegations Mr Ford has made relate to incidents which Mr Ford has already said publicly were subject to incident reports to the appropriate AQIS officers. In other words, I know and AQIS knows that the incidents Mr Ford refers to are already on the AQIS files. For the AQIS officers to suggest that they are not aware of the substance of the allegations implies that AQIS either is not coming clean or is incompetent or hiding something. That saddens me because I believe that that matter should have been cleared up a couple of years ago so that AQIS retained a good name.

         This process has taken two years. I think this says nothing for public accountability and says little for the consultative process and the expressed desire by departmental officers to cooperate with the Senate.

         I advise the officers from AQIS and other departments that the Senate should have the cooperation of government departments to clear matters up. It is not good for us as law makers and administrators and it is not good for the departments if we do not have a squeaky clean organisation. I will continue to pursue the issue of accountability and integrity. I think the Senate should ensure through you, Mr President, or others that parliamentary committees are not held in contempt. Whatever obstacles are put in our way we will continue to find out the result of all these accusations that have been made and make sure that proper processes are used in relation to Senate inquiries and committees.

         —Earlier today I raised in passing the fact that the bankruptcy of the Labor Party in New South Wales, financial as well as moral and political, was evident from the fact that Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd has assets amounting to, at the most, $1.8 million and appears to have liabilities of about $10 million. It is hard to tell which element of the Labor Party owes who what.

         The point I made in passing was that it is very hard to tell exactly how disastrous the situation is in financial terms for the Labor Party in New South Wales and how bankrupt it really is because Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd has not lodged its annual return. In fact, the 1993 annual return is not complete. That is the case with a lot of shonky organisations. I note that its annual returns for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were all lodged in one lump on 10 March 1994. In  other words, there has been a blatant breach of the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission by this subsidiary of the Labor Party—a subsidiary which is a bottomless pit, which cannot work out its accounts and which has not provided any key financial data because it does not have it. It appears to be in continuing breach of a whole range of matters.

That letter was signed on 2 March 1994, a year ago. In it he says:

         The member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) put out a press release today because, as I understand it, the gallery was being misinformed by the Labor Party—in particular by Mr Della Bosca's wife, who happens to be a Labor senator for New South Wales—that it did not have to put out the key financial data, that there was no need to. She has made a basic error because on the form that Mr Della Bosca signed and sent to the Australian Securities Commission, there is a question, `Were the company accounts for the financial year audited?' and that box is ticked `No'. The accounts were not audited. The Labor Party cannot get away with the shonky trick of saying, `We do have an auditor and therefore we don't have to provide accounts.' But the auditor has not audited the accounts, presumably because the accounts are not in a state capable of being audited.

         One would certainly get that impression because the ASC has threatened on a previous occasion to deregister this company for not complying. The subsidiary in New South Wales of the Australian Labor Party has been threatened twice by the ASC with deregistration for not complying. The previous time—1994 was the latest time—was back in December 1992. I will read a letter dated 9 December 1992 from Mr John Della Bosca to the Australian Securities Commission:

        The ASC could not have told whether it was in operation because the company had not provided any annual returns. By the way, I do hope that the directors of this company have received penalties for failing to meet the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. It is pretty ordinary, is it not, when officials of the Labor Party—which claims it has the capacity to run the state of New South Wales—cannot even abide by the Australian Securities Commission requirements and, presumably, receive penalties? Unless, of course, they had some mate fix it up for them. Mr Della Bosca goes on to state in the letter:

        As I said, it was not just six months. That letter was dated 9 December 1992 and it took them until March 1994 to get around to filing the annual returns. Once again, they were inadequate because the financial matters were inadequate. All these returns were filed in one hit.

         I say this to the Labor Party: just by putting down the name of an auditor who has not audited the books—because the books are not in a state to be audited—and admitting that the books were not audited, it cannot get away with dodging the requirements, sneaking around the rules and breaching the law that the ASC administers by that kind of shonky device. Sure, when Labor was last in government in New South Wales it did all those shonky things; it did get around everything; it did have corruption—yes, that is the way Labor runs because you cannot trust Labor with money. That is evident, once again, from these accounts.

         It is also interesting that one of the things Mr John Della Bosca had to swear was this: that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the company will be able to pay its debts when they fall due. That must be one of the greatest jokes of all time. It would be interesting to see whether Mr John Della Bosca—let alone the directors who do not want to contribute their names—would be prepared to swear that when he files, if he ever gets around to filing, the 1994 annual return. This is yet another example of how the Labor Party cannot be trusted with money, how it has continually breached the ASC requirements and the Corporations Law and how this branch of the ALP has not just shown bad judgment in losing a fortune in the Sydney property market; it has shown a total disregard for the law.

        I did publicly announce in a speech I made in Hobart at the ALP national conference that I am currently looking at how plantations can play a role in relieving pressure on native forests while, at the same time, offering significant expansion of the industry's resource base. To this end, I have recently agreed to fund a national plantation study. The study is fully consistent with the national forest policy statement and will involve state and territory conservation councils. I believe it will be significant in progressing the NFPS goals of the full utilisation and expansion of Australia's plantation resource and the NFPS objectives in relation to the development of plantation based industries.

        The study will develop an aggregate national overview of the plantation estate, involving the identification of the extent of hardwood and softwood plantations in each state, opportunities for processing this resource, industry expansion opportunities, employment potential and also Commonwealth actions to stimulate an increased emphasis on plantation resource utilisation. It is designed to provide a picture of the extent of the plantation resource nationwide and will identify specific development opportunities which could enjoy the support of both industry and conservation groups. It will also provide the Commonwealth with information on the potential for the ecologically sustainable expansion of industry and employment.

        The study does differ substantially from the National Plantations Advisory Committee work, which primarily focused on the development and establishment of new plantations on cleared agricultural land. It also differs from the work of the Resource Assessment Commission, which undertook financial feasibility assessments for possible expansion of the plantation estate and studies that detailed the area of land suitable for new plantation development. This study, by contrast, will focus on the extent of existing plantation estate and will examine means to fully utilise that resource. The consultant who is coordinating the study has already had very positive feedback about the study from industry sources.

        A study proposal from Environment Victoria entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         National Plantations: Environment, Industry Development and Employment
        </emphasis>
        was first submitted to my department in June of last year. A revised proposal, which was redrafted to fit more directly within the funding guidelines of the environment portfolio, was submitted in February 1994. On 1 April I received that revised study proposal with the recommendation from my department that funding should be granted for the study. I did, however, withhold further action until July, pending receipt of Environment Victoria's audited financial statement for the grants to voluntary conservation organisations program for 1993-94 and until questions raised by Mr Barry Cunningham on the extent of departmental funding to the organisation were answered. I believe this study will provide a basis for greater dialogue on plantation issues between industry, union and conservation interests. I think this is very important to the environment debate in this country.

        (1) With one exception, military police have no powers over civilians by virtue of their status as military police. The exception relates to the Defence Force Discipline Act. That Act provides for persons other than members of the Defence Force to be declared to be `Defence civilians', when they accompany a part of the Defence Force outside Australia or on operations against the enemy and have consented in writing to be subject to the Act. A military police officer has certain specific powers in relation to investigation of offences under the Act, meaning that a police officer might have powers exercisable in relation to Defence civilians. There are presently no persons who are `Defence civilians' for the purposes of the Act.

        For example, under section 82 of the Defence Act, a member of the Defence Force may arrest a person who is believed on reasonable grounds to have committed an offence against the section, namely trespassing on Defence establishments or photographing or sketching Defence equipment.

        Under section 51 of the Defence Act, State Governors may proclaim that domestic violence exists, and may request the Governor-General to call out the Defence Force for the protection of the State against domestic violence. If this has occurred, the Minister may authorise a part of the Defence Force to move to the vicinity of the incident, following which the appropriate civil authority may request a part of the Defence Force to assist in the law enforcement role. In such a case, Defence Force policy requires that those members involved use the minimum force necessary to achieve the purpose. They remain subject to military command, but are also subject to the normal civil law, which is not suspended by reason of the involvement of the Defence Force.
