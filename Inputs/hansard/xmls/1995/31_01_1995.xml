I refer to a third generation logging contractor possibly sitting in the Senate today wondering whether he will have any work when he returns to Wandandian tomorrow. He has 25 employees, $3 million worth of equipment and is typical of seven or eight other logging contractors servicing six timber mills between Nowra and Bega. I ask the minister: does he realise that each one percentage point increase in interest rates costs that man and his business an estimated $10,000 and that the government has forced up official interest rates by 58 per cent in the last five months? Does the minister also realise how his government's confused logging policy is adding uncertainty to that logging contractor's business? What does the minister say to that particular logging contractor about the government's intention to now impose a so-called carbon tax, which will simply be a further tax on the fuel that this contractor needs to run a profitable business? I ask the minister: how does the government expect Australian businesses to survive, let alone prosper, with such foolish and confused policies?

         —There is nothing confusing about the government's position so far as logging is concerned. The Prime Minister's statement was a straight down the line recognition of the reality that there are two major competing interests in issue in this country—the issue that is of deep concern to a very large number of members of the community about saving native forests and which not only is a matter for the Commonwealth government and its export woodchips policy but also is very much a matter, so far as the logging itself is concerned, of the responsibility of state govern ments.

         It is about time people woke up to the fact that the basic responsibility for determining the future of this industry—whether it does or does not survive, or in what form or to what extent it survives—is very much a matter for the state governments. You put some of the heat upon them rather than just upon the Commonwealth. What we have been trying to do as part of the national forest policy strategy is get people together, get a rational assessment of the matters in issue and get a rational balance between not only the interest in the environment and saving native forests but also the interest that is so clearly and starkly there in preserving employment in this country and doing nothing unnecessary to undermine it.

         We are acutely conscious of that side of the equation as well as the environmental one. That is why it is such a difficult issue and it is not dealt with sensibly by the kind of noisy malarky we hear from the other side of the chamber on this particular issue. I hope that, if we are going to see a new and sensible approach on policy issues from the other side, we will get a better recognition of the difficulty of drawing this kind of balance in this situation.

         As to the question of a carbon tax or any other fiscal policy change that might be involved, that is of course something that is utterly unresolved at this stage. It is the subject of some discussion obviously within the government—as you would expect, given the nature of the fiscal issues that are confronting the country at the moment and the nature of the environmental responsibilities we have—but certainly no decision of any kind has been made, and we are acutely conscious of the employment and the economic implications of going down that path in any very substantial way.

         As to the question of interest rates which was also raised, the situation is, of course, that you have to be sensible when an economy is coming out of recession to ensure that the growth that is generated by that is sustainable growth; that when you come to the traffic lights you can keep going, you do not have to come to a shuddering stop. You have to adjust the speed of the economy so the lights are always green, so that you can always keep going. That is why, of course, we have had a series of small changes, small increases in interest rates—to reflect the reality of an economy coming out of recession, surging with growth, surging with capacity.

         There is a need accordingly to ensure, particularly given the lead times that are involved in these judgments, that the economy does not move so fast that it is necessary to over correct and produce a stop. That is why interest rates have been rising. The hope, of course, is that the overall situation of the economy, the demand side of the equation, is slowing down. There is some evidence for that. It is to be hoped certainly, as most commentators have been saying, that the nature of the economic situation and the nature of the government's response to it so far, is such that it will not be necessary to go further in any very drastic way down that particular path. That is a matter about which you cannot make premature judgments. Any responsible government recognises that and any responsible opposition should do the same.

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is only this minister that would tell Australian business that it can cop a small interest rate increase, which is a 58 percent increase in five months. It just demonstrates how out of touch the government is. The real question is: does the government really understand what its policies are cumulatively doing to Australian business? You are forcing up interest rates; you are now seeking to impose upon them new taxes on production; and, in the case of this particular industry, you have added a confused logging policy. Does this government not understand that small business in particular cannot grow, cannot prosper and cannot employ in that sort of environment? When is this government going to face the realities of what it is doing to Australian business, rather than giving the sort of airy-fairy academic answer that has just been given by the minister today?

         —I should thank Senator Colston for his question because it enables me to give some more and better particulars to the headline answer Senator Evans just gave to the opposition. The figures from a range of various statistical sources on manufacturing performance in Australia make the manufacturing sector in this country the stand-out performer in the Australian economy. Over the last two years, it has seen the strongest ever sustained growth in manufacturing production since the Australian Bureau of Statistics commenced collecting figures. We have done better in the last two years than ever before according to the bureau, which commenced the collection of figures in 1974.

         Production increased by 12.2 per cent per year to the September quarter of last year. This has taken the surge of production to 12.5 per cent above the record in the June quarter of 1989. We are now at the highest ever level of growth in manufacturing industry production. The manufacturing sector has directly contributed 23.6 per cent of total growth in the Australian economy since 1991. That is an outstanding performance, when one considers that it represents only 16 per cent of gross production.

         If one looks at investment as an indicator of future trends, one sees that in this section of the economy investment has been surging and is a foundation for continuing growth. Manufacturing investment went up by 10.3 per cent seasonally adjusted for the September quarter last year. Growth over the last four quarters represents 26.9 per cent—that is the year on growth—a huge amount of investment growth. The bureau's forward surveys suggest that these trends are set to continue.

         If one looks at the export performance of this section of the economy, one can see an equally impressive performance. Manufacturing exports have gone up by 9.9 per cent each year in real terms since 1986 and 1987. Elaborately transformed manufactures, the most complex and sophisticated manufactured goods, have gone up the most. They have gone up by 17 per cent per year over the decade, which puts Australia as the best performed country in the OECD in terms of the growth in elaborately transformed manufactures. We now earn $11 billion from the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. We earned $2 billion just over a decade ago. This is set to continue.

         The announcement last week by Mitsubishi Motors Australia that it has been selected as a world source for the next generation family sedan car indicates a great deal of confidence in the Australian manufacturing sector, and the Australian automotive sector specifically. Our quality is up, our prices are competitive and design and other inputs put us on the world stage as a leading player. It is evidence, too, that the government's policies in manufacturing development are working. The Button car plan is effective. It is also a compliment to the companies which have performed in this sector, particularly Mitsubishi which has adopted best practice guidelines.

         There are two other surveys out which indicate what the future trends will be—the Chamber of Manufactures survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends. They come to these conclusions: strong growth went through in the December quarter; higher production levels were reported; significant increase in production is expected by most of the companies in the field; and profits and investment in plant and equipment are expected to remain high—a strong performing sector in the Australian economy.

         —That is a very valid point that occurred to me at the time. I am astonished that such a simplistic policy on such an important issue could actually become coalition policy. You will simply stop all further clearing for agriculture in Australia—some members of the National Party might have views about that that they clearly have not been able to express—purely on the basis that it will be a contribution to eliminating greenhouse gases. You can argue validly for stopping clearing or, indeed, for reafforesting the 15 per cent of currently cleared land that has been claimed by the coalition it will reafforest as a habitat for flora and fauna, and for a whole range of other valid reasons. To suggest that that is what you need to do to act as a carbon sink is absolute nonsense which I would dispute absolutely, simply on agronomic grounds.

         —You might be pleased to hear this, Senator Kemp. Research in Victoria carried out by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has demonstrated very clearly that soil, properly managed, is capable of sequestering more carbon than trees are. In fact, the solution—and it should be adopted—is whole farm management practices, particularly things like minimum tillage. If the land is properly managed, organic carbon levels in soil can actually be built up to a greater extent than they can in trees. The Victorian agricultural department has shown only too clearly that that in turn results in more productive cropping. So it is an absolute win-win situation. I notice Senator Brownhill nodding in assent. It is true: if you manage the land properly, you will not only absorb more carbon into the soil but you will actually get better cropping and better production as a result.

         Not only is this an entirely fallacious policy on agricultural grounds, but it is also totally uncosted. Mr McLachlan said in the policy that to do this would be `both simple and inexpensive'. He based this on the South Australian process, which I have to say is excellent, of compensating landowners for taking land out of production and, in fact, not clearing it.

         The current cost of that program—I have checked with South Australia—is around $120 per hectare. Translating that into a national policy, how the coalition can say in print that this will be both simple and inexpensive is beyond me. As I have pointed out already, the cost of implementing the reafforestation of 660,000 hectares of currently cleared land every year that it has targeted would be between $5 billion, using direct seeding, and about $15 billion, using plants. So the government, in pure fiscal terms, will not be adopting that either.

         The national convention process shows at the moment no grounds at all for confidence that any kind of democratic accountability of the military regime will emerge from that process. Many political prisoners remain incarcerated. Political and civil freedoms are effectively non-existent. Forced labour is still a reality in many parts of the country. So far as minorities are concerned, the offensive against the Karen National Union, about which Senator Bourne asked, which the Australian government deplores and which has now already resulted in the fall of Manerplaw, has called in question any real commitment by the SLORC administration to reconciliation with the minorities.

         The Australian government's policy under these circumstances is to continue to apply every conceivable form of pressure or encouragement or persuasion that we can that is likely to be effective, to try and get movement against a number of benchmarks that we have articulated. That approach has largely found common acceptance not only with the United States and Europe but also with the ASEAN countries, which are very much more influential than any of us in Myanmar, at the discussions we had earlier last year. Australia's position on trade and economic relations has led us to take the approach of neither encouraging nor discouraging trade and investment but holding out the prospect of more active support for trade and investment if again movement is made on those benchmarks.

In the end, Mr Hawke chose not to do so, though he had ample opportunity to make these points, particularly in his discussions with Khin Nyunt. I have conveyed directly to Mr Hawke, in a phone conversation which he initiated this morning from Hong Kong, my disappointment at the missed opportunity to reinforce the views of the whole world community in this respect and also the significance likely to be attributed by the regime to the issue not being raised.

         The reality is that the states have primary responsibility for the management of forests and, as the Prime Minister has indicated, the government wishes to work cooperatively with the states to find the most effective way to end logging in the 509 high conservation value coupes. The mainland states, of course, have accepted an obligation, in signing the national forest policy statement, to protect forest areas likely to be of high conservation value until such time as those values can be thoroughly assessed, a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system put in place and a system of forest reserves established. I think it is time that the states joined with the Commonwealth in honouring that obligation of the national forest policy statement.

         Subject to the outcome of consultations with the states, it is anticipated that the principal means of protection for these coupes will be through conditions that are attached to the new licences. Of course, that will depend on the companies giving up their current licences, according to the processes that the Prime Minister outlined in his statement of 27 January. The Prime Minister has invited them to do so in order to remove the uncertainty that has been created by the Federal Court decision.

         I believe that it is in the best interests of all parties involved in this issue that they respond positively to the invitation the Prime Minister has issued. State agencies will need to reschedule their planned logging activities to avoid the nominated coupes. If after such rescheduling the resources available to industry are inadequate, the government has indicated that it will work in consultation with the industry, the unions and the states to assess the need for industry assistance.

         —Notwithstanding the opposition's interjections, this is a program that has widespread support amongst state governments and the private sector. It is a straightforward team Australia proposal which this morning reflected that cooperative approach in a meeting of the Market Australia Advisory Group. The meeting was attended by myself and my colleague Peter Cook, representing the federal government, Hendy Cowan from Western Australia, David Hamill from Queensland, Phillip Gude from Victoria and Shane Stone from the Northern Territory, together with representatives of other Commonwealth government agencies and representatives of the private sector.

         The Market Australia initiative had its origins in the McKinsey report on behalf of the Australian Manufacturing Council about emerging exporters. The report identified a concern for Australian companies, particularly small to medium enterprises, and identified the need to raise international perceptions—by implication, particularly in our region—about Australia's capacity in the manufacture of sophisticated goods and the provision of sophisticated services.

         There has been some delay in the commencement of that program to enable research to be undertaken because I did not wish—and the other ministers and representatives shared the view—to respond merely to an assessment as general as that from McKinsey, so we undertook a research campaign in seven markets in the Asian region which substantially reinforced the concerns which McKinsey outlined and gave some indications of the sort of campaign we ought to undertake to deal with them.

         The matters we dealt with this morning particularly related to marketing campaigns conducted essentially by the Commonwealth but with the cooperation of, and some funding from, the private sector to seek to change those images. It is a truism of any sort of marketing that images are quick to form and slow to change. But it is important to have a campaign to start the process of change. This morning's meeting decided to test the marketing concept in selected markets, particularly China, Indonesia and Thailand. We will be looking at some sector specific activity probably in the Republic of Korea.

         The advisory group proposed quite forcefully—and I think accurately—that there need to be sets of performance  indicators against which the success of the campaign can be measured. It is not intended that it should be funded by the public sector as a long-term proposal. It is intended that we will seek to show whether a strategy such as this can succeed and, if it can, we hope that it will then be taken up by the private sector. We will be having discussions later this year and early next year about initiatives to encourage the private sector to take up this proposal when the government commitment to it concludes.

This is a report that responds to the clear needs of providing vital and significant information to people in that age group. It is information that those people asked for. It is also clear that many in that age group, particularly in the younger age group of 14 to 18, do not have all the information, given the number of youngsters who are becoming infected with sexually transmitted diseases. We know the concern of youngsters who get pregnant when we do not want them to or when they do not want to, and we know the problem of AIDS.

         The 509 coupes have been identified as those of the highest priority that are required to protect areas of environmental significance pending a full assessment as part of the regional forest agreement process. Those areas have the potential to be strategically important for the development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. The point is that they were areas assessed as having outstanding conservation attributes such as old-growth values or wilderness values; or they might be endangered species habitat or perhaps there was a conjunction of a number of other values. Particular attention was applied to coupes in areas listed on the Register of the National Estate or those where harvesting operations had the potential to impact on World Heritage values and, in coming to the 509 coupes, supplementary information and comments from state agencies were also utilised.

        I point out to the Senate that the reason for my raising this particular matter was not to make a great point of the tardiness of the answer, nor to be concerned in particular about the other question which is unanswered, but, rather, to point out that question on notice No. 1893 was of the same ilk as the question without notice I asked today. In other words, it was a question about the process that this government has in place with regard to the export of woodchips from this country.

         For the edification of honourable senators, question on notice No. 1893 pointed out that alleged breaches of prescription in compartment 13 of Croobyar State Forest had come to our notice. We alleged that activities were taking place which were not in accordance with the national forest policy statement. We therefore asked: what is the forestry policy statement worth if breaches could be noticed on 22 November 1994? We wanted to know what was being done about it and whether a new licence would be issued to these people if such breaches were in fact found to have occurred. The fact that it has taken so long is not really the issue. The real issue is that we are concerned—and the Democrats have a right to be concerned—about the forest policy statement. We want to know whether the government is serious about enforcing it.

         I appreciate the fact that Minister Collins, in his answer to my question without notice, was able to say that there is an increased supervision of the terms and conditions of these licences. But, in the case of 27 November, we would have thought that there would be some sort of response to suggest that this government is serious about policing its own policies. It is not that we want inspectors hiding behind every tree or people running around in hard hats poking about in other people's business all the time, but we do want some attempt to demonstrate that this government is serious about the terms and conditions that have been established.

They have made Australia a laughing stock from a business investment point of view. They simply cannot handle, and are incapable of managing, the forest industry in Australia.

         This whole thing was a sham, and the minister and the government knows it.

The government thought it could play one side of the coin as well as the other by renewing the licences. It thought it could get away with doing that.

The process I undertook in developing that advice, I believe, was the most comprehensive, thorough and transparent that has ever been undertaken.

         All states were advised in July 1994 by DPIE of the Commonwealth's information requirements on the renewal of export licences. The states' response to this request for information was very patchy and in many cases quite late. In fact, a comprehensive list of coupes likely to be logged were only ever received for Tasmania and the southern forests of Western Australia. This made the task of developing advice for Minister Beddall very difficult indeed.

         Unfortunately, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could see the green lobby votes going out the window some time before Christmas, he decided to do something about it and overrode two of his ministers—Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall—cancelling those licences, which had been issued under the national forest agreement almost two years ago. He had to intervene because he could see those green lobby votes disappearing. That is why we have the 509 blocks around Australia locked up.

         These are the lies the Greens put around. If you listened to the Greens—I half believed it myself for a while—you would think good, straight, millable karri and jarrah logs were going into woodchipping. That is a lie. That is a plain lie because only five per cent of hardwood forest goes into woodchipping as a by-product. The logs do not go in as a whole. The Democrats are not bad at pushing this lie either. Only five per cent of the hardwood goes in. Otherwise, that material would be left on the forest floor to rot and cause further diseases in the forest or to burn and add more expense. This way it has a value. The Greens say that that is the case. I say it is all lies.

         In all states of Australia, public forests are controlled by state authorities. In Western Australia they are controlled by the Department of Conservation and Land Management. It manages the forest. It decides what logs are cut, what logs are not cut and where not to cut. For example, it decided that there would be no cutting for 200 metres on either side of a stream. It decides not to cut on too steep a bank—anything over 15 degrees, I believe—whereas a lot of other countries cut on steeper banks. CALM decides all that.

         —Certainty before the law, I believe, is a most important principle for not only the democratic process but also the prosperity of Australia. As it applies to industry, as it applies to the jobs of workers and as it applies to the environment, the government's new policy fails on that crucial test.

         The government's announcement on this matter is absolutely confusing. That is a matter that is common ground for persons who are supportive of the forest industry and also persons who are supportive of the environment. I fit into both categories, I hope, and quite a lot of people fit into that category—supportive of the environment and supportive of the industry. Frankly, knowing the number of foresters that I do, I take exception to the fact that they are classed very often as vandals of the forests.

         I had the pleasure recently of tenting with my wife up in Blue Tier in north-eastern Tasmania. Not many people know about Blue Tier—only the locals, and I happened to marry a local. It was a wonderful experience there for four or five days after Christmas. That was an area that a century ago was mined for tin. What has happened there is that Forestry Tasmania has ensured that that particular area is protected, and I refer to the massive myrtles that are swept by the mists of a night-time watering of the whole area. Forestry Tasmania has protected that area.

         I take exception to what Senator Faulkner says about no cooperation between the states and the government. I, along with everybody else, had thought this was gone from politics when the Resource Assessment Commission did the study and the national forestry policy statement emerged. In fact, that statement said:

        Apparently Senator Faulkner thought that as minister he was the only one able to make that particular assessment. That was not what was envisaged in the national forestry policy statement. In fact, the states in cooperation with various Commonwealth areas did the assessments.

         I am going to make reference to some Western Australian aspects. In particular, I want to pick up the point made by Senator Harradine about certainty before the law and also that there must be some ability by people who deal with governments to have faith in government statements—ministerial statements, in particular.

         In connection with Western Australia, I refer in particular to the 1992 AHC-CALM agreement. At that time the then minister, Mrs Kelly, heralded that agreement by saying:

       <para>
        She further went on there to say that this would improve the productivity in the forest sector while conserving the National Estate. At the time this was supported, might I add, by Senator Coulter, the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, by Senator Chaney, who was the environmental spokesman for the opposition, and by a number of other people, including some from the Green movement.

         We now have a situation where that has been thrown out the door. It is indeed unfortunate that both Senator Collins and Senator Faulkner have chosen to leave the chamber, but I note that the Leader of the Government, Senator Gareth Evans, is here. I put the fact that we are already seeing the fallout of this particular decision with the uncertainty that is apparent here: Whittakers, one of the operators in Western Australia, has applied to the Stock Exchange to suspend trading of its shares and this has been granted. This is the sort of thing that happens when we have a government that is inconsistent in its policy position and does not know where it is travelling. There is conflict between Senator Collins, Senator Faulkner and Minister Beddall in the other place. We now have the intervention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As a result we have thousands and thousands of jobs at risk, with the flow-on effects of that into our current account, higher national debt, higher interest rates and all other things flowing from them.

         What we have to say to those sitting on the other side in relation to this is that if they are going to change the rules of the game, if they are going to say that they no longer have faith in what the Australian Heritage Commission did in 1992 in making the assessment in terms of the Western Australian forest—if they no longer have faith in that decision and the identification process that went on then, then they should damn well come out and say so. They should just be a little bit honest about it. They should not hide under it and undermine the industry, undermine the people involved in it, mislead the people who are genuinely concerned about conservation values, undermine the work that has been done by the conservation and land management division in Western Australia and totally confuse everybody in the process.

         That is the challenge that this government has to answer as to why it has changed its particular position. It certainly cannot be for conservation reasons. It certainly is not because of the management of the particular operations that go on there, whether it be saw-milling or—as Senator Panizza said—picking up the residue of that saw-milling and utilising it for chipping and earning export dollars. It is all about the government's political position and how it perceives it can buy votes. It is not about the best interests of Australia. It is not about the best interests of the particular states involved in it. It is not about honouring agreements which have been put in place, as I have mentioned, between the Australian Heritage Commission and the conservation and land management department in Western Australia. In fact, it is a total no confidence vote in those entities.

         But, in terms of identifying the `coupes', as they are called in Western Australia, one must ask why the government got a list from the conservation council but never bothered to refer those on the list to the conservation and land management division and, as I understand it—but I cannot be certain about this—nor did the government bother to have those identified or assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission. The government has gone back in over the top of the work that was already done in 1992; it has given no valid reason for the action it has taken; and it has thrown an industry, a very successful industry, into chaos.

That agenda is to do the work of the conservation movement—that is, to fund the conservation movement and to give it reports to act upon to close down certain forest coupes. We ought to be aware that the 146 areas of high conservation value in Tasmania, which Senator Faulkner previously listed, were seriously flawed in science. Some 80 per cent of the areas that he nominated in my home state did not qualify under the national forest policy statement definitions of high quality, old-growth and wilderness. Large numbers of the areas nominated had a history of past logging and reafforestation.

That is a very good example of the complicated process that should be undertaken when assessing the value of these particular coupes of forest.

Those are the two options: burn the timber, burn the resource—if you can live with that, the price of timber and homes will go up—or shut down the mills in regional Australia. As my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald said, the timber industry has sustained a number of rural towns that have been hurt by the drought.

         I am a member of a number of conservation bodies, and have been since the mid-1950s, and I make no apology whatsoever for the position taken by the conservation movement over a long period. It is the conservation movement that has been telling the forestry industry and successive governments over many decades that we should get into extensive plantation forestry. I point the finger here at the opposition, which was in government right through the 1950s, the 1960s and into the early 1970s, and then from 1975 to 1983, for its failure to insist that the forestry industry in this country be based on plantation forestry.

         In the state of South Australia, where we unfortunately chopped down our small amount of forests very early on and established plantation forestry in the 1920s mainly in the south-east of the state, we have and have had for decades the only forestry commission that has been running at a profit. A few moments ago Senator Calvert talked about Tasmania. Doesn't he recall that the Tasmanian government had not so long ago to write off $450 million worth of debt which the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has got itself into because of the total inadequacy of the way it was managing the forests?

They are not being screwed by the conservation movement; they are being screwed by the inadequacy of the policies which have been pursued over a long period.

         The claim that has been repeated here today that it is only waste which is going to the chippers is a lie. I have been to many forests and seen exactly what are the operations. I suggest to the opposition that, if it goes and has a look, it will see at least 30 per cent of the timber which is being cut down is being left on the forest floor. I have seen it in Queensland; I have seen it in New South Wales; I have seen it in Victoria; and I have seen it in Tasmania. Again, it is the workers who are being screwed in this because many of them—they are outside this building with their rigs—are working on contracts in which they are paid by the tonnage of logs delivered to the chippers. The companies have mobile chippers. They could go out into the forests, chip there and transport the timber in bins, which can be seen around this building also.

Logs two feet in diameter and branches are being left on the forest floor and burnt simply because it is not economical for those workers, because of the economic situation that the chipping companies have put them in, to pick up those important pieces of timber and take them in to be chipped.

If we had taken notice of the conservation movement from the 1960s onwards, we would be at least 20 to 30 years down the track towards having more extensive plantation forestry, and there would be adequate timber both for the imports which Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to and also for the supply of timber and chips to Australia.

         The purpose of this bill is to enable the recently enacted safe third country provisions of the Migration Act 1958 to cover Vietnamese refugees who had already been successfully resettled in the People's Republic of China but who lodged claims for a protection visa in Australia after 30 December 1994. More generally the bill is also to enable the safe third country provisions of the Act to have effect from a specified date preceding the date of commencement of any future agreements and relevant regulations.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the last session of Parliament the Government introduced safe third country amendments to the Migration Act to ensure that certain non-citizens in relation to whom there is a safe third country, or who are covered by the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Refugees (CPA), should not be allowed to apply for a protection  visa. The purpose of the legislation was to prevent forum shopping by people who had already found a country which offered them protection, or whose claims for refugee status had been rejected under an appropriate determination system.  The first application of the legislation was in respect of people who arrived in Australia from Galang in Indonesia where they had been assessed as not being refugees under a refugee determination process approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation has been effective in ensuring that the relatively small numbers of asylum seekers from Galang arriving here after the legislation was passed were returned and others in similar circumstances were discouraged from attempting to circumvent the Comprehensive Plan of Action brokered by UNHCR. What the current legislation did not foresee was a situation where large numbers of people arrive very quickly from a place where they have received effective and on-going protection, but with which Australia does not have an existing safe third country agreement. Under the legislation as it stands, Australia has no choice but to process to finality all claims from these people lodged before a safe third country agreement has been reached. In other words, it is possible for people to arrive in Australia from what is in fact a safe third country, and access our refugee determination system because an agreement between that country and Australia has not been negotiated. This is not in the interests of the safe third country, the country to which the asylum seekers travel or UNHCR. It encourages rapid and destabilising irregular movements of people and undermines the concerted actions of governments and the UNHCR to provide durable solutions in countries of first asylum.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From October 1994, 695 people, largely ethnic Chinese Vietnamese from Southern China, have arrived by boat in Australia. Neither Australia nor China considers it desirable to encourage this flow of people. More importantly, information from UNHCR, the Government of China and our own representatives in southern China has shown conclusively that these people have received the protection of China since they began arriving there from Vietnam in the late 1970s. The details outlined in the statement on the prescribing of the PRC as a safe third country, which will be tabled in Parliament shortly, reveal the group in question to have been treated humanely and that every effort has been made to help them integrate socially and economically into Chinese society. To encourage the belief that simply by sailing to Australia they, and the many like them who remain in China, can undermine the resettlement efforts made on their behalf by China and the UNHCR is wrong. The Government does not believe that this in the best interests of the ethnic Chinese Vietnamese community in China and it is not in the best interests of the international community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia makes a considerable effort internationally, through our overseas aid program, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives and our  assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to support efforts to help refugees return to their own country or to resettle in their country of first asylum. Where resettlement in Australia is the most appropriate approach, cases are considered in an orderly way under our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life. The irregular and illegal movement to Australia of people who have no grounds for claiming to be refugees from China undermines these and similar efforts made by the international community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On 30 December 1994, it was announced that the Government would introduce into this session of Parliament legislation designed to ensure that, from that date, certain unauthorised arrivals from the PRC would not be allowed to gain access to Australia's refugee determination system. The announcement underlines the fact that a country may have, in fact, been a safe third country well before it has been prescribed as one by Australia. To alleviate the paradoxical situation of a country appearing to be an unsafe country one day and a safe country the next, and to avoid the possibility of a similar situation to that which we have recently found ourselves in respect of China, Australia would have to negotiate safe third country agreements with every country in the world.

        The bill being introduced today will allow the sensible operation of the safe third country legislation by ensuring that all people who have protection in a safe third country will be treated in the same way, rather than the anomalous situation that exists under present law where people from the STC who apply before a safe third country agreement is concluded are allowed to engage our protection obligations whereas those who arrive in precisely the same circumstances but after an agreement has been reached cannot.

        The legislation `will not, and cannot result in people being returned to a country that is not a safe third country. No-one will be returned unless they are covered by a safe third country agreement or there has been proper examination of their claim for protection. The legislation also does not apply to anyone who has been granted a substantive visa or to whom it has been determined Australia owes protection obligations before the safe third country regulation takes effect.

        It should also be noted that the Minister retains a non-compellable discretion to allow a person's application to remain valid despite this legislation if the Minister judges that to be in the public interest.

        This bill seeks to make Australia's contribution to international efforts to reduce the large-scale illegal movement of people effective and consistent. Its main effect will be to eliminate inconsistencies in the way people are dealt with under the safe third country provisions of the Migration Act who are in all respects the same, other than in the date they arrived in Australia. It contains a very effective safety net to ensure that people affected by it are either returned to a prescribed safe third country or allowed into our refugee determination system.

         This bill has two purposes, both of which relate to the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill's first purpose is to ensure that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are disregarded in determining if a non-citizen is a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Refugee Convention as amended by the Refugee Protocol for the purposes of considering an application for a protection visa.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia was among the first to sign the Refugees Convention, and the Migration Act and our refugee determination system reflect the seriousness with which we take our obligations under the Convention. The Convention states that a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. A commonly used example of the kind of social group the Convention had in mind is that of the Kulaks of the then USSR who were persecuted because they were a land owning class which the Government of the day wished to eradicate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Useful though the ground of social group undoubtedly is, it is also the most difficult to define in practice. Assessment of whether a claimant is a member of a particular social group is usually left to those who administer and review our refugee determination system. However, the implication of the recent Federal Court judgement that a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policy of a foreign government applies, or who objects to such a policy, has such potentially serious consequences that the Government has decided to introduce the current bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government considers that the recent judgement distorts the meaning of the Convention ground of particular social group to such a degree that the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system would be threatened if it were allowed to stand.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policy is inconsistent with the intention of the Convention to provide protection to refugees with a well founded fear of persecution.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In introducing this legislation I emphasise that the Government is not questioning that the Convention ground of particular social group is a useful and necessary concept. Indeed the Government is seeking to bring the application of this concept into line with our international obligations following the recent Federal Court decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I also wish to make it clear that this bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a particular pre-existing social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular village or workplace who is subjected to the rogue application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under the legislation introduced today. Nor will a person who is a member of a particular religious, political or racial group subject to the persecutory application of fertility control policies be denied consideration of their claims under this legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is concerned to address issues which might arise from gender based persecution and has been working actively in this area for some time. For instance our Humanitarian Program contains a specific women at risk component which targets resettlement assistance to refugee women in particularly vulnerable situations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, the Government is concerned to ensure that the Convention is interpreted correctly. This will ensure the retention of public commitment to our refugee determination system and the integrity and effectiveness of that system. Incorrectly diluting the meaning of particular social group under the Convention has the potential to undermine that public confidence and the ability of our determination system to do the job it was set up to do—to afford protection to genuine refugees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation introduced today will help provide a common sense approach to the definition of a particular social group under the Convention by precluding the possibility of very large numbers of people with nothing in common but that they may be affected in some way by the fertility control policies of their government being caught within the definition of a social group under the Convention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second purpose of the bill introduced today is to prevent a non citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when they have already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been finally determined.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A person's claim is assessed against the Convention definition of a refugee, and if it is not accepted at the primary stage, the person may appeal to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal which may reverse the primary decision. If a person's claim is still not accepted at the RRT stage, it is open to that person to seek review on administrative law grounds from the Federal Court.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under current legislation, when a person has exhausted this process, it is not difficult for them to lodge another application for a protection visa and start the whole process again. The fact that repeat applications serve to delay the removal from Australia of the applicant has led to their increased use. The processing of these repeat applications, which like the initial application are free of charge to the applicant, is both expensive and time consuming.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When a system is fair, open and contains the right to appeal the primary decision, claimants will generally have no need to repeat the whole process to get a fair hearing. That fair hearing is amply provided by the system as it exists already. The bill introduced today therefore will have the effect of barring repeat applications in the majority of cases. Its intention in doing so is to protect the integrity of, and support for Australia's refugee determination system and to ensure that available resources are expended on claims for protection which have not yet been exhaustively assessed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In introducing this bar on repeat applications, the Government is aware that there will remain circumstances in which particular repeat applications may merit consideration. These cases are likely to include repeat applications which contain information which was not available to the claimant during the course of the first application, and which is of a nature that is likely to have a real bearing on the assessment of the need for protection. Events in the country of origin of the claimant that have occurred since the first claim may also mean that a second consideration is warranted. The Government has therefore decided that the Minister will retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed by the full refugee determination process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although the Minister's non-compellable discretion may only be exercised by the Minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases in which the Minister might wish to exercise his or her discretion are identified and brought to the Minister's attention. In such cases the Minister will present to Parliament the reasons for the exercise of his or her discretion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Both aspects of the bill introduced today demonstrate the Government's resolve to maintain a refugee determination system that is targeted towards those with a claim to Australia's protection under our Refugee Convention obligations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that there are some twenty million refugees in the world today. Australia has an obligation to help these people through the most effective means at our disposal. We  meet this obligation through our overseas aid program, our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives, our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life, and through our on-shore refugee determination system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the need arises to defend these efforts and to maintain their credibility, public support and effectiveness, as in the present case, the Government will do so.

         I rise to comment on this very important, albeit very brief, report of the Auditor-General. There has been very widespread concern in the community about the capacity of this government to use taxpayer funds for partisan political purposes.

          This report indicates that the Auditor-General sought to carry out an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service. The 1 1/2 pages of the report indicate that the government and the service blocked the efficiency audit. In other words, the Auditor-General was not allowed to assess the efficiency of the work that is carried out by the National Media Liaison Service—more commonly referred to as aNiMaLS. This is a very serious matter which has come before the chamber and which has been brought to our attention by the Auditor-General.

          The role and functions of the National Media Liaison Service were set out some years ago by Senator Bolkus. The first role was to provide accurate and timely information on government policies and programs to the media throughout Australia, as well as information on policies to interest groups within electorates.

          The second role was that representatives in each of the state capitals, Darwin and Townsville should cooperate with ministerial staff to coordinate media arrangements but not have any direct responsibility for arranging itineraries. The third role was that state representatives are to provide local members of all parties with details of government programs.

          The fourth role specified was that representatives will not work with local or state party branches and will not be involved in party programs, nor electoral campaigning. The fifth role was to coordinate the distribution of detailed information on government policies—and I stress that it is government policies—and programs from the information units of various departments to local media. The final role was to monitor local media to provide media summaries. Monitoring, however, was stated as being secondary in importance to media to achieve information dissemination.

          We know that, whatever the role specified there, the NMLS in fact carries out work that is very substantially different. It costs the taxpayer $1.5 million. The essential work of the National Media Liaison Service is not, I believe, to inform the public about the activities of the Labor government but to monitor and analyse the work of the opposition. It is no wonder that the Auditor-General was very savage in his report about the blocking of an efficiency audit. The last thing the government wanted was for the Auditor-General to look at the books and to look at the work that has been carried out in this unit.

         I put it to the Senate that there is continuing a serious misuse of public funding. We all remember the infamous sports rorts affair. We remember a number of multicultural grants being made before the 1990 election which were never announced to the wider community. We know the ability of this government to use funds it compulsorily raises from taxpayers for party political purposes. If the government wants to have a taxpayer funded unit, a taxpayer funded hit-squad, to attack the opposition, then let it come out and say that that is what it is doing and let us have a debate on that issue.

          It is clear that the government itself has been embarrassed and has hidden behind the Audit Act as it stood to prevent the efficiency audit by the Auditor-General. But in the coming weeks a new audit act will be brought before this parliament. The former Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, says that he understands that this act will not provide explicitly for the performance audit mandate of the Auditor-General to extend to activities such as those of the National Media Liaison Service, but he goes on to say—I suspect he must have been told by the government itself:

I hope those people understand the seriousness of this.

          The Auditor-General, in his report, is informing the parliament that he is unable to undertake his duties because of barriers which, in this case, have been put up by executive government. The proposed efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service was to be part of a broader efficiency audit of government information and advertising. This audit was to address the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the government's massive information and advertising activities, and we share many of the concerns that Senator Kemp has just mentioned in relation to the activities of this body.

          The NMLS, or aNiMaLS as it is known in popular jargon, plays a vital role in the government's information machine. Many have long suspected that aNiMaLS is a purely political beast designed to publicise the case for re-electing the Labor government and to collect any dirt it can on the opposition through its extensive media monitoring. In using the term `opposition', we would include ourselves because we believe that the government would also be wanting to collect dirt on the Democrats, Independents and minor parties.

          ANiMaLS has constantly denied this allegation, arguing that its job is to publicise government activity rather than the government per se. An efficiency audit would have been a very effective way of proving the case one way or the other, but there is the hole to which the Auditor-General refers. ANiMaLS, while paid out of government money, is not technically part of any government department. Therefore, the Auditor-General cannot conduct an efficiency audit of the service without the approval of the minister—in this case the Minister for Administrative Services, Frank Walker.

          The minister's response delivered to the Australian National Audit Office in November was that the proposed review was ultra vires.

It highlights the urgent need to pass and to strengthen the Auditor-General bill coming before this place next week.

          The minister should not be let off the hook. The government or the Department of Finance has already agreed that organisations like aNiMaLS should be subject to efficiency audits and is drafting a regulation under the new bill to achieve this. Ignoring the question of where it should be, in regulation or in the bill proper, the fact is that after the bill comes into effect, most likely on 1 July, an efficiency audit will be possible. So the question still stands: why is the minister now denying the Auditor-General access to NMLS? What has aNiMaLS got to hide between now and 1 July?

The government is pushing a propaganda line, a line which is anti-opposition or anti any opposition to it, using taxpayers' money in the process. This body scrutinises anyone who dares voice opposition to the government and sets to work exposing any conflicts or problems that opposition might have and then sends it off to the media. That is really what this body is all about.

          It is outrageous that there cannot be any scrutiny by the Auditor-General of this body and its practices. It is not surprising that when the Auditor-General set out to scrutinise this body he was stopped. That any body such as this should not be subject to scrutiny by the Auditor-General is frankly outrageous. I join with previous speakers in demanding that in the interests of democracy and in the interests of accountable government there be an immediate inquiry into this matter. I ask fellow Australians to wake up and look at what the government of the day is doing. It is using taxpayers' money to pursue its own political ends via this nefarious body.

          —It is vitally important that the people of Australia understand what is happening to the sum of $1.5 million that is dedicated from their taxes to fund the National Media Liaison Service, commonly known as aNiMaLS. That organisation employs 23 staff. What is their role and what do they do? Senator Kemp has already alluded to what they do. Senator Ellison has highlighted an example that was referred to in the

          The audit office sought to inquire into the National Media Liaison Service. The scope of the proposed audit was to assess the economy, efficiency and administrative effectiveness of government information and advertising activities. What on the face of that could be more innocuous, except if you have something to hide and behind the facade of this agency a more sinister agenda is being pursued? Of course that is why the audit was refused.

          In October of last year the Audit Office sought to have an interview with the National Media Liaison Office.

          The Audit Office then, quite properly, wrote to the minister seeking his assistance in resolving the impasse. But what happened? The minister replied on 5 December saying that the `review you propose is ultra vires the Audit Act,' and referred to a legal opinion—undoubtedly, once again obtained at taxpayers' expense to create a legal technicality behind which the government could hide and avoid an audit of the National Media Liaison Service. Of course, technically it was ultra vires.

Undoubtedly, the National Media Liaison Service will get the shredders working overtime to ensure that nothing is left behind which could indicate the type of work it was doing. But of course it begs the question: why didn't the minister say, `Look, technically you're not entitled to audit aNiMaLS. But I, as the responsible minister, am more than happy to have this part of my administration audited by you to confirm that it is a genuine body, to confirm to the people of Australia that the likes of Senator Kemp have been pedalling untruths about the National Media Liaison Service.'

I do not know what sort of glass walls they have there. If the Auditor-General had the right to seek independent legal advice, I wonder whether it would have been the same as the advice that the Attorney-General's office gave to the minister.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will be aware, I have been very concerned about the lack of involvement of the parliament of this nation in the consideration of the treaty-making activities of this government. There have been many cases where multilateral conventions, UN treaties and conventions, have been signed, as well as ILO conventions which have been done, without any proper consideration by the parliament or without any public debate.

         Often some years down the track we find that under international law Australia is bound to act in a certain manner. Of course, the most dramatic example of that was really the discovery by many Australians that, for the first time since 1986, Australian domestic disputes could be adjudicated offshore by UN human rights committees. I have expressed my concern a number of times in this parliament that such an important decision was taken by the executive without any significant public debate or any wider consideration of the long-term ramifications of such an action.

         Equally, in relation to the ILO, this is a tripartite body—a body which I think over a long period of time has generally enjoyed the support of unions, industry and governments. Regrettably, I think, because of the actions of the Keating government and the industrial relations ministers and the secret treaty making of the government, that tripartite and bipartisan approach to the ILO has come under very severe pressure.

         Just before the last election, the Keating government ratified ILO convention No. 158, concerning the retrenchment of employees, without making a press release. We discovered after the election that Mr Keating and his colleagues had ratified this convention hours before the writs were issued. This convention, along with a number of others, provided a head of power for the so-called Industrial Relations Reform Act, which in itself has now been challenged before the ILO. But the point of me drawing this to the attention of the Senate today is that I have not had time to closely examine the convention, which has been put before us today, and whether there are ramifications of this which would require more careful consideration.

         I note that it has gone to state officials and that the ACTU is supportive of the convention but, interestingly, Mr Brereton tells us that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is supportive of the development of a national standard `described below'. It is not clear from what Mr Brereton tells us in this document whether the ACCI is supportive of the ratification of the convention. If it is not, it would have been handy for Mr Brereton to actually inform the Senate why it is not supportive. I put that question. It is one to which I would be interested to receive an answer.

I would be intrigued to know whether that practice was followed with ILO Convention No. 158? If that practice was not followed, what flowed from that? I will be seeking further advice on this matter.

         It is important that this parliament consider very carefully international treaties and conventions which the executive government goes off and signs. A number of UN multilateral conventions have had quite profound effects upon the legal system of this country. Although I welcome the fact that the text has been signed and that the minister has given us a covering statement, I think the ratification of this convention raises important questions for this parliament, such as: what is the position of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry?

         Many of the conventions of this country have been overridden and overruled by legislation carried through this place in recent years. I find that absolutely and totally untenable. It is unsatisfactory. In fact, it is wrong. Sooner or later this whole situation has to be resolved. I am damned if I can live with a situation where people in Geneva or elsewhere determine what happens in the parliament of this country. That is what has been happening. I must mention that it was just over 12 months that we dealt with the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which relied very heavily on conventions.

A colleague of mine said to me, `If you get this over in about seven minutes, you'll get away with it.' The fact is that this government has consistently misused international conventions to override the rights of the states and this place in a manner which is not in the best interests of Australia. It suits the lawyers of the country. It keeps the High Court of this country occupied. Until we get a process where these conventions are properly examined and dealt with in the best interests of Australia, we will continue to see legislation being passed on the basis of conventions being challenged in the High Court. That is fact; it is not myth. It is happening right here and now in this place.

No convention should be agreed to unless it has the approval of both the houses of parliament of this nation.

This is a more cost effective way of providing a mobile service and it is expected that more will be put into operation.

        Recent research conducted on behalf of the Program indicates that women from non English speaking backgrounds are more likely to attend if they receive a referral from their general practitioner.

These issues will be address in the recruitment strategies. The research also found that women in this group are less concerned about cancer and have a lower level of knowledge about cancer than women from English speaking backgrounds. They are more likely to attend if they can be screened via their community groups so women can support one another during the process. Women from this group often congregate in particular localities and a local, flexible campaign is more likely to achieve results.

At present the core set of data and the standards imposed on this data are robust and directly comparable e.g.. age, histology, personal identifiers, country of birth, place of residence. Data collected on additional features of breast cancer, or any other cancers, is less comparable. For example data on tumour size, in situ verses invasive carcinoma, stage, Aboriginal status and node status are all collected on an ad hoc basis by State and Territory cancer registries.

While some cancer registries are able to provide data 18 months after the completion of the calendar year others are not able to supply data for up to four years after completion of the calendar year. The reasons for this delay are the (1) nature of cancer reporting (i.e. compilation of multiple reporting sources) (2) lack of resources (3) volume of case load (4) historical impediments (5) legislation inadequacies.

In particular information on the incidence and size of breast cancers is critical to a scientific evaluation of the success of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer.

        As the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer is a joint Commonwealth/State program, the communication strategy needs to be consistent with agreed State and Commonwealth responsibilities. Communication activities undertaken by the Commonwealth should avoid causing excessive demands on the State screening services. National activities should be planned in consultation with the State Co-ordination Units and national activities will be complementary to, and consistent with, the activities planned by the States and Territories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given that mammography screening services will progressively become accredited, a steady build-up of communication activities is proposed. These phases will need to be planned in detail to ensure each can be brought on as the need arises or in response to Ministerial directives.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the initial phase, communication activities should promote the National Program and its co-ordinated, accredited nature. The target for this phase should be women and health professionals. Accurate coverage of breast cancer issues by the media should be encouraged and relevant information materials should be developed.

        Rationale and Practice
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The primary purpose of the National Program is to detect cancer sufficiently early so that prognosis is enhanced for those women found to have the disease. It aims to screen a large proportion of women in the age group for which mammography has been proven to be effective in reducing mortality—those 50-69 years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the scientific trials on which the Program was based, no distinction was made between women who had symptoms and those without symptoms. Mammography was offered to all women in the appropriate age group. It can be expected then, that the mortality benefits may be anticipated where screening is offered to the whole eligible population.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The basis on which women are eligible for screening must be clear and unequivocal. The recommendation of the Breast Cancer Screening Evaluation Committee that "a national mammography screening program should select women on the basis of age alone" provides such a basis. Generally there is no dispute about a women's age, regardless of any lack of consensus about what the age of eligibility should be.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no such clarity about the meaning of "symptom". The Program defines a symptom of breast malignancy as a lump or serous or bloody nipple discharge, although it does collect information on other "symptoms" nominated by the woman or health professional or observed during screening. Women themselves may define breast pain or other signs as "symptoms". There are obvious difficulties associated with any attempt to use the presence or absence of symptoms as a primary criteria for eligibility.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any policy is only effective if it is able to be implemented.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In a system where women are recruited through the use of a population register and through generalised recruitment strategies, age is the only practical basis on which letters of invitation can be issued and eligibility promoted in general.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Population based mammographic screening is directed primarily at women without symptoms, and this is the practice throughout the National Program. Publicity and educational material stress that women who have symptoms should consult their general practitioner. If the practitioner considers it necessary they will be referred to the usual diagnostic services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A letter mailed to all general practitioners in September 1992, from the Commonwealth spokesperson on Women's Health, Dr Margaret Dean, stated clearly that "women who have symptoms or indications of breast malignancy should not be referred to the National Program".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In all States women with symptoms are actively discouraged from attending for screening in all information available to women,—in publicity material and/or in letters. In some States women are discouraged when they attempt to make an appointment. This latter practice has ethical and resource implications in that appropriate clinical staff must be available to assess whether the woman does have symptoms, and to recommend appropriate action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another aspect of direct discouragement of this nature may be that women will disguise the presence of symptoms. Where the mammograph is then negative, the woman will not automatically receive the additional investigation (either at a Program Assessment Service, or by specific referral back to her general practitioner) she would be offered had the symptom been declared.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Program recognises that, whatever the discouragement, some women with symptoms will present for screening. It accepts a responsibility to those women who indicate at presentation that they have a symptom, or who insist that they will not attend elsewhere for investigation or who are unable to attend elsewhere. In these cases the women are screened.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Each Service is required to have a protocol governing procedures for the screening of women with symptoms. The existence of such protocols does NOT indicate that the Program encourages woman with symptoms to be screened, but is a reflection of the responsibility indicated above.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The existing National Accreditation Guidelines require that all women in whom symptoms are identified be recommended for further assessment, regardless of the result of the mammogram. In some situations a clinical examination is performed at the time of screening. IN others women are referred to their general practitioner or recalled to an assessment clinic for further investigation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In all cases the Program policy is that the women will be advised to have significant symptoms further investigated. Where a woman has nominated a general practitioner she/he will also be provided with that advice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Program closely monitors its performance and data will be collected and reported on the screening of women who have identified symptoms.

        Screening mammogram can detect cancers which are too small to be found through physical examination. It is the most effective method available to detect breast cancer at an early stage when conservative treatment and a successful recovery are more likely.(15,16)  A mammogram can identify a very small tumour well before the lump can be palpated or before there are any symptoms or signs of breast cancer.

        Overseas research into screening mammography programs has demonstrated significant reductions in breast cancer mortality. The National Cancer Institute held an International Workshop on Screening for Breast Cancer in 1993 to conduct a review of the most recent clinical trial data on breast cancer screening, including eight major randomized controlled trials from around the world.(17) Every study found a protective effect due to screening for women in the 50-69 year age group of around 30-35%.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For women in the 40-49 year age group, there was no reduction in mortality from breast cancer attributable to screening in the first 5-7 years after entry and an uncertain marginal reduction in mortality at about 10-12 years.(17) The breast tissue of younger women is more fibrous and dense than that of older women, making mammography less accurate. This may result in a higher recall rate, higher benign to malignancy biopsy rate and a lower cancer detection rate.(18,19) The National Health and Medical Research Council state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening women under 50 years.(20)

        There is evidence to show that screening mammography is the most effective method available to detect breast cancer at an early stage when conservative treatment and a successful recovery are more likely.(1,2) A mammogram may identify a very small tumour well before the lump can be palpated and before there are any symptoms of breast cancer.

        Each Screening and Assessment Service consists of a number of screening units (fixed site ant mobile), affiliated with an assessment centre.

        Women aged 40-49 years and 70-79 years may also attend for screening, if they wish but they are not targeted for recruitment by the NPEDBC.

        Women who present with a lump or symptoms of breast disease should not be referred to the Program. A Medicare rebate is available for diagnostic mammography for these women.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Policies and programs aimed at the reduction of the impacts of algal blooms are being actively pursued through the development and implementation of national, State and catchment based strategies. These strategies have adopted a multi-faceted approach and address both the impacts of blooms should they occur, and the causes of algal blooms. The strategies include the development of algal bloom contingency plans, management of streamflow, long term nutrient management and research. However, even when such strategies are in place it can be expected that blooms will be frequent at least for another decade as a result of phosphorus stored in the waterways.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the December 1992 Statement on the Environment , the Prime Minister set out the Commonwealth's commitment to assist in the improvement of the water quality of Australia's river systems. The initiatives announced in that Statement are designed to address nationally significant water quality issues and to act as a catalyst for States and local community action on their most immediate water quality problems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For example, the Government is injecting more than $70 million over four years to improve catchment management and water quality throughout the country, including efforts to address the causes of algal blooms. The Commonwealth is looking to catchment management processes to lead the development and implementation of the sustainable use of natural resources. Water quality is a particularly sensitive measure of sustainability. This is best achieved through planning and implementation processes involving consultation with, and the effective participation of, the full range of stakeholders.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A high priority will be given to addressing point sources of nutrient pollution which are an important contributor to the formation of algal blooms. Point sources arising from waste water, irrigation drainage, stormwater and effluent discharge will be targeted through better management.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While high priority is given to projects addressing point source pollution, a significant proportion of the available funding will be used to address diffuse source pollution in a whole catchment context. It is difficult to accurately assess the relative contribution of nutrients from diffuse or dispersed agricultural run-off and other potential sources. Diffuse nutrient loads enters waterways principally from run-off and soil erosion during high flow events and over a broad geographical area. Their primary control rests with land use planning, the promotion of `best management practices and construction of catchment water quality control works such as artificial wetlands, riparian buffer strips and fencing of water course margins to prevent livestock access.

        The National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS), as a joint initiative of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) and the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) is being developed in response to growing community concern about the gradual deterioration in the quality of the nation's water bodies. The Strategy will set an overall strategic direction for water quality management and is based on the principles of the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. The objective for the NWQMS is `to achieve sustainable use of the nation's water resources by protecting and enhancing their quality while maintaining economic and social development.'
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government endorses the emphasis put on the NWQMS by the Senate Committee in its recommendations. There are, however, a number of recommendations referring to the NWQMS that fall outside its scope. Consequently other measures will be necessary to advance these recommendations. These are noted in the discussion of the specific recommendations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The NWQMS provides a national framework for the protection of surface water and groundwater quality throughout Australia by the development of high status guidelines which act as the point of reference when water quality is determined on a case-by-case basis. This approach provides a shared national objective while allowing flexibility to respond to differing regional and local circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Strategy proposes the adoption of a package of complementary regulatory and market-based measures to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. The adoption of `user pays' and `polluter pays' policies can ensure that resource users bear the costs associated with the use of water resources rather than pass them on to society as a whole. Other measures which could be adopted to maintain and protect water quality include adoption of minimum wastewater discharge guidelines or standards set on the basis of modern accepted technology or a requirement to install modern and efficient technology in new developments. Community consultation and involvement is integral to the successful implementation of the Strategy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first phase of the NWQMS was launched in August 1992 with the release of a series of discussion papers and draft guidelines for public comment. Three key elements of the Strategy have been finalised, namely, Policies and Principles—A Reference Document and Water Quality Management—An Outline of the Policies which address the underlying philosophy and principles of the Strategy, and Australian Water Quality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters which provides guidance for the application of scientifically based water quality criteria as part of the process for setting water quality objectives for particular waterbodies. A current status report on the Strategy is at Attachment 1.

        Schedule 4 of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment envisages the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council (NEPC) which is a Ministerial Council between Commonwealth and participating State and Territory Ministers. The main objective of NEPC is to develop and pass national environment protection measures (NEPMs) such as standards, guidelines, goals or protocols. NEPMs are to be developed inter alia for ambient marine, estuarine and freshwater quality. The NEPMs will take account of natural variations of parameters under consideration. Adoption of NEPMs should help in preventing algal blooms.

        Complementary Commonwealth/State legislation is needed for NEPC to be established. At the COAG meeting in February 1994, all participating jurisdictions agreed to introduce legislation to establish NEPC as soon as possible. The Commonwealth introduced its NEPC Bill in June 1994. All participating States and Territories have indicated their readiness to enact their respective NEPC Bills by the end of 1994. Thus NEPC should be operational in 1995.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government give consideration to providing the necessary resources for the collation and analysis of the available historical data on algal blooms, nutrient levels and flow rates.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Both Commonwealth and State agencies hold a large amount of historical natural resource data, including information on water quality and quantity. To assist the effective management of this information, governments through the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (1992), agreed to a schedule on data collection and handling. The schedule identifies the Australian and New Zealand Land Information Council as responsible for facilitating the effective management of land related data held by various agencies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Constitution, State Governments are responsible for management of water resources, and historically have undertaken the major role of data collection and management. The Commonwealth would see any data collation and analysis exercises operating within the existing state frameworks and therefore for States to continue with the primary role of data collection and storage. Analysis of relevant water information which is found to be necessary could be undertaken by making use of State data files rather than duplicating information through the establishment of a centralised data-base.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       </para>

        Information Centre, Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A number of these agencies have established data sharing arrangements between themselves and with state natural resource agencies and other institutions including universities, museums, etc. The existence of such agreements negates the need to centralise (and therefore duplicate) all existing data within a Commonwealth agency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth is cautious in some respects over the value of historical data collation and analysis, given the often inconsistent nature of the historical data. The aim of this activity is to identify trends in historical water quality and quantity data and to use this data to forecast whether current conditions are likely to initiate algal blooms. The Murray River is probably the best historically monitored river system in Australia, with data on flow rates available from about the 1930's. However, it is interesting that even here, where there is the best chance of using existing historic data for trend analysis, the Inquiry's Report (para 3.41) notes that, `the existing network of permanent monitoring sites in the Murray-Darling Basin does not provide sufficient information on the development of algal blooms'. Data available on most other river systems only goes back to the 1970's, which in terms of use for identifying trends presents some difficulties due to the relatively short time period.

        The actions outlined in the recommendation may not necessarily be the optimal approach. As with the above recommendation, it is considered that the actions can already be achieved through existing monitoring programs and data sharing agreements. Given the range of Commonwealth and State river monitoring sites already in existence, it is unlikely that new sites need be established. Instead, data from existing sites could, in addition to their current functions, also contribute to the national monitoring effort. In particular, it is noted that the supporting text states that "in some situations there may only need to be selective increases in the quality of existing monitoring programs to include long term data".

        Future Commonwealth funding levels for all programs, including algal research, need to be considered in the Budget context and to take into account the Government's medium term fiscal objective of reducing the Budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. However, the Government is providing secure, long-term funding to research agencies involved in algal research, such as the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation (LWRRDC) and the Centres for Co-operative Research. The ongoing funding commitment for LWRRDC is $11.1 million per annum.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition the Government has also provided $10 million over four years under the 1992 Statement on the Environment to carry out scientific water quality monitoring projects. This money has been combined with additional funds from LWRRDC under the National River Health Program which has a focus on scientific water monitoring and environmental flow requirements including R&amp;D and management options for blue green algae blooms.

        The length of funding for research projects is a matter for the managers of the agency to decide. In practice, the bulk of approved projects for algal research appear to enjoy a commitment to three years funding. Projects which show potential for greater benefits can, of course, be extended beyond three years.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        E.1At its meeting on 8-9 June 1993 the Council of Australian Governments asked that a Working Group of officials, under an independent chair, prepare a report for its next meeting containing a strategic framework for the efficient and sustainable reform of the water industry, having regard to the technical and policy diversity that currently exists across the States and Territories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        E.2The water industry in Australia has over $90 billion invested in it in replacement cost terms. The bulk of this investment, some $50 billion, is in urban areas whereas most water is consumed in the agricultural sector. It is estimated that over 70 per cent of Australia's currently harvested water resources are used for irrigated agriculture and stock watering. In turn, irrigated agriculture accounts for around 25 per cent of the value of the nation's agricultural output.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        E.3Progress is being made on a number of fronts to reform the water industry and to minimise unsustainable natural resource use. Nonetheless there currently exists within the water industry:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        approaches to pricing that often pay little regard to differential patterns of consumption among users and involve cross-subsidies which, in turn, can disadvantage industrial and commercial users of water services;

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        limitations on water being employed in higher value uses. At this time there are only limited opportunities to trade water entitlements which contribute to disincentives to water being employed in higher value uses; and

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        E.4Numerous policy documents and public reports have also identified a number of issues and deficiencies involving water and the wider natural resource base that require the attention of governments. These include:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        widespread natural resource degradation which has an impact on the quality and/or quantity of the nation's water resources;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        while policy and program frameworks are in place to address the natural resource management challenges that exist at present, these policies, practices and levels of private and public investment are not, however, going to halt the process of natural resource degradation, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        whether it is in the Basin, the south west of Western Australia or parts of Tasmania the position has reached the stage where an intensive management effort is required on the part of all jurisdictions to arrest the process of degradation.

        E.5In the light of all of this, it is recommended that Heads of Government in implementing a strategic framework for the water industry have regard to the following principles:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        E.8Apart from improved environmental outcomes, the strategic framework is expected to result in a restructuring of water tariffs and reduced or eliminated cross-subsidies for metropolitan and town water services with the impact on domestic consumers of water services being offset by cost reductions and more efficient, customer-driven, service provision. Financial assistance for particular consumers may be necessary where cost reductions are not available to offset price increases. In the case of rural water services the framework is intended to generate the financial resources to maintain supply systems should users desire this, allow water to flow to higher value uses subject to certain social, physical and environmental constraints, provide irrigators with a tradeable asset (which could also serve as a useful structural adjustment instrument in some cases) and devolve, where appropriate, operational responsibility for irrigation schemes to local areas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        E.9While the need for reform is recognised, the legacy of past investment and policy decisions, particularly in relation to irrigation schemes, means that there are very real constraints on the extent and pace of reform in some areas. Because the changes flowing from the framework are extensive and far-reaching in their implications, particularly in rural areas, it is considered that a five to eight year implementation period will be required. Some aspects of the reform packages outlined in the report will require governments to consult widely with the community more generally and private interest groups.

        E.10It is recommended that further reports be prepared for the Council of Australian Governments annually on progress in implementing the framework over the next five years, with a final report on progress to be prepared for the Council's first meeting in 2001.

        2.2Since the June 1993 report to COAG on water resource policy, further reform has been pursued by jurisdictions and other bodies responsible for the management of the nation's water resources and/or the delivery of water and wastewater services. This, in part, builds on work generated by the development of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, the Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management and Irrigation Management Strategies and initiatives taken under the National Landcare Program. Major reform has also been driven by the wider micro-economic reform agenda and the pursuit of increased efficiency within government business enterprises and authorities.

        2.3All jurisdictions, except the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, at least in part, use property valuations as a basis for water and wastewater charges in urban areas. Some jurisdictions provide a free allocation. In addition, there are often significant cross-subsidies from commercial and industrial customers to domestic users. In the past, this cross-subsidy has been as high as $300 million per annum in a single jurisdiction. Moves are being made to eliminate urban cross-subsidies by phasing-out the valuation approach to charging and, in some jurisdictions, to ensure that sewerage and wastewater charges reflect the costs of provision. In some jurisdictions there are also cross-subsidies from urban to rural users and between high and low volume water users.

        2.4All the major metropolitan suppliers of water services are currently generating real returns on their assets. In contrast, in rural areas, governments have tended not to charge prices for water sufficient to maintain irrigation systems.

In some areas, these rights have been over allocated. One jurisdiction is currently determining bulk entitlements to its storages as a means of converting existing imprecise water rights to explicit tradeable entitlements. This will allow the separation of water entitlements from the ownership of land, a necessary precursor to the introduction of more widespread trading in water.

(For the purposes of this report, for urban water services, metropolitan bulk water suppliers and all new investment, full cost is defined as operational, maintenance and administration costs, an allowance for asset refurbishment, the servicing of debt/rates of return (see following paragraph).)  In most cases, efficient pricing aimed at full-cost recovery might involve the imposition of an access or connection charge together with a usage charge. If governments choose not to charge certain consumers the full cost this might be explicitly accounted for and paid as a community service obligation. In the case of many existing rural water and irrigation schemes application of the full cost definition will need to take account of operational and maintenance costs, any river delivery costs, the refurbishment costs of supply and reticulation assets, including headworks, and the extent to which investments were intended to meet social as well as economic objectives. The degree to which full cost recovery is pursued might be determined by each jurisdiction, noting the need for consistency in pricing approaches where cross-border trading is possible (see paragraph 3.8 below), but any departure from full-cost recovery should be based on transparent subsidies or community service obligations.

Based on its estimates of the real cost of capital to the water industry, the Agricultural and Resource Ministers Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) has adopted a figure of 4 per cent in preparing industry performance reviews.

In a first best or ideal world it would be desirable for each of these functions to be undertaken by separate entities. The alignment of organisational structures with objectives means separated bodies can be provided with clear and non-conflicting objectives and more transparent accountability mechanisms.

The benefits of greater commercialisation, and in particular corporatisation, is that organisations are able to operate at `arms length' from direct government control. Corporations can be given a clear set of commercial objectives and left to operate much like a private sector company which, like other businesses, are subject to taxation (or taxation equivalents), the disciplines of the law and market forces. Under these circumstances organisations become more clearly accountable for their financial and operational performance and less likely to be able to sustain the inefficiencies often found in less accountable organisations.

First there is a number of water resource systems which are currently either overallocated or overharvested. In the former case this may not be a problem if entitlements are not fully used. Trading in these circumstances could, however, have a deleterious impact on the riverine environment, if dormant rights are sold and used. In the latter case, there is a need to strike a new and sustainable balance between the environment and the other uses of the water. Dormant rights should be substantially reviewed before the creation of a system of tradeable water entitlements.

Landcare initiatives can play an important role in this area. Other options could include agreed grazing management plans with adjacent land holders, controlled access to the water and the establishment of reserves. On-land wastewater and sewage disposal strategies can lead to an improvement in water quality and these are currently being considered in many parts of the nation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.13In the area of metropolitan water services the pricing regimes of most jurisdictions are currently based to a greater or lesser extent on the local government rating base. The implementation of the approach to urban pricing outlined above will require the re-basing of tariff structures to include access and volumetric components. It will also require the installation of water metering devices in cities or parts of cities, such as Brisbane and Hobart, where they do not currently exist.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.14In most areas domestic users are subsidised. The subsidies are significant and represent a cost impost on commercial and industrial users. Time will, however, be required to unwind the subsidies and to effect offsetting cost savings, which, based on an analysis undertaken for ARMCANZ, are available in most jurisdictions, based on current levels of service. (It is noted that the impact of these savings may, however, be reduced by increased costs occasioned by the introduction of improved levels of service.) Trade waste charges in some jurisdictions are also inappropriate having regard to the costs incurred in treating and safe disposal of the waste. These charges might be adjusted over the same period to reflect the costs involved.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.15In jurisdictions where certain classes of consumers of water are subsidised by other users it is suggested that if State, Territory or local governments wish to continue these practices the extent of the subsidies be made transparent. Overall, the proposed charging reforms are expected to lead to reduced water consumption in urban areas with beneficial spin-offs in terms of the level of future investment in additional storage capacity and reticulation systems. For example, the introduction of a per kilolitre charging structure in the Hunter Water Board region resulted in a significant reduction in water consumption thereby delaying future investment in water storage capacity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.16While metropolitan charging arrangements generate positive returns, the same is unable to be said about rural water prices. No jurisdiction currently has in place charging arrangements to provide fully for the ongoing maintenance of its irrigation infrastructure, including the headworks.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.17In these circumstances, the Working Group recognises that it is not possible to increase prices overnight. It is, however, considered possible if it were done over a period of years and accompanied by a range of supporting measures including the achievement of water delivery cost savings and more efficient demand management practices by users.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.18At present, water is not always being used in the most efficient manner and this often has untoward environmental consequences. In Western Australia the South West Irrigation Study has highlighted that economic welfare would be improved if water were diverted from grazing uses and employed more in horticultural industries and to a somewhat reduced extent in dairy farming. Were this to occur, there is also likely to be a beneficial impact on the environment as water is applied to soils with greater retentive capacities rather than in areas with high water tables and salinity problems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.19Water prices which more fully reflect costs could also be expected to result in water being used more effectively in rural areas, especially when accompanied by appropriate education campaigns. There is evidence that due to the cheapness of the resource, on-farm irrigation practices lead to waste and inappropriate use. Higher prices could be expected to moderate such practices and lead to less water being used.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.20As mentioned, over the next 25 years, a number of jurisdictions will have to find alternative sources of supply to meet growing urban demand. In some instances, this demand might be met by rural-urban transfers at relatively little cost in terms of infrastructure investment. In other cases, more extensive investment may be required. Whatever the situation, the prices charged for the water should recover the full cost.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.21There are indications in some jurisdictions that the private sector may in the future play a greater role in the provision of water services. This raises a number of issues associated with the taxation treatment of these entities, and their ability to raise funds for investment. Among these issues is the possibility that infrastructure bonds could be a future source of funding for investment in the water industry. However, the coverage of these bonds does not at present extend to water supply, sewerage, irrigation, pipeline and other water projects. It has also been suggested that the existing 10 year term for infrastructure bonds may need to be lengthened in view of the long life of many water resource projects.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.22In the rural sector at this time there would appear to be only limited opportunities for new irrigation schemes. Again it is considered that such investment should not proceed unless it can be demonstrated by the proponent that the proposal will generate a positive real rate of return, that it will be ecologically sustainable and that the consequences for the environment have been properly weighed. These tests are a good deal more stringent than has generally applied in the past, but the costs of past deficiencies are increasingly manifest in terms of the prices that would now need to be paid for water to maintain the schemes and the measures that are required to address the environmental consequences of some irrigation practices.

        Tradeable Water Entitlements

        4.23Consistent with the principle that water should be employed in its highest value uses within the social, physical and ecological constraints of catchments, means need to be put in place to achieve this. The concept of tradeable water rights or entitlements, given that it would operate within a market framework, is generally considered to be the best way to secure the maximum benefit from the use of the resource.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.24All jurisdictions currently allocate water rights or entitlements to groups of rural users. For trading arrangements to be instituted these rights or entitlements need to be vested, where this is not already the case, in those who are deemed to be eligible to trade. In at least one jurisdiction, however, entitlements already exist which exceed the capacity of the river systems involved to satisfy. Means will need to be found to solve this problem. One approach might be to determine the environmental needs of the river systems involved and to allocate the residual water on a pro rata basis, having regard to previous entitlements and patterns of use. Having done this, entitlements might be traded either within or across catchment areas within the social, physical and ecological constraints of the catchments concerned.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.25Against this background, there would appear to be scope to offset the impact of rising water prices by allowing farmers to sell, in part or in whole, their water entitlements and use the proceeds to re-structure their properties or to leave the land altogether. To the extent that water use were to decline overall, the impact on the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin is likely, in the longer term, to be positive.

        4.26If resources are to be allocated efficiently and trading in water to be fair and equitable it is essential that, where cross-border trading is possible, the basis of charging, including asset valuations, and entitlement arrangements are consistent. The work that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Research Economics (ABARE) has undertaken on the impact of higher water prices on irrigated agriculture in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (see below) has highlighted a number of differences between jurisdictions in relation to asset valuation and cost recovery. It would seem that these differences are already having some influence on resource allocation and locational choices resulting in negative regional and national economic effects. All other things being equal, this would be magnified in a trading situation and has to be addressed before widespread trading in the Murray-Darling Basin, in particular, could be introduced.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.27As noted, the institutional arrangements surrounding natural resource management are not as clearly defined as they might be nor are regulatory functions always separated from service delivery in the water industry. If they have not already done so, it is suggested that jurisdictions consider developing administrative arrangements where policy responsibility and stewardship of the natural resource base are closely coordinated so that management responsibility for the resource base is not fragmented, as has often been the case in the past. Where such a framework is instituted, there will need to be links established with local government and other bodies at a local level to ensure that land use planning decisions and administration do not compromise sustainable natural resource use.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.28In the water area, apart from settling and administering the natural resource policy framework, there is the need to determine and monitor adherence to water quality standards or guidelines. Jurisdictions will need to consider the most appropriate institutional structure to perform these duties although some jurisdictions already have environmental protection agencies to fulfil these roles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.29Once the natural resource policy and regulatory frameworks have been defined and established, the main requirement is that water services are delivered an efficient and commercial manner. Views differ as to what is the best model to follow and each jurisdiction will need to determine which approach is best suited to its circumstances and customer needs. New South Wales has, for example, established the Hunter Water Corporation, while both New South Wales and Victoria have engaged in significant contracting-out of service provision in the water industry and privatised components of their water service delivery chains.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.30The situation is somewhat different in the rural sector. Here responsibility for the operation of irrigation schemes, where it is not already the case, could be devolved to local communities who are in the best position to determine their future service requirements. As noted earlier, for the most part, irrigation schemes have hitherto been developed and operated without proper financial provision being made from revenue, for their maintenance and refurbishment. A number has outstanding debt attaching to them. Should governments be attracted to the notion of local control, this might be facilitated by governments writing-off debt, where appropriate, and/or making some financial contribution to the costs of refurbishment on the condition that future charges not only cover all the costs of delivery but provide for future maintenance and refurbishment as well.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.31Provisions that have been made in the past for future refurbishment have been treated by some governments as discretionary while in other cases funds have at times been looked upon as a convenient source of revenue. The consequences of this approach has been underlined more recently in the case of the Torrumbarry Weir where there is no stock of financial resources to draw upon to undertake any re-construction work that might be approved. It is considered that the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council should consider the establishment of financial arrangements to ensure that future operating, maintenance, administration and refurbishment costs of headworks and structures under its control are collected from water users.

        Structural Adjustment in Irrigated Agriculture
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.32ABARE in analysing the impact of higher water prices on agricultural production in the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin obtained estimates from the relevant State water agencies on the per megalitre prices that would need to be charged to users to maintain the existing irrigation infrastructure, including the headworks, in this part of the Basin. ABARE found that the price rises flowing from the introduction of full cost recovery would reduce income in the regions modelled by about $66 million per year or about 6 per cent of total regional income derived from agriculture.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.33This estimation of losses, however, is likely to be overstated for a number of reasons. The model used did not allow for adjustments in water supply infrastructure, technology, drainage systems and farm capital and demand management, among other things. In the long run adjustments in these areas would be expected to enable more efficient water supply and demand and, other things being equal, result in lower water costs. Furthermore, the prices used in the model were derived using asset valuations based on current water supply systems and the maintenance of these systems in perpetuity. More appropriate asset valuation methods, for example, the adoption of the Guidelines on Accounting Policy for Current Valuation of Assets (for National Performance Monitoring of Government Trading Enterprises), could result in asset values on which full cost recovery charges were based being lower, with a subsequent lowering of water prices.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.34In the same study ABARE found that the introduction of tradeable water entitlements would generate gains from trade between regions in the model of around $48 million per year. However, it was also emphasised that this figure is expected to be an underestimate of the gains for two reasons. First, long-term gains (which the model does not capture) are expected to be greater and second, the model only took account of inter-regional trades, not intra-regional trade from which additional gains could be expected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.35In summary, ABARE has concluded that the national economic and environmental gains from the implementation of these particular reforms would be significant. While the financial impacts of the package of reforms result in gains and losses, it is important to note that the limitations of the model led ABARE to emphasise that the losses are likely to be overestimated, while the gains underestimated. Furthermore, the study only focuses on the impact of these reforms from the point of view of irrigated water users. While the reforms result in both gains and losses to this sector, from an economy-wide perspective the losses quantified above constitute a transfer from one sector of the economy to the other, not a loss to the economy as a whole. On the other hand, the gains represent a net addition to the economy which after multiplier effects would be significantly larger than the initial $48 million identified.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.36This said, the ABARE work and studies commissioned by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission indicate that in some areas an increase in water prices to the levels required to maintain irrigation infrastructure will put pressure on some segments of irrigated agriculture. Farm amalgamations and restructuring may be appropriate in these circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.37Shifts in production patterns in an environment of increased water prices and transferability of water entitlements will not be costless and are likely to bring changes to regional economies. In this context the governments may need to consider the financial implications of structural adjustment through programs like the Rural Adjustment Scheme and those carried out by the Office of Labour Market Adjustment. For example, governments may need to consider making structural adjustment assistance available on a regional basis, rather than as occurs at present, on an individual basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.38It is, however, important to note in this context that water prices generally only represent a small proportion of the total farm costs. Furthermore, the modelling exercise undertaken by ABARE assumes that water prices are immediately increased to the higher levels demanded by full cost recovery. However, the reforms recommended in this report would be phased in over a longer time period. For example, if water costs represented 10 per cent of total farm costs and prices increased by 10 per cent per annum, total farm costs would, all other things being equal, only rise by 1 per cent per annum. Thus, the proposed phasing mechanism would be expected to reduce significantly the impact of structural adjustment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.39Structural adjustment in an environment of tradeable water entitlements also raises a number of potential taxation issues including the capital gains tax treatment of the proceeds from the sale of water entitlements. The Working Group noted the potential significance of tax related issues but in the time available was not able to address these matters in any detail. It is proposed that a sub-committee of Commonwealth and State officials established by the Working Group on Micro-economic Reform meet to discuss taxation issues of relevance to the water industry with a view to reporting, through the Working Group, to COAG within 12 months. It is also expected that the proposed Industry Commission Inquiry into Private Sector Infrastructure Funding will examine and report on, inter alia, the implications for private sector funding, management and control of government, institutional, taxation and regulatory arrangements. Relevant water related taxation issues could be examined in this context.

        4.40It is also noted that the Premier of New South Wales has written to the Prime Minister indicating that the corporatisation/privatisation of irrigation schemes may raise issues of tax compensation.

        Community Involvement and Public Education

        4.41There is a growing recognition around the country that water and water services are not free goods. There are numerous examples of public education initiatives and the seeking of community input into finding solutions to shared challenges, be they meeting future supply needs, improving water quality or reducing pollution from waste water and storm water discharges.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.42A number of these issues is local in their implications and arrangements might be put in place in the local community to address them. For example, cooperation in community monitoring through national programs such as "Waterwatch", and the establishment of a local catchment body or a landcare group where these do not already exist. In other areas, jurisdictions could co-operate in the production of material for public education campaigns as New South Wales and Queensland have done in the "Waterwise" campaign. Some jurisdictions are targeting schoolchildren in their education campaigns. Jurisdictions already involved in these activities could share their experience with those who are not and to work with the relevant education authorities to develop appropriate curricula and resource materials.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.43In the rural sector there is an increasing recognition that some past and present practices place at risk the future of a great deal of agricultural activity and the wider environment. Generally, farmers, once faced with the longer term consequences of these practices, have been prepared to effect changes, for example, in some instances even buying out fellow farmers to ensure that agriculture in salinity-prone areas continues to be sustainable. Further evidence of community preparedness to become actively involved is the establishment of over 1600 Landcare groups, "Streamwatch" groups and, in South Australia, the proposed establishment of community self management groups to look after local water systems. It is considered vital in implementing the other aspects of the strategic framework outlined in this report that governments and other bodies such as the Murray-Darling Basin Commission continue to tap the current willingness and preparedness within the community to find shared solutions to common problems and challenges.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4.44It is also important that programs be put in place for the on-going exchange of information with the general public and interest groups on the cause and effect relationships between infrastructure performance, standards of service and related costs. The derivation of sustainable standards of service will be achieved in a far more effective manner, if longer term implications are recognised by all parties during the establishment process. Failure to take the necessary steps is likely to result in the initial formalisation of unsustainable service standards, with significant adverse cost implications.

        4.45The results of water research should feed into public consultation and education processes. While a good deal of water and water-related research is currently being undertaken there is a need to ensure that this research buttresses the strategic framework canvassed in this report. Greater co-ordination and liaison between research agencies to utilise more effectively the expertise of bodies such as the Land and Water Research and Development Corporation, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and other Commonwealth and State organisations would be beneficial in this regard.

        5.1A number of the changes that have been canvassed in this report are already in train in some jurisdictions. Other changes outlined are more far-reaching in their implications and so are incapable of being introduced overnight. In some instances, there is a deal of conceptual analysis yet to be done. In other cases, time will be needed for consultation and adjustment to occur. This is certainly the position where pricing matters are concerned.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.2The speed and extent of water industry reform and the adjustment process will also be dependent on the availability of financial resources to facilitate structural adjustment and asset refurbishment.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.3The widespread need to re-base pricing arrangements, and at the same time remove cross-subsidies for particular classes of urban consumers of water services, will require a period of adjustment. This notwithstanding, the Working Group considers it to be achievable by the end of 1998. The first step in the process is, however, for agreement to be reached on cost recovery definitions. It is suggested that an expert group, on which all jurisdictions might be represented, be requested to do this and report to COAG at its first meeting in 1995. Moreover, where a State, Territory or local government authority decides that a particular class of consumer should not bear the full cost of services provided, this cost, at the earliest time, should not only be fully disclosed but, where possible, the service deliverer be reimbursed for any shortfall in revenue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.4As far as rural water pricing is concerned, it is considered that more time will be required to effect changes. It is therefore suggested that jurisdictions work towards achieving full cost recovery (as defined in Section 3.4) no later than 2001. As with urban water pricing, there will be a need, particularly among jurisdictions involved in the Murray-Darling Basin, to agree on cost-recovery definitions as well as a common approach to asset valuation. The expert group mentioned in paragraph 5.3 might undertake this work and report to COAG at its first meeting in 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.5Attention will also need to be given to settling an approach to meeting the costs of water required to be stored for subsequent release for environmental and recreational purposes. In the case of water stored for environmental purposes one approach could be to treat such costs as part of the production costs of total water supply of that particular system and spread the costs across all relevant water consumers. Similarly, in the case of water stored and subsequently released simply to maintain flows for recreational and/or tourist activities a charge against the community as a whole might be appropriate. It is suggested that ARMCANZ, with the assistance of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, work towards determining, for inclusion in the first annual report to COAG, the charging principles to cover the financial implications of environmental allocations and recreational uses of water bodies and courses.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.6In addition, ARMCANZ by early 1995 might also consider the licensing/charging arrangements surrounding groundwater use given the importance of this resource and the adverse impact its indiscriminate use can have on the wider natural resource base. Advice could then be provided to individual jurisdictions to be used by them in their development of appropriate groundwater arrangements with the details of this advice to be contained in the report to COAG at the appropriate time.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.7In relation to establishing formal systems of water allocations or entitlements, jurisdictions where they have not already done so, should begin to do so as soon as possible with a view to having arrangements in place to allow more widespread trading in water to commence no later than 1998. For the Murray-Darling Basin jurisdictions, where it is essential that consistent entitlement systems be put in place to facilitate cross-Basin trading, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, in conjunction with ARMCANZ, should settle the form of the arrangements by the end of 1994. The arrangements should address such matters as ownership, environmental allocations, water quality, volume and tenure.

        5.8The States would also need to submit guidelines for water trading to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to ensure sustainability and compliance with the Murray-Darling Agreement.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.9Where it is found that more water should be made available for the environment or that river systems have been overallocated, it is a matter for individual jurisdictions, in the first instance, to decide how these challenges might be overcome. For example, overallocation of water could be addressed by determining the environmental needs of the (river, groundwater) system involved and then allocating the residual water on a pro-rata basis, having regard to previous entitlements and usage. Having done this, entitlements might then be traded. In the event that there are cross-border implications, as in the case of the Murray-Darling Basin, jurisdictions should, however, co-operate in finding solutions. In the case of the Basin, it is considered that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and Ministerial Council should be involved in this.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        5.10The pricing reforms for rural water users, together with the introduction of formal entitlement and trading arrangements, will require consultation with those affected. It is suggested that this occur at an early time to enable governments to gauge what, if any, structural adjustment assistance will be required to bring about the resource allocation and production changes that are expected to flow from the initiatives proposed.

        5.11It is a matter for individual jurisdictions to progress institutional change, particularly that involving local government in integrated catchment management.

        5.12As noted in Section 4 of the report, there is scope for the costs of delivering water services to be reduced. Indeed, such cost reductions would assist in cushioning, for example, the impact of removing cross-subsidies in urban areas. It is therefore suggested that ARMCANZ, in conjunction with the Steering Committee on National Performance Monitoring of Government Trading Enterprises, further develop by June 1995 its inter-agency comparisons of performance as a spur to improved efficiency in service delivery in the water industry. It is further suggested, in this context, that service providers be required to achieve international best practice.

To this end, it is suggested that the Working Group on Water Resource Policy coordinate the preparation of a report to the Council for its first meeting in 1995. In the succeeding four years ARMCANZ, ANZECC and, where appropriate, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council and the Ministerial Council for Planning, Housing and Local Government might report annually on progress with a final report being prepared for the Council's consideration at its first meeting in 2001.

        NATIONAL LANDCARE PROGRAM
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1992 a major review of Primary Industries and Energy portfolio natural resource management programs was completed. These programs, which included the former Federal Water Resources Assistance Program (FWRAP) and the National Soil Conservation Program (NSCP), were assessed to ensure that they reflected current objectives in natural resource management and to facilitate desirable program outcomes. The review was undertaken against a background of the evolution of the Commonwealth ecologically sustainable development process and an increased emphasis on the whole systems approach pursued through integrated catchment management.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The review recommended increased emphasis on facilitation and catalytic projects rather than capital works projects. It also recommended a more explicit focus on ecologically sustainable development objectives and improved resource management and efficiency. It further recommended that funding for the land and water programs should form part of a comprehensive policy which draws on Commonwealth, State and individual responsibilities and resources to address natural resource management problems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following the Government's endorsement of the review's broad findings, the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance ) Act 1992  was enacted, repealing the former water and soil conservation program Acts resulting in the establishment of the National Landcare Program (NLP).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development is a major basis for the NLP. The Program requires complementary institutional reforms and economic measures to be implemented in concert with Commonwealth funded activities, in accordance with terms outlined in Commonwealth-State partnership agreements currently under negotiation with State Governments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Through the NLP the Commonwealth is pursuing a range of objectives to achieve sustainable resource management and use. Under the partnership arrangements, the States will be required to incorporate a broad package of measures designed to achieve sustainable resource use and viable industries. Under both the NLP and the Murray-Darling Basin Initiative, an integrated package of land, water and related vegetation measures are being advanced to achieve the Commonwealth's objectives for efficient and sustainable resource use. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission released its Algal Management Strategy for the Basin in October 1994. Other key elements include: education; training; resource, property and catchment planning; the self-help Landcare movement; and infrastructure development, together with economic, policy and institutional reform. Linkages between rural development and resource management programs are being improved with the objective of fostering self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries and regions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The long term aim of the NLP is to foster sustainable resource use through integrated approaches to resource management. Community landcare, integrated catchment planning and improved land use management as well as water supply and management activities can all contribute to achieving the sustainable resource management goal. Natural resource problems are complex, often requiring approaches that are region or catchment specific. While resource allocation and pricing are important, other issues must also be addressed. This broad based approach provides for comprehensive scope and strategic focus while successfully providing for leverage to be applied to achieve complementary reforms which are beyond the reach of Commonwealth expenditure programs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The NLP recognises the need to integrate more closely approaches to land, water and vegetation issues and to achieve better coordination between levels of government and with the community in order to progress the Government's ESD and micro-economic reform agendas. By providing a basis for sustainable natural resource use, the NLP underpins the Government's strategies for maximising the contribution of rural industries and regions to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community.

        State and local governments and community organisations are intimately involved in delivery of the National Landcare Program, both through the community landcare component and Commonwealth-State partnership component. In the case of community landcare, State agencies act as agents for the Commonwealth.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Sexual Harassment in the Australian Defence Force entitled Facing the Future Together, was tabled on 25 August 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Inquiry commenced hearings on 4 February 1994 and concluded on 7 June 1994. The Committee comprised six Senators with Senator Gerry Jones as the Chairman. The Committee received 122 written submissions from individuals, including submissions from current and former Service personnel, and 16 submissions from various organisations. Evidence was heard from 57 witnesses at the public hearings, in some cases more than once. Four witnesses appeared in-camera before the Committee. The Report contains 42 Recommendations with topics ranging from re-defining policy documents and refining training and education programs, through to the severity of the censures handed down to personnel from HMAS Swan.

        CONTEXT
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Terms of Reference for the Committee arose out of allegations of incidents of sexual harassment that occurred in HMAS Swan during a tour of duty in South-East Asia during 1992. The most serious allegation was that of sexual assault of the female medical officer by a fellow officer. At a subsequent court martial the accused officer was acquitted.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee firmly endorsed the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force. The Report emphasised that, in order to achieve integration, personnel at all levels must be educated on gender-related issues. Further, Defence Force managers must have and use effective tools to manage these issues.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While dealing with and reporting first on the incidents in HMAS Swan, the Committee inquired into the nature and extent of sexual harassment throughout the Australian Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee was complimentary of the initiatives taken by the Navy after the incidents in  HMAS Swan to further the integration of women and eliminate sexual harassment. However, the Committee felt that the Army and Air Force, while having plans in train, were not proceeding with the same degree of urgency and commitment evident in the Navy. Army and Air Force are affording a high priority to this issue and have developed the appropriate mechanisms and put educational programs in place. It is important that the three Services and the Australian Defence Force Academy maintain this momentum. The continuing commitment by the leaders of the Australian Defence Force is imperative if the Defence Force is to meet the challenges of integration.

        SUMMARY OF THE REPORT FROM THE SENATE INQUIRY
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This overview provides comments on the main themes emerging from each of the chapters of the Report.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chapter 1—Sexual Harassment
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This chapter provides a general overview of sexual harassment not only in the Australian Defence Force, but in the community as a whole. The Committee noted that under the revised definition in the Sex Discrimination Act: `it is now no longer necessary for the complainant to demonstrate disadvantage as a result of sexual harassment. The crux of the difficulty with this definition lies in the very subjective nature of the criterion itself.'  The definition of sexual harassment is not clear and organisations' and individuals' perceptions may differ markedly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chapter 2—Sexual Harassment in the Navy
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This chapter builds on the comments in chapter 1 but specifically addresses the incidence and nature of sexual harassment or sexual assault in the Navy. The Committee believes that adequate statistics were not available as many members were reluctant to complain for fear of retribution.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chapter 3—Accommodation in HMAS Swan
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This chapter acknowledges that accommodation in HMAS Swan, which carries a crew of 250, is cramped in both the working and living conditions. Modifications to the accommodation in existing vessels can be expensive and must be balanced against other factors such as their remaining time in service.  This class of ship has undergone some modifications but, as they will be phased out of service at the turn of the century, extensive modifications are not economically viable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chapter 4—Behaviour of Officers Ashore
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chapter 4 examines the behaviour of officers from HMAS Swan during the deployment in South East-Asia, and concludes that the crew was generally well behaved, although some examples of immature behaviour were displayed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Chapter 5—The Terms of Reference of the Board of Inquiry
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A Board of Inquiry was established primarily to investigate allegations of sexual harassment against a female Reserve medical officer, Dr Carole Wheat, by fellow officers. This chapter looks at whether the Terms of Reference of the Board of Inquiry were sufficient to enable it to consider any aspects of unacceptable behaviour that occurred on board HMAS Swan.

        the Committee's concern that the subjective element of the test is relied upon too heavily in the determination of a complaint (paragraphs 1.28 and 1.33).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current definition of sexual harassment was drafted to reflect Government policy which is that, in determining whether sexual harassment has occurred, there is a need to consider the complainant's perception of what has occurred, balanced against a test of what a reasonable person in all the circumstances would have anticipated (Explanatory memorandum to the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992). This test provides the flexibility which is necessary to accommodate the wide range of behaviours capable of constituting sexual harassment. It also permits the assessment of individual cases on their merits, taking into account all surrounding circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Government policy is that the complainant's perception (the subjective element of the test) is relevant to determining whether sexual harassment has occurred. Whether a person feels sexually harassed will depend on circumstances particular to that individual (for example, age, sex, race, culture and relationship to the alleged harasser). This is reflected in the words "in all the circumstances". To ignore the complainant's perception of the conduct in question fails to acknowledge the often devastating effect on a complainant of sexual harassment and the differential effect of particular conduct on different complainants.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposal to establish a hierarchy of complaints (Recommendation 1—point 1) with a corresponding delineation of the appropriate mechanisms and legal sanctions for the different degrees of seriousness of the unlawful behaviour (Recommendation 1—point 3) is at odds with current Government policy. The legislation does not currently differentiate between types of harassment because all such behaviour is based on disrespect and abuse of power. The Government has indicated that it will not tolerate sexual harassment in any form. Sexual harassment is a generic term which is capable of encompassing a wide range of behaviour. It would therefore be virtually impossible to list every type of behaviour which is capable of constituting sexual harassment. Construction of such a list would be a necessary precondition to insertion of a hierarchy of complaints.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The establishment of a hierarchy of complaints would also not take account of the differential effects on a complainant of particular behaviour. In effect, a hierarchy would operate to devalue the effects on a complainant of particular behaviour and send a message to the community that some forms of sexual harassment are of a lesser concern.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To draw a line between certain types of harassment and allocate specific sanctions to each would undermine the system of conciliation and the flexibility of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to provide a remedy that is appropriate in the circumstances. The emphasis of all the human rights legislation administered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is on conciliation and providing a remedy appropriate to the circumstances in question. To prescribe particular penalties for particular types of behaviour is contrary to this approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government therefore believes that it is unnecessary to amend the Sex Discrimination Act as recommended by the Senate Committee in points 1 and 3.

        Recommendation 1 (point 2)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This recommendation does not take adequate account of the power differentials between the person harassed and the harasser and the effects of sexual harassment. The Recommendation appears to be based, to a certain extent, on the Committee's view that a person who is harassed should have an obligation to confront the harasser.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are many reasons why a person who alleges sexual harassment is unwilling or unable to confront the alleged harasser; these include the effects the alleged harassment has had on the complainant and the power relationship between the parties. According to Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the majority of persons bringing sexual harassment complaints before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are young women who feel unable to speak to the harasser. Women who do wish to confront the alleged harasser and have a complaint dealt with informally should be encouraged to do so, however, this is a very different proposition to the one being put forward by the Committee. The Committee's proposal has the potential to create a situation in which a complainant is required to inform the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour is offensive or to justify that the circumstances were such that it was not possible to do so, before proceeding to an outside body. The proposal may create a strong disincentive to the making of complaints and has the potential to create further legal and administrative hurdles for the complainant.

        Recommendation 2
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommends that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission should investigate the proposal that the requirement under the Sex Discrimination Act for employers to take all `reasonable steps' to prevent an employee or agent from engaging in unlawful acts of sexual harassment should specify that, as one such `reasonable step', the employer should provide support, through an appropriate off-line, internal unit in the organisation (such as Sexual Harassment Contact officers) or, facilitate access to an external agency (such as the Sex Discrimination Commissioner), for the person who feels harassed to bring to the attention of an alleged harasser (directly or indirectly) that the person's behaviour is offensive, intimidating or humiliating.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Such action should be seen as different from a formal complaint alleging sexual harassment and provide an opportunity for both parties to clarify the situation and be made aware of the possible consequences if offensive behaviour continues. The purpose of the measure is to assist in resolving genuine misunderstandings before they become a major difficulty in the work relationship, particularly in situations where the person who feels harassed feels unable to prevent the offending behaviour by his or her own action alone. The measure would also simplify the resolution of a subsequent complaint, should such a complaint be formally lodged.

        The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's training package for managers and supervisors on eliminating sexual harassment from the workplace encourages and points out the advantages of developing an `in house' process for dealing with sexual harassment complaints so that they can be dealt with expeditiously and less formally. The package notes the need to ensure that `in house' sexual harassment policies should always include mechanisms for informing a person alleging sexual harassment of all the options so that people can make an informed choice about how to proceed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, it is not clear from the Recommendation whether recourse to `in house' facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint with an outside body. All complainants should have the option of choosing to deal with a situation of alleged harassment in a manner which is comfortable to them. They should continue to have the option to proceed directly to an outside agency or attempt to resolve the situation in accordance with internal policies and procedures for dealing with sexual harassment.

        Sexual harassment is an abuse of power. Responsibility for eliminating it must rest with the employer and with the perpetrator. The Government agrees that, where possible, it is preferable that complaints be resolved informally between the parties. However, to place responsibility, in all cases, on a complainant to confront a perpetrator does not take account of the sensitivities and the power differentials in many working relationships. This is why a range of support mechanisms must be available to assist in conflict resolution.

This is intended to cover all the non-specialised training required for qualified entry officers on joining the Navy. Validation, including reviewing the course length,  will take place on completion of the first extended course. It is not feasible to extend the Reserve Officer Orientation Course to 26 weeks because, generally speaking, Reservists are not able to take leave from their primary employment for such a prolonged period.

        Under peacetime conditions the posting of a medical officer to each major Fleet unit is not warranted by the size of the dependent patient base.

        The Army has a comprehensive medical support structure which has evolved due to the nature of the battlefield. In Army's Area of Operations, the medical capabilities increase as a casualty is evacuated to the rear. At the `front', medical assistants and medical officers are integral to combat units, such as infantry battalions, and carry out emergency medical aid to casualties before evacuating them rearward. Within, and progressively to the rear of the logistic support area are the field ambulances, field hospitals, general hospitals and then, regionally located in Australia, the military hospitals. It is in these medical support facilities that casualties can be held, treated and nursed and these units are staffed with medical officers, nursing officers and medical assistants who provide the appropriate level of medical support and care for the casualty.

        The Navy does not support the proposition that sailors be allowed to remove themselves from ship billets if they develop reservations about their ability to handle life at sea. To allow such a situation would have the potential to affect operational effectiveness and to create posting turbulence with resultant short notice postings to other sailors. This in turn would have the potential to lead to family crises, dissatisfaction with Service life, discharge and shortages of trained personnel. Current policy provides avenues for Commanding Officers to land personnel who are assessed as being unable to fulfil their sea service obligation due to welfare or medical reasons, or where there is a degree of incompetence or disciplinary problems which warrant discharge action being taken.

To ensure that a balanced view and assessment consistency is obtained, all reports are commented on by the member's Head of Corps.

In cases of specialist members, such as direct entry officers, often a senior officer within the member's specialisation will have additional input on that member's technical profi ciency.

        In the Navy's case, the 008 number (Operation Lifeguard) is an integral part of the Good Working Relationships Project and is used to monitor trends in harassment/discrimination occurrences. Considerable effort and resources have been devoted to establishing the service and training its operators. In addition, Navy personnel are able to empathise with the callers and quickly establish a rapport with them.

Nevertheless, in such cases, if either the complainant or the alleged offender object to the investigating officer on the grounds of personal knowledge, another investigating officer will be appointed. In the case of Air Force the operational environment permits appointment of investigating officers of commissioned rank from another unit.

        (a)The chain of command should continue to take full responsibility for the development, implementation and monitoring of ADF policy on sexual harassment. It is also essential that the Services develop their own internal expertise in every aspect of the management of sexual harassment, including expertise in group dynamics and conflict resolution. However, there would be value in setting up an Advisory Panel to meet periodically with the Defence Force Policy Committee to assist the ADF carry out this responsibility. The Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Defence Force Ombudsman, and the present consultants to Navy and the ADF on sexual harassment should be included on the Advisory Panel. In view of the many integrated civilian/military establishments, consideration should also be given to including a representative of the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The HQADF and single Service EEO Units and personnel providing the 008 services should, as a matter of course, participate in meetings with the Advisory Panel.

        The establishment of a Defence Advisory Forum on Discrimination was announced by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in August 1994. The inaugural meeting with this Forum and the Defence Force Personnel Policy Committee, including the Commandant of the Australian Defence Force Academy, was held in September 1994. The Forum comprises the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Defence Force Ombudsman, the Director of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and representatives from industry, civilian organisations and tertiary institutions. Representatives from the single service Equal Employment Opportunity units were also in attendance. This Forum should provide valuable advice to the Australian Defence Force on a broad cross section of human rights and equal opportunity issues. The next meeting is scheduled for March 1995.

The Navy's approach of conducting focus groups to identify issues, followed by service-wide seminars which encourage communication and open discussion of the issue of unacceptable sexual behaviour in the context of appropriate overall behavioural standards provides an effective model for dealing with sensitive and complex matters of this kind. Similar processes should be put in place by all the Services to address the wider issue of professional inter-personal conduct, including general and sexual harassment, and mechanisms put in place for eliminating harassment of any kind from the ADF.

        The Committee endorses the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force and recommends that high priority be accorded to removing, to the maximum extent possible, any remaining barriers to recruitment and promotion prospects for women in the Services. To achieve this, high priority and resources should be given to reviewing criteria for advancement in the Services to reflect accurately the full range of complementary skills and attributes required for an effective and efficient Defence Force. Particular care should be taken to ensure that policies on access to facilities, physical strength requirements, pregnancy leave, fraternisation and the pre-requisites for promotion, do not unfairly or unnecessarily disadvantage women. Equally importantly they must not be perceived as giving an unfair advantage to women.

        The Government is committed to the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force.

        The first initiative is the establishment of the Defence Advisory Forum on Discrimination to address the challenges of discrimination and inequality in the workplace.

        FEASIBILITY OF NATIONAL ID SCHEME, THE TAX FILE NUMBER
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government welcomed the tabling in October 1988 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the tax file number.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In particular, the Government welcomed the conclusions of the bi-partisan majority regarding the Committee's additional terms of reference flowing from the Treasurer's announcement in the May Economic Statement in 1988 that the Government would proceed with legislation to upgrade the integrity of the existing tax file number system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Specifically, the report states (paragraph 2.21):
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        "The Committee concluded that the tax file numbering scheme proposed by the Treasurer is likely to improve the efficiency of the taxation system and to assist in the elimination of fraud and abuse of that system."
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government also noted the Committee's view that it is essential that the uses of the tax file number be strictly quarantined so as to protect the privacy of the Australian community and so as to ensure that the tax file number proposal does not become a surrogate means of establishing a broader identification system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government further noted the acknowledgment of the Committee that it is always open to Parliament to amend legislation, with the exception of the Constitution, in the usual way (paragraph 10.22). There have been occasions since 1988 when different uses of the tax file numbers have been the subject of scrutiny by Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some of the amendments to the tax file number legislation have been purely administrative in nature. However, others have had the effect of connecting the revenue and income support systems more closely because most income support payments are income tested.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The latter category involves the tax file number being a pre-requisite for payment of income support and home owner grant entitlements. This approach was taken so that statements by claimants for income support as to their income and domestic circumstances could be independently and automatically verified. The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 which was given Royal Assent on 23 January 1991 provides the authority for matching taxation and assistance agency data using the tax file number.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the Government welcomed the Committee's recommendations in relation to privacy legislation including the principles by which privacy may be protected, the establishment of an independent Privacy Commissioner, and the means of enforcing the principles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In his Second Reading Speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, the Treasurer foreshadowed that privacy legislation was to be introduced. The Privacy Bill was introduced to Parliament on 1 November 1988. In an effort to protect the rights of individuals, the Bill:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        proposed the establishment of the Privacy Commissioner;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        set out information Privacy Principles;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        vested power in the Privacy Commissioner to develop privacy guidelines; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        articulated rules relating to enforcement, penalties and compensation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill received Royal Assent on 14 December 1988 and came into effect on 1 January 1989; the same date of effect as for the tax file number legislation. On a number of occasions since that time, the Privacy Commissioner has been involved in consultations with the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to privacy matters concerning tax file numbers. Those consultations have included discussions covering the employment, investment and welfare uses of tax file numbers. and the matching of information using tax file numbers as allowed by the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is satisfied that individuals' right to privacy is adequately addressed and acknowledged in the administration of the tax file number system. (This was reflected in the May 1989 Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Administration of the Tax File Number System.)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is satisfied that the Committee's recommendations regarding privacy have been fully implemented.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, the Government noted the suggestion of Senators Hill and Alston that the ATO should, before proceeding to upgrade the tax file number system, make further efforts to extend its existing names and addresses matching system to interest reports for partnership, trust and corporate taxpayers. In doing so, Senators Hill and Alston correctly identified this as one of the major problem areas for the ATO, highlighted in the ATO's submission to the Committee. In actual fact, this is one of the key areas which the tax file number is intended to address. The reality is that there is no more accurate, efficient and effective way of matching vast volumes of externally obtained data to client computer records than to use a high integrity numbering system such as the upgraded tax file number. This is clearly evidenced in the private sector where business organisations use their unique client identifiers to accurately match millions of credit vouchers each year. The essential point is that whereas a `names and addresses' matching system results in confusion and thereby inability to correctly match examples, a numbering system avoids that problem.

         I wish to speak to the government response to a report that the Standing Committee on Community Affairs presented earlier last year. This was a unanimous report by the committee, which worked very hard and held many consultations around the country. The issue is of vital importance. It affects many women, most particularly those over the age of 50. That the committee was able to come up with a unanimous report speaks very highly of the work of the committee and the hard work of the secretariat. We today have the government response to its report.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee made 27 recommendations in the original report. Of them, the government either accepted or supported 24. For a committee, that is not a bad rate at which to score support. It is an issue that traverses a number of things that are also the responsibility of the states. That would have made it more difficult in responding to the report. I understand from quickly reading part of the response that our report was sent to a number of the states for them to also comment. Some of their replies have been fed back into this response, which is very important.

          I will highlight a couple of areas that I notice are outside the resolve of the Commonwealth to deal with. But there is a response, and things are being taken to the Australian Health Ministers Conference. One in particular is improving the level of travel and accommodation assistance available to women living in areas outside the major metropolitan areas who require radiotherapy treatment. Whilst this is primarily a matter for the states, concerns about the recommendation will be referred to the Australian Health Ministers Conference. That is a very important move and the way to go. As I said, our report traversed a number of areas that are also the concern of the states. The fact that they are going to be brought to the attention of the states is very important.

        <para first-indent="16">

          Another vitally important issue that we dealt with is the collection of statistics by the cancer registries of the states and territories. We recommended that the statistics collected by state and territory cancer registries be collected on a more uniform and consistent basis and that the data on cancers generally be provided to the Commonwealth government on a timely and regular basis to ensure that current national statistics on the incidence of cancers are readily available.

          The government supported the recommendation in principle. However, it is powerless to do very much about it because it is dependent upon what happens at the state level. The uniformity of data collection is being addressed by the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in conjunction with the state and territory cancer registries. I commend those organisations involved in doing that.

          At present, the core set of data and the standards imposed on this data are robust and directly comparable. That is also very important because we want to be able to compare the incidence, mortality and morbidity figures of breast cancer not only within Australia but internationally to know whether some of the treatment mechanisms that we are using are working.

          The response goes on to state that the timely reporting of national cancer incidence data is dependent on the supply of data from the state and territory cancer registries. While some cancer registries are able to provide data 18 months after the completion of the calendar year, others are not able to supply data for up to four years after the completion of the calendar year. It gives several reasons for this: the nature of cancer reporting, such as the compilation of multiple reporting sources; the lack of resources; the volume of the case load; historical impediments; and legislative inadequacies.

          The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and state and territory cancer registries are attempting to improve the timeliness of national incidence reporting. We noticed when we started our inquiry that the reporting of incidence by a number of cancer registries was very out of date; some registries were more than four years out of date. Our inquiry served as a fillip to some of the states to get their registries up to date and to report on a more timely basis. To me, that is an extremely important issue and one that I hope the states will continue to address.

          The importance of the treatment regimes and being able to evaluate screening programs is dependent upon getting good, accurate and timely data through. If that is not going to happen in all the states in this country, we are going to find that we do not know where there is a timelag—that is quite significant if it is four years—in being able to evaluate and implement alterations and changes that need to be brought into play. I very much urge the states to take on board the need for this and to do something about improving the timeliness of their reporting.

          At the back of the response, an attachment outlines the national program for the early detention of breast cancer and its communication strategy. We found a lack of education and knowledge in the community. For example, women under 50 are not encouraged to come. Women under 40 are certainly not included in the program because it is a mammographic screening program, not a diagnostic program. The difference between screening and diagnostic mammography is not well understood in the general community. I am pleased to see that there is a national program.

There is also a listing under the heading `Policy and practice in relation to symptomatic women in the program'. We thought about that issue very deeply, because it involves what is done if people with signs and symptoms who turn up to a clinic are loathe to go elsewhere. It also involves how they are incorporated into the mainstream system so that they do not go away, decide that they have made one attempt to have their problem dealt with and, because they did not get the response they hoped to get, do not bother again. That is also dealt with in this report.

          I know that our sister committee in the other place is now compiling a report on the treatment of breast cancer. I await its report with a great deal of interest. I thank everybody who was involved in this report for their contribution. We have made a valuable contribution to this issue. That is borne out by the fact that the government has endorsed just about every one of our recommendations.

I also commend the government response.

          I want to refer to two aspects that are subsequent to the publication of the report and the government response. There are dangers in the program in so far as the recent publications on this issue show that 70 per cent of the target numbers have to respond to screening for it to be shown to be successful. That figure is not being achieved.

          The second aspect of it is that we have discovered since the initiation of this inquiry that women are not going back for re-screening after two years. If that does not occur, the program will fall down in terms of the early detection of breast cancer. There is a tendency for women to have a mammogram and say, `I have had my mammogram. I do not have breast cancer'—even knowing that one in 10 will not show up anyway. Having said that, time elapses, they forget and they do not go back for re-screening.

          Two major issues must be addressed: firstly, women in the target group must come forward to have a mammogram; and, secondly, they must be re-screened. If 70 per cent of the target group do not come forward and then they all do not come back for re-screening, it will be a waste of money in terms of being able to prove that it has had an effect on the Australian community. With those two caveats, I am very happy to recommend the acceptance of the government response to the report of the Senate standing committee.

          I still have one issue to raise with the government and that is in relation to the funding of biopsy, which is a removal of the suspect area to prove whether it is a cancer or not. Our recommendation was that biopsy should not be included. Admittedly, it is a state problem, but, speaking as a surgeon, it is essential in the management of the woman who has breast cancer, particularly from the surgical aspect, that the treatment should continue after the biopsy and that it should not be part of the screening program. If it is part of the screening program, the woman is handed over to the surgeon, having had surgery of some kind or another. This often distorts the picture and does not give the surgeon the full knowledge that he or she needs to have in managing that particular patient. It is a somewhat minor thing from the report's point of view but major to the individual patient concerned.

         The main point that I want to stress very briefly this afternoon is the slowness of the government's response with respect to what is really a very important issue. We have seen extensively around Australia outbreaks of blue-green algae. Several years ago we saw 1,000 kilometres of the Darling River infected with blue-green algae and the impossibility for quite some time for people along the river to use that water because of its toxic nature.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We have had repeatedly in South Australia outbreaks of algae in the lower part of the Murray, specifically in the area of Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert, and this has made it impossible for people in the townships of Clayton, Strathalbyn and places like that to again use water for irrigation, stock purposes or, indeed, for human consumption. In the last fortnight I have heard that the people in Strathalbyn have had to switch to alternative water supply. It is a serious problem and one which is increasing in severity and in its spread. It seems to me from reading this government response that it is a totally inadequate response to a very important problem.

          In a sense, the blue-green algae outbreaks are really only an indicator of a much more serious underlying problem with our water supplies—namely, that the quality of the water with respect to such things as tepidity, temperature, flow, nutrient content is deteriorating. What happens at the end of that long chain is that sometimes one has an outbreak of algae and that, in a sense, is an indicator of this deteriorating quality. For those reasons, I think it requires a much more vigorous and timely response than is indicated by this report.

          The report itself was published, as the document indicates, in December 1993. The government response refers back to the December 1992 statement on the environment by the then Prime Minister in which he gave a Commonwealth commitment to assist in the improvement of water quality. That was in December 1992; it is now almost February 1995.

          One finds that throughout this report the government is taking note of the recommendations of the committee, that it is supporting the recommendations, but in fact very little is actually happening. This is against the deteriorating quality of water. Adelaide, for instance—fortunately, although I live in Adelaide, I do not have to drink Adelaide's water; I live in the Adelaide hills and have my own water supply—is seriously in danger of losing its water supply. If there is a combination of very low winter rainfall, similar to what we had in the last year, and high summer temperatures, an outbreak of blue-green algae would make it impossible for Adelaide to pump water from the Murray. In dry years the Adelaide city is sometimes dependent up to almost 90 per cent on Murray water being pumped into the essentially empty catchments of the Adelaide hills and then reticulated down to people in Adelaide itself.

          I think that in itself is an extremely serious problem which has not received the sort of response that it should have from government. For instance, on page 3 the government's response states that there is:

         growing community concern about the gradual deterioration in the quality of the nation's water bodies.

         That is an admission by government that there is a gradual deterioration, despite the fact that it gave an undertaking in December 1992 to do something about it. It further states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Strategy will set an overall strategic direction for water quality management and is based on the principles . . .

          When one turns to the government's response to the specific recommendations of the report one finds that in relation to the country towns water supply improvement program the government has put up $16 million over a period of four years—that is, $4 million per year for the water supply of country towns throughout the whole of Australia. The government response goes on to point out:

         This is of the order of $100,000 each. It is a totally inadequate amount of finance to undertake the very important work which is necessary. Again turning to the Murray-Darling system, we know that many of the small towns along that very important waterway have inadequate waste water treatment, have inadequate sewage treatment and have inadequate treatment of nutrient run-off from farms. That is what is leading to the nutrient build-up in the Murray-Darling system and ultimately to the toxic blue-green algae.

          I mention one other issue that I think should have been attacked far more vigorously by government: the issue of phosphorus in detergents—in household detergents, washing detergents and a range of commercially-used detergent products. The committee has made recommendations in relation to these detergents. The report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee recommends that existing and proposed campaigns to achieve lower phosphate levels in detergents through marketing strategies be continued.
        </para>
        <para>
         It further states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . if a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus in detergents has not been achieved within two years—
        </para>
        <para>
         we are already halfway through that period—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         then legislation be enacted to reduce levels or to ban phosphates in detergents.
        </para>
        <para>
         These are quite reasonable recommendations which came from the committee. But we find again that the government is leaning over backwards to be kind to the detergent industry. I will read one sentence which I found quite horrifying when I read it. It states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It should be noted that reducing or eliminating phosphorus in detergents may not be enough to have a significant impact on reducing algal blooms while there are other sources of phosphorus reaching waterways and while there is already a store of phosphorus in streams and sediments.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, the government is saying that, because two or three sources of phosphorus are getting into our streams, we will not tackle this very important source—namely, detergents, which could be tackled very quickly and very easily. Surely, any reduction in the levels of phosphorus is important, particularly in a country like Australia where many of the soils are very low in phosphorus and where, under those conditions, phosphorus is the critical nutrient not only in soil with respect to weed growth but also in our waterways.

          The government response goes on to talk about the most acceptable mechanism from an industry perspective being the use of economic instruments. In other words, there is an ideological commitment to protecting the needs of industry rather than protecting the needs of the environment.

          I simply stress that water is one of the most critical resources in this country. We have an extremely dry continent. We have a continent in which water is the limiting resource for much of our activity. We have a problem with deteriorating water quality. It is urgent for government to take the longer term view.

          Here we have another example of the need for longer term strategies. Unless government does not take note now of the importance of water, unless government does not act to remove phosphorus from detergents—remember that not too many years ago we did not have detergents; we used soap, and we got by quite well without phosphorus in detergents, so we can do it—and unless government is prepared to act and act vigorously, the problems which we are creating for future generations with respect to the quality of water will be very severe indeed.

         The government responded to the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee by putting down this response on 12 December 1994. We are all aware that the government did well to have it ready for the final week of the Senate sitting last December, but there was a great congestion of business. I do not want to make any cheap points about it being put down on the first working day after the Senate rose. Rather, I wish to commend the spirit in which this whole inquiry was undertaken: with the utmost seriousness to seek a comprehensive inquiry by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of the Senate and to gain the most positive response from the government towards our findings to see all the measures in place that would most seek to eliminate sexual harassment in the navy, army and air force—from the defence forces of Australia.

          The government's response is very much in that spirit.

          There is a degree of misunderstanding in the government's perception of what our report said about the 13 recommendations that are not fully supported. No doubt that is partly the fault of our not writing it more clearly and partly because of some errors of communication. This misunderstanding particularly relates to recommendations 1 and 2 that concern the Sex Discrimination Act. We are all aware that the only person in Australia who took any exception at all to this report was the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. I thought that whilst she was no doubt trying to responsibly carry out the duties of her office, her remarks were rather emotional and overly verbose.

          With regard to the heart of the Sex Discrimination Act, which the commissioner rightly must ensure is implemented, she is in some way being put at significant risk by our call in recommendations 1 and 2 that there be amendments to three matters in that act: the hierarchy of complaints of sexual harassment; the advantage, wherever it is possible, to the complainant in informing the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour was offensive; and the provision of appropriate mechanisms, differentiated mechanisms, for dealing with the different degrees of seriousness of unlawful behaviour. We have in mind in particular that this will impact upon the army, the air force and the navy, because every member of the defence services is subject—as are all Australians—to the Sex Discrimination Act.

         The junior female officers on the SWAN told the Committee, for example, that the reaction of many of the crew after the unfavourable publicity it received in September 1993, was to withdraw from the normal interaction that had been developing, as the men came to accept the women's professionalism during the course of the deployment. A mixture of resentment and uncertainty among the male personnel over where the line on unacceptable behaviour was to be drawn had the effect of isolating the women.

That is often the case in serious cases, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner says that that is the case in the majority of cases in which complaints are brought. I do not argue with any of that. I do not want to have any argument with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, whose work is so important. Rather, I ask for that degree of sympathy for the flexibility that we had been seeking to note the hierarchy of complaints.

          Sexual harassment can be someone displaying some offensive photograph. We call that a degree of sexual harassment. It is not directed at any individual, and it is not seeking any particular favour from any particular individual. Another level of harassment is where some person touches another person most offensively, or even offensively. That is another higher or more serious level of offence. A very serious offence would be a person requiring a sexual favour of another person in order for that person to gain some advantage or not to suffer some detriment.

          We saw in the navy in particular, but also in the army and air force, that this whole range of offences could land the offender, or the alleged offender, before the Sex Discrimination Commission. Therefore there was uncertainly amongst many personnel that, if they put up a particular photograph in one part of their cabin, this could lead them to be taken before the Sex Discrimination Commissioner because it can be construed, given the subjective element in the definition of what is in fact offensive, as offending in terms of sexual harassment?

          These are the two main areas where the government is disagreeing with the committee. I note that the other two matters that are still under examination—27 and 39V(a)—are dealing with trials where there are allegations of sexual assault. We are recommending that they be dealt with by a civilian criminal court and, similarly, the investigation towards the trial be dealt with by civilian investigation. This would be the case if the offence occurred anywhere in Australia but, if it occurs outside Australian waters, it would lead to only a court martial being applicable. We want that element to be carefully examined. It is being examined by Attorney-General's and Defence. We will, of course, listen very carefully to the analysis that eventually comes forward. I reiterate that I support the original recommendations.

I am very grateful that the government's response has, to a large extent, supported the recommendations made by the committee. Of the recommendations, 53 were supported, four were supported in principle, six in part and one was under examination.

          Pressure of time precludes me from covering every recommendation, but I would like to comment on several points. In a number of instances the government response draws attention to written orders and pamphlets et cetera as sources for advice on various aspects of military life. These documents are useful as far as they go, but I cannot stress strongly enough the need to deal on a personal level with the many issues associated with sexual harassment. This includes such a basic decision as the choice of a military career. These issues need to be dealt with on a person to person basis or in a small discussion group.

          No matter how much information is contained in documents, they cannot be seen as an adequate replacement for open, frank and informative discussion and dialogue about the personal issues involved. One aspect of this—the need for mixed gender focus groups of ADF personnel—is covered in recommendation 39-II(A). The response, which supports the proposal, says:
         </tab>
        </para>

         It would be very interesting to know how extensive these focus groups really are. It is puzzling that no mention of these groups was made in the original submissions to the committee.  Several of the committee's recommendations relate to the need for a practical guide to all personnel for dealing with instances of unacceptable sexual behaviour. The government's response tells us that headquarters of the ADF, in conjunction with the department, have prepared a detailed document entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Eliminating harassment in the integrated defence environment
         </emphasis>
         . It is to be hoped that this document will be available to every individual in the ADF and that it incorporates a section on conflict resolution.

          The committee urged that the ADF-wide awareness raising seminars should be supplemented by more specific training for any person wishing to develop skills and techniques for dealing with such harassment at the inter-personal level. The government's response supports the proposal and outlines the supplementary training offered by the three service. It should be noted that the response makes no mention of the Australian Defence Force Academy.

          One matter raised during the committee's hearings was the question of the need for investigating officers to be appointed from outside the unit where the alleged incident occurred. While the response says that the ADF is sensitive to this issue, I would point out that it puts the view that individually deployed units must have the capability of conducting internal investigations. It also says that, if the commanding officer perceives that an investigation may not be impartial, guidance will be sought from a superior officer to appoint an appropriate investigating officer.

          It is my view, and I believe the committee's view, that in all but exceptional circumstances the investigating officer should be from outside the unit. The officer should not be acquainted with any parties involved in the incident. It is imperative that in any incident the complainant and the alleged offender must be apprised of their right to ask the commanding officer for an external investigating officer. The overriding principle must be that justice is done and seen to be done.

          I would now like to comment on the two recommendations that Senator Teague commented on. Neither recommendation was supported by the government's response. Recommendation 1 and 2 are interlinked and address the basic question addressed by the committee. A very important issue addressed in the committee's report was the damage that is done if sexual harassment is not dealt with promptly. Situations that may initially be mild or based on misunderstanding are allowed to fester and develop into major problems.

          The committee sought to encourage early intervention to resolve a situation that is unsatisfactory to someone before that situation evolves into a formal complaint. Once a situation or formal complaint has been reached, the prospects are that all parties to the complaint—the complainant as well as the alleged harasser—will be hurt. Even if an apology is given or monetary compensation is paid to the complainant, the complainant will inevitably carry the stigma of being called a whinger or someone who does not meet with the requirements that are held within the establishment they are working in. The committee felt that, if possible, such a situation should be pre-empted.

          Sexual harassment should be nipped in the bud before the parties involved are damaged. It was with this in mind that the committee put forward recommendation 2. It is disappointing that the recommendation has not been accepted by the government. The committee particularly noted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's training package for managers. This package encourages in-house informal resolution of sexual harassment complaints, yet it was not developed until 1993—nearly 10 years after the sex discrimination legislation was passed.

          The emphasis has been on punishment for wrongdoing rather than education to pre-empt wrongdoing. Greater clarity for employers about their responsibilities, as set out in recommendation 2, would ensure better outcomes for all those involved. The government's response to recommendation 2 refers to an alleged lack of clarity—and I suppose the committee in some way must accept the responsibility for that—on whether recourse to in-house facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint. This is a matter which can be looked at in different ways.

          The issue would have been clearer had the government accepted the committee's recommendation 1. This recommendation said that there should be a clearer distinction between serious sexual harassment, such as brutal sexual assault, and the more mild irritants that are perceived by some people as offensive. In instances of less serious types of sexual harassment, it would then have made sense to make in-house efforts or involvement of an outside body part of the informal conflict resolution.

          The in-house efforts or the outside involvement—such as by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner—would be a precondition for formal complaint. Where the harassment is, by community standards, widely regarded as serious, and there is no ambiguity about the offence, then clearly a direct formal complaint to an outside body would be appropriate. The finetuning involved in implementing recommendation 2 should not pose any major obstacles if the basic need to resolve difficulties before they get out of hand is kept clearly in mind. Sexual harassment appears to be a straightforward matter but, as the committee soon found, it is a very complex issue.

         The committee was looking for the employer to take all reasonable steps to put in place a system whereby the matter could be nipped in the bud internally—at the workplace, within the place of employment—and sorted out by negotiation—that is, by some form of conciliation between the parties—and thereby would not have to go on to any civil action in the courts. That is what the committee was getting at in recommendation 2. During the course of this inquiry, I believe, the committee found that there were a good many instances of sexual harassment which could be sorted out at that level without any formal litigation or sanction against an individual.

Some people believe in touching more than is the case with other people. Some people are quite inhibited. What may be thought to be a very harmless gesture by one person can be received as quite offensive by another. It falls upon the legislature to bring in legislation which covers this situation and takes into account the varying degrees of human behaviour. It was Ms Triulzi, who had been engaged by the Navy, who stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . what we need to understand is that there are lots of elements of grey in understanding what sexual harassment is and is not, and how we distinguish and differentiate those levels of grey.
        </para>
        <para>
         That precisely is the point that the committee was looking at in recommendation 1. In December 1992, section 28 of the Sex Discrimination Act was amended. What was previously a more objective test was changed to a more subjective test, so that the offence that is created is as follows:

         in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.
        </para>
        <para>
         I stress the words `would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended'. That requires a person in such an instance as the workplace to anticipate what the other person will feel. This becomes increasingly hard, having regard to the fact that I have mentioned—the diverse cultures and backgrounds that Australian society has.

          One could be in a factory where there are many people of different nationalities and descents, and one has to go through this exercise of anticipation. One has to look at the other person who may have just won the lottery, or at someone whose close relative may have just died. One then has to ask oneself, `Is it sexual harassment if I put my arm around this woman and say, "My condolences", or if I slap this person on the back and say, "Congratulations on winning the lotto"'? The average person cannot possibly go through that exercise.

          I think the government has ignored the problem with a lack of definition. That is precisely what this committee came up against all throughout this inquiry: what precisely is sexual harassment? I join with Senator Teague in asking the government to reconsider this.

          I join with Senator Jones, who chaired the committee, in expressing disappointment at the fact the government did not  not support the recommendations. In fact, I believe that Ms Walpole, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, took somewhat of a trite view in saying that that definition was sufficient and that there was no problem. It was not her role to be there of course, but it could have been of great assistance to her if she had been with us throughout the inquiry to see what level of grey there was. In a very minor instance someone could extend sympathy by putting their arm around a person's shoulder—that is at the low end of the scale—and that could be regarded as sexual harassment. It goes right through to someone touching a fellow worker in an offensive manner. In that say one can see the hierarchy of complaints and the area of grey.

          Where legislation forbids this, I believe citizens must be given a clearer definition. If subjects throughout the country are to be expected to obey the law, they have to be given direction. It is our duty as legislators to tell them what they can and cannot do. I do not believe that section 28 of the Sex Discrimination Act does that. It leaves it to the individual to anticipate what another person might feel. I really do think it merits close attention.

          The committee, in recommendations 24, 25 and 26, urged reconsideration of the censure of Captain Mole and argued that he not be impeded in his promotion. These were very good recommendations indeed and I note the government's response to them. I have made inquiries and I believe that Captain Mole has since been promoted and that his censure, whilst not being removed as yet, is under review. I am happy to report that to the Senate because I believe that this officer was serving the navy and his country well. As a result of the attentions of some of the media in this instance, he suffered a great deal. In fact, he suffered a setback to his career generally in the navy. I believe the committee saw that and that is why the committee recommended those things. I thought it important to place that on the record.

          Former Justice Donald Stewart did not have any powers of subpoena or any other powers that this Senate committee has, but what he unearthed I believe is the tip of the iceberg of what is quite scandalous behaviour in the transfer of soccer players. Naturally, it has received a fair amount of media coverage, because I think most Australians are concerned about sport. No doubt there will be a lot of discussion on this.

The additional evidence they brought forward to us under parliamentary privilege last Friday in Sydney is something that we will be discussing. Senator Baume and I will be speaking on this matter in the Senate, but just to give some indication of the situation, I would poiont out that a further document that came forward from Blackburn Rovers Football Club in the UK regarding the transfer of a Frank Talia shows that some $200,000 is missing.

        The Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council performs an important role; namely, it provides a forum to consider industry issues and provides advice to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) from an industry perspective. I think this report outlines the number of important issues the council addressed during the year in review. It provided technical advice to the negotiation process of the Uruguay Round discussions, which we all hope is going to do some good for us.

         The council has developed feedlot guidelines for the industry, which basically have been very worth while and very good for an industry that has increased in size and stature in Australia. It has also focused on establishing systems within the meat industry to provide more effective links between the producer and the consumer. While it is all very well for government bodies to work on these links, it is something that must be industry driven and meat producers themselves must appreciate the importance of the end user and the importance of, and the need for, consistency in the product.

         That is something that has caused a great deal of concern in the last little while—the helix contamination of some of our beef into some of our export markets. Some people have said that the AMLC levy should have been used to help some of those people with the helix contamination problems. Basically, there is a big concern by all of those people who have beef contaminated by helix which, as everyone in this chamber knows, was used to spray cotton. It is probably one of the best and softest chemicals that has ever been used in the cotton industry, but the Japanese and the Americans have nil tolerance of it. When the residue levels get up to one or two, the non-tolerance areas will not accept the product.

         The AMLC has a very big part to play in that contamination scare. I think the job will now be left to the AMLC to make sure those markets that have been hurt by that particular scare are recouped. Quite often some of those other countries use some of these things as non-tariff trade barriers. It is quite interesting that the Japanese use helix to spray vegetables and everything else but they have a nil tolerance of it if it is in imported beef.

It does not list what this council's administration costs are, so I cannot comment on whether industry is getting value or not.

I do not know the reasons for the change, but I am aware that there is some criticism within the industry of that change taking place. So I hope that the industry sticks together and does the right thing. If we are to have an industry council, the advice has to be objective. I hope that this is going to be so with the AMLIPC in the future.

         —I support Senator Brownhill's motion to take note of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council annual report. The objectives of the council refer to a body called the residue management group. Its second key objective is to protect export and domestic markets for animal products from disruption to trade and financial losses caused by chemical residue detections. It is in that area that I wish to make a contribution tonight. There are a number of issues concerning the beef residue testing debacle that has come to pass through the feeding of drought affected cattle and even feedlot cattle with cotton trash treated with the chemical helix, which incidentally, as Senator Brownhill said, is a very effective method of killing caterpillars at certain stages of cotton production.

         I have a number of concerns. Firstly, there seems to have been an extreme lack of leadership in the beginning, and a lack of understanding of the plight of farmers already suffering severe drought being isolated into areas regarded `at risk' and then being forced to substantially meet their own testing costs. The New South Wales government has, to its credit, given considerable assistance in this area. Secondly, the AMLC was not prepared to use its $5 million in residue testing funds which had been set aside, I assume, for precisely this purpose.

         Thirdly, it seems that many northern cattle producers, both in New South Wales and Queensland, have been left in an appalling situation. The industry had washed its hands of many producers who had fed cattle through the most severe drought on record and who presently are unable to sell their cattle because they would be over the maximum residue level of this chemical. I am pleased to see that the New South Wales farmers are looking at some way of compensating these producers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Fourthly, the fundamental point that seems to have been missed by the AMLC is that anything that interferes with Australia's legitimate claim as a clean and green supplier of beef to the world is a problem for all producers, not just for those presently affected by this particular residue problem. It is especially so for northern producers and Queensland producers. Their livelihood was further threatened by this unfortunate combination of drought and the CFZ chemical, which hopefully will not happen again.

         The industry must be assured that in future a national management plan will be in place to handle future residue detection problems—and there will always be those problems. It must be there to answer questions quickly, to give leadership, to provide a speedy trace back of contaminants and, overall, to give confidence, to be of benefit to all producers and, most importantly, to give the sort of leadership our international market requires.

        In relation to the first annual report of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, the Greens WA objected in the beginning to the whole idea of a levy to fund this corporation. The idea of making money from chopping down trees to pay a bunch of industry representatives and bureaucrats to research how the industry can be sustainable is bizarre. I can be optimistic but, given the attitude prevalent in governments, it is likely that this will only be yet another smokescreen—like the national forest policy, the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry or the ESD forest policy—designed to divert attention, while the trees keep falling.

         By now we know that the way to make the industry sustainable is by agroforestry or to regenerate plantations on degraded, already cleared land. We know that adding value is the answer, not just increasing export volume to make up for declining prices. We know that the answer is not to eliminate the last stands of old growth forest and then try to become sustainable. How much more research do we need? CALM has researched agroforestry for years, but what has it done? It has lacked the will to implement it.

         Woodchipping is a tonnage export. It is a high volume, low value industry. It is a heavily mechanised industry that is shedding jobs as fast as possible. It is a large corporate dominated industry; it is a foreign dominated industry. It is not going to create great wealth, unless truly massive amounts of material are shipped out—and the actual benefits will be minimal, relative to expense and sensitive to price.

         Since 1986 the price of woodchips has fallen dramatically. Brazil has brought seven million hectares of Eucalypt plantation on line; South-East Asia is bringing huge gum plantations on line; and Spain, Argentina, South Africa and China are all bringing gum plantations on line. These are all plantation based trees. Supply is up, the prices are down and the margins on woodchips are getting thinner.

         Woodchipping is capital and technology intensive. It is highly mechanised in an effort to reduce labour costs. This is typical of high volume, low value products for basic economic reasons. It is not going to change. The trend to replace workers with expensive imported equipment will accelerate. The need for capital—usually foreign sourced capital—is also likely to accelerate. Three results will flow from this: jobs decrease relative to export volumes; imports increase relative to the profits from exports; and servicing of overseas loans increase as a portion of export earnings.

         As further mechanisation occurs and volume of extraction increases, the use of intermediate inputs, such as fuel, increases.

Profits are also repatriated and so do not enter into multiplier effects here and are part of a capital outflow from Australia.

         Finally, there is the issue of subsidy of forest products generally, and woodchipping specifically. Even without this, there are a number of factors which see money flowing out of the country as a consequence of the export of woodchips. This means that the actual contribution of woodchips to balance of payments is liable to be minimal or negative. At best, we are selling our forests for a mass of potage; at worst, we are paying people to take them away.

If these were included, then we might get an outcome that we can look forward to, sitting down and working with those people who work in the industry, instead of just looking at the profits of very large corporations.

         The situation clearly is that it is within Australia's interests that there be research and development of forest and wood products. I would have thought that anybody who was genuinely concerned about Australia's future would be embracing a development corporation which is looking at developing our forest and wood products. I have to say that I agree it would be beneficial if our woodchips did not go overseas. But what happens? When we in Tasmania wanted a pulp mill at Wesley Vale—a mill which at that time would have been the most environmentally sensitive in the world—who were the most vehement opponents of it? It was the Green movement. So instead, the woodchips are being sent to Japan to be processed in a mill which is more environmentally damaging than the Tasmanian mill would have been. These people tell us to think globally and act locally—but their action with the Wesley Vale pulp mill was in exact contradiction to that policy.

But when it does not suit the Greens to adopt a report, they go for another one and another one and another one. Then, of course, Senator Margetts quotes from that famous report—which, I noted, had the name of one of the people from the staff of Senator John Devereux—as being one of the supposedly independent reports that they rely on. It is like the Greens, who seem to rely in Tasmania on their own polls, those that they conduct, and then try to sell them off to the community as having been done by an independent organisation, until they get caught out.

Just as much as rabbits might like to dig burrows for their homes and undermine little banks and trees from time to time, so human beings to make their homes in which they live will chop down trees. If that means that I am a hater of nature, then the chances are that the beavers in Canada, or wherever, that cut down little saplings to dam rivers are also haters of nature. If a little animal does it, it is okay; but when human beings want to do it, that is outrageous; that is a hatred of nature.

         If the timber industry were sustainable at present, then we would be in the happy position of the industry never needing to log old-growth and high conservation value forests. Unfortunately, this insistence that the industry cannot survive without logging in old-growth and high conservation value forests means that the industry is not sustainable. It also means that, because there is such a reliance by this industry on these native forests, when those forests are gone the industry will not be sustainable in any sense of the word. It is certainly not environmentally sustainable now.

         Australia is very fortunate. It is an ancient continent. It has historic, beautiful, longstanding forests that have never been logged. If we log those forests that have never been logged before, then we are destroying them forever. They will never be renewed. Trees will grow, but forests are extinguished by the first logging and intrusion into them. Honourable senators need to learn the difference between trees, plantations and forests because old-growth forests are a unique ecosystem. They are very precious and valued world wide, but they do not seem to be valued in this country.

         The list that the federal government has developed, which protects only some forests and leaves others vulnerable, even though the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) indicated they are high conservation value forests, is a hit list for the timber industry. It means that where you declare forests to be of high conservation value but you fail to have the political will to protect them, you render them vulnerable.

         To claim that it is the state's responsibility to protect those forest areas against road making and other activities is an abrogation of the federal government's responsibility. The states have already said that they will not protect even those 509 areas that have been reserved for rescheduling and assessment. Therefore, what we are doing is throwing away something very valuable.

         The forest research levy, from which this study will be financed and which some of my colleagues in the Senate agreed to, is actually a way of giving permission to log all forests and trees for $1 a tree, whether it comes from a sawmill or is imported. The very important point is that if there is a $1 levy for each tree and that levy does not differentiate between a plantation log and a 400-year-old tree, then we are giving moral permission, through this funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, to act at the expense of our natural heritage.

         —I did not come into the chamber to rebut some of the outrageous statements that the Greens have put on the record tonight, but I think it is an appropriate time to do that in defence of our native forests. Our forests are not disappearing. Australia has approximately 43 million hectares of native forest. Of that, just over seven million hectares, or one-sixth, of this estate forest is managed specifically on a sustainable basis for wood production. About one per cent of that seven million hectares is harvested and regenerated every year. That means that any area logged will, on average, not be logged again for 100 years.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second point that is worth making is that the forests are not logged for woodchips alone. Timber is a natural and renewable resource competing with non-renewable commodities like steel, aluminium and plastic. Native forests are logged for the purpose of providing sawn timber for housing, furniture and for use in the construction industry. The waste from sawmilling is then either converted into woodchips or burnt or wasted at sawmills. Similarly, in the forests, trees from the harvest area that are unsuitable for sawmilling are either chipped or left to burn or rot. If woodchipping were to stop, sawmills would still need the same number of trees to be logged. The only difference would be that the by-product would be wasted, and that has been put on the record a couple of times today.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third point is that no animal or plant has been threatened by logging. The federal government's Resource Assessment Commission determined with its exhaustive study into Australia's forests that there is no evidence that any plant or animal species has been threatened with extinction because of forest industry activities. Given that state forests have been logged for more than 100 years, this is sound evidence of the resilience of our forests.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fourth point—and this is a question the Greens would like answered—is why do we not get all our wood from plantations? The reason is that Australia's wood needs are currently met about equally by domestic native forests, domestic plantations and imports. Australia's 100 million hectares of plantations could not supply further shortfalls from native forests. It simply means that we would have to import more. We presently have a current account deficit on the importation of timber or timber products of around $2 billion a year. If the Greens would like to see our current account deficit rise even more, then perhaps they should look to that as a solution.

         —She would do it by the importation of plastic sandals, I guess. The final point is why don't we use all the woodchips in Australia? The Greens would be interested in the reason for that, even though they probably know it. Due to the political uncertainty about the forests, which they engender, companies are not prepared to make the very large investment of up to a billion dollars that is needed to build plants for pulp and paper manufacturing in Australia. Senator Abetz, my colleague from Tasmania, knows a great deal about that. There is a provision in our export wood licences for chips to be first made available to domestic manufacturers for local processing. Only the surplus is exported.

         A lifelong member of the National Party, Tom Gilmore was born in 1908 in the mining town of Wolframcamp, west of Mareeba. After leaving school at 14, Tom Gilmore undertook many diverse jobs and the experience gained from working with a wide variety of people from all walks of life enabled him to be an effective representative of the Queensland people when he entered politics later in his life. Tom worked as a clerk in a hardware store, a tally clerk on the wharves, cut sugarcane by hand—truly backbreaking work—and he was also an ambulance bearer and a fireman on a sugar mill locomotive.

This would involve an unacceptable diversion of staff resources from existing priorities. Data for the training provided to Indonesia in the 1993-94 financial year is given in the following tables.

        Similarly, software may at one extreme be very inexpensive, and purchased over the counter, or at the other be very costly and acquired through major tendering processes. Much software may not be purchased at all, in the sense of legal ownership transferring from the producer to the Commonwealth, even though there is Commonwealth expenditure. Concepts like average lead times for decisions to purchase, and average life of hardware and software are imprecise and meaningless in this context.

To obtain the information requested by the honourable senator for financial years prior to 1993-94 would involve considerable additional research and compilation as each of the Services would be required to extract the information manually from departmental and archival records. This would involve an unacceptable diversion of staff resources from existing priorities. Data for the training provided to Thailand in the 1993-94 financial year is given in the table below.

        I note my previous detailed response of 13 October to the honourable senator on the matter of Defence Cooperation training with PNG. To obtain the information requested by the Senator for financial years prior to 1993-94 would involve considerable additional research and compilation as each of the Services would be required to extract the information manually from departmental and archival records. This would involve an unacceptable diversion of staff resources from existing priorities. Data for the training provided to PNG in the 1993-94 financial year, however, is given in the table below.

        I note my previous detailed response of 7 November 1994 to the honourable senator on the matter of Defence Cooperation training with Malaysia. To obtain the information requested by the honourable senator for financial years prior to 1993-94 would involve considerable additional research and compilation as each of the Services would be required to extract the information manually from departmental and archival records. This would involve an unacceptable diversion of staff resources from existing priorities. Data for the training provided to Malaysia in 1993-94 and 1994-95 (to date) is given in the table below.

        (1) Spent nuclear fuel containing Australian Obligated Nuclear Material (AONM) in the Republic of Korea (ROK) remains subject to the provisions of the Agreement between Australia and the ROK concerning Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and the Transfer of Nuclear Material, which entered into force on 2 May 1979. Under Article VIII of this Agreement, AONM subject to this Agreement may not be reprocessed within the ROK or transferred to a third country without the prior written consent of the Australian Government. Requests for such consent would be considered on a case-by-case basis. No such request has been made in respect of reprocessing.

        (2) Spent nuclear fuel containing AONM in Japan remains subject to the provisions of the Agreement between Japan and Australia for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, which entered into force on 17 August 1982. Pursuant to Annex B (the Reprocessing Settlement) and the Implementing Arrangement of the Australia/Japan Agreement, Australia exercises its prior consent rights on a programmatic basis so that AONM may be reprocessed in Japan or in an eligible third country as part of a long-term nuclear fuel cycle program. A condition of this programmatic consent is that the facility in which reprocessing will take place is included within the Delineated and Recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program (DRJNFCP). The DRJNFCP is an integral part of the Australia/Japan Agreement and the provisions of the Implementing Arrangement which outline the DRJNFCP are of treaty status and are published (along with the Agreement) in the Australian Treaty Series (No. 22 of 1982).

        Australia has also given programmatic consent to certain retransfers of AONM subject to the Australia/Japan Agreement within the Delineated and Recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program. In accordance with arrangements established in 1992, Japan notifies Australia of such retransfers, including those of spent fuel containing AONM, approximately six months in advance of each transfer.

        (3) Australian uranium may only be exported or retransferred to countries with which Australia has bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements. These agreements lay down stringent conditions for the use and transfer of AONM. Within Australia's network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, five agreements (those with Euratom, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland) contain reprocessing settlements, allowing those treaty partners to retransfer and reprocess AONM under a programmatic consent regime based on conditions previously agreed to by the Australian Government. The remainder of Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, except that with the Russian Federation, require prior written consent from Australia to be sought on a case-by-case basis before reprocessing of AONM could take place. To date no such consent has been sought. The agreement with the Russian Federation does not provide for reprocessing and only covers toll processing on behalf of third parties at the "front end" of the nuclear fuel cycle; that is conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication.

This understanding is supported by the terms of a settlement reached between Mr Johnson and Trust Bank Tasmania following civil action brought by Mr Johnson for wrongful dismissal; the Reserve Bank has been advised formally that the terms of the settlement specify that:

        (5)(a) The Reserve Bank monitors continually changes in the assets and liabilities of banks;  Tasmania Bank and the Savings Bank of Tasmania were no exception. In November 1990 Tasmania Bank experienced a moderate outflow of deposits following the announcement by the State Government of significant losses for that bank. The bulk of the outflow occurred in the first two days after the announcement. The Reserve Bank consulted with the bank during this period and was fully aware of the extent of the outflow. The Savings Bank of Tasmania's deposit holdings fell by 6 per cent over the four month period following the State Government's announcement of problems in Tasmania Bank in November 1990. By July 1991 this fall had been all but completely reversed. Changes of this magnitude can be associated with factors such as changes in balance sheet structure and a bank's pricing policy for deposits.

Mr Kemp called on the Head of Bank Supervision Department on 17 September 1991 to update the Reserve Bank on the integration of the Savings Bank of Tasmania and Tasmania Bank. The Governor, while in Hobart on 3 October 1991 to speak at a conference, called upon Mr Kemp to discuss various issues relating to the Trust Bank Tasmania. In carrying out its duties as prudential supervisor of banks, the Reserve Bank routinely meets with senior executives of banks.

        (1) Is the Minister aware of a minute prepared by the Migration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Division dated 6 June 1989 advising the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that 'DEET officials were most concerned at the impact upon institutions of a sudden cessation of students from the PRC (People's Republic of China)—some institutions would be bankrupted if they were required to refund fees. In addition, programs for students in other countries would have to be cancelled where institutions were dependent for viability upon the PRC component. If cessation results from actions of the PRC Government the industry has no option but to adjust as best it can. If actions by the Australian Government stopped the program the industry would presumably seek some form of redress . . . Deferment of processing avoids the necessity of institutions refunding fees and buys us time to consider this aspect in the light of developments.'.

        At about the same time, a number of English language institutions in Australia closed. In June 1990, the Commonwealth Government wrote to all ELICOS and Special Studies institutions detailing the procedures and guidelines to be followed if they wished to request provision of temporary financial assistance to cover short-term cashflow problems but not to compensate for any loss of profits. Those institutions which had a solid financial base, recruited students from several countries and, therefore, were not largely dependent upon the PRC market, were able to adjust to the visa changes and sustain viable businesses which have contributed to the further development of the export education industry. (ELICOS figures indicate that there was a 50 percent increase in enrolments in that sector between 1993 and 1994.)

        (3) The most important asset of the Royal Australian Navy is its personnel. Both the Falklands and the Gulf conflicts showed that the survivability of the ships themselves is critical for the survivability of the crews. In both these conflicts, little-understood secondary effects of weapon strikes significantly exacerbated the effects of the initial `hit'. In 1991, the Navy first proposed a series of destructive tests on a recently de-commissioned warship to validate computer models and engineering algorithms with a view to improving the combat survivability of Australian warships. As a result, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation developed the series of destructive experiments currently being performed on the Derwent hulk to collect data to assist the Navy to meet that goal.

Sale of ships of this nature and demolition markets are basically confined to mainland China which is paying in the region of $US157—160 per light displacement ton delivered to the Shanghai area under its own power. Ships under 6000 tons light weight are basically not attractive and require payment of an import tariff of 6 percent.

These reports consider the environmental impact of the experimental program as well as a Risk Management Plan. These reports were examined and approved by both the Commonwealth and West Australian Environment Protection Authorities. The Navy has consulted with local, state and federal authorities at each stage of development of this plan. The experiments will be completed on 2 December 1994 and have been extremely successful, providing much valuable scientific data and very realistic training opportunities for the Navy fire-fighting and damage control teams.

        The Australian Government considers that adequate provision has been made to safeguard human rights in The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1 July 1997 under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which has international treaty status and has been registered with The United Nations. We consider that the two sovereign powers, which are signatories to the Joint Declaration, have an obligation to ensure that its provisions are fully implemented after the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997, including, in particular, the provisions guaranteeing independent judicial power, and rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief ensured by law.

        (2) China has declared its intention to dismantle the three-tier political structure in Hong Kong as it presently stands, having been modified through legislation passed by Hong Kong's Legislative Council in June this year, and to create an interim legislature in 1997 to ensure continuity in laws, to handle urgent business and to arrange elections for a permanent legislature. We hope that whatever arrangements are made for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are democratic and transparent and in accordance with the wishes and interests of the Hong Kong people. The spirit of the Joint Declaration and China's 1990 Basic Law in fact encourages building an even more accountable and representative government in Hong Kong over time. China has enshrined these guarantees in its own domestic laws regarding Hong Kong, i.e. the 1990 Basic Law.

        (2) Yes. There are several instances where rural properties have been connected to the grid when renewable energy power supply systems would have been a cost effective alternative. This is particularly so where rural properties are far removed from the nearest grid lines and/or the electricity requirements of properties are small. For example, the University of New South Wales has estimated that, in many instances, renewable energy power supply systems could represent an economically viable alternative to grid connection for rural households faced with a grid connection cost of more than $15,000. Cost estimates of this nature underpin the Renewable Energy Promotion Program through which the Government has provided $3 million over the past three years to promote the use of commercially viable renewable energy technologies, particularly in rural and remote areas of Australia. Approximately 80 renewable energy displays which will be available for public inspection are being established throughout Australia.

        (3) I am not aware of the context in which these specific statements were purported to have been made. However, I understand that they may relate to the launch of a book by journalist Gavin Gilchrist entitled "The Big Switch—clean energy for the twenty first century". The book contains considerable criticism of officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Examination of these criticisms (see, for example, the

This results in a misleading impression that these officers were not providing balanced advice on the prospects for using renewable energy technologies in Australia.

        (4) Over the past decade, the US Federal and State Governments have undertaken major energy efficiency programs. They have also put in place regulations for electricity utilities to invest in energy efficiency through what is commonly known as demand side management (DSM) programs. Although the US has benefited economically from implementing many of these measures, recent studies suggest that several of the utility-DSM measures were far from economically viable on their own account. The results of these studies has led to a thorough re-examination of the cost effectiveness of DSM measures in the US, particularly compared with the cost-effectiveness and consequent benefits to the overall economy of government run energy-efficient programs.
