        We, the undersigned students and staff of Forster High School, believe that in making plans to undertake nuclear testing in the Pacific, the French Government is acting with a high degree of irresponsibility. The American Government, by endorsing French policy and undertaking its own nuclear testing is acting equally irresponsibly, if not more so. The actions of these two nations will not only threaten world security, but destroy millions of organisms and their habitats.

        The possible leakage from the test site of radioactive material would promote cancers and permanent genetic damage in present and future generations of human and all other life forms. The secrecy surrounding some hospitals in French Pacific colonies suggests that this has already happened locally. As health workers, we see the extensive and costly social problems produced even by remediable health impairment. Finally, it is well understood that the announcement and carrying out of tests damage the support for the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.

        Existing actions in protest at the French decision, such as the disallowance of refuelling of French aircraft in Darwin, should be continued.

        The Ordinances were gazetted in April 1995 and were expressed to operate retrospectively from 1 January 1995. In effect, financial institutions duty became due and payable in that period. The Commonwealth has entered into an arrangement with the State Taxation Department of Western Australia to assess and collect taxes in the Indian Ocean Territories on behalf of the Commonwealth. However, the powers in the FID Acts, which are vested in the Minister in accordance with sections 8G of the Cocos (Keeling Island's, Act 1955 and the Christmas Island Act 1958, were not delegated to the WA Commissioner of Taxation to authorise the collection of the duty.

        That instrument amends instrument No.99 of 1995 which determined a Statement of Principles relating to chronic myeloid leukaemia. The amendment replaces the word "acute" with the word "chronic" in clause 1(a). The Explanatory Statement notes that this amendment reflects the correct decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority. Instrument No.99 of 1995 was, however, part of the legal process reflecting that decision, and the decision was not accurately reflected in that instrument.

The Committee raised the inconsistency of the spelling of the disease by letter dated 6 March 1995, and as a result, instrument No.125 of 1995 has corrected that spelling error. The Explanatory Statement, however, does not mention the role of the Committee in identifying the error.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you point out, Instrument No 126 amended Instrument 99 which was about `chronic myeloid leukaemia'. The inclusion of the word `acute' was inappropriate since both the Statement and the factor were talking of the `chronic' form, a different medical condition. There was already a Statement of Principles for `acute myeloid leukaemia', Instrument 35 of 1994. No disadvantage occurs to the sufferers of that condition since the same factor appears in that Instrument.

        I refer to the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No.86, and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Laws) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No.87. These instruments are presently before the Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These two sets of rules make an almost identical amendment to the respective principal regulations. The following comments of the Committee, therefore, apply equally to both instruments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Explanatory Statement for the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment) states that the regulation in force prior to the making of the current amendment, regulation 18, "requires the Commissioner to certify [in the evidentiary certificate] that an assessment of sales tax payable by a person was made against the person in respect of the year set out in the certificate". This amending instrument, which removes the reference to a particular year from the Commissioner's certificate of assessment, is made retrospective to 16 June 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee has considered the explanation for the amendment in the Explanatory Statement, being that as the Act does not refer to a year, the amendment is removing an inconsistency from regulation 18.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not unusual, however, for regulations to set out the details, manner and time frames within which fees, levies and charges or other imposts are to be collected or other matters complied with. That is, the delegated legislation sets out the details after the head legislation has set out the general principles. In order to be satisfied that regulation 18 is not, in fact, valid law, the Committee would be grateful for your advice as to the need to amend regulation 18.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee would also appreciate advice as to whether there were any evidentiary certificates issued during this time, being 16 June 1994 to present, which did not mention the year and, if so, whether such certificates were used in any actions.

        I refer to your letter of 8 June 1995 concerning the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No. 86, and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Law) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No. 87. These statutory rules amend the regulations which specify the information which must be shown on evidentiary certificates for use by the Commissioner of Taxation in proceedings to recover unpaid sales tax.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The statutory rules under consideration make identical changes to the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Law) Regulations. In each case the amendments remove the need for specifying the year in respect of which tax has been assessed in evidentiary certificates used by the Commissioner of Taxation in sales tax recovery proceedings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You seek advice on the need for the amendments. You also seek advice as to whether any evidentiary certificates issued after 16 June 1994 (the date on which the requirement to include a reference to the year of assessment was included in the regulations) did not mention the year and, if so, whether such certificates were used in actions to recover unpaid sales tax.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first point to note is that the amendments operate retrospectively to correct an error made by amendments to the regulations which took effect on 16 June 1994. The two offending amendments were part of a package of changes which included the standardisation of evidentiary certificates for recovery of several kinds of taxes including sales tax. Part of the standardisation of certificates was a requirement that the evidentiary certificate should include the year in respect of which the assessment of tax was made against the person.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 and Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.1) 1930 (and other sales tax assessment Acts affecting dealings with goods before 1 January 1993) do not impose a liability to taxation in respect of a year or any other period. Accordingly, a regulation containing the requirement to specify, on sales tax evidentiary certificates, the year in respect of which an assessment was made is inconsistent with the principal Acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given this inconsistency, the reference to `year' in sales tax regulations on evidentiary certificates could cause confusion amongst taxpayers, and the courts and tribunals that deal with sales tax matters. The amendments effected by SR86 and SR87 of 1995 are therefore necessary to remove the possibility of such confusion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since 16 June 1994 the Commissioner has issued 6 evidentiary certificates in court proceedings to recover unpaid sales tax. Generally, the certificates are used in court in contested actions against individuals for recovery of unpaid sales tax. None of the 6 certificates specified a year in respect of which unpaid sales tax had accrued. The requirement to specify the year was disregarded because of uncertainty about the meaning of the requirement and because there is no power under the principal legislation to issue assessments for sales tax in respect of a particular year.

          Accrual accounting has been with us for a long time and is the basis for accounting in the private sector and in government business enterprises. Accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they occur. This contrasts with cash accounting which records transactions when cash is exchanged. Accrual accounting therefore aims to match the costs incurred during a particular reporting period with the benefits earned in that same period. It also segregates capital transactions from operating transactions. It is a commonsense approach.

          , which was tabled in 1957, the committee argued that Commonwealth bodies operating on a trust account, rather than from the consolidated revenue fund, should keep a profit and loss account and a balance sheet which should be certified by the Auditor-General. Later, in 1982, the committee recommended that cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary basis for financial reporting by Commonwealth authorities and, instead, that accrual accounting should be adopted.

          It also became clear in the committee's recent inquiry into the commercialisation of public sector operations that many Commonwealth agencies, particularly those which had moved to adopt a more commercial approach to program and service delivery, had found accrual reporting and accounting to be a valuable management tool. For this reason, the committee broadened its inquiry beyond the assessment of the readiness of Commonwealth agencies to produce reports on an accrual basis for this last financial year to the uses of accrual informationâ€”by the government, by agency managers and by external reviewersâ€”to facilitate better judgments about operating performance, economic impact and the stewardship of public resources.

          During the review, the committee received evidence at public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, at which the experiences of agencies within the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales jurisdictions were canvassed. As well, information was sought from other states and territories and from New Zealand, which has been at the forefront of introducing accrual accounting for government agencies in the world.

          Report No. 338 considers at some length the uses to which the information in accrual reports can be put. In particular, information can be used to make comparisons between reporting periods and between agencies. Such information has the potential to be of great benefit to the parliament, to which agencies are held accountable, and to the public through media commentators.

          To assist those interpreting accrual based financial statements, the committee has recommended that the Department of Finance should develop a professional marketing strategy directed at the potential users of agency financial statements and also that the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives develop information and training packages on the new financial reports for members of parliament and parliamentary staff. For its part, the committee intends to write to all parliamentarians and party whips informing them of the type of accountability and performance information that can be derived from such reports.

          The committee believes that accrual information is an essential tool for modern public sector day-to-day management. Without regular access to accrual information, it is not possible to make accurate assessments of the cost of service provision and thereby the efficiency of program performance. It is of concern to the committee that, as yet, only a few agencies have recognised the value of accrual information, and even fewer have taken the initiative to explore the full potential of accrual information. The committee believes that, at agency level, accrual based financial management systems should be introduced and more should be done to educate managers in how to make best use of accrual information. There should also be incentives to encourage agencies to adopt the reform.

         The committee notes that there is a basic incoherence in the Commonwealth's financial management systemâ€”funds are appropriated on a cash basis, but end of year reports are now made on an accrual basis. In the committee's opinion, this is not only inelegant but also sends mixed messages to managers. Managers are inclined to focus on cashâ€”it is cash they have been appropriatedâ€”but the end of year accrual reports mean that they are held accountable for more than just managing cash. Such a system is likely to undermine the potential of the reforms undertaken to date. The committee has recommended, therefore, that there should be a major review of the Commonwealth's system of budget appropriations to consider the merits of requiring that budgets be prepared and appropriations made on an accrual basis.

          Report 338 concludes with a discussion of the next major accounting reform for the Commonwealthâ€”whole of government reporting. The committee believes that preparing such reports on an annual basis would provide information of great value to cabinet, to the government's key economic advisers, to parliamentarians and to many other external users. Whole of government reports would help inform strategic decisions about government priorities and policies and would enable the government to better account for its use of public resources.

That means looking into whether or not the Commonwealth is suggesting that Mrs Faulkner's case was weak because it was unsubstantiated, whether or not the right thing was done in not allowing witnesses to substantiate the case, or whether or not there was any interference with evidence. It is important to establish whether there are issues that remain unresolved.

As this has never actually happened, that is why the motion is before the Senate today, to make sureâ€”no matter what we think about what has happened over timeâ€”that the Commonwealth acted in a correct and proper way in its dealings in all ways in this case.

This reference seeks to look at the Commonwealth's conduct during those proceedings and, in particular, in relation to the evidence produced at trial. The Faulkners say that Brigadier Flint in a letter to the Defence Ombudsman, I think it was, had said that he had acted with authority in the representations he made to the Faulkners, that is, that when he spoke to the Faulkners about whether their clip would be purchased by the army he had authority.

          At trial Brigadier Flint said that he did not have authority. So there was a change in the evidence. The question is: how did that come about? Through freedom of information applications it became apparent that there were various notes of conversations made by Commonwealth officers whereby certain statements were made and Brigadier Flint's evidence was discussed. It is in relation to this aspect of the Commonwealth's approach to that matter that part of this reference relates. Among other things, there is a notation that Brigadier Flint should be required to say that he acted without authority, which was contrary to his previous statement. That is an aspect which needs looking at.

          There are comments about Brigadier Flint's pensionâ€”that he should be told that he does not have to worry about his pension. Brigadier Flint had retired. It is alleged that he was worried about his pension and that the Commonwealth had raised this as an aspect of relevance and that it should be brought to his attention that he did not have to worry about his pension, the presumption there being that if Brigadier Flint was worried about his pension his actions or evidence might be flavoured in some way. I do not make any judgment either way in this regard. It is simply a question of whether this merits further investigation.

          As well as this, the Faulkners did have legal aid to conduct their case. However, this was limited before trial and they were denied legal aid for the purposes of obtaining witnesses who they say were essential to their case. These witnesses were overseas. There was the question of the cost involved and the question of relevance. Nonetheless, they say that they could not conduct their case in a proper fashion without a full grant of legal aid. That is another limb, if you like, of the referenceâ€”the Commonwealth's actions regarding the limiting of legal aid to the Faulkners.

          We are talking about a matter which arose in the 1960s. I am advised that Mrs Faulkner's company invented the Trisal clip, which, I understand, is a haulage clip for securing tow ropes. Mr and Mrs Faulkner sought to sell the clip to the Australian Army. In attempting to do so, they had many dealings with the then engineer-in-chief of the Australian Army, Brigadier Flint. Over a period of years, the relationship between Flint and the Faulkners turned sour.

          In 1974, therefore, proceedings were instituted against the Commonwealth and former Brigadier Flint. In those proceedings it was alleged that: Brigadier Flint made negligent or fraudulent statements in relation to the army's intentions to buy a large volume of Trisal clips from Mrs Faulkner's company, and to promote use of those clips by the armed forces of other countries; Mrs Faulkner invested in her company in reliance on these statements; orders of the size foreshadowed did not eventuate and the company failed; and Mrs Faulkner lost her investment in the company and also lost the financial benefits she would have derived from exploitation of her patent rights in the clips.

          So in this case we are talking about conduct from the 1960s and proceedings instituted in the 1970sâ€”matters from 20 to 30 years ago. The matter went to the supreme court. It was dismissed by Mr Justice Allen of the New South Wales Supreme Court in 1987. It is a 71-page judgment. The judgment, I am informed, was a comprehensive rejection of the allegations made by Mrs Faulkner, based on what was clearly a very thorough examination of the documentary and other evidence.

          It is important to look at the judgment of the judge in 1987. As I say, we are talking about actions that happened in the 1960s and 1970s and a comprehensive court appraisal in 1987. From the judgment it appears that Mr and Mrs Faulkner set up Brigadier Flint to make the representations of which they complained and that, to the extent that any representations were false, the Faulkners were not misledâ€”and this teems out of the judgment of the supreme court. Rather, the representations were made for the purpose of the Faulkners passing them on to others such as financiers, potential purchasers. One only has to look at page 26 of the judgment to get that.

A judge that I have no knowledge of, but in court in 1987, an eminent judge in New South Wales, Mr Justice Allen, had this to say about credibility:

          Since that judgmentâ€”I think Senator Ellison picked up on thisâ€”the Faulkners have made a number of allegations of which two are probably pertinent to this particular motion. One assertion is that limitations were placed on the management of Mrs Faulkner's case. In matters such as this there are two questions to be determined: liability and the quantum of damages.

          At the outset it should be made directly clear that the Commonwealth did not directly impose any limitation on the management of the Faulkners' case. Rather, after Mrs Faulkner's bankruptcyâ€”which was another complicating circumstance in this complex taleâ€”the Commonwealth was providing legal funding for her case.

          In 1987 some limitations were imposed on the amount of that funding. Attorney-General Duffy and Attorney-General Lavarch, together with the Minister for Justice, Michael Tate, examined these allegations about the limitation. The reasons for the limitation on funding have been given; they have been justified on many occasions to the Faulkners and others who made representations on their behalf. I must also place on record here that, although there have been allegations of impropriety, no evidence has been adduced to support those allegations.

          The bottom line is that in relation to the question of the Commonwealth's alleged liability to the Faulkners, which was the first thing that had to be established by the Faulkners, I am advised that legal funding was continued on terms and conditions consistent with the advice of the Faulkners' senior counsel.

          So that brings us to another matter. Not only did they lose the case, not only were they slammed in the court but, thereafter, they turned against their senior counsel as wellâ€”and that is something which I think people appreciate.

          It is true that funding of approximately $550,000 was refusedâ€”it is unfortunate that Senator Ellison is not listening to thisâ€”in relation to the calling of overseas witnesses. I am advised that the plaintiff's senior counsel had described that part of the plaintiff's claim in respect of which the overseas witnesses were necessary as `somewhat speculative'. The Solicitor-General, who had been instructed by Attorney-General Bowen to consider the plaintiff's claim in the context of a review of legal aid funding, described this part of the claim as `entirely speculative and very close to being bereft of any legal or factual justification'.

          It was thus entirely proper, given the advice on the one hand from the plaintiff's counsel that it was somewhat speculative and the advice on the other hand from the Solicitor-General that it was entirely speculative and bereft of any legal or factual justification, for the Commonwealth to decline the funds for the calling of overseas witnesses on the basis that that would have been a waste of public funds. Moreover, it is worth noting that the witnesses related to the amount of damages which they claimed to have suffered rather than the liability. The first question to be tried was the question of whether there was in fact liability.

          The Supreme Court of New South Wales ordered that the two questionsâ€”that is, the quantitative damages as opposed to whether the Commonwealth could be found to be liableâ€”were to be tried separately. The liability issue was tried first. The witnesses from overseasâ€”which involved $500,000 worth of airfares and whateverâ€”went to the question of quantum.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Having tried the liability question first, the court found that the Faulkners had not established liability and therefore it did not need to consider the issue of damages. Thus, the limitation on funding in relation to overseas witnesses, even if it was unjustified, did not limit the plaintiff's capacity to conduct their case in relation to the Commonwealth's liability, which they lost. I think Senator Ellison will appreciate that the court said that you have to establish liability first and then you can go to the quantum.

          â€”I must say something about this matter because some grey issues are involved here. Senator Spindler, for whom I have a great deal of admiration, particularly in the field of civil liberties, has said it is always difficult for an individual to get a fair hearing. The inference in that is that our court system is loaded against those who do not have as much money as those to whom they are opposed in the court. Whether judges can adjust that is a matter of opinion. In my view, the courts struggle and, in most cases, succeed in seeing that justice is done. Nevertheless, if it is the position of those who want this to go ahead that justice is not done in the courts of Australia, so be it. But it is certainly not an inference that I want to be associated with.

          Senator Spindler has said that this will take only a few hours. But what it must be, in effect, is an appeal from the decision that the courts have made. No matter how you try to look at it in any other way, that is it. The Legal and Constitutional References Committee has to inquire into whether an independent inquiry is justified into the conduct of the Commonwealth's actions in relation to Ryker (Faulkner) v. the Commonwealth and Flint and, in particular, the reasons for the severe limitations imposed on the management of Mrs Faulkner's case. I would have thought that a quite nasty reflection upon the counsel appearing for Mrs Faulkner.

          I do not know how the counsel conducted that case. I do not know who the counsel was. But it was certainly conducted in a place where privilege is often misused. It is a very interesting suggestion that somehow her case was not conducted properly.

          In any event, if the Senate is so minded as to cast those sorts of aspersions on the very terms of the motion on Mrs Faulkner's counsel, so be it. All I can say is that it might have been at least reasonable to hear what her counsel and her lawyers had to say before we brought this sort of motion into this chamber. I would have thought it would be a matter of fairness that a professional person would have been given some warning, and perhaps he was, before that sort of imputation was put upon him or herâ€”I am not sure of the sex of the counsel or the solicitor instructing the counsel.

          I would have thought it to beâ€”to use the most mild wordâ€”a most ungenerous approach to the lawyers. Maybe I am not taking that properly. Perhaps that particular section is referring to the severe limitations on the judge. If that is so, again it seems to be a most nasty and unhappy aspersion on the justice who was listening to the cases, Mr Justice Allen. In any event, the Senate seems intent upon pursuing that course. I suppose there is not much that we on this side of the chamber can do about that.

          We have to look at the evidence of the trial. I think Senator Bolkus said this trial took some considerable time. So the Legal and Constitutional References Committee has to look to see whether an independent inquiry is justified into the conduct of the Commonwealth's actions in relation to the case, and in particular to the evidence of the trial. That will involve looking at all the evidence that was put before the trial. We will have no assistance, as I take it, from counsel. We will be getting, as I understand, the views of one side and then making a decision which is very properly a decision that should be made in an appeal court.

What about all the other people who are disappointed and who say they get unfair hearings when further evidence arises later on? Why should they be excluded from this process?

Why do other people have to go through the judicial system to get results when these people can lobby so successfully?

          I am very saddened to hear Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the government, suggesting that the character of a person should be important in deciding whether or not we are careful or particularly careful as to the actions of the Commonwealth in dealing with that person. If we are talking about characters and credibility here, I am horrified to hear a minister getting up and suggesting that the character of a person should determine whether or not we look into whether the Commonwealth has acted correctly. Does that mean somehow that justice is more important for nice people than it is for people who might not be as likeable?

          â€”The government supports this motion, which is to refer the matter of outworkers in the clothing industry to an inquiry of the Senate Economics References Committee. There is notorious exploitation principally of migrant outworkers who often do not have a facility in English, who work under a naked light globe in a back room in suburban Melbourne or Sydney more often that not and who are paid usury wages. The purpose of this motion is to refer an inquiry into that type of exploitation to the committee, and the government supports it.

          The government supports the referral for a number of reasons. Obviously we are opposed to that type of exploitation which falls outside of the reach of the industrial relations system in this country and, therefore, should be properly addressed. Secondly, there are a number of employers in this industry who are respectable and honest employers. While the issue of outworkers remains ill-defined as to who are the culprits, the honest employers get labelled as bad employers while the bad employers tend to get off scot-free. This inquiry will identify who are the baddies and who are the goodies, exonerate the goodies and condemn the baddies. That is an appropriate thing to be done in the public interest.

          â€”I was somewhat surprised to hear Minister Cook talk about the outcome of the inquiry before we have had it. Last Thursday, when Senator Spindler raised this matter in the Senate, both Senator Childs as deputy chair and I as chair of the Senate Economics References Committee indicated that we would oppose the motion put forward by Senator Spindler. I want to make it quite clear that our opposition to that motion was purely the procedure that had taken place for the raising of the matter in the Senate. Senator Spindler, as a full member of the economics committee, had not raised the matter at a committee meeting where it could have had proper discussion by all members of the committee. In that way there could have been some input from all members of the committee into the devising of the terms of reference. That consultation has taken place this week with Senator Spindler, Senator Childs and me and then later at a full committee meeting.

          We were never opposed to the concept of the inquiry because we believe it to be a very important issue. As the minister has said on behalf of the government, and as other coalition members have said, we have always thought it an important issue and, certainly, one worth inquiring into. What we were opposed to at that stage was the procedure that had been followed whereby the matter was raised in the Senate before it had been properly discussed by our committee.

          I think you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, both Senator Childs and I said at that earlier stage that, if the matter was adjourned, it could then be discussed by the committee. So we have come up with revised terms of reference which I think cover all the aspects Senator Spindler wants to raise in that inquiry, and I think, probably through the input of six or seven people on the committee, we have come up with something that is acceptable to everybody.

          The other thing I would like to highlight with regard to the committee, and this also applies to other committees, is that committees themselves at some stage have to have some control over their agenda, the amount of work before the committee and the amount of work put onto the secretariat when there is more than one inquiry proceeding at once. Let me say that the last three references to the economics committee have all been raised in this place before they have gone to the Senate committee for discussion. It just so happens that the last three references have been raised by the Democrats. This has meant that the work the committee wants to doâ€”whether it is work that government members of the committee want to do, references they may want to bring forward, or references coalition members may wish to bring forwardâ€”has all been superseded.

          I must admit that Senator Spindler did speak to me privately about this at the end of June, but we, both government and coalition members of the committee, have not had an opportunity to discuss it. There are areas that members have an interest in and that they would like to develop references on themselves, but in each case they have not been able to do so because of matters raised in the Senate without consultation with the committee as a whole which have been forced upon the committee.

          Let me also say that, in the new terms of reference devised following committee discussion, there is purposely no reporting date in this new, amended motion. That is due to the fact that we have had a reference with regard to telecommunications towards the year 2000â€”this is the last reference that was generated from within the committeeâ€”which we have been hearing for some 18 months. It has had to be pushed aside for other references which have needed urgent inquiry. Although they have been important references, I concede that, unless the committee has some control over its agenda, the good work done by committees in the past will be in danger of losing some significance. I know that applies not only to our committee. It can be said, because of the change in the nature of committees, that some references have been generated in the same way as Senator Spindler has brought this matter forward.

          In closing, let me say that I certainly support this reference. I think it is a very important one, and there are lots of matters that we need to look into. I anxiously await the evidence that might come before the committee. I certainly will not pre-judge what might happen at the committee because we may find out lots of things we now do not know about. The committee is unanimous in its decision that this reference should now go forward in its amended form.

          We should be extremely grateful for the work that committees do to serve the Senate. We must remember that committees have been set up to serve and assist the processes of the Senate. To reject a reference because it has not first been discussed with the committee is a precedent I do not think any of us would want to see brought in because it violates the principle of the democracy of the Senate being able to set its own terms and references. I do not, therefore, object to what has happened here. It is a good example of talking through the problems and working out something with which all members are more pleased.

          This is an important reference. It arises from a report by the TCF union into the practice of outworking in the garment industry both in Melbourne and in Sydney. It is an area of our industrial work that we must pay some attention to. We are rightly critical of the working conditions that obtain in some of the countries which are our trading partners in this region and elsewhere. There is some evidence that in our own backyardâ€”and I use that term advisedlyâ€”working conditions are imposed on people that are anything but fair and just. We must ensure that the conditions for which we have fought for so long in this country are protected. In particular, I have an interest in children under 15 who are being exploited in various industrial contexts overseas. In this case there is some evidence that this may happen in Australia as well.

         â€”When the debate was adjourned yesterday I had finished dealing with one of the four main elements of the bills before us, namely, the restructuring of the Refugee Review Tribunal. The second main element relates to the provision in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of all members of the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. Currently, only the principal members' remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Other members' remuneration details are prescribed by the Migration Act, at SES band 1 levels for full-time members and amounts determined by the minister in writing for part-time members.

         The proposal contained in the bill is to bring the IRT and RRT into line with the arrangements applicable to similar tribunals such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Veterans Review Board. Giving the Remuneration Tribunal the responsibility to set remuneration because it is in line with other tribunals is, therefore, not objectionable in itself, and the coalition supports that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The provision in the bill to deny the Remuneration Tribunal the ability to lower the remuneration for members appointed before 1 July 1995 is, however, at odds with the spirit and purpose of the transfer of the determination of the terms and conditions to an independent assessment body. There is no justification, in our view, for prohibiting the Remuneration Tribunal lowering remuneration if it deems that appropriate, especially when most appointments were made last year for a period of five years and many of those appointments, as we have debated on other occasions in the Senate, were obviously political appointments whereby the minister, Senator Bolkus, was favouring his political mates.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With the provision left intact, if the bill goes through unamended, the Remuneration Tribunal effectively only has the power to grant remuneration increases. The government's justification for this no-downward provision is that it maintains equity between future members, if they get paid more, and also fulfils employment and remuneration conditions entered into by those people at the time of their employment. But the government's position is inherently inconsistent. On the one hand, it talks about preserving conditions applicable at the commencement of the employment. If it wanted to do this, it would make the new Remuneration Tribunal provisions only applicable to new appointments and exempt old ones, who would continue under their existing arrangements.

         On the other hand, it talks about equity between all members, new and old, but will not allow the Remuneration Tribunal to properly implement this by reducing remunerations where it is determined to be appropriate. It may be that the Remuneration Tribunal would never want to reduce terms and conditions of employment. Nevertheless, to prevent it doing so in relation to certain of those appointments is, in our view, inconsistent.

         The granting of additional statutory entitlements to applicants engaging the Immigration Review Tribunal has been a controversial aspect of this bill. The measures proposed in the bill include: the right to appear before the IRT where a hearing occurs; the right to assistance while appearing; the right to an interpreter; and the right to material submitted to the IRT. These measures are in accordance with the recommendations made in December 1992 by the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisionsâ€”a dreadful name for a committeeâ€”otherwise known as the Macphee committee after its Chairman, Ian Macphee.

In that committee hearing, my colleagues Senators Ellison and Abetz, on behalf of the coalition, submitted a dissenting report which, very properly, drew to attention the major concerns the coalition has. The major concern was that we were not convinced that allowing lawyers to address the tribunal would necessarily make it adversarial. As I understand it, that was the essential thrust.

         Presently, it is up to the discretion of a member of the IRT whether a representative of the person appearing before the tribunal may in fact address the tribunal.

That is only one interpretation of Tordo's case.

Not allowing such representation in these circumstances is indefensible.

        I always have great concern when governmentsâ€”and, unfortunately, governments of all persuasions do thisâ€”seek to put in minimum penalties and maximum penalties and do all manner of things to try to restrict those people within the community who have to exercise, for want of a better term, a judicial mind and to try to administer some sort of system of justice.

         If we remove the discretion of tribunals, really we are limiting the range in which tribunal members can operate and restricting their capacity to deliver justice in each and every individual case. Sure, if you take the broad-brush approach you might say, `Yes, it can be arguable,' but, at the end of the day, justice is not about the broad-brush approach; it is about each and every individual that comes before the tribunal, the court or whatever tribunal or body is to make a determination.

         The views of the Law Council of Australia are fairly clear, as was the view of the Bar Association of New South Wales. I do not wish to take any more time of the Senate in this regard, other than to commend the dissenting report of Senator Ellison and myself, and also those parts of Senator Spindler's dissenting report which deal with that one issue I wanted to address today, because it is a matter which is close to my heart. I am genuinely concerned about the way governmentsâ€”might I add, of all persuasions, in all jurisdictionsâ€”seem to be moving in restricting the discretions being given to tribunals and other bodies that are charged with delivering justice and fair outcomes for individual citizens in this country.

         â€”The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994, as the second reading speech by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) pointed out, seeks to make a number of amendments to the Migration Act and to other legislation. There have already been very good comments on, and explanations of, the bill from my colleagues in the chamber, so I will just mention the response of the Greens in relation to some of those. I will start with that part of the bill which, in my opinion, contains the most fundamental aspect of all the measures before us, and it is the one that Senator Abetz has been referring to.

         The bill seeks to limit the powers of the Immigration Review Tribunal in its ability to set its own guidelines for the conduct of hearings. It seeks to alter section 363 of the Migration Act by stating that, if a person is not entitled to do something, then the tribunal does not have the power to permit the person to do that thing. It will remove the tribunal's power to grant a person leave to be represented.

         This amendment is the result of Justice Keely's ruling that the act, while it does not entitle a person to be represented at a tribunal hearing, does not prevent the tribunal from allowing representation. Justice Keely found that the tribunal has wide powers to decide what form of hearing would provide a fair, just, economical, informal and quick review of a case.

         If we look at section 353(1) of the act, we find that the tribunal was set up to provide fair, just, economical, informal and quick review of immigration decisions. If I recall rightly, at the time I was very concerned about some of those terms which may well provide contradictions in terms. We cannot always find justice from the quickest measures; nor can we always find the fairest means through informal means.

         Putting that aside, I cannot help but wonder how the government's aim of hampering the tribunal will assist in ensuring fair and just decision making. Perhaps I am taking too negative a view of the government's motives here, but we are becoming too accustomed to dealing with migration or refugee legislation which is drafted in response to court decisions which the government does not like. In almost every case, the legislation is aimed at limiting the rights of people seeking review of decisions made by government departments. I would have felt more easy if we had been making a change to the law to make explicit that the tribunal should be able to give that leave or allow people to have that leave.

         In this particular case, the government's motives must be even further questioned when we note that this restrictive change is not mentioned in the outline of the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Indeed, the changes to the Immigration Review Tribunal's functions are said:

         The Greens will move an amendment to this provision in the committee stage. We just seek to drop the clause from the bill. I express my regret at already hearing in the chamber that, on balanceâ€”which is a very useful phrase at the momentâ€”the opposition will not be supporting that amendment. I acknowledge the comments made by Senator Abetz, and also referred to in Senator Short's remarks, that it is not a consensus position of the opposition. I could wish that conscience voting would allow greater support for the amendment that I will put and that I understand is included in a range of amendments which will be put by Senator Spindler for the Democrats.

         Other matters in the bill which need to be mentioned at this point include the change whereby the Remuneration Tribunal will be empowered to determine the remuneration of members of the Immigration Review Tribunal and of the Refugee Review Tribunal. I understand that the opposition is opposing two clauses which set certain conditions in this area. I can only regard the opposition's stance on clauses 6 and 7 as part of an economic world view which says that, if a salary can be indexed, it must be able to be indexed downwards as well as upwards. It may well be that certain economic circumstances could arise in which such a course of action could suggest itself. However, these provisions apply only to current members, who will not be members forever.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government's reasoning here seems simple enough: that if, by chance, the Remuneration Tribunal's first determination should set the salary for members of the IRT and RRT at a level lower than that at which the current members are appointed, then they should not be penalised. After all, they have accepted appointment to important positions within the community on terms and conditions put to them in good faith and they have accepted them in good faith. Why should the government now be able to change the rules in an arbitrary fashion?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Furthermore, if the current members' remuneration is higher than that provided for in the first determination of the Remuneration Tribunal, then their remuneration will simply stand still until that which applies to later members catches up in future years. Perhaps the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) could reassure me on that point when the Senate moves into the committee stage. As a result of that, we will not be supporting the opposition's amendments.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At the end of the bill provision is made for the level of certain fees relating to education services to migrants to be indexed. This is in line with the government's desire to have such fees increased automatically over time, reflecting the increased costs of providing the services as measured by some broad economic indicators. Clearly, this is a government policy decision which covers vast areas of service delivery and is similar to the decision made by this government in the early part of its time in office to index such things as certain excise duties and the like.

         A great deal of political heat has been taken out of the government's budget processes as a result. It can be seen as a logical and worthwhile move towards predictability for the community. We had not intended to oppose it in this case, at least in part because of the wider context in which the change is being made. But we will listen to Senator Spindler's comments and arguments in relation to this. The Greens intend, in spite of reservations, to support this bill but we certainly wish that our amendment to the schedule in relation to item 25 will gain some support and some reconsideration from the government, as the opposition seems to have made its stand already.

         â€”I think most of the points raised in the debate so far go to particular aspects of the bill. In the interests of saving time, it might be best if we do not have a long response from me at this stage. For instance, I think Senator Abetz put forward both sides of the argument with respect to the point that he was pursuing. The government comes down on the one side; he comes down on the other. So there are points like that, but I think they could probably be addressed as we go along in the committee stage.

I draw to the attention of the committee the fact that two of these bills, the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Amendment Bill 1994, provide for increases in the charges which may be levied under the principal acts.

          This treatment of the bills appears to arise from the new interpretation adopted by the government during the consideration of taxation legislation in 1993 that a bill is not a bill imposing taxation within the meaning of the constitution unless it levies some new tax and that a bill which increases the amount of the tax is not a bill imposing taxation. The majority of the Senate, in effect, has taken a different view and would, on that view, treat these bills as bills imposing taxation and as therefore requiring requests rather than amendments. This has been drawn to the attention of the government's advisers, but it has been indicated that the government's amendments are still being moved in the form of amendments.

         I think it is a very serious matter, and I know there is a difference of views within the chamber about that. So I ask the government to explain what its motivation is in this regard, because it comes across as highly restrictive of peoples' civil rights; also, it would set a precedent by restricting a tribunal in the powers and the discretion that it should legitimately exercise so as to ensure that the aims of the actâ€”stated there as fair, just, economical and informal, et ceteraâ€”can be carried out properly.

         â€”As I have stated in my speech during the second reading debate, this is an amazing amendment by the government, saying to members of the tribunal, `You may not make certain decisions except in exceptional circumstances.' I ask the minister to explain. Although the term `exceptional circumstances' is mentioned in the bill a little further down, this is really the point at which, even at this stage, the government could remedy this extraordinary provision that is being imposed which removes the discretion of the tribunal that has been appointed to deal with applicants who in some cases may simply not be able to represent themselves properly. If the government were prepared to give a very wide definition to `exceptional circumstances' that may perhaps go towards ameliorating some of the still negative effects that this amendment will have. As it stands the Democrats will certainly oppose item 25.

         â€”Senator Spindler will anticipate that I cannot give him that assurance. Exceptional circumstances have been mentioned, for instance, in my second reading speechâ€”and we are talking about exceptional circumstances. I think the opposition agreed with us in respect of this. I recognise once again that Senator Abetz has a different perspective. Our proposal, our structure, is such that it does not embrace the adversarial approach before the IRT. As a consequence, we limit exceptional circumstances to situations where there are physical or intellectual disabilities or psychiatric conditions, for instance. But we do stick to that approach. It has at its roots the profile that we have of an IRT, which is one that does not work on the adversarial approach. So we do have a difference in starting points in a sense. We have a difference at least on this issue, which I am sorry we cannot resolve.

         â€”I ask the minister why the government is so strongly of the view that just because you involve the right to representation it would necessarily make it adversarial. I am not sure that anything has been put forward by the minister to substantiate that assertion. Secondly, I ask the minister to exercise his mind as to what is the most important thing from the government's point of view. Is it to at all costs ensure that it is non-adversarial or is it more concerned about ensuring those parts of the legislation which require fairness, justice and those sorts of factors?

         I would have thought that a government that allegedly prides itself on social justice and things of that nature would have more concern about effecting a fair and just outcome as opposed to just saying, `Well, we don't like the adversarial system so we will not have it' even if it means that fairness and justice, which ought to be the top priority, cannot be the result. I would like to hear the minister explain why the government is so concerned that it will turn into an adversarial system, what proof he has of that and, even if it were to, what is more importantâ€”the fairness and justice of the situation or for some reason not having any adversarial situation?

         â€”I could go through this at length and traverse issues which have been traversed a number of times in this place and score political points about Senator Abetz's part in this, but I will not do that. All I will say is that we are of the view that once you allow cross examination the system becomes adversarial. Without traversing the whole raft of issues involved in this, let me say to Senator Abetz that the whole structure was intended to be flexible and non-adversarial; one which would allow access to people without their needing to go to lawyers; and one in which the department would not find itself being represented by lawyers before the tribunal as well. As a consequence, it makes the system much more accessible to people who do not have the means to get legal assistance.

         It is all part of the philosophy that we had in setting this up in the first place. It is all part of the philosophy which drove the review in this area, CROSROMD, which made recommendations which further strengthened the general, non-adversarial nature of the tribunal. The government has agreed to pick up recommendations 25 to 28 which go down that route. We can discuss this all you like, but let me place on the record the fact that the opposition is also of the view that the flexibility and access, which are the main features of the system as it now stands, are worthy of protection.

        The three amendments taken together confirm that the tribunal has no power to allow representatives of people before the IRT to give evidenceâ€”unless there are exceptional circumstancesâ€”that people appearing before the tribunal are not entitled to be represented in this way, and that they have no right to examine or cross-examine witnesses before the tribunal. The issue is essentially the same as the one we discussed under item 25â€”that is, that people who are not capable of representing themselves efficiently and effectively should have the opportunity to ask an adviser or an assistant to address the tribunal to make a point clearly and cogently.

         There are provisions for interpreters to be used but we are talking about the case where people are simply not well-versed in administrative procedures and require their case to be put. I believe that that is not within the tradition of Australia's administrative or legal systems. I know the government's motivation is to ensure that these proceedings do not become adversarial, but there is a long step between them becoming adversarial and for some arguments to be put by an adviser if the person herself or himself is unable to do so.

         That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Wednesday, 30 August 1995, of Dame Pattie Maie Menzies GBE, wife of Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister, the late Right Honourable Sir Robert Menzies, and herself a figure held in great affection by many in the Australian community for many decades and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.

        Dame Pattie Menzies was a magnificent Australian and indeed a warm and joyous human being. She managed to combine often potentially conflicting rolesâ€”on the one hand as a politician's spouse and a loving parent of three children and, on the other, to maintain an active involvement in a variety of forms of public life and community service.

         Throughout her long life she never shied away from responsibilityâ€”she was always prepared to put her resources and energy back into the community and the country which had given her so much. She came from a deeply political background. Indeed, her father, like her husband, was a member of both the Victorian and federal parliaments and a minister of the Crown.

         She was enormously supportive of her husband's political career. The expression `behind every great man stands a great woman' is no longer particularly apposite in the current age, but the spirit that lies behind that proposition was never more apt than in her case. Everything that her husband did was discussed with her. She was there when the momentous decisions were made, such as his decision to transfer from state to federal politics.

         Dame Pattie saw both family and community good as very worthwhile aspirations. Her life was devoted to the service of those close to her and those she believed had not been as fortunate as she had. She was therefore prepared on every occasion to make the necessary sacrifices. Those of us who were fortunate enough to see her in action at political functions can always remember the twinkle in her eye and the way in which she was able to make the strategic pause and capture the spirit of the audience. She was not a consummate orator, as undoubtedly was her husband, but nonetheless she was able to read the mood of a meeting. She was able to relate to people both publicly and privately. She was prepared to remain active throughout her long life.

         â€”The government is very pleased to join with the opposition in supporting this very appropriate condolence motion. Dame Pattie was a role model to a very great many Australian women over a long period of extremely distinguished public service. It is absolutely fair to say that she was held by the Australian people generally in great affection and esteem.

         It is recognised that she did play a tremendously supportive role for all those years of marriage to her husband and was a significant influence on him in all sorts of ways. One of the best documented of those influences was the remarks she evidently made by chance to Robert Menzies in 1954. She is recorded as saying, `One hears a lot of talk about rates of pension and so on. But I believe that the greatest social need for old people is that they should have a place of their own to live in. Couldn't you think up some scheme under which the government could subsidise the building of proper accommodation.'

         The immediate and positive outcome of that was the Aged Persons Homes Act, under which a Commonwealth subsidy was provided for institutional accommodation for the aged. Sir Robert Menzies is recorded as saying, I think accurately, that no other of his government's schemes was more widely welcomed by the public or gave that government and the community greater satisfaction. Someone who exercises that kind of very positive and helpful influence is to be much admired and much applauded.

I extend our sincere sympathy for yesterday's passing away of Dame Pattie Menzies at the great age of 96. For over 50 years, Dame Pattie has been one of the most admired women in our nation. The reverence in which she was held by the Liberal Party is demonstrated by the standing ovation she received when she attended the Liberal Party's 50th anniversary last year. Liberal Party president, Tony Staley, extolled her great contribution to the party and nation, calling her a great woman, one of our great wives and one of our great mothers. That is a heartfelt sentiment with which we here would all concur.

         Dame Pattie was born to a life of politics. Her father served as both a state and federal member of the parliament, and when she met Sir Robert at the local Presbyterian Church her fate to hold a central role in Australian political life was sealed. Dame Pattie was a source of great strength to Sir Robert when his early political career faulted with his resignation as Prime Minister in 1941. She provided unstinting support, loyalty and hard work when his career made its magnificent resurgence in 1949.

         She made a great contribution to Australia, firstly, in her role of supporting Sir Robert Menziesâ€”Australia's longest serving Prime Ministerâ€”and later for her community and charity work in helping the underprivileged and disadvantaged. Dame Pattie was awarded a GBE in 1954 in recognition of her tireless and unselfish work, and her tireless nursing of Sir Robert when he had a stroke in the early 1970s. We in the National Party extend our sympathy to her family.

She obviously exercised that power in the gracious way that only women in that situation can. She always exercised the power for good.

         I had the pleasure of meeting Dame Pattie Menzies on innumerable occasions, but last year I introduced her to a young friend of mine who was a first-year student at university at the time. Dame Pattie engaged her in a very long conversation and started off by asking, `What are you doing?' And she said, `I'm doing linguistics, Dame Pattie.' Dame Pattie and this young friend had a long conversation about language and the importance of studying language and languages. I am not sure that every 95-year-old would be as able to carry on a conversation with a young person of that age group about linguistics.

So she had a sense of humour that stayed with her right until the very end. I think it is a great example to all of us of how somebody in their latter years can still live with great vigour and vitality. I wish to extend my deep sympathy to Heather, her daughter, to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and other members of her family.

         â€”The Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill is essentially non-controversial legislation. It seeks to allow the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to play a role in the functioning of the community by transferring the land back to the community so that the Jervis Bay National Park can effectively be operated by the local Aboriginal community but, for all practical purposes, will continue in the way that it operates at the present time. So it will remain a national park.

         There is power in the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act, as I recall, for the minister to actually direct that to happen if it does not. Otherwise, it is a 99-year lease which will give the Aboriginal community invaluable experience in the operational aspects of control of the park. We, therefore, regard it as a positive step. Perhaps I could simply say that we will be supporting the amendments that have been circulated in the name of the Australian Democrats.

         â€”I wish to speak very briefly on the Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill. There were originally some concerns expressed by residents of the area that this may well pose some kind of threat to their traditional rights, if you like, to fishing in the areaâ€”this is the non-Aboriginal residents of the regionâ€”because there has been a great deal of visitation to the area by those people who recognise its beauty and its potential for recreational fishermen. But I think the way this matter has been handled has resolved any of those problems which have emerged. I understand that the Mayor of Shoalhaven has carried out some investigations in the region and established that there are no problems. This is, of course, an area that comes under the control of the ACT.

         I do want to raise one little matter that is of concern to some Aboriginal people working in this area, and that is that employees of the National Parks and Wildlife Service are entitled to housing. I think there are about eight Aboriginal families who have an employee member of the family working either for the National Parks and Wildlife Service or for the administration in that area and who are entitled to housing in the area. The problem that emerges is what will happen to those Aboriginal people who are entitled to housing when they cease, by retirement or by some other measure such as redundancy, to be employed.

         The reason I ask this question is that there is a shortage of housing in the area. As I understand it, there is something of a waiting list to get into the Wreck Bay housing facility, which is an Aboriginal housing facility. All I am raising with the government is whether the problems facing those Aboriginal employees of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in this area could be examined. I do not know what the right solution is, but I know that some Aboriginal people there that I have spoken to recently have concerns about their future accommodation in the event of their retirement from employment, which carries with it the entitlement to housing.

It is the right path to take, and that path is leading us to a number of different forms of management of the land. One of those ways is to have joint management in some areas like Uluru and Kakadu. The Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 that we are debating today provides the mechanism for the next step in joint management of part of Jervis Bay National Park and Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens.

         They aim to clarify the processes that have come about as a result of the community's experience in dealing with the principal act. We believe our amendments will assist the community to operate more efficiently and more reasonably. For example, our amendments will allow the community to take action with regard to community needs like housing, education and social welfare. Our amendments will enable the community to undertake capital works, to protect and conserve natural and cultural sites on Aboriginal land, manage their land, conduct business enterprises and plan their land use needs. Our amendments will enable the community to refrain from seeking ministerial approval for amounts under $100,000. We are talking about a community which is organising sewerage, housing and other infrastructure contracts.

         At the outset, I would like to make the point that I share the concern of Senator Kernot that the residents of Jervis Bay, who have come today to listen to this legislation, are not able to see it taken through to finality. It ought to be realised that the reason for that is, given the amendments which have been proposed, that there is an agreement that amendments will not be processed at this time of day, which is principally set aside for non-controversial legislation. Therefore, unfortunately, by the government choosing to bring it on at this particular point, it is unable to be properly processed. It is through no fault of those of us on this side of the parliament. In fact, it should have been listed at a more appropriate time on the program.

         However, I want to specifically address those aspects of the legislation that relate to Norfolk Island. There are clauses within this bill that set out to extend new and certain provisions to enable inquiries into the provision of reports to the minister on application made by Norfolk Island to the commission for a grant of special assistance, and any matter relating to a grant, or the making of a grant of financial assistance, by the Commonwealth to Norfolk Island, referred to it by the minister. Secondly, it requires the commission to inquire into and report to the minister on any matter relating to the financing of works and services provided by the Commonwealth, or a Commonwealth authority, to an external territory other than Norfolk Island, referred to it by the minister.

         I think it is important to recognise that we have a very special and unique relationship between the Australian parliament and the government of Norfolk Island. This is historical; it is based on a very long and negotiated special arrangement. Anybody who is familiar with the budget appropriations of the federal parliament will know that Norfolk Island makes very little demand and, in fact, operates on special financial arrangements, unique and very different to those that apply at our other external territories of Cocos (Keeling) Island and Christmas Island, where very generous and extensive financing is, in particular, made available. Therefore, the provision of an inquiry in this area must necessarily take into account the needs and the issues of Norfolk Islanders.

         On the 6th July 1995 the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories passed to the Norfolk Island Government (NIG) (through the Administrator) a copy of the Bill. The extension of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 was discussed at a recent Inter-Government Meeting between the Parliamentary Secretary for Territories, Mr Snowdon, and the NIG. At that meeting the NIG emphasized that the self governing status of Norfolk Island should be taken into account in any amendments, that the changes should include a clause to permit the Commission to respond to any future application for special assistance initiated by the NIG, and that no reference to Norfolk Island matters will be undertaken without prior consultation with, and agreement by, the NIG.

         The proposal on the land grant and lease-back follows the model established for Uluru National Park. This model includes legislative compulsory lease-back whereby the council is obliged to give a lease for continued management of the granted land as a national park. A board of management with a majority of representatives of the traditional Aboriginal owners will be established to oversee management of the park and gardens. Overseeing development of a plan of management to the area will be, of course, a major task of the board. Extensive public involvement in the development of the plan is required under the legislation. The legislation amends the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to enable the minister to establish a board for the national park and botanic gardens if they are declared to be Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal land grant act, and if agreement is reached with the council, of course.

The proposed amendments will place Norfolk Island in the same position as the states and territories in respect of the Grants Commission survey. In that sense, the Grants Commission can be said to be an auditor and a determinator of the level of Commonwealth assistance. As mentioned, the coalition will be supporting this bill.

         The reality is that this bill is yet another sham perpetrated by this government on Aboriginal people. The bill grants title of the Jervis Bay National Park and Botanic Gardens to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council who are then required, under the legislation, to lease their land back to the Commonwealth for the purpose of a national park. Existing legal rights of land-holders and public rights for use are preserved. A management plan is to be prepared under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. As it did over Mabo, the government is paying lip service to Aboriginal self-determination, while entrenching existing land title and placing paternalistic limits on the ability of Aboriginal people to manage their own land and affairs.

         The Greens (WA) are appalled that the government finds itself incapable of coming to terms with the true nature of self-determination. This bill shows that it is utterly unwilling to return land back to its original owners, full stop. Instead, the land is returned but must then be leased back. Existing titles are maintained and a management regime is established under yet another act. Why is it that the government cannot grant land to Aboriginal people without the spectre of mistrust and suspicion hanging in the background? Reconciliation will never advance beyond its infant stage without non-indigenous people making unequivocal acts of trust in Aboriginal people.

         This bill not only fails to give the members of the Aboriginal community control over their land and activities; it also fails to affirm their enormous wisdom and skill in the management of the land up till now. Thus the bill requires a management regime to be established under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. On top of this, the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council's operation continues to be controlled by the act, including the insulting requirement that spending decisions over $1,000 must be approved by the minister. I might add here that this is not money that is given by the government; this is the money they have earned in their own right. They require approval by the minister for any spending decisions over $1,000. Is this what the government means by self-determination? I will be moving an amendment later, in the committee stage, to eliminate this requirement.

         The Greens have listened to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community and understand that they want to see this bill passed. Because of this, we will not be opposing the legislation. However, if the government wants the community to believe that it is committed to reconciliation, it must show in the future a much greater level of trust and understanding of Aboriginal people than is contained in this bill.

         â€”The Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995 seeks to bring the Queensland Industry Development Corporationâ€”the QIDC, as it is knownâ€”under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia by listing it under the definition of a bank in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959. The Queensland government has sought this measure to improve the accountability of the QIDC. The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power as it relates to the state financial institutions, in this case the QIDC, to the Commonwealth. This will ensure that the QIDC is required to follow the provisions of and is subject to the supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to prudential matters.

         The coalition will not be opposing this bill but I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the bill is not without some controversy in Queensland itself. The reason is that the Goss Labor government in Queensland, when it passed complementary legislation last year for the QIDC to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank, gave assurances that the QIDC would not become a bank. However, declaring the QIDC a bank under section 5 of the Commonwealth Banking Act will give it a complete range of banking powers. So what we have got is the fact that the Goss government gave quite misleading assurances last year that the QIDC would not become a bank.

         When one looks at the absolutely disastrous records of some other state Labor governments in managing state banks, one can only have cause for some concern that the consequence of all of this is that the Queensland Industry Development Corporation will, in fact, become a full state bank. In my own state, Victoria, we saw a Labor government, in the 1980s and early 1990s, absolutely wreck the State Bank of Victoria through gross incompetence and, in some instances, worse. We saw the same situation in South Australia with the State Bank of South Australia.

         â€”The Trade Marks Bill 1995 repeals and replaces the Trade Marks Act 1995 and the Trade Marks Act 1994. The bill derives from an exposure draft of the Trade Marks Bill 1994 which the government released, and on which it invited public comment, in February 1994. The 1994 bill sought to implement the government's response to the July 1992 report of the working party to review trade marks legislation, entitled

         Before the results of public consultation could be included, the government decided to introduce the Trade Marks Bill 1994 as part of the package of legislation enacted last December to ensure that Australia met its obligations under the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation. However, in so doing, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) indicated that the government would amend the new act at the earliest opportunity to incorporate the results of that process of consultation. Due to the extensive nature of the changes that would be necessary to amend the Trade Marks Act 1994, the government has decided that it is now simpler and more convenient to repeal the 1994 act and replace it with a new consolidated bill which we now have before us. The Trade Marks Act 1994 has not yet come into effect.

         The bill proposes a new and wider definition of a trade mark. As a result, it will now be possible to register sounds, smells and aspects of packaging as trade marks provided that all other requirements are met. The bill also streamlines existing procedures under the trade marks system. In particular, it is proposed to introduce a system of multi-class applications which will eliminate the need for separate applications for each class of goods or services for which registration is sought. In addition, the bill includes simplified provisions for recording the assignment of trade marks and a more streamlined method of removing unused trade marks from the register.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In line with the 1994 act, the bill proposes that the distinction between part A and part B of the trade marks register be removed. Under the existing system the register is divided with trade marks registered under part B accorded more limited rights than those in part A. There were a number of members of the 1992 working party who recommended retention of a divided register and, according to the minister's second reading speech, a minority of submissions to the working party also supported that view. Nevertheless, the government has opted to pursue a unified register with all trade marks accorded the same level of protection currently afforded by part A registration.

         Whilst the bill differs from the 1994 act, mainly in matters of clarity and technical detail, there are two key areas of more substantive difference which are worthy of comment. Firstly, whilst the 1994 act sought to streamline existing provisions dealing with associated trade marks, the new bill proposes to do away with the concept of associated trade marks altogether. According to the minister's second reading speech, this measure is in line with submissions received during the public consultation process and is consistent with the situation in most other industrialised nations.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other area of more substantive difference from the 1994 act is that the new bill does not include provisions relating to the registration of the use of the trade mark by a person other than the trade mark owner. Instead, the bill provides for use of trade marks by persons other than the registered owner provided that the owner retains control over the use of the trade mark. According to the government, the World Trade Organisation agreement does not require use under control of the owner to be registered and, consequently, it is said there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users. The change also simplifies existing legislation by eliminating part 11 of the 1994 act.

         â€”I would like to make some very brief comments, not in relation to the technical detail but to the processes involved in arriving at the point we have reached today. In essence, the Trade Marks Bill 1995 is an update of the Trade Marks Bill 1994 which was passed into law by the Senate last December. The bill we dealt with then was part of a very large package of trade bills which were introduced in order to enable Australia to accept the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, which was an agreement to which the government was very keen to be a founding signatory. The Democrats did not agree with the rush to sign the World Trade Organisation agreement because of the blind faith it puts in free trade ahead of fair trade. But that is now a past debate; that is past history. We are in there, although I believe the consequences have not yet been fully felt.

         The 1994 Trade Marks Bill was drafted so as to be consistent with standards and principles prescribed for trade marks contained in the WTO agreement. It replaced the Trade Marks Act 1995 and was due to come into effect on 1 January 1996. However, in the rush to enable us to sign the WTO agreement, the government was actually forced to table and have the parliament pass an exposure draft of the bill, with which we are currently dealing. The exposure draft became the Trade Marks Bill 1994.

         The bill we now have, the Trade Marks Bill 1995, is the final, completed version of the bill. It has been updated to reflect the outcome of consultation with the trade marks community, and it will repeal and replace last year's bill. This final bill represents the culmination of a process which began as long ago as March 1989 when the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, authorised a working party comprising representatives of the Trade Marks Office, the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and the Law Council of Australia to review and streamline the trade marks legislation. That working party released a discussion paper for public comment in July 1991 and its final paper, glamorously called, `Recommended changes to the Australian trade mark legislation', in July 1992.

         From that point, there came the draft legislation. It was widely circulated and an extensive process of consultation occurred under the auspices of the Trade Marks Office. The bill does reflect that consultation. I believe that the government is to be congratulated for the considerable amount of work and discussion and participation that has gone into developing the bill to this stageâ€”if only it happened all the time. In particular, I would like to congratulate the Trade Marks Office, which made sure that it did happen.

         We do not have 100 per cent agreement on the final bill, but it certainly is very widely accepted. The major problem, as we see it, is the inclusion of aspects of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent in the definition of a trade-markable sign. We understand this is included to make the legislation consistent with what is described to us as international practice. It seems, however, to the Democrats that adding aspects of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent to the definition of a trade-markable sign only adds to a marketer's capacity to capture market share by gaining control over forms of sensory manipulation, rather than forcing them to provide anything more concrete by way of producing something really new or valuable. Manufacturers and marketeers will have their products protected by labelling and other definitions in this bill. We do not believe that they need any more.

We therefore recommend this bill to the Senate.

         â€”The introduction of this bill is not opposed by the opposition. It will modernise the trade mark regime. The current regime was enacted in 1955, some 40 years ago. It would be noted by even the most casual observer of trade and technology that there have been significant developments in the intervening 40 years. This bill has its genesis in the research undertaken by the working party to review trade marks legislation. The working party reported in 1992. The government, in response, produced a draft exposure bill two years later which, in effect, implemented the government's response.

         Whilst the public consultation was still in progress, the government decided to introduce the Trade Marks Bill 1994. It undoubtedly did this because of its self-perceived need to fulfil its obligations to the World Trade Organisation. However, the public consultation process resulted in so many amendments that the government, quite properly, decided to, in effect, withdraw the 1994 bill and proceed with this particular bill.

There is other material on the public record about this bill which does not need to be repeated. I note that the bill will eliminate provisions that may have the effect of diluting the level of accountability between owners and other users of trade marks.

         The reason I want to raise this matter is that `Tarkine' is not the recognised name of a geographic area within my home state of Tasmania. It was a name invented by certain elements within the green movement to try to establish some credibility for having the Arthur-Pieman region of my home state listed on the Australian heritage list. It clearly was a propagandistic name and had no geographic basis whatsoever. Indeed, the Tasmanian Nomenclature Board did not recognise it.

         The Trade Marks Office itself, of course, did not recognise it, and that is why it initially allowed the registration of that name.

No entry was located to indicate that `Tarkine' failed to qualify as a trade mark because of its identity as a geographic name.

         But then, undoubtedly, certain pressures were brought to bear, because of the federal government's pursuit of having the Arthur-Pieman region in my home state listed. This region is one where there have been townships of in excess of 2,000 people, and where considerable mining, agriculture and forestry operations have taken place, over many decades. So, to try to beef up the claim to have this listed on the Australian heritage listing, a new name had to be developed.

         A name was then developed by picking on a versionâ€”not even a proper name but a version of a nameâ€”of the name of an Aboriginal band that lived in the area. They were the Tarkinimma band, and theirs was only one of very many bands that traversed the area which is known as the Arthur-Pieman region. Indeed, they were mainly coastal Aboriginals, only went round to about 10 miles inland and, basically, survived on seafood. But, in insisting that they wanted to get some good-sounding name, the name `Tarkine' was used by those supporting the listing of the Arthur-Pieman region, so they tried to call this area `the Tarkine region'.

The Trade Marks Office people told me in the answer that they provided that information came to light that Tarkine does have geographic value. It is used to denominate an area of wildernessâ€”once again, they have made a value judgment that it is wilderness; how and why they have done that, I do not knowâ€”in north-west Tasmania between the Arthur and Pieman Rivers.

         â€”This area of trade marks comes under the heading of intellectual property, which has more importance than most people would realise. The question of trade marks is relevant both to the consumer and to the business involved, particularly small businesses which perhaps use trade marks more often in the course of their daily commercial activities. A trade mark is a word or symbol used to identify the trade source of goods or services. Thereby the consumer relies on that, and the vendor or the retailer relies on that mark as being something which is identified in the marketplace and something upon which that business hangs its hat in order to sell its goods. As I said, it is part of the area of intellectual property where you have such things as designs, patents and trade names. Sometimes it is hard to define the differences between them.

         The common law recognised the action of passing off, which is a situation where you pass off someone else's goods as your own. There was an action allowed to an individual, based on either deceit or false pretence, in relation to that. It was allowed for very good reasons, because someone had the thought and went to the effort of coming up with a design or a trade mark and, of necessity, had to have protection for having endeavoured to come up with that. Similarly, the consumer needed that protection because the consumer needed to know that what he or she was buying was in fact that article which was for sale and was not the property of another person.

         This Trade Marks Bill 1995 repeals and replaces the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Trade Marks Act 1994. The coalition is aware of the problems being faced by the owners of registered trade marks and the complexity of issues arising from the sale of Australian products in an ever increasing international market and, therefore, does not oppose the bill. As previous speakers have mentioned, this bill came about as a result of Australia's obligations under the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and, in particular, the sub-agreement entitled `The agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights'. This is an aspect where perhaps an international instrument is of great value domestically to Australia because, in this sense, it provides a minimum standard for intellectual property protectionâ€”thereby protecting Australian products, I believe.

         The definition, as has been mentioned previously, has been widened. I understand from the paper done by the parliamentary library that the current definition did have its problems. The present definition which is contained in the Trade Marks Act 1955 has limitations because it does not expressly convey the requirement that the trade mark must be distinctive. Also the definition is ambiguous because it refers to a connection by an infringer with the owner of a registered trade mark.

         As I understand it, clause 17 of this bill remedies those defects, and allows for signs which can include a shape, colour, sound or scent provided that the identifier can be represented graphically. Under the new definition, these features of a product will be protected, and I think that is to be applauded. The new definition is simple and easily understandable. In fact, I would compliment the drafters of this bill in the setting out of the explanatory guide at the beginning of the bill, and then the flow chart, done by way of an appendix, which sets out how to obtain the registration of a trade mark. I believe that that is an innovation which the Commonwealth is using more and more these days, and it is one which I applaud.

         The bill generally seeks to streamline the process for registration of trade marks, and introduces a system of multi-class applications which will eliminate the need for separate applications for each class of goods or services for which registration is sought. That, too, is a good thing. It removes the distinction between types of trade marks. At present, you have two categories A and B, and the bill removes that distinction and accords all trade marks the same protection at the higher level under the old system. That also is a reform. I understand that the financial impact of this bill will not be great by means of implementation, but the gains that remain to be enjoyed by the business community, and the consumers of Australia in general, are very great indeed. I support wholeheartedly this bill, as does the coalition.

         â€”This is one of those areas where it is simple for a person to become submerged in the complexities of the legislation and find they have accepted the reasoned and basic view. It is useful, from time to time, to surface and look at what the act does and why. Trade marks have one primary function which is to distinguish the product of one manufacturer from the product of others. There are two reasons to do this. One is because a person may want people to know that the product is yours so that, if they like it, they can buy it again. It is a basic method of ensuring that, when a producer puts the time and effort into a product to make it a good product, consumers can identify that product and buy it again. It protects the interests of producer and consumer.

         This is a fairly simple and straightforward issue. A label or some other identifying mark can be used that means customers can find that product when they look.

         The second reason for having a trademark is so that a person can take a product which is little different from any other, or of little inherent value, and promote it through advertising using the full range of psychological marketing techniques.

         Going back to the first case, the one the moral argument for trade marks rests upon, we would have to say that where a product is functionally superiorâ€”whether that means it works better, tastes better, smells better or makes your cat happierâ€”people will look at that product, identify it for themselves and seek it out. If there is a similar product that is not as good, they will remember that as well. As long as there is a label of some sort, the consumer will do the differentiation. All that is needed is that label.

Because they would not notice a difference, they might not pay any attention to whether a thing is Coke or Pepsi. Coke might lose sales. If, Ricardo forbid, it were not Pepsi, but Amrit Cola in Bombay, or Black and Gold from the supermarket sold at half the cost, people might buy Amrit or the generic brand because it is cheaper, as long as they can still partake of the whole hip, cool image that has been marketed effectively independent of the qualities of coke as a drink.

         The issue is that, while a label is enough to ensure that consumers can identify a product, it may not be enough to exclude others from all the benefits of this marketing. But is the reason for trade marks to exclude others from marketing of products, like coke, which are in fact no better than most other productsâ€”products which are unnecessary, unhealthy and which cost a lot? And this is a real issue amongst the poor and among developing countries. There is evidence in many countries that the aggressive marketing of cola drinks has been so successful that people buy these products, which are very expensive relative to their income, and that they buy these products to try to give some part of the image which was created to their children. They buy them at the expense of food. It is a phenomenon known as cola malnutrition syndrome.

         â€”I am glad you are in here today for the condolence motion. I am very grateful to you. I am sorry you were not here for the bulk of the morning. Minister, yesterday you revealed that you have expressed serious concerns about human rights abuses in the Freeport mine area of Irian Jaya to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas. Is it a fact, however, that the Prime Minister has refused to do likewise when he meets President Suharto because he concedes that he simply could not refute allegations that the Aboriginal community has been denied basic human rights:

        Putting aside this plea of guilty in relation to your government's failure to tackle the real problems afflicting the Aboriginal community of Australia, why shouldn't President Suharto simply conclude that, whilst you have gone through the proper motions, the Prime Minister is simply not serious about alleged human rights abuses in Irian Jaya?

         As to whether the Prime Minister raises this or any other human rights issue when he meets President Suharto, that is a matter for his judgment. The Prime Minister's working visit to Indonesia on 17 September is basically for discussions with President Suharto on our important shared interests in APEC and achieving a good result at the leaders' meeting in Osaka in November, and a vast range of bilateral and regional issues.

         It is not normally the practice to identify publicly in advance a full agenda of the issues that will be raised for discussion. It is the Prime Minister's practice not to be specific about all the matters that he raises. He does make clear however, and has made clear on many occasions, that his discussions with the President of Indonesia, which have now taken place on several occasions, cover all the dimensions of our relationship. I stress the word `all'. The Prime Minister has in the past discussed human rights questions but the subjects that he discusses with him are not set by the media, and the Prime Minister is not inclined to preview the course of his talks in public. It would often be unproductiveâ€”indeed counterproductiveâ€”to do so, particularly when sensitive questions are involved.

         â€”Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The only problem with all that is that you say that the Prime Minister's discussions will cover all issues, which presumably is meant to incorporate human rights issues. But the Prime Minister himself says he won't. He says, `Why should I, because they might ask me about human rights abuses?' Surely that sends the worst possible signal to the Indonesians: why should they not regard it as simply a second-order issue if the Prime Minister of this country is not prepared to raise that matter with his opposite number? What advice have you given him? Have you told him that it is appropriate for him to make sure that he communicates the concerns you have put down in public, or have you simply told him, `Nudge, nudge; wink, wink. Don't worry. You don't have to worry about that issue. You talk about the more important things to you'? Is that the advice you have given him?

         â€”My question is directed to Senator Cook in his capacity as Minister representing the Treasurer. My question is prompted by the national accounts figures which were released by the ABS yesterday. Is it correct that in the June quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, the economy recorded year-on-year growth of 3.7 per cent? If so, this seems to indicate that we have had not only quite a few minutes of growth but many quarters and indeed years now. Fortunately, this positive situation conflicts with a great deal of talking down of the economy in some circles. Could the minister inform the Senate of the true nature and extent of the growth as demonstrated in the national accounts?

Anyone that opened any newspaper today would see that universally, across the board, all newspapers have hailed the publication of yesterday's national accounts as indicating a very strong and sustainable growth path for the Australian economy. Indeed, it makes a joke and a total mockery of the jibe by the opposition leader, Mr Howard, about five minutes of economic sunshine. We have in fact had many years of economic sunshine.

         The good story here is that the Australian economy is continuing to grow, and grow on sustainable growth paths. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of growth; that is to say, four consecutive years of economic growth for Australia. It equals the record since quarterly estimates commenced in 1959; that is to say, a record not surpassed for 3 1/2 decades. It is a record and an achievement of which Australia, Australian business and Australian workers can be proud. It is a record for all Australians to be proud of.

         While the government does recognise that some people are still doing it tough out there, this sort of sustainable growth represents the light at the end of the tunnel for many of them. You can only get rising living standards across the board if you get this sort of sustained economic growth. You certainly will not get it by sitting back and denigrating the efforts of Australian business, by producing artificial rhetoric about the battlers and without any policies whatsoever, as is the case with the opposition, to deliver any sort of economic outcome. You will not get it by the blundering doorstop interviews that Peter Costello, the shadow Treasurer, did yesterday in which he made a complete goose of himself by not being able to answer direct reporters' questions on the state of the Australian economy.

Inflation continues to hover at a low level, around 2 1/2 per cent. These are all figures and achievements of which Australians, as I said, should be proud.

It is a matter of judgment as to whether you regard it as reasonable that someone should be required to wait for the payment of their legal bills for up to nearly a year after those expenses have, in fact, been incurred, because if we have to wait for the formal appropriation to take place in the April-May budgetary contextâ€”that legislative authority, presumably, would not be in place until the end of June, if it is not to be regarded as urgentâ€”the payment would not be able to be made until next year. In all the circumstances that is so manifestly unreasonable in terms of the legal creditors that would be here involved that there would be, unequivocally, an element of urgency such as to meet the normal way in which that particular test is applied.

         `Urgent'just means in the normal course of governmental business or in the normal course of decency is required to be paid sooner rather than later. Of course, anyone who is a debtor can say there is no urgency about paying a bill that is due to a creditorâ€”`Just let the creditor wait.' If you adopt that particular brand of morality, which is equivalent to every other brand of morality you have on parade in this place, then you might come to that conclusion. But I would like to see the person who wrote that adviceâ€”the QC, the silk, whoever it wasâ€”taking the view that he is perfectly happy to wait up to more than a year for his bills to be paid. If he is prepared to accept the logic of that particular statement, I would be very surprised indeed.

Indeed, farmers are in an absolutely critical period nowâ€”if the crops do not get a drink in the next two to three weeks they will die. It was very soul-destroying for the farmers concerned in having their hopes raised, along with the rest of us, earlier this year with the rain that allowed them to plant the crop and finding the follow-up rains, to this point in time anyway, not having fallen.

         The drought declarations in New South Wales were in fact falling. Unfortunately, we are now in the situation where they could increase to 80 per cent of the state in the next couple of weeks if it does not rain. I spoke to the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, yesterday about the situation. I reiterated to Mr Carr the Prime Minister's pledge that federal financial assistance to farming families will continue as long as it is needed. The Prime Minister also made this clear in public statements which he issued along the same lines in Sydney yesterday.

         It contains significant policy differences to that of the government and that is why we did not adopt it.

         None of those policies would ever seriously be considered, let alone adopted, by this government. The return of severe drought to the natural disaster relief arrangements is completely at odds with the national drought policy re-endorsed by the Commonwealth and all state governments, both Labor and conservative, only two weeks ago in Perth. One of the fundamental reasons we will not adopt the coalition's drought policy todayâ€”and this should be of interest to Senator Sandy Macdonald, as a senator from New South Walesâ€”is that we would have to cut off thousands of families from drought relief tomorrow using that criteria.

         There has been no definitive response even on the question of fees incurred before the commission, at least not one that I was aware of a couple of days ago when I last checked that particular matter. In that respect, she has ample grounds for complaint as does the Commonwealth that this matter is still unresolved as she continues to incur expenses day by day. One hopes that the Western Australian government will meet its obligations in that respect whether under those guidelines or under anything else.

         So far as the additional costs that have been incurred in collateral proceedings, I am not aware whether there were any collateral proceedings in those earlier cases or whether the question has ever previously risen in WA. It has certainly risen in plenty of other jurisdictions. Mr Greiner went off to the courts to challenge the jurisdiction of ICAC as that affected him in New South Wales, and that tab was picked up by the Liberal government in New South Wales. It was certainly the case in Tasmania that when Mr Gray went off on a collateral frolic to challenge the jurisdiction of the Rouse royal commission, that tab was picked up by the government in question. Where there have been precedents of which I have been aware in other jurisdictions, the tab has been picked up.

         There is nothing magic about guidelines. The guidelines are only a guide, as their appearance implies. It is a matter entirely for the discretion of the government of the day whether it ranges beyond those and makes a separate ad hoc payment. The guidelines that exist at the Commonwealth level, as we have made clear and which were the subject of a great deal of fulmination and carry on earlier on, were guidelines that applied only to defence of legal proceedings properly so calledâ€”criminal matters and civil litigation. They are silent on the question of royal commissions.

         â€”I address my question to Senator Bolkus representing Duncan Kerr, the Minister for Justice. I refer to claims by Mr Eoin Cameron, the member for Stirling, that his office was raided by Australian Federal Police as a result of a complaint by me and that the raid was politically motivated. Conscious as I am of the proper reluctance of the Australian Federal Police to comment on operational matters, I ask the minister whether he is able to confirm: first, that I made no specific complaint to the Australian Federal Police about Mr Cameron; second, that the execution of the search warrant was as a result of the AFP's own inquiries and investigations; and, third, that such warrants are only issued and executed with the most careful, proper and serious consideration.

         â€”I want to pick up on part of Senator Crichton-Browne's question. It is, of course, normal policy not to confirm or deny whether a particular matter is under investigation. In this case, I can say that the AFP have already publicly confirmed that they are investigating complaints made by you. I am advised that the complaint was made on 15 June 1995 and that, as publicised already, it relates to threatening facsimile messages. As for individuals, Senator Crichton-Browne, I think you would understand that I am not able to comment on the specific details of your complaint, including against whom that complaint was made.

         With respect to the search warrants, I can say that in the course of their investigations into your complaint the AFP have executed search warrants. The seeking of search warrants is not a matter lightly undertaken by the police, as everyone here would understand. I am unable to comment on the specifics of the investigation. I can say that the process for obtaining search warrants is governed by statutory provisions and, of course, a significant amount of case law. The police must have sufficient information to satisfy a justice of the peace or a magistrate that a search warrant should be issued. They are not easily obtained, they are subject to challenge in court and they need to be based on adequacy of evidence. They also need to be exercised and executed in accordance with strict legal requirements.

         I also cannot comment on the specific details of any particular search warrant executed by the AFP in the course of their investigation. I am advised, however, that in relation to your complaint the AFP is investigating possible breaches of section 85ZE of the Crimes Act 1914 which relates to harassing or menacing via telecommunications services and section 28 of the Crimes Act 1914 which relates to interfering with political liberty. As I said, Senator Crichton-Browne, I cannot go to specifics as against whom the complaint was made and operational details, but I can give you that framework of operation which governs the Australian Federal Police in matters like this.

He is one of many voices in a long and extensive chorus of criticism in this area. I am also aware of the Morris committee report on aspects of youth homelessness. The Youth Bureau in the Department of Employment, Education and Training has responsibility for coordinating the preparation of the response to this report. That response is due by the end of the year. In respect of the federal government's response to this particularly important and sensitive area, I think the senator would appreciate that the way to tackle this particular problem is through diverse policy initiatives. I will get for him from the relevant ministers a coordinated answer on those problems which go, for instance, to initiatives through the justice statement, initiatives on child abuse, initiatives on youth homelessness and the like. Hopefully I will be in a position to give you that answer very soon.

         We take our obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child seriously. That is why, in 1993, we decided that the convention should be an international instrument for the purposes of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. As such, the commission can now inquire into Commonwealth acts, practices and legislation that are inconsistent or contrary to that convention. The commission can also conduct research on the basis of that instrument. We have no current intention of legislating the Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic law, I can say that as well. With respect to most of your question, Senator, I will take that part on notice, and I will come back to you with the raft of initiatives the government has taken on a wide range of policy areas.

In view of this very disturbing evidence, does the government still maintain its charade that the AFP's investigations of matters arising from Operation Wallah was, to quote Minister Kerr, `thorough and entirely proper'? Why should the public not agree with eminent criminologist Professor Paul Wilson that, `It seems investigations into powerful political figures are not pursued with the same vigour as those involving the average citizen'?

         The Pitney Bowes $88 million will be over four years and will include the export of mailing equipment and systems and local development of hardware and software. This activity will substantially increase their overall level of activity in Australia and will concentrate several of their international-regional activities in Australia. The second agreement, with the Dell corporation, is committed to developing Australian information technology by investing and exporting from Australia. They will be employing an additional 46 people over four years, to meet the advantage of the $39 million they are investing as a corporation. Olivetti will be putting in $19 million, creating an additional 40 to 50 high technology jobs as part of the company's overall push in the marketplace.

It has gone for over one hour and 10 minutes and that is longer than any other question time, with 28 questions being asked. Why don't you admit you blew it? The government will oppose the suspension of standing orders.

        â€”Senator Faulkner cast some doubts on opposition motives. I do not even direct any comments to them at all. It is an opposition's job to have a bit of a lark in here, to be a bit opportunistic and not to think of when they were in government and the positions they took at the time. It is the old story: they will take one view this time and if they are ever in government, it will be 180 degrees different. I accept that as part of the cut and thrust of politics.

        What are the motives of the Greens (WA) for moving this? It really is a philosophical difference about the balance between the parliament and the executive. Their view, I think, is that the executive is at their beck and call every minute of the day. But for the good governance of the country, quite often we allocate between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock for question time.

        It does not affect the Greens, they could not care less. They are the anarchists of Australian politics. They could not care about good government. They care about accountability; that is good; but they could not care less about good governance. These two and their predecessor often moved these sorts of motions because they could not care less. As long as they can do something they think will needle the government, something that they know will be acceptable to the opposition that they crawl to all the time, this absolutely suits their purposes.

        I do not expect the opposition to always go along with that. Sometimes they do and sometimes they do not. Today it is a big larkâ€”why not keep the ministers here until 4.30. What a good joke; we will upset their programs. They can do that. But they know they will get that back in spades if they ever make it to this side of the chamber. That usually makes them a little hesitant to support such ratbag motions. It is not as though we have not been fair today. We have had 16 questions.

If we had not had this time wasting debate and if this motion had been supported most of those questions probably could have been asked and answered by now. What you decided to do was stand up and make a big scene and carry on. The answer we received from Senator Faulkner is the only answer we have got that tells us that the Left needs a new leader in this parliament.

        The question was asked from the backbench: what did you do when you were in government? You might be interested to know that on average 28 questions were answered day after day in this particular chamber. How are you going? In 1994, 21 questions including supplementaries were answered; in 1993, 22 were answered; in 1992, 22.6 were answered; and in autumn and winter 1995â€”is this the precedent you guys have set for the future?â€”19.6 were answered.

We came in here hearing the word around the chamber that there was going to be some attempt to extend question time by maybe doubling it by an hour or having another 28 questions; it was something of that kind. I asked Senator Alston at the beginning of question time what the state of play was and what the opposition's intentions were in this respect. He said, `Well, because of what happened yesterday, we reckon that we are entitled to some more questions. We want to ask of you 28 questions, including supplementaries.' I said, `Including supplementaries; you are clear about that? There would be 28 questions, including supplementaries, starting from 2 o'clock. You will be happy with that?'

He said to me, `How long is this going to take?' and I said, `If you tell people like Senator Cook to halve their answers, you will make a lot more progress.'

You are not exactly honouring the bargain, are you? As a result, we simply achieved the same result by deleting the reference to supplementaries. That puts you back where you know you ought to be, and that is enabling us to get back to the level of questions that were answered at a time when governments were prepared to cooperate and treat question time as a genuine exercise in seeking information, not simply as an opportunity to filibuster and stonewall.

        That was our proposal. That was made abundantly clear to Senator Evans, and that, as I hope Senator Kernot understands, is the position. It was never intended that we have another 28 questions after question time but simply that question time be allowed to continue until 28 questions had been asked on the normal basis. It was not on the basis that you would then go off and make sure you strung things out by having as many supplementaries as you possibly could. That is what you have done. That is the breach of the agreement. Don't run away from it. I am sure you know what this is all about.

       I think that the best solution is a two-hour question time tomorrowâ€”two hours or a minimum of 28 questions. I am pleased to announce that I cannot be here tomorrow.

       Well, he is lucky. But those 28 questions presumably were in the context of Senator Margetts's motion yesterday, which was for 28 questions including supplementary questions to have been asked and answered. That was her motion yesterday. As I understand it, if we can get on with the 12 questions that Senator Alston's amendment seeks, it would serve us all well.

In other words, you are left with 28 questions, and that is to include what has preceded this point in time. If that has been carried, as it has, I cannot see how we can now revert to another question which would be contradictory of that earlier proposition.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Senator Crowley, your government is spending $12.5 million on an advertising campaign funded by the taxpayer to push the benefits of superannuation. Mr Keating has gloated that an average wage earner joining the work force now would retire with nearly half a million dollars in superannuation. How much would the average woman who works for 25 years, not the 39 years of the average man, and at 85 per cent of male earnings, have in her superannuation when she retires? Aren't you simply conning Australian women? Isn't this why Eva Cox has described your superannuation policies as neither fair nor equitable for women? Would you like me to repeat it because you couldn't hear it?

This is a question that wants to make a sadness out of the great gains for women, most of whom did not have superannuation but now do. This is great good news for the government. As to the details of Senator Patterson's question, I will take that on notice.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. I refer to the release on Tuesday of the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index. I understand this small business index reflects information gained from a survey of 1,000 randomly selected small business proprietors from all metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions of Australia. Has the minister been able to consider the survey results? If so, do the results provide any indication of the strength of the economic recovery?

         â€”I thank Senator Childs for his question. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index is a credible index. Every quarter it samples 1,000 metropolitan and regional small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The one that came out earlier this week showed some very good signs for the economy, which also back up the accounts figures which were released yesterday, as we well know. It showed that confidence remains relatively strong across the sector. Small business confidence is higher in the recreation and personal service sector. Expectations for growth are relatively stable.

         It is significant to note that interest rate concerns have fallen substantially, with only two per cent of respondents expressing concern, compared with eight per cent in February and six per cent in May. Over half of the respondents expect to increase sales over the next 12 months and expect inflation to be at about four per cent during the next 12 months.

Does the government accept that, to the extent that it resists attempts to clean up the global environment, it leaves Australia with an increasingly tarnished reputation as well as outmoded industries which will inevitably become less profitable?

         We can agree that the figures from 1991 have fallen from 43.7 per cent to 35 per cent in 1995. You ask why people have been leaving. People have been leaving health insurance for two reasons: one, because of the costs; and, two, because until recently private insurance entitled people to a very big bill. So people who used private health insurance found that it was not much help to them at all.

         The legislation that was introduced in this place has not really had time to make a difference to the private insurance numbers. But already a considerable number of agreements are in place between hospitals and insurance companies which mean that people will have 100 per cent cover for their hospital expenses. And if there are arrangements and negotiations between doctors and the insurance companies, that kind of 100 per cent cover for medical costs may also be provided to the patients who might have to use it. So it depends very much on what happens as a result of the negotiations still under way between the insurance companies and the medical communities. So far the doctors have started a vigorous campaign to reject any participation and, therefore, any opportunity to give patients 100 per cent cover.

I congratulate the ABC for commencing the award and for the assistance that it has given for the advancement of rural women in Australia.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In March 1992 and again in February 1993 the Prime Minister made it quite clear that if Australia was not able to achieve four per cent economic growth then it could not improve the employment outlook. Is it not the case that currently the number of under 25-year-olds in employment is 94,900 fewer than prior to Mr Keating's recession in July 1990â€”that is, there are 94,900 fewer young people in employment? What message does the slowing growth rate announced this week send out to the thousands of young unemployed who are still awaiting an opportunity to provide themselves with employment, and particularly those in  depressed regions where the unemployment rates for young people are upwards of 40 to 50 per cent? Is it not a fact that Mr Keating's recovery has indeed passed a large number of our youth and many Australian families by?

         As far as the total levels of youth unemployment are concerned, we have had this debate in this chamber many times. Most youth in the age group we are talking about here, in the cohort 16 to 20, are in training. They are at high school, university or technical college. They are engaging in some form of training and they are not in the work force, nor are they seeking jobs. So the figures that you are giving are a biased representation of that age cohort, and you know it. We have had that debate many times.

         â€”I wish to supply some additional information that I undertook to supply regarding a question without notice to me from Senator Harradine in the chamber on Tuesday. Senator Harradine asked me what the government's forecasts for youth unemployment would be in the year 2001 after the Working Nation strategy had run its course. I remind this place of the government's commitment under Working Nation to an overall unemployment rate of five per cent by the turn of the century.

         We are creating jobs well in excess of the 200,000 required annually to meet our targets. Obviously, if we move to the five per cent target, we would expect improvements to the significant youth problem commensurate with the continuing decline in overall unemployment.

         Historically, youth unemployment has always been higher than the overall unemployment rate because the turnover of young workers is greater than for the overall labour force, resulting in a larger pool of workers between jobs. However, under Working Nation, the government has committed the resources and provided the program flexibility to skew the labour market equation in favour of young people and ensure that they share in sustained jobs growth. The evidence is there. Over the year to July 1995, the number of young people seeking full-time employment fell by five per cent. For long-term unemployed 15- to 19-year-olds, the number has fallen even further by over 20 per cent, and by 30 per cent for the 20- to 24-year-olds.

         Education and training do significantly increase the chances of young people getting and holding a job. The latest ABS labour force data shows that the unemployment rate for those 15- to 24-year-olds who did not complete secondary school was 28.2 per cent, twice the rate for those with a post-secondary school qualificationâ€”that is, 12.9 per cent.

        The issue of how the ATSIC board of commissioners came to the decision to award $20 million to the Northern Territory for land acquisition over the next two years while $4 million has been kept aside for emergencies or for land acquisition in the states is a very serious matter which deserves the deepest scrutiny of the Senate through our invaluable committee processes. As many senators are probably aware, yesterday the Federal Court in Sydney set aside the decision of the ATSIC board. In doing so, the judge made it very clear that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Far from taking into account the Government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister that there not be an inappropriate increase in acquisitions of land in the Northern Territory, ATSIC did the opposite. It embarked upon a course which would ensure that this policy would, at least to the extent of some of $10 million allocated, be frustrated.
       </para>
       <para>
        This matter has been the subject of a great deal of debate in this place and elsewhere. It has been raised in several ways, with very unsatisfactory responses so far from the government: during the land fund bill debate; during question time; calls to order; a successful censure motion against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins; and in the estimates committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Federal Court judgment adds to the concerns expressed in the Senate and contrasts with the arguments which were raised by the government during those debates. The Federal Court action was taken against ATSIC by the New South Wales Land Council, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and FAIRA from Queensland. These three Aboriginal organisations felt deeply aggrieved by the decision of the ATSIC board and their position has been vindicated by the decision of the Federal Court.

         However, the decision of the court has far from settled the matter. There are a number of issues which have only been highlighted by the case. These can be summarised in the following questions: if there was a belief within ATSIC that there was an agreement with the government about giving special treatment to the Northern Territory, where did that belief come from? How did the ATSIC bureaucracy come to write the briefing paper on which the board based its decision? How did that briefing paper get the endorsement of the legal section of ATSIC if it was manifestly wrong? How did that briefing paper get the endorsement of the deputy CEO of ATSIC if it was manifestly wrong? How did the board of commissioners of ATSIC come to make such a manifestly unreasonable decision on such a sensitive matter?
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In some ways this is actually a very simple matter. There are really only two options about how this whole affair arose. The first option is that somehow the ATSIC bureaucracy managed to create a briefing paper on a highly sensitive matter which was manifestly wrong. In this case there is serious cause for concern about how such a briefing paper came into existence. The Senate committee should look at how the internal processes of ATSIC conspired to create such a brief.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second option is that the ATSIC briefing paper was right and there was an agreement with the government that the Northern Territory would be given special treatment for the next two years. In this case there has been gross deception on the part of the government and particularly the Prime Minister; a deception which resulted in the passage of a bill through this place; a deception which would rightly be called one of the most important wrongdoings by this government. I would like to quote from page 46 of Justice Hill's judgment:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no evidence before me of any discussions which would lead to the conclusion to which the author of the option paper, upon which the decision was based, came. This is not surprising. For there to have been such discussions and agreement with the Prime Minister, what the Prime Minister said in parliament would have to have been deliberately misleading. I would not lightly infer that the Prime Minister intended to mislead the House in this way. The fact that no evidence was called by ATSIC is also relevant to my conclusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may ask why it is that I have continued to pursue this matter with such vigour and why it is that we keep making such serious allegations against this government. Senator Bob Collins and Senator Gareth Evans have accused me of having some kind of grudge against ATSIC or distaste of ATSIC. Far from this: anyone listening to the questions that I have asked will be able to recognise their legitimacy. If you take a close look at the evidence which we have been able to uncover, then this is really the only conclusion which one can honestly draw from the evidence.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         No, we do not have any evidence which makes it explicitâ€”not yet. The decision is the strongest evidence that we have. The need for a committee is to establish the basis on which a manifestly wrong paper came to be written. What we do have is a great deal of evidence which alludes to the fact that there was an agreement. ATSIC was a willing party in an agreement which was reached with a handful of people, including the Prime Minister.

         The Senate has a responsibility to look after the interests of all Australians. By setting up a statutory authority with a partially elected board of commissioners, the parliament did not abrogate our responsibility to the Aboriginal people of Australia. Indeed, ATSIC remains accountable to the parliament for its actions, just as it remains accountable to the Federal Court.

No evidence on merit was provided to the court. No evidence on merit was provided because, if it had, it may have exposed the Prime Minister. `We have no argument for the option paper being wrong' was the statement that was made. We don't have that argument. The inquiry which this motion seeks to set up will allow us to inquire into such matters and the questions I mentioned earlier.

        ATSIC exists to redress the imbalance of the past colonisation of the continent. To this end it is funded to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders acquire land. ATSIC does not exist for the purpose of furthering the interests of Aboriginal persons in a particular place. A decision by it, for example, that it would favour residents of a particular state or territory over residents of another state or territory would clearly be invalid. The residence of beneficiaries is not of itself a relevant factor. Where public moneys are made available for distribution to a particular group in society, in the present case, persons of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, it is necessarily implied that all persons within the class of beneficiary will be open to consideration for that benefit.

Senator Chamarette has actively pursued this subject in this chamber, through the estimates hearings and the supplementary estimates.

That is what it isâ€”an obsession, and an unreal one, because there is no evidence.

         I took the ATSIC legislation through here. Originally, the government had intendedâ€”as Senator Evans and I have stated again and again in here, and it was publicly knownâ€”that we would incorporate all of the land acquisition powers into the new body and that we would remove from ATSIC the continuation of the role it has played, and played very well, in acquiring land for Aboriginal people for some years.

In my view, in the circumstances, the Commission erred either by taking into account an irrelevant consideration (the supposed discussions which I infer did not reach the suggested conclusion) or by failing to take into account a relevant consideration (the real Government policy) as well as by coming to a decision that in all the circumstances was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could come to it.

         â€”Why didn't the plaintiffs produce it if they suggested it existed? It was produced by no-one in the Federal Court. Read the judgment. You can try to politicise the judge's decision all you like, but it is there in black and white. In fact, it could not be clearer. The Federal Court found there was no such conspiracy, but Senator Chamarette still will not agree. I know that she is desperately trying to help Cathcart's book, but I say again, if he wants to call it `Mabo: the real story' he had better not have this as its central element because that will not be the truth, it will be a lie. Those individuals I spoke to confirmed to me no such deal had occurred. The ATSIC board made its own decision about how it would allocate its funds, and the basis of the board's decision was set out in the chairperson's press release on 11 April.

         Another point needs to be made. I said in the Senate when this matter was first raised, when we were taking the legislation through the Senate, that I did not believe that the ATSIC board would actually make this decision. This was to the aggravation of the land council, and I have never ever hesitated to aggravate them if I thought that something needed to be said. They were aggravated by what I said but I made my own personal position on that decision very clear. I was entitled to do that but not to interfere with that decision in the sense of causing the government to direct them to change it. It was openâ€”and I said thisâ€”to the disaffected people to take action. They have, and they have a judgment.

         The problem you have, Senator Chamarette, is you cannot handle the concept of Aboriginal people, the ones you do not agree with, making decisions and having the right to make them without interference. You wanted them directed to do otherwise by the government. The New South Wales land council took the course open to it. It is a public fact that the decision was a controversial one inside the commission. All that is public. It was a tied vote. It was hotly contested inside the commission. On that day the New South Wales land councils did not get up.

What I did not allow for, of course, was the well-known persuasive powers of territorians against the odds. They persuaded others to take a different decision but it was hotly contested and the vote was tied. The New South Wales land council, Senator Chamarette, then took action available to it and got a judgment, and they are entitled to do that. That does not mean we have to interfere in this process at all. That is what you cannot handle, Senator Chamarette. The ATSIC board made its own decision.

         Senator Chamarette, I did read this judgment last night. In respect of the central issue that you are pursuingâ€”a deal which does not existâ€”it found very clearly there was not. But there are some aspects of his honour's judgment that I do find curious. If I were a lawyer I would not even hesitate to express this personal view I am expressingâ€”and I read the judgment last nightâ€”but I am not a lawyer; I am just a mug politician. So any opinion I express on a legal matter is not worth a dam thing. As a mug politician I find aspects of this judgment quite curious. As the person who took the ATSIC legislation through the Senate chamber, one in particular I find very curious indeed, and I will refer to it. His Honour said, starting on page 42, that the applicants had two grounds of appealâ€”two. The first was thisâ€”and I am quoting from the judgment:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First it is submitted that the decision of the commission to set aside in each of two years $10 million of the $12 million to be allocated in that year for land acquisition to persons seeking to acquire land in the Northern Territory was a decision so unreasonable in the administrative law sense that it amounted to an error in law.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is fair enough. He then went on to describe the second ground:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second ground relied upon was the failure on the part of ATSIC to take into account in determining the allocation of its funds government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, at the bottom of that same page, he said this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In my view the applicants should succeed on each of the submissions made.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the judge found on two grounds: firstly, so unreasonable as to be wrong in lawâ€”fair enoughâ€”but the other, very curious, when he upheld it; that it was wrong because they had not taken into account government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister. The reason I find that curious is this: I took that legislation through the Senate. To the best of my knowledge there are no provisions in it that require ATSIC to take account of determining government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister. Not only is there not in my recollection any requirement of ATSIC to take account of government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister, but their charter, in fact, is to be independent of the government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is an overriding power of direction from the minister to ATSIC to be taken in the last resortâ€”a power I might add which he has never to the best of my knowledge ever exercised. If we had wanted an organisationâ€”and I can safely say this in terms of the policy foundation of ATSICâ€”to take all of its decisions consistent with government policy announced by the Prime Minister, we probably would have kept the operations entirely within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, where that could easily have been accommodated. The reason the governmentâ€”and this is a political point not a legal pointâ€”established ATSIC was deliberately to have a process where Aboriginal people could make decisions independent of the government and indeed, and it is a matter of public record, at times in conflict with the government.

         It is a matter of public record that the chair and the board of ATSIC have on many occasions disagreed with the government, and we have had that out in the public domain. That is something we are very comfortable with. That is one reason why ATSIC was establishedâ€”to allow Aboriginal people to express a view.

         I am not a lawyer. I might be absolutely up the creek on this one. Just as a lay person reading a judgment, I was fascinated that one of the grounds relied upon was `to take account of the obligation that ATSIC had to have regard to government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister'. I do not believe they have any such obligation. I do not believe there is any provision in the actâ€”and I will check laterâ€”that requires them to do so. I found that a curious part of the judgment.

         Having said that, let me say that there is another section of the judgment that attracted my interest, where the judge placed great value on documents talking about ATSIC's obligations to be equitable in its distribution of grants. I say, again as a non-lawyer: does this mean that it has to be equitable in each and every year of the allocations? Can the equity be considered over a period, for example, of 10 years? I ask the question: would it be open to the ATSIC board to take a decision on land acquisition in one year which was deliberately designed to correct what they saw as the inequity of distributions in previous years? Is that necessarily inequitable? I do not think so. Is there a requirement for ATSIC year by year or allocation by allocation to be equitable, in that sense, on a yearly allocation? I am not sure.

         These are important questions in the judgment that need to be looked at. I do not know. I am curious about that in respect of the judgment. As I said before, the fundamental curiosity I have about the judgment is that, as one of the two grounds on which the judge said he relied for his decision, he relied upon a ground that the ATSIC board should have had regard to government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister. I would like some lawyer who is smarter than I am to point out where in the act or anywhere elseâ€”

         This is a very important point. He says that the scheme, to be successful, if there was some discussion with the government, would require the `connivance' of the Indigenous Land Corporation. First, ATSIC has to make a decision to spend virtually all of its money in the Northern Territory, then it has to go to the ILC and say, `We don't want you to spend any of your money in the Northern Territory,' and the ILC then has to have a meeting and agree to do that. The judge has said:

        That evidenceâ€”and we cannot question this judgment, I presumeâ€”was obviously not before the judge. But the senators who follow this debate and the poor public who are following this debate know very well that that evidence is before us, because back in June a press release was issued by the Indigenous Land Corporation saying that, indeed, they had. They would not have said they connived but, to use the judge's word, that `connivance' was given public airing. The first meeting of the ILC board was held and part of that connivance was agreed and published. Indeed, David Ross, now the chief of the ILC, held a press conference in this very building the day after and told the public of Australia that his part in the connivance had been achieved.

Quite clearly, the government and the Prime Minister have absolutely nothing to fear from this inquiry if there was no sort of connivance, if there was no sort of agreement, if there was no sort of discussion that would have led the person who wrote that minute to believe that the Prime Minister had not misled the parliament. I hope for the sake of Australia and for the sake of Aboriginal affairs that the Prime Minister did not mislead the parliament; but these are matters that do need to be resolved.

         To answer Senator Sherry's question, a select committee can be formed without the Senate incurring much additional cost. It is quite likely that the committee would not need to move out of the building because a lot of these matters relate to ATSIC and the personnel the committee would need to take evidence from are based here. The staff of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund, with the exception of one person, were seconded from other committees. This committee could do the same.

         Look at where we are. ATSIC made a decision. People expressed surprise and other emotions about the decision that was made to quarantine that amount of money over two years for the purchase of land in the Northern Territory. However, we have talked a lot in this place about self-determination. It is true, I think we should argue, that ATSIC had the right to make that decision in the same way as those who feel aggrieved by that decision had the right to appeal that decision. They did that. The Federal Court set the ATSIC decision aside.

         There has been a bit of inconsistency when we have talked about self-determination in here. I vividly remember the disagreement we had in the land fund debate over whether self-determination meant that individuals should be allowed to purchase land and then sell it to others, thereby, I argued, undermining the amount of land to be held in the land stock. In terms of self-determination, it would affect the capacity of many other indigenous people to, for example, inherit that land. So you cannot be selective. It is okay in the case of that land fund debate for self-determination to exist to that extent, but it is not okay for it to exist as it applies to ATSIC's right to make a decision with which we may disagree. I really want to point that out. There has been some great inconsistency about whether we accept self-determination.

         I acknowledge that there was disquiet about the decision. I acknowledge that we have a right to discuss how we should deal with that disquiet. My first option would be for ATSIC to have the opportunity to take whatever decision it chooses to next. The second point I would highlight is whether there have been adequate opportunities for those members of parliament, including those in the Senate, to scrutinise the material surrounding that decision. As I understand it, there has been a combination of numerous freedom of information requests, which have been complied withâ€”those requests have been served on both the government and ATSICâ€”and many documents from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

         â€”I am not prepared to vote for the entirety of Senator Chamarette's motion in the way it is currently framed. However, I adopt the view that I have always adopted here: if there is a matter of widespread concern about a particular issue one should not stand in the way of an examination of that particular issue before a committee. I think that is the point Senator Kernot was making.

         I have thought about the matter. Unless there is some convincing expression in Senator Chamarette's response, I am not prepared to vote for the first part of her motion. In my view, parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) are unnecessary. When it comes to part (2) of the motion, I believe that part (a) should be deleted. I foreshadow a further amendment which would delete part (1) of the motion and substitute certain words in lieu of those currently contained in part (2)(a).

It seems to me that this is a sort of focused matter which is more appropriate for a select committee. I also acknowledge the advice that I was given from the minister's office about this and I know that there would be an ability by the joint committee to consider this. But this is a particularly focused matter which, to my mind, is more appropriate to have before a select committee which has an early reporting date and which, naturally, as has been indicated, would not mean a great expenditure of money. Having said that and having foreshadowed my views, I will now listen to what the chairman of the joint committee might have to say.

         â€”I feel a certain pressure now, Senator Harradine, by those remarks of yours, but I want to enter the debate purely to put a few comments on the record based on the role of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund, because it has been raised as an issue in this debate. I think it is appropriate to say that, in my view, if the numbers are in the Senate for this matter to be referred to a committee, then it is appropriate that the committee that was established by this parliament to be responsible for native title and, more recently, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund matters ought, some two months later, be given the opportunity to fulfil the role that we as a Senate decided it ought to have.

         I can say that the committee did finalise its program for the year at a meeting the other day. There was nothing in that discussion that ruled out our ability to handle a reference of a piece of legislation or any other matter. Given the proposed reporting date of 30 September, I do not see there would be any difficulty in the committee dealing appropriately, and with responsiveness, to any resolution with that sort of deadline.

         I would say that the committee so far has been a very good committee of the parliament. It has worked with consensus and has been able to put down two unanimous reports. I accept that this sort of political reference will challenge the committee's ability to maintain that consensus. But I do think the committee is building up a reputation as a positive influence in the debate in Aboriginal affairs. We are building up a rapport with many of the key players and a certain expertise both in the secretariat and in the members of the committee.

The reality is that, if a select committee is established, the same playersâ€”Senator Campbell, Senator Chamarette and Iâ€”will find ourselves in another guise doing the same job, so to that extent, I suppose, one could argue that it does not matter. But I am personally, as chairman, a bit disappointed that other members of the native title committee do not feel it can perform this function.

         â€”I want to respond to the amendments that have been proposed by Senator Kernot and Senator Harradine. First of all, I want to reply to the comments made by Senator Collins in his response on behalf of the government. I have no problems with groups of people making decisions that I do not agree with. I am more than happy for any group of Aboriginal people or non-Aboriginal people to make a decision, as long as it is a proper decision. What we are talking about here is a decision which was part of a debate and about which concern was expressed. The Federal Court set it aside, and it found that the ATSIC board decision in all the circumstances was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could come to it. I believe having a double standard for Aboriginal groups or non-Aboriginal groups is just as patronising and wrong as the kinds of implications and imputations that have been directed towards me.

         I affirm everybody's right to make decisions that they are entitled to make, but I believe that where they are subject to administrative law or to the courts they should be able to answer that scrutiny. Secondly, I agree that this parliament has not abrogated its role in the setting up of ATSIC in looking at the way government expenditureâ€”about which we debated on a piece of legislation in this chamberâ€”is dealt with. So I believe there is evidence, and I do not think it is fair to accuse me of some kind of grudge or inability to accept that Aboriginal people can make their own decisions. I have no problem with that. The implication of Senator Collins was that that was the case.

         Senator Collins stated that the evidence does not exist and used that as the reason or proof that there was nothing to look at in this inquiry. If the evidence was not able to be produced to the Federal Court in those circumstances, we have to ask ourselves why. How could it be that the ATSIC CEO and the ATSIC legal officer could present a brief, which was the basis of this decision that has been set aside, to the ATSIC board that was so manifestly wrong? We have a responsibility to look at that, scrutinise it and set it up in such a way that the ATSIC board is not misinformed about government decisions, parliamentary decisions and its own options about which it can make its own decisions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, Senator Collins said that ATSIC had no obligation to have a regard for government policy and that it has a right to be independent. He queried the implication that ATSIC should comply with the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. I quite understand that, but my understanding of the way it was referred to in the court judgment was simply to explain that the brief which was purporting to present an agreement made between ATSIC and the Prime Minister did not reflect something that the Prime Minister had said was government policy in the House of Representatives debate.

         The fourth point was one that Senator Collins made about equity. He discussed the possibility that that can be seen over the long term and that we should overlook the inequity that is patently obvious in this decision because it might all even itself out. Senator Campbell's reference that there is a danger of being additionally conniving to perpetuate inequity needs to be looked at. I think he raised that point quite adequately.

         The arguments against Senator Kernot's amendment, which I do not support, are four-fold. Firstly, the reason I believe that it is not appropriate is that it blurs the terms of reference, and it makes its inquiry and report by 30 September as the only basis for that committee to operate. Secondly, it suggests a joint committee rather than a Senate committee. I have had personal experience with difficulties of this Senate imposing terms of reference on a joint standing committee. I will not go into details, but I can assure you that a joint committee does not usually take very kindly to the Senate imposing terms of reference on itâ€”as I found in the reference relating to women's representation in parliament to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third point I want to makeâ€”one that Senator Evans appropriately raisedâ€”is that I believe there is a reason that a Senate committee could be more appropriate than the joint standing committee. In political terms, because the government has the numbers on that standing committee and we are asking government members to be part of that committee that may well put them in a conflict of interest. If government members are expected to defend the hostile approach to these investigations that its representativesâ€”namely, Senator Collins, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Faulknerâ€”during estimates have demonstrated, then I am not optimistic that a fair result will ensue.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have no concerns about Senator Chris Evans as the chair of the committee; it is more the political matter he raised about numbers. He can easily argueâ€”and I will leave it up to the Senateâ€”that, because a select committee might have the numbers that relate to the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens, we are using that. My point is that we are putting the government in an invidious position by taking a committee where it has the numbers and where it may have a particular view. As we are looking to matters that cast some question over the procedures of a government agency and also of the Prime Minister it would be better in terms of that accountability to have a committee that was swayed in the terms of the opposition.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a precedent to my decision on the numbers in that I opposed a reference going to a select committee where the opposition had the numbers in a case where I felt there may have been a conflict of interest in those terms. It means that there is a balance on that committee, which cannot be accused of having been biased in the government's favour or of having covered up. I believe that committee will be able to address the matters that are brought before it in a way that cannot be compromised if they do come forward to clear ATSIC, the Prime Minister or the government of any difficulties in that regard.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fourth point is that it may well be that the topic we are addressing is not best kept in the purview of the native title committee because the topic of this reference is to look at ATSIC, rather than the express purpose of the committee, which is to review the operation of the Native Title Act and the ATSIC Indigenous Land Corporation. If there is any ill-feeling engendered by this inquiry in relation to the topic under examination then it is best to set it up separately.

But I acknowledge that, with Senator Evans, there is expertise on the native title committee. I have no quarrel with that. I have mentioned my concerns. I believe it is not a slight matter that we are looking at ATSIC rather than, and only incidentally, at the land fund in this case. I am happy to accept Senator Harradine's proposed amendment.

        Going back to about 1991 we heard very much about Australia's waterfront reform where some $430 million or $450 million was allocated for this reform. Senator Collins, especially at the time he was Minister for Transport, told us how that waterfront was going to be really reformed and cleaned up. The $430 million or $450 million has been spent, but what have we got for it? Very little from what I can see.

It shows that Australia's waterfront standards still have a disastrous rating even by world standards. Today I asked Senator Collins a question on that. I thought it was a reasonable question to ask because, firstly, it was a very bad report and, secondly, he was the minister at the time and all he could say in reply was no. I asked him if he knew what it was.

The BIE review is the government's own review into what goes on in industry and our efficiencies.

       It is little wonder that the government has chosen to use out-of-date figures, as Mr Brereton did yesterday in the House of Representatives when he was answering a question from Mr Sharp, the shadow minister for transport. He used well out-of-date figures, yet he knows that that report is there and waiting for the government to deal with. That is all he could do. I think it goes somewhat towards misleading parliament if you know the report from BIE is there and yet quote out-of-date figures. That act speaks for itself.

        What happened to that $430 million? Almost half of it was used to pay out wharfies to reduce the numbers on the waterfront. At that time, an average wharfie was earning $34,000 a year. At the beginning of this year, the same grade of wharfie was earning $75,000 a year. So under this government, under this restructuring, it went from $34,000 to $75,000. You could say that that could be part of the restructure and the benefits of the restructure. But about half of those who took the package of $100,000 are back on that wharf. The figures are here. That is a total disgrace. This restructure was supposed to have brought about improvements.

       Our lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to their highest. What situation does that put us in in relation to our export industry, which is Australia's income? One must bear in mind that this report has been prepared by the government's own body. It was not done by the coalition, it was not done by the NFF and it was not done by the Chamber of Mines and Energy. It was not done by anyone but the government itself. The government's own body has given it a report that damns its waterfront reform.

We are always told when we compare our waterfront with Asia that Asia has cheaper labour, more labour, more of this, less of that and less of something else. I am willing to leave Asia aside, but to get a true comparison we have to compare ourselves with North America. That is the area we export to with our agricultural, mining and manufacturing exports.

        It works both ways. Our exports to the rest of the world go through the wharves and we import machinery and all sorts of products. That is why our balance of payments is always blowing out.

           Inside Sport
          </emphasis>
          magazine, which I think was released yesterday, which says that the Senate committee basically should have found the Australian coach, Mr Eddie Thomson, guilty of behaviour that was inappropriate to the extent that he should have been sacked. I believe the report by the Senate committee was very fair and balanced. On the evidence presented to us, I think the conclusion was that there was no evidence which indicated that Mr Thomson had received any money or had behaved in a way which brought him any improper benefit. It seems to me that that evidence stands.

          In this article it is put that we had found that the coach should be retained as the Australian coach. We did not find anything other than that there was no evidence presented to us to justify the recommended penalty by the Stewart inquiry into soccer that he be dismissed. In other words, the negative that we present does not necessarily mean we are taking a judgment that he should have his job. In fact, we ended up criticising him for having behaved inappropriately.

          It seems to me that various people in the media who seem to have some axe to grind on this have decided to totally ignore that finding of ours that he had behaved inappropriately.

          I do find it strange that the Australian Soccer Federation, which professed great concern and great hopes that this inquiry would put the problems of soccer behind it and would get rid of all the innuendoes and attacksâ€”I had hoped that would have been the outcome of our inquiryâ€”by failing to take any action, even by way of gentle reprimand, has allowed a situation to continue so that people have certainly expressed to me the view that the Australian Soccer Federation did not care what the Senate inquiry came out with. In fact, this article in
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Inside Sport

          magazine, in a sense, criticises the ASF, particularly Mr Hill, the president, for having clearly given an indication that, whatever we came out with, he was pretty keen to reappoint the coach. I have no problem with the ASF reappointing the coach. All I do have a problem with is the assertion in this article that Mr Thomson should have been sacked on the basis of what a very distinguished former judge, Mr Stewart, had to say.

They continually use words like `the perception' that something had happened, that he `may have' known, that the `implication' was, that there was a `strong inference' that he was doing it, and so on. I have had concerns about the level of responseâ€”and particularly this articleâ€”regarding what we have found.

          I should stress that as far as I am concerned and, I believe, as far as the committee is concerned, this matter has not yet been finalised. There are other matters, particularly those relating, I regret to say, to the Institute of Sport, which are to be examined in the future and to which reference has already been made by some correspondents.

          This is a matter which obviously is of public concern. It has received considerable publicity. Obviously this is a matter that the soccer inquiry should and, I hope, will properly examine. I stress that the report of the soccer inquiry so far is the first reportâ€”not the final report. The media, apparently, does not recognise that other matters of some substance emerged from this inquiryâ€”for example, the pursuit of discrepancies. There was a discrepancy of something like $250,000 between what a Victorian club is alleged to have received as a transfer and what it is reported to have received. That sort of matter has been referred to the Victorian police because it is not a matter properly for examination by the Senate committee.

In other words, there has been a response to our report which seems to me to be unreasonable.

          â€”The government's response to the 13th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is indeed welcome. Honourable senators may recall that recommendation 6.1 of the committee stated that the committee was not convinced that there was not a role for the tribunal to play in dealing with medical complaints. The good news is that the government now favours including complaints involving the interpretation of medical evidence within the tribunal's jurisdiction. I need not remind honourable senators that this chamber itself played an important part in contributing to this widely acclaimed decision. The Senate select committee has just concluded taking evidence of the first 12 months operation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. That report will be given later this session.

          I remind the Senate that in the submission to this recent tribunal review the ISC itself stated that a key factor in the government's decision to revise previous policy was the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's caseload statistics over the first three months of its operation. The caseloads showed that less than 20 per cent of the written inquiries to the tribunal arose from disability claims and only a small proportion of those related to questions of medical evidence. A regulation gazetted on 1 November 1994 deferred the handling of disability complaints involving the assessment of medical evidence by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal until 1 May 1995.

          A difficulty was acknowledged, by all, I believe, where the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was seeking a determination which affected contractual relationships between trustees and their external parties. This issue was also significant given the environment created by the judicial power in the High Court case Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others.

          Given the need for legislative amendments to bind insurers, and given other necessary amending issues, the exclusion of medical evidence from the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal jurisdiction was extended until 1 November 1995. I believe the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will have, after this date, all the necessary apparatus and structures to provide for a low cost, fast and efficient resolution of medical issues as an alternative dispute resolution forum to the courts.

          . One of the key features of this report concerns the debate on member choice. Member choice is an increasingly important issue for superannuation members. I believe that in the future most superannuation funds will be offering member choice, not necessarily unlimited choice but some choice. However, I remind the Senate that that choice can be within only a range of investment options determined by trustees.

          This will be part of an evolution where members now largely have what I call investment risk, and they certainly have this in accumulation of funds. These members are demanding a greater and greater say in the operation of their superannuation investment. I need to remind the Senate that members do have different needs through life. I believe that these should be addressed by trustees.

          I also remind honourable senators that trustees cannot give unfettered choice to members, because it would be an abrogation of their duties as trustees and would also be contrary to the legislation of SIS. Legislators must determine where the boundaries of reasonable choice actually lie. You might recall that the committee recommended in its 14th report that beneficiary investment choice be mandated for standard employer funds with 50 or more members and members generating investment components.

          Mandating beneficiary investment choice for such funds would seek to remove a glaring inequity in the superannuation system. As it now stands, members of personal superannuation funds are mostly provided with the opportunity to choose the most appropriate investment strategy for their needs and, importantly, are considered capable of doing so. On the other hand, members of larger standard employer funds have no such choice, and, according to some commentators, are not capable of having a choice and should therefore be protected. The committee has recommended that a `one size fits all' approach to investment is not appropriate and will become untenable in the long term.

Elizabeth Bryan was State Super Corporation General Manager, Investments, and won the Telstra New South Wales Businesswoman of the Year award. She basically says that a member's right of choice is more important than how many may exercise that choice. The other day, Linda Nicholls gave a very good paper on member investment choice, which I seek leave to table.

         I pointed out last evening that the minister responsible for declaring marine parks in South Australia is also the minister responsible for fisheries and the Minister for Mines and Energy and, as such, clearly has a conflict of interest when talking about the need for protecting marine areas for the purposes of protecting the breeding areas, principally, of the southern right whale. The minister responsible for fisheries and the Minister for Mines and Energy in South Australia has a conflict of interest with respect to his colleague the minister responsible for conservation. This may result in his reticence to support the marine park, despite the support which comes from the minister responsible for the environment in South Australia.

         Disturbingly, the removal of SARDI from the draft management planning process is clear evidence of the increasing influence of the fishing industry in the management of South Australia's aquatic resources, at the expense of the independent long-term government research and management advice. This is evidenced by the establishment of integrated management committees, which now have statutory power to regulate and manage all of the state's aquatic resources, including habitat management, and to define research prioritiesâ€”in effect, the privatisation of community owned resources.

The South Australian Fishing Industry Council has recommended that any present SARDI representatives who sit on one of these integrated management committees have no voting rights.

At the same time, the South Australian government is seeking to further inhibit the efforts of those legitimate researchers who work within the South Australian government at the moment to continue with their work on behalf of conservation, with a direction that their work be oriented towards exploitative activities. Many SARDI researchers feel that South Australia will follow the example of Victoria with a complete outsourcing of scientific research related to sustainable fisheries, with all research and research priorities being completely regulated by industry.

         The value of the marine resource at Head of Bight in terms of tourism, as I have indicated already, far and away exceeds the importance of that area as a fishing resource. Whale watching is a rapid growth industry. In Western Australia, operators have reported a growth rate of 50 per cent over the last five years. In Queensland, two operators claimed a growth rate of 100 per cent in only two years. In Queensland, boat-based whale watchingâ€”this is mainly humpbacks in Harvey Bayâ€”generated a direct income of $3 million in 1993.

         At Ningaloo Marine Park in WA whale shark visitors have increased 400 per cent from 500 visitors in 1992 to 2,000 visitors in 1994. Whale shark fees alone generated $500,000 in 1994. If the additional costs for fishing charters, safari tours, diving and accommodation are included, a total of more than $2 million was generated from the eco-tourism activities in the region during the six-week whale shark season. South Australia has already generated $310,000 direct income from cetacean watching enterprises. This is based on only 10 operators.

         The total catch of southern rock lobster within the total area of the proposed marine park boundaries was 44 tonnes in 1993-94 at current prices of $35 per kilogram. This represents a direct income of only $1.5 million. Within the proposed sanctuary zoneâ€”six per cent of the total marine park areaâ€”this translates into only $90,000 in income from rock lobster. It is important to note that the vast majority of the lobster taken in the proposed marine park is caught in the area east of Head of Bight. This area would be seasonally open to lobster fishingâ€”that is, December to Aprilâ€”under the proposed conservation zone proposals. So here we have a direct comparison of the economic benefit of protecting this area as a major marine parkâ€”the economic benefit in terms of eco-tourismâ€”compared with its established direct benefit as a fishing area.

         Prospectivity for mineral and petroleum development is widely acknowledged to be poor in the marine park area. This has been confirmed by BHP, which has formally and publicly supported the marine park proposal.

This is an area which at the moment is largely devoid of established tourist facilities. People have to literally go out there and camp to carry out this activity. The return in terms of eco-tourism could be very significantly increased.

         Based on rates of increase in eco-tourism experienced elsewhere in Australia, with an expected rapid increase in whale watchers over the next five years, the Great Australian Bight Marine Park has the potential to generate in the order of $10 million to $20 million in direct income to the communities of the western Eyre Peninsula.

         In Dominica, 600 people spent $230,000 to watch sperm whales in 1993. Whale Watch Kaikoura, in New Zealand, won the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow award in the green tourism category in February 1995. The award recognises the high standards, contributions to the local economy and sensitivity to the environment. Whale watching has become a national icon that reinforces New Zealand tourism's clean-green image, which is very lucrative in the nature-based and eco-tourism market.

         The Head of Bight Sanctuary cannot be considered a marine park but rather an aquatic reserve, that is, the small South Australian one. Marine parks are defined nationally and internationally as large areas, zoned for multiple-use activities. They are specifically established to manage a range of non-exploitative and exploitative activities. Importantly, they incorporate the concept of buffer zones. I strongly recommend that senators look at this proposal, and urge the federal government to become more intensively involved to ensure that this area at Head of Bight is properly protected.

Those councils were not namedâ€”very peculiar, because if there had been any other council into which an inquiry had been held the council and the identity of the people involved in the inquiry would have been made public.

         The report goes into a number of investigations of the finances and activities of the council. For example, the Auditor-General in Queensland in February 1990 told the Minister for Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs that an audit had disclosed `an unacceptable position in the financial administration of the Council'. In March 1990, a senior consultant to the Department of Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs reported on the performance of the council. He said that it was riddled with factionalism and that personality clashes prevented some matters being properly dealt with.

Amongst other things it indicated there should have been $18,744.45 on hand at the bank and in fact the amount on hand was $2,061,21.

How you can overdraw a trust account is completely beyond me. It is a disastrous state of affairs. That qualified audit report also indicated that there was a significant increase in arrears of debts outstanding to the council, 80 per cent of which were estimated to be uncollectable.

         No doubt lawyers for this council will respond to my statements here in parliament today by saying that significant improvements have been made and that the council was recently congratulated by the minister for improving.

         Why do I say this council cannot adequately manage its affairs? The explanation for that is really quite simple. I visited the community recently. Amongst some of the concerns that were raised with me, a number of elders, including one elder by the name of Gordon Charlie, asked me to inquire of the council's solicitors as to whether they could be provided with a copy of a compensation agreement entered into between  Cape Flattery Silica Mine and the council.

I received a letter from Messrs Bottoms English, lawyers for the council, on 4 August stating that they were going to obtain instructions from the Hopevale Aboriginal Council concerning the matter. I wrote to them again on 23 August saying, `Three weeks have elapsed since I wrote to you and I have not received another response.' In the eight days that have elapsed since then I still have not received a response.

         A country like that does not deserve the privilege of hosting a conference such as the one that is taking place at the moment.

         â€”Tonight I want to discuss a major issue for Australian women. I had hoped I would have an opportunity earlier today, having asked a question of Senator Crowley, to take note of that answerâ€”well, I should not elevate the status of her response to the status of an answerâ€”but I did not. It was her response in answer to a question which I had asked her about how much an average women who works for 25 yearsâ€”not the 39 years of the average manâ€”at 85 per cent of male earnings would have in superannuation when she retires.

         This dishonesty that is being perpetrated amongst Australians, and which will be accentuated next week, is nothing short of the sort of lie or story that was told to Australian people when former Prime Minister Hawke said, `No child will live in poverty by the year 2000.' If anybody who is over 18 years of age out there thinks that the superannuation guarantee fund the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is putting forward will support them in their retirement, they are wrongâ€”and, in particular, Australian women will not be supported in their retirement.

         This government has had 13 years to get a retirement incomes policy in place. It has fiddled at the edges of superannuation to the point where people have no faith in it because they feel it will change all the time. The government is to spend $12.5 millionâ€”I repeat: $12.5 millionâ€”on an advertising campaign, funded by the taxpayer, to push the benefits of superannuation. Next week is national superannuation awareness weekâ€”well, I reckon it is `superannuation con week'. It is scheduled to coincide with the distribution to every household of a booklet explaining how superannuation works.

         A few weeks ago in June we had a booklet circulated to all households about the wonders of the social security system; that cost two-and-a-bit million dollars. Now we have $12 1/2 million being spent on telling them about money growing on trees. The Prime Minister's extravagant $12 1/2 million propaganda campaign within six months of an election is a blatant political stunt designed to overcome public scepticism about the government's enforced savings plan.

         The Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, says that he has research that shows that 76 per cent of women think that super is good for them, personally. Of course they do. They also think savings, democracy and motherhood are good things. That is not the point. The point is: are women treated equitably and fairly under Labor's superannuation policies? And the answer is no.

         The coalition supports the implementation of a national savings policy and a retirement incomes policy which provide incentive and reward to all Australians. What we do not support is the sort of con trick which Mr Keating is perpetrating on the women of Australia. He has gloated that an average wage earner joining the work force now would retire with nearly half a million dollars in superannuation.

         As I said, you have to be 25 at the time it is fully in force, so you have to be 18 now and work continually throughout 40 years to even hope to hit the $500,000â€”and that is only if everything goes to plan, such as interest rates going up at the same rate. But if you are a woman and have worked for 25 yearsâ€”not the 39 years of a manâ€”at 85 per cent of male earnings, you will not have that in your superannuation. This is an absolute fraud.

         In 1990 the government had an opportunity when the coalition put forward a retirement savings policy for women. The government before the 1993 election sort of half copied that and let women continue to put into their superannuation for two years after they left employment. But that is not good enough. There really has not been an adequate attempt on the part of the government to address the issue of women's superannuation. In fact, Eva Cox, convenor of the Economic Women's Think Tank, has said that it is unfair and inequitable; she has cast doubts on the government's plan.
