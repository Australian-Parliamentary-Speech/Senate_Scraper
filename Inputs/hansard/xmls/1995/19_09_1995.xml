         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. The minister will recall that when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, brought down his One Nation package, he promised to relieve the tax burden on middle income earners—particularly those on incomes between $20,000 and $40,000—by bringing in the infamous l-a-w tax cuts. Minister, I remind you also that today we learned that only Australians earning more than $70,000 a year enjoy a lower tax burden than they did in 1983 and that in fact low and middle income families are now paying more tax. Is this what Mr Keating meant when he said, `This is as good as it gets'? Or is this yet another broken promise and a further demonstration of why this government deserves a spell on the bench?

Our promises have been delivered, unlike your `fistful of dollars' promise in the 1977 election when you tried to bribe the Australian people by offering tax cuts which you did not deliver.

         But why should the superannuation guarantee levy be included? It is not a tax. It is certainly not a tax; superannuation is, of course, deferred income for ordinary Australians. It is money not provided to the government, like it may be in other countries. It is money not held by the government, like it might be in other countries. It is money that belongs to the individual and to the worker, not like in other countries. It is their money; not the government's. That is why the OECD regard the superannuation guarantee levy as not a tax. The opposition, who obviously want to use the argument presented in today's paper to suit their own conniving political ends, do not respect the OECD or, indeed, the true character of the superannuation guarantee levy.

         In the 10 years since we introduced tax reform in this country, the overall revenue for individuals has fallen from 13.5 per cent of GDP to 12 per cent of GDP. That is the record: under you, 13.5 per cent; under us, a fall to 12 per cent. When the coalition was in government, as I said, the tax system in this country was a national joke and a disgrace. The wealthy paid tax if they chose. The burden was on the middle income earners and the low income earners of Australia.

         Senator Macdonald is equally ignorant about Australia's rural sector. The rural sector in many areas of Australia has been suffering from prolonged and crippling drought which has, understandably, undermined growth rates in that sector. But that is a very different matter to claiming that the sector is fundamentally unable to respond when external factors, such as seasonal conditions and prices, recover—that was the point Senator Macdonald was trying to make.

         ABARE today issued its latest quarterly outlook for the rural and resources sector. ABARE's main finding is that the rural sector will experience both rising prices and output levels in 1995-96 leading to a very welcome increase in export values for the rural sector. As a result of rising international commodity prices on the back of continuing world growth and a return to more average production levels locally after the drought affected outcomes of the past years—as a result of all of that—there will be a very positive outlook for the contribution the rural sector will make to Australia's growth in terms of both rising exports and prices.

         The total value of commodity exports is forecast to rise by 14.1 per cent to $56.9 billion in 1995-96. Mineral resources are forecast to contribute $6 billion in increased value of these exports and rural commodities $1 billion. As I have just said, these ABARE forecasts published today do not reflect a sector with `little chance of contributing to national growth', as claimed by Senator Ian Macdonald. They make a mockery of his claims, although, in here, of course, we are getting very used to that.

         The ABARE figures are underpinned by effective and clearly articulated government policies—something that the rural sector is still not getting from the opposition. Even in respect of such serious problems as drought, they are asking the questions and still getting no answers. Rural Australia is still waiting to hear any policy detail at all from this opposition, despite Senator Hill's boast, publicly made, that there are three folders stuffed full of opposition policies. Senator Hill, you have said publicly that you have got three folders stuffed full of opposition policies. It is about time you tabled them.

This follows a large increase in winter  plantings in Western Australia and southern grain growing areas. Dry warm weather with only patchy rainfall since sowing has unfortunately reduced your prospects for winter crops in Queensland and, as we know, despite recent rain, in northern New South Wales. These figures demonstrate that rural Australia is doing more than its fair share to contribute to national economy growth.

         But you ask what has changed since 1985 for families. Senator, let me start telling you a few of the things. We have thousands more child-care places that families with two parents working and families with one parent at home are now enjoying. That is one major change and benefit to Australian families. Secondly, as was the case in 1984 and certainly in 1985, none of the low income families in this country pay their Medicare levy. They are exempt from paying that, Senator, to assist them with the cost of health. Do you remember how those families could not go near the doctor before 1983 because two million of them were not insured? That is one of the other things that we have changed for Australian families.

         Do you remember the changes in social security, Senator, with targeted payments for families, benchmark payments for children below 13 and above 13—benchmarked for the first time ever and indexed to change with inflation? These were enormous benefits for families. The introduction of the parenting allowance was a huge benefit to Australian families.

         If you want to talk about what is of benefit to families, just remember, since you asked me, that these are just a few of the items. Consider what has happened to Australian families since we came into office. When we came to office, about 36 per cent—in the thirties—of children finished year 12. Now, around 80 per cent of children finish year 12. That is another thing Australian families really want for their children. Also, as of about next February families will be eligible for a maternity allowance on the occasion of the birth of a child, which is in recognition of the costs at that time in a family's life.

         I was asked: what has this government done for families? That is an excellent question. I have barely skimmed the surface. There are many things this government has done for families. If you pick out some of those items without looking at the whole comprehensive picture, you will get it wrong. You cannot look at tax without looking at payments. You cannot look at the benefits to families without looking at the implications of the Accord and the social wage, the benefits of Medicare and the benefits of education, as well as those targeted payments. This government now pays to Australian families over $12 billion in payments. That goes to those very Australian families you were citing a minute ago as being in big trouble.

The platform for action issued by the Beijing conference calls on governments to formally measure the value of women's unpaid work. Given this government's prodding of other nations at that conference to make concrete domestic commitments, how is the government going to translate this part of the Beijing platform into action? Does cabinet actually spend much time addressing the issue of the unpaid work of women and men? If you do measure the value of women's unpaid work, what are you then going to do with that information? Will you, for example, move to incorporate it into the national accounts?

         —Some advance encouragement to give her a substantive answer is the way in which I would describe it. I can only partially meet that obligation. In relation to measuring unpaid work, however, I can say that Australia is very well advanced as compared with most other countries. The ABS conducts a five-yearly survey of unpaid work—the time use survey. The 1993

         As to the kinds of estimates that have been made as to the value of that work, in 1992 the estimated total value of unpaid work was $227.8 billion—that is to say, nearly 60 per cent of GDP; 58 per cent in fact. Unpaid household work contributed $209.7 billion of that. The remaining $18.1 billion was comprised of volunteer and community work. Those figures are published in the

         But there are many aspects of social policy at the borderline of economic and social policy which are very appropriately addressed in the context of conferences like this—in particular, the Copenhagen conference a few months ago on economic and social development issues in which the kinds of strategies that Australia has developed, for example, through the Working Nation white paper for getting long-term unemployed people back to work and so on, were seen as right at the cutting edge of international policy development. Equally, there is no doubt that conferences of this kind are extremely useful in getting a better appreciation of what is already going on by way of policy addressing these issues and also in opening up new items on the international agenda for us to pursue.

         Today IBM graduated with distinction from the partnerships for development program. It has been in the program since 1988. As a consequence of that program and the partnership during that period, IBM exported $3 billion worth of equipment and product from Australia. In last year alone, it managed to export $550 million worth of information technology from Australia. This is an excellent example of how the government, working with major private sector companies, can target and influence the shape and size of an Australian industry and how the industry, basing itself in Australia on a competitive basis, can achieve major exports in the Asia-Pacific region.

         Working Nation, as everybody knows, is a $9 billion commitment over four years. It is a comprehensive strategy that aims to share the benefits of economic and employment growth with both the long-term unemployed and the regions in which they live.

In addition, he was able to announce the government's commitment of $11.5 million to new work opportunities programs, which will see up to 1,000 long-term unemployed people engaged in revegetation and other related activities developing the state's national parks and reserves.

We are prepared to deliver because we are a little bit more honest and a little bit more decent in our approach to these matters than you lot ever would be. My understanding, although I need to check this further, is that the particular limits which have been set by Mr Court and his government are significantly more stringent than the criteria that have been applied in the past—certainly for those royal commissions for whose carriage the Labor government has been responsible. I will be in a position to answer those questions hopefully in a little more detail a little later, if you can curb your impatience and wait till then.

In view of strong criticisms by friends of Dr Flynn of what they say is the inadequate response of the Australian consular service to his plight, what action has the minister taken to ensure that the human rights of this Australian citizen, which are claimed to have been disregarded by Australian authorities, are given the full protection that strong diplomatic representations could provide?

We share the concerns which have been articulated about many aspects of the handling of the case within the Indian system, particularly with regard to the delays in the High Court hearing of the case against his detention and some of the uncertainties and vagaries that have been involved on the criminal side of the equation.

         But it is simply utterly untrue to say that I, or my department, or the Australian High Commission in New Delhi, have been sitting on our hands, somehow lacking interest in this matter. I, for a start, raised the issue with one of my Indian counterparts when I was there in May. Senator McMullan did so as well earlier this year. High Commission officers have met with Dr Flynn on more than two dozen occasions, on top of numerous and often very long telephone conversations with him and his legal representatives concerning his detention, as you would expect in a matter of this complexity.

For a start, there is the question associated with criminal proceedings under the Customs Act which were initiated only after a long delay, are very slow and which have not yet got to the stage of even committal for trial. But, at Dr Flynn's request—and this has not featured very largely in the media campaign or the public relations firm's accounts of what is going on—the High Commission has been asked directly not to intervene in any of the judicial proceedings under the Customs Act.

         So far as the other proceeding, which is the present authority for his detention, that is under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, which is a form of administrative detention and, as such, highly colourable in principle, one would have thought; although it is subject to procedures for judicial review applications and a number of things of that kind: we have supported his legal case under that act.

         We were in fact on the verge of initiating a further legal action, just prior to the media campaign which started last week, which did involve an application for parole and which would have been followed by further application under section 11 of the relevant act for the revocation of the detention order. We have been asked now by Dr Flynn and his lawyers not to pursue that particular action. I am not quite sure why that is the case. One reason for not pursuing the parole action that has been bruited about in public statements recently is the suggestion that to proceed with the parole application would somehow jeopardise his situation because it would represent a kind of concession to the validity of the detention order.

I notice that today, in response to the kidnapping of three Australians in Somalia, you said that, as you knew the warlord involved, you would give him a phone call and try to get the people released. I am wondering whether we can have the same kind of high-level personal response in relation to Dr Flynn. When is there going to be a strong and effective protest to the Indian government over its treatment of Dr Flynn, or are we going to see him just rot in gaol or in an intensive care ward for the next 15 months?

         A dozen representations have been made under the detention matter which are completely distinct from the 10 representations that have been made on the medical matter and which are completely distinct from the two dozen or more consular visits or calls that have been made to him. This is a serious, sustained effort that has been made, yet all one gets for making such a serious and sustained effort are the kinds of allegations by Jackson Wells Communications and other miscellaneous high-priced public relations flakes which are sent out into the public domain.

         —We are not fuelling the French nuclear tests with our uranium. There is a small quantity of Australian uranium, representing about three per cent of the commercial power energy sources that are required, which goes into the civil side of the French system. That is subject to a bilateral safeguards arrangement. It is also subject, like similar arrangements of other nuclear weapon states, to a voluntary offer agreement which France has entered into and which enables the IAEA to verify that the designated nuclear material in France remains in civil use.

         The whole safeguard system, which as I said yesterday has been absolutely crucial to the maintenance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty regime since the 1960s, depends on the operations of those particular safeguards. If some ill-considered and misguided statements by French ministers have called into question the French commitment to those safeguard regimes, then the French have bought for themselves a much more serious problem than the one involving the supply of Australian uranium. What they have done is thrown into doubt the credibility of their commitment to a safeguards system which is applicable world wide and which is of fundamental importance, as I have just said, to the integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation system.

         We have absolutely nothing to apologise for so far as the supply of Australian uranium is concerned. It is not just a matter of making a commercial return and not having anything to be concerned about so far as the use of that uranium for military purposes is concerned. It is more than that. As I tried to explain to Senator Margetts, I think it was, the other day, all of those countries around the world that possess either nuclear technology or nuclear raw materials have an obligation under the non-proliferation treaty, because of the balance of obligations that were struck in that treaty, to make available that material or that technology, as the case may be, for peaceful purposes.

         That is the bargain that was struck in the 1960s to ensure that the then non-nuclear weapon states would not acquire nuclear weapons. They said, `We're prepared to go down that track provided we are guaranteed a supply of uranium or a supply of nuclear technology and provided we are not going to be prejudiced, inhibited or disadvantaged in any way.' Those other countries—the weapon states—accepted certain obligations to eventually eliminate their weapons and do a number of other things. Countries generally, including those in the position of Australia which possess this resource, were also obligated to follow a certain course.

         That is why we are sticking to our guns on this.

Does he also recall that the government's green paper on employment in December 1993 said that `for Australia to reduce its unemployment rate to five per cent by the year 2000, the economy would need to grow at an average rate of between 4 1/2 and five per cent' and also the Prime Minister's statement just six months ago that `we have got to grow at something like four to 4 1/2 per cent to keep unemployment coming down'? Given that growth is now well below that crucial figure of between four and five per cent, when will the Prime Minister honour his 1992 commitment and, to quote him, give it away?

It needed to be slowed down, for a whole variety of reasons which you and others were pressing upon us and which we readily acknowledged.

        I note that the minister really avoided my question, which was about the situation facing Australian families 10 years after Mr Keating's tax summit. All we got from the minister was a little list of expenditure items, which was her basis for asserting that families are better off. What her little list boiled down to was an assertion that there were more child-care places, which is the case, although it is ironic that she should make that claim when this Senate is debating a bill put forward by this government to limit Australians' access to child care and limit it in such a way that it will hurt low income families the most.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fact that there are more child-care places really is a response to demand for more child-care places, a demand in part resulting from Australian families now needing two incomes if they are to survive under this government's economic policies. Survey after survey has shown that Australian families are now saying they cannot survive on only one income under this government's policies. That is why there have to be more child-care places and that is why the government has had to meet that demand. This government, through its economic policies, is basically killing off the single income family. We will only be able to see that in museums after 12 1/2 years of this government.

         The other thing the minister cited was the maternity allowance. Okay, that is coming before this Senate, but that does not come in until 1 February 1996. Australians might well be quite cynical about the timing of that—very conveniently placed at about the time the next federal election is due. The maternity allowance itself represents a massive broken promise that was made to the trade union movement about the nature of the maternity allowance. It is a very big retreat from what was originally promised to Australians and Australian unions.

         She then also cited the parenting allowance. That was originally the home child-care allowance, which was nothing more than a name change from the dependent spouse rebate for families with children. All they did was a mirrors trick by changing the name and calling it something else. Now they have changed the name again. So it did not really amount to anything substantial in the way of an extra benefit for Australian families.

         The minister completely ignored the evidence of damage to Australian families after 10 years since the tax summit. This government deliberately engineered the worst recession in 60 years, which did massive damage to Australian families. One million people ended up on dole queues because of this government's deliberate policy of engineering a recession. Families and family businesses were ruined by what this government did.

         She completely ignored the tax record of the government. It is interesting to look at the budget papers for this coming year. We note that individuals' income tax went up 8.8 per cent in 1994-95 and is forecast to go up another 13.6 per cent in the next financial year. That is all paid by Australian families. What happened on sales tax, which is also all paid by Australian families at the end of the day? It went up 10.7 per cent in 1994-95 and is forecast to go up another 13.4 per cent in 1995-96.

We had the disastrous increase in sales tax on vehicles—a direct broken promise in itself, a broken promise which will mean that Australian families now have to pay $1,000 more to buy an ordinary Australian vehicle like a Falcon or a Commodore as a result of this government's policies.

They obviously make no apology for that. They want their friends, who do not want to pay tax and are trying to avoid it, and who do not get a number of these benefits, to be able to have more money. But they also want to make sure that those in low socioeconomic groups and on low incomes actually have to buy more things.

         If he is talking about the superannuation levy he may have an argument. To work out which is regarded as a tax and which is not, apply the income tax test. If something is allowable against your earnings, then it is not regarded as a tax. If it is disallowed, it is defined as a tax. In the case of superannuation—it is added wages that an employer pays and sends off to a superannuation company—if the employer does not do that or there is a shortfall, then the superannuation guarantee comes in. That then becomes a tax and the employer cannot claim that as a tax deduction. You cannot have it both ways. I believe that whatever is taken off an employee and employer by law should be regarded as a tax.

         So when this government, or any government, decides by law to take money away from an employer or an employee and put it in a private institution to do a job that the government eventually has to do—that is, provide pensions—then, by providing superannuation instead of a pension, that should be regarded as a tax. When you properly lump that together, you will find that we rank about the middle of OECD countries, no matter what sort of excuses the government makes in comparing us with any of those other OECD countries. That is where we finish up because that money is compulsorily taken from employers and employees and goes to those institutions.

         The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has said that President Chirac is a liar.

         Senator Evans is relying on a piece of paper, the NPT, when he knows very little about the actual administration of the NPT. For instance, as we will show later in the week when we get some more evidence to support this, France, as a nuclear weapons state, has a civil program which technically comes under the NPT and the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection process, but at the same time has a nuclear weapons program which is excluded from the NPT and the IAEA inspections.

         We will produce evidence later in the week which will show that due to that conflict of activity within the same facility—that is, using low enrichment uranium for the civil program and high enrichment uranium for the military program—the IAEA inspectors are excluded from carrying out comprehensive inspections. It is quite conceivable, even theoretically, that under the NPT and the IAEA inspections, Australian uranium can find its way into nuclear weapons.

         I do not want Senator Evans trying to confuse the issue by saying that we are trying to identify uranium atom for atom. We are well aware of the fact that when a batch of uranium goes in for enrichment, it may be 10 per cent uranium from Australia and 90 per cent from somewhere else. When it comes out, 10 per cent might go into civil programs. But based on the evidence we put before the Senate as long ago as 1989, we are arguing that after that process, uranium scraps from Australia, clearly labelled as such, were swapped with highly enriched uranium which went into the military program.

         I am well aware that there are clauses in the NPT which, confusingly, require nuclear states, states with nuclear technology and nuclear facilities, to share those with states which do not possess that. Many of us in the anti-nuclear movement for decades have been pointing out the stupidity of having both an exploitative and expansive set of clauses built into a facility which should be actually controlling an activity. There is a conflict of interest in there. I wonder whether, in the recent renegotiation of the NPT, the Australian government sought to remove those clauses which so confuse the issue.

I do not think that is justified. I think that Australia should desist from exporting its uranium to France, where it does find its way into French nuclear weapons. That is what concerns the majority of Australian people, and they want this government to stop that export.

        What an extraordinary answer it was. Senator Crowley sought to tell this Senate that there was nothing wrong with child care in this country. Senator Crowley, against all facts, sought to tell the Senate that, in fact, Christmas carols were not being banned; grace was not being banned; there was nothing to worry about at all. Of course, Senator Crowley has never been one to let the facts get in the way of her own prejudices, and what a remarkable demonstration of that we had today.

         The facts are that child care under Senator Crowley is an abomination and a failure. It is an abomination and a failure which distresses the vast majority of Australian people. It is a fact that Santa Claus was banned at Hornbrook in Melbourne. It is a fact that Christmas carols were banned in Coburg. I would not be surprised if they banned Senator Crowley, but banning Christmas carols is another story. It is a fact that Santa Claus was banned at Erskine Park in Sydney. Now we have a case where grace was banned at a child-care centre in Newcastle on the grounds that it was culturally inappropriate.

         Senator Crowley disputed the fact that the government was seeking to have 560 child-care reviewers. She said that was garbage. Unfortunately, when Senator Crowley, the minister, put a message in the September issue of

Either Senator Crowley does not have a clue what is happening in her portfolio, or Senator Crowley is trying to mislead the Senate. I am going to be charitable and say it is not the latter.

Let's start at the top, and let's get rid of the minister and put in somebody who is actually capable of delivering.

        The petition of the undersigned shows: the unjust and inequitable nature of the Government's policy to restrict Childcare Assistance where a parent is outside the workforce to 12 hours per week. This policy will cause hardship to lower income families, to the children of those families, and child care workers. The Government should be condemned for breaking its promise to ensure access and affordability in child care.

        Under the Government's policy parents will have to pay full cost fees after 12 hours of childcare per week if one parent is outside the workforce. This will widen the gap between rich and poor, and many child care workers may lose their jobs.

        I refer to Statutory Rules 1995 No 55 being the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicle Standards) Regulations which are presently before the Committee. The proposed Regulations provide a set of standards, uniform throughout Australia, for the construction and performance of heavy motor vehicles and trailers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Proposed Regulation 7 provides that the Minister may exempt a specified vehicle from a requirement of the Heavy Vehicle Standards on being satisfied after applying a number of criteria. Section 18 of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act 1993
        </emphasis>
        provides for the delegation of this power and the subdelegation of it thereafter. The exercise of the discretion may be of considerable commercial value. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether there is a right to an independent review of the exercise of this discretion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee also draws your attention to the strict liability provisions. Proposed subregulation 9(1) provides strict liability in relation to the failure of a trailer to comply with a requirement in the proposed Regulations. Whereas it may be reasonable that the owner of the trailer and the driver of a vehicle towing the trailer should be subject to strict liability, the Committee notes with concern that "the owner of any motor vehicle towing the trailer" would be subject to the same liability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee is concerned that in some circumstances, according strict liability to the owner of a vehicle may be unreasonable. Under the proposed subregulation in its present form, the owner of a stolen vehicle which is then used to tow a trailer which does not comply with the proposed Regulations, would be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of up to $2000, if an individual, or $10,000 if a body corporate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee is similarly concerned about the strict liability accorded to "the owner of a motor vehicle forming part of the combination" in subregulation 10(1). Again, if the theft-and-unauthorised-use situation is applied it is possible that an unreasonable result may follow.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice in respect of the strict liability provisions. In particular the Committee would welcome your advice as to whether the strict liability of owners of vehicles in the circumstances described above may be avoided.

        The States and Territories are adopting national arrangements such as those included in the Heavy Vehicle Standards and Oversize and Overmass Vehicles Regulations into existing State/Territory legislation pending finalisation of the integrated road transport legislation.

        In relation to the Committee's concern to provide protection against unfair consequences resulting from the application of the strict liability provisions, it is proposed to attach liability to the "operator" of the vehicle rather than the "owner".

        As noted earlier, the Committee appreciated your helpful reply and I will report to the Senate on your assistance. Nevertheless, the Committee would be grateful if similar undertakings and assurances could be given by the Minister for Transport who, the Committee understands, is responsible for the administration of the relevant parent Act. I would be grateful if you can arrange with your Minister to give the Committee such an assurance. The reason for seeking this additional assurance is that the regulations are part of a uniform national legislative scheme, which presents particular challenges for legislative scrutiny committees. These challenges have been recognised in the Administrative Review Council Report on Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies and in the discussion paper Scrutiny of National Scheme Legislation and the Desirability of Uniform Scrutiny Principles, drafted by a working party of Chairs of scrutiny of legislation committees throughout Australia. Also, both sets of regulations will commence upon notification in the

        The Committee would also be grateful if you could arrange for a progress report on the matters in your letter.   I would be grateful if you could indicate to the Committee that you will be able to provide such a progress report by 24 November 1995. This will enable the Committee to consider the report before the Christmas recess.

        Such legislation presents special challenges for legislative scrutiny committees.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recently the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances scrutinised regulations which were made as part of such a uniform national scheme. The scheme in question was given effect at the Commonwealth level by the

         National Road Transport Commission Act 1991
        </emphasis>
        , which included as a schedule an agreement between the Commonwealth, all States and the Australian Capital Territory. The agreement recited that there should be improvements to road safety, efficiency and administrative costs; and that this necessitates uniform or consistent legislation throughout Australia, to be achieved by a cooperative legislative scheme. The agreement further recited that the essential element of the scheme was that the Commonwealth would make law for the ACT which would be the model for legislation by the States and Northern Territory, which in turn would enact laws consistent with the model. The agreement also established a Ministerial Council, the approval of which was necessary before the model law could be made. The approval of the Ministerial Council is also necessary for the amendment of the model law.

        , which expressly provided that it forms part of the national scheme envisaged by the National Road Transport Commission Act. It further provided that its purpose was to empower the making of laws for the Australian Capital Territory which are intended to be adopted by the States and the Northern Territory. The Act did not itself include any substantive provisions dealing with vehicles or traffic, instead providing that regulations may be made in respect of these matters. It was these regulations which are the legislative basis of the scheme as it affects users and which came before the Committee in the same way as other Commonwealth regulations.

Both sets of regulations apply to the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory only, but each expressly provides that their purpose is to provide a set of standards uniform or consistent throughout Australia. Both Explanatory Statements advise that the regulations will be incorporated into the law of each of the States and the Northern Territory.

        The Committee scrutinised these regulations in the usual way and found that several provisions were cause for concern. The most important of these were provisions under which vehicles may be exempted from the prescribed standards. Such exemptions, which may apply to individual vehicles, could have commercial benefit for operators. There appeared to be, however, no provision for independent review of decisions adverse to vehicle owners or operators. The Committee normally would consider that review of administrative discretions which may confer a commercial advantage is essential. In addition, one of the sets of regulations provided for strict liability offences, for which the Committee usually seeks an explanation. The Committee raised these matters formally with the Minister.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, the Hon Neil O'Keefe MP, responded to the Committee's concerns on 6 June 1995, attaching detailed advice from the National Road Transport Commission. The Committee considered the reply and requested further advice on the issues of concern. The Parliamentary Secretary replied on 29 August 1995, advising that appropriate review provisions would be included in proposed new regulations to replace the present provisions and that the strict liability provisions would be amended to meet the Committee's concerns. The proposed amendments would be submitted expeditiously to the Ministerial Council. In the meantime, the present regulations would not be commenced until the Ministerial Council agreed to the new regulations. The Parliamentary Secretary also arranged for additional material from the National Road Transport Commission to be sent to the Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Normally the Committee would regard this reply as entirely satisfactory and the Committee congratulates the Parliamentary Secretary on his commitment to ensuring that delegated legislation provides the highest possible safeguards for personal rights. In this case, however, the Committee wrote again to Mr O'Keefe. The reason for this is that while the Committee accepts undertakings from Ministers, who are answerable in Parliament for their actions, the Ministerial Council, which under the uniform national scheme must approve the amendments, is not directly answerable in this way. The Committee therefore asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he could arrange for the Minister for Transport to give similar assurances, both sets of regulations providing for commencement upon a date notified in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Gazette
        </emphasis>
        by the Commonwealth Minister. The Committee also requested a report in three months on progress with the new regulations. In addition, the Committee wrote to the Chairs of State and Territory legislative scrutiny Committees describing its actions in this matter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Parliamentary Secretary then replied to the Committee, confirming that he had the authority to act on behalf of the Minister in this matter and that neither set of regulations would commence before the Ministerial Council agreed to the replacement regulations. The Committee accepted this reply but agreed to keep the matter under review, the present sets of regulations being only the first module of a number of successive modules to implement the entire national scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have reported to the Senate in some detail on this matter because of the unusual procedures mandated by the national uniform legislative scheme under which these regulations were made. These procedures, required by an agreement between the executives of the Commonwealth, States and mainland Territories, in effect oblige the Commonwealth to make delegated legislation under a Commonwealth Act only with the approval of a Ministerial Council and not to amend that legislation without similar approval. The Committee agreed that the agreement would not constrain its usual scrutiny of the regulations and, with the helpful cooperation of the Parliamentary Secretary, Neil O'Keefe, I am pleased to report to the Senate that undertakings have been given in respect of the regulations which ensure that the high standards of the Committee are maintained.

        Under Guideline 17, the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) may impose or vary the conditions of licences without regard to nearly all the other provisions of the Guidelines. Guideline 18 states that holders of licences are to be involved in the alteration and consent process and must agree before the Guidelines may be breached. The only holders who may be involved in the process, however,  are those holders of licences whose services, in the opinion of the SMA, may be affected by the variation or imposition of a condition under Guideline 17.

        I can advise that while the SMA does not consider it is exercising `discretions', the decisions it makes under MDS Guideline 17 can be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 292 of the Act. While a number of the Guidelines refer to the existence of particular facts or circumstances, the SMA does not exercise `discretions' under the Guidelines. Rather, under section 112 of the Act, the SMA is required to comply with the Guidelines when exercising its powers to impose or vary Multipoint Distribution Station (MDS) licence conditions.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The SMA advises that compliance with the Guidelines by the SMA is relevant to the exercise of the SMA's power under paragraph 107(1)(g) of the Act to specify particular conditions in an apparatus licence. The SMA's compliance with the Guidelines is also relevant to the SMA's power under section 111 of the Act to impose further conditions on a licence or to revoke or vary existing conditions. Under section 288 of the Act, any person affected by a decision under either of those provisions may request the SMA to reconsider the decision, and if dissatisfied with the result on reconsideration, may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 292 of the Act for review of the decision. This would include the holders of any type of apparatus licence whose services may be affected by a decision by the SMA, in reliance on Guidelines 17 and 18, to impose or vary licence conditions without regard to other of the Guidelines.

You asked how the words ". . . in the opinion of the SMA, may be affected by the operation of an MDS or other transmitter. . .

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In its letter of 1 June 1995, the Committee sought information on whether the exercise of the discretions, conferred on the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) in Guidelines 17 and 18, are subject to an independent review on the merits. In my reply of 22 June 1995, I advised that decisions made under these Guidelines were reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I also indicated that the SMA considers that it does not exercise discretions under the Guidelines. This means that the SMA does not exercise discretionary powers under the Guidelines; such powers are exercised under the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Radiocommunications Act 1992
        </emphasis>
        (the Act).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The SMA advises that the formation of an opinion such as that required by Guideline 18 is, generally speaking, of no import or effect if it is not coupled with some further action such as the exercise of a power, be it statutory or executive. It is for this reason that review provisions are directed at the exercise of statutory powers, rather than specifically at the formation of the state of mind that is to precede the exercise of powers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I understand that the SMA drew the distinction in this case so as to make clear to the Committee the reasons why the Guidelines did not themselves contain the relevant review provisions. In other words, the SMA was seeking to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that, in the case of the licences that are the subject of the Guidelines, the criteria for the exercise of the powers in sections 107(l)(g) and 111 of the Act are contained in Guideline 17, whilst the relevant powers are contained in the sections themselves. This is a somewhat unusual circumstance but is one dictated by the form of the Act itself, as section 112 of the Act provides for statutory criteria to be imposed by means of disallowable instrument, in this case, the Guidelines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The SMA advises that, although it is conceivable that in some circumstances the formation of the opinion without a corresponding exercise of power could be of some import or have an effect, such circumstances would be relatively rare. For example, if licensees were to avail themselves of the statutory conciliation process to deal with alleged interference between services, the SMA could be asked to provide an opinion on whether one service might interfere with another. That opinion could then be of some importance in the conciliation process and directly or indirectly affect the outcome.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I advised earlier, the exercise of the powers of the SMA to impose and vary licence conditions under sections 107(l)(g) and 111 of the Act is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is through this mechanism that the question of whether the statutory criteria for the exercise of those powers have been met, may also be reviewed. I trust that this explanation meets the Committee's concerns.

        I thank my colleagues for supporting the motion in a spirit of bipartisanship. Today I am calling for the federal government to act with urgency on the enormous environmental problems associated with goldmine tailings dams—also known as impoundment areas, concentrator residue impoundment areas or slime dumps—in Australia. There are at least 164 such goldmine tailings dams in Australia and a great proportion of them do not fulfil the federal government's own statement of best practice environmental management in mining projects. This is an inadequacy which can and does have enormous ecological consequences for wildlife, ground water, vegetation and human health in the area of the tails dam.

         Windara mine near Laverton was the site of the death of 60,000 budgerigars killed by cyanide gas from the mine tailing in 1985. In the goldfields, toxicity problems are not monitored and could be a source of similar environmental catastrophe in the future if the problem is not addressed by this government immediately. International examples include the Ok Tedi case of the BHP goldmine on the Fly River, which is well known, and the Omai goldmine in Guyana, which on Saturday 19 August experienced a tailings dam collapse where huge amounts of cyanide and copper were leached into the environment.

         More accurately, the people of Omai experienced the tailings collapse. An estimated 90,000 cubic metres of cyanide loaded water from the tailings washed into the river per hour and then into the Essequibo River on which the people of Omai rely for drinking. The leakage was let run unchecked by the company for five days before it was sealed, by which time four million cubic metres of tailings water was in the river. Immediately, the World Health Organisation's health and environment adviser was called and warned residents along the river to stop using the water for cooking or drinking. Aquatic life along the Omai and Essequibo rivers was described by the adviser as being completely destroyed.

         In addition to the cyanide problems involved in negligently constructed tailing structures, mine tailings dams are highly saline. One of the major discrepancies between the government's current best practice guidelines for tailings dams and the design of tailings dams in the field is the issue of the use of lining membranes on the perimeters of the dam. The great proportion of currently operative and proposed tailings structures are not lined. This problem was highlighted in a keynote speech to the Third International Conference on Environmental Issues and Waste Management in Energy and Mineral Production in Perth in August 1994.

         As a result of being unlined, both the highly toxic cyanide compounds and the salt from the tails water soak through the floor of the dam and into the watertable. The ramifications of this effect are threefold. Firstly, salinity in ground water limits the possible uptake of water by vegetation on the perimeter and surrounds of the dam. It is reduced in the roots of plants, particularly tall eucalypts, because the salt concentration gradient between the soil and the plant root that is necessary for osmosis to continue is unbalanced or reversed in the presence of this highly saline soil and the osmosis stops. Often plant root cell membrane damage results from causing water to move out of the plant through the roots, and the plant dies and dries out. This occurs even in the salt tolerant plants found in the goldfields, and eucalypts can die within days of their roots coming into contact with the high concentration of salinity from leaked tails water.

         Secondly, the cyanide contained in tails water absorbed by the soil pollutes ground water that may be accessed by nearby towns and mining camps, having potentially fatal effects. Thirdly, the leakage of cyanide in goldmining areas can have an economic effect, in that it chemically reacts with any gold in the soil and makes it unable to be extracted. If successfully managed, a tailings impoundment can be a relatively minor hazard. It is the instability of tailings dams that causes the leakage of lethal cyanide gas and the lack of proper containment facilities that creates the dangers of salinity and cyanide filtration into the soil.

         An awareness of these problems is outlined in the government's own statement on best practice, yet these practices are almost unanimously shirked by proponents of the mining industry.

         The apparent lack of proper care for the environment at the Northparkes mine does give me cause for concern about the company's proposal to develop a new mine at Lake Cowal, which is some 150 kilometres south of the existing Northparkes mine. Lake Cowal is an important wetland, as it is a significant drought refuge when other parts of the state are dry. It is utilised by a large number of water birds. Many species of water birds actually breed at Lake Cowal. The lake also supports a commercial fishing industry when the lake is full.

I understand from officers in my own department that there have been other significant kills of native birds from cyanide poisoning in tailings dams in other parts of Australia. Obviously, there are a lot of tailings dams associated with the goldmining industry in this country. In fact, some 100 tailings dams exist here.

         As I have been informed, it is a relatively simple management procedure to prevent native bird deaths from cyanide in tailings dams by minimising the amount of water that is stored in tailings dams and minimising the concentration of free cyanide in the tailings dams to a level of less than 50 parts per million, which is not harmful to wildlife. Given the cost of cyanide, I would also assume that mine managers would be keen to recycle and reuse as much of this cyanide as possible. Two relatively simple procedures—bird deaths on tailings dams and a risk of bird kills—could obviously be significantly reduced. I hope that those with responsibility for mine management would take account of those measures and others that might be able to be utilised to ensure that we do not face the similar situation that occurred at Northparkes.

I think Senator Faulkner drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that cyanide in tailings water at goldmines located near wetlands can be a threat to migratory birds. Desert wildlife and bird life generally remain close to permanent water supplies but, in times of drought or bushfires, the birds sometimes have to find other supplies of water and feed, otherwise they would die through lack of water or starvation. Therefore, they are sometimes attracted to tailings dams. If they go to tailings dams which are toxic, death can result as well.

         As I said, there is an issue which Senator Chamarette has brought to the attention of the Senate. I think companies these days that do not observe high environmental standards do pay a community price, and that price has been paid by Northparkes mine. I think all of us would agree that these things must be avoided in the future and that companies themselves have to be eternally vigilant in this regard. I now foreshadow the amendment I will move to Senator Chamarette's motion. It states:

         —There are several issues that come out of this matter of the death of birds, not only at this particular site in New South Wales, but, as Senator Chamarette has pointed out, in a number of other sites around the world. Of course, it impacts on human health as well in Guyana and a number of other places. The level which was mentioned in the

         I think there are a couple of things that come out of this matter, though. The first one is that, no matter how well you do EISs, when companies do EISs and present them, there is no guarantee whatsoever that the information contained in those EISs is even reliable, let alone that the imposition of standards through the EIS and assessment process will in fact be observed. I think in this case we have probably seen a company that has been very slick with its advertising, has in fact won some awards and got away with it. Unfortunately for it, of course, it has got caught out and I think the

         So I make a plea; it is a plea that has been made often enough in the past. Environmental impact statements need to be made independently of the proposers of projects, they need to be independently assessed, and there needs to be independent monitoring, not monitoring by the companies of their own operations. I think that comes clearly out of all these cases of pollution of tailings dams with cyanide and the death of birds and the other environmental impacts that we have seen.

         The main point I wanted to pick up this afternoon was touched on incorrectly, briefly by Senator Faulkner when he talked about the sustainability of mining. Of course, when we are mining minerals, we are in fact carrying out an unsustainable activity, by definition. These are non-renewable resources, and I think it is very interesting that we are having this debate today, the day after we saw the World Bank figures which showed that Australia, on a per capita basis, is the richest country in the world.

The point I want to make, the point I want to stress, is that those are not real figures. Those are the capital values of the gold whether it is in the ground or whether it is taken out of the ground. There is no value whatsoever in mining that gold. That gold will still be there in 10 years, in 20 years, in 100 years time if our children or our descendants want eventually to mine it.

         I asked Senator Gareth Evans an important question yesterday, and in response he gave me this booklet `National Balance Sheets of Australia' which shows that the Australian Bureau of Statistics had attempted, quite incorrectly, to make some assessment of the capital value of Australia's assets. The whole point about this is that we should be keeping different accounts. What we have seen in this case is massive pollution, massive environmental damage in an area which could go on producing benefits for generations of native animals, of native plants, of Australians for thousands and thousands of years, measured against the immediate exploitation of a non-renewable resource which, if the accounting was done properly, would simply show that we had shifted $250 million out of our bank balance as a resource in the ground into cash flow.

         When one looks at the accounting done properly, the accounting done as every business in this country would do its accounting, namely, keeping a capital account and a cash flow account, one can readily see that in this particular case we have the exploitation of a non-renewable resource for very, very little value whatsoever—actually, the value added to the gold in extracting it, not the value of the mineral in the ground, and at the expense of enormous environmental damage.

Effectively, companies are given a very significant right in this country which allows them to either mine or harvest certain natural resources and it is about time that they followed up that right that is given to them by giving some respect to the environment and demonstrating that respect.

The second thing I share with Senator Chamarette is a very serious and long-term interest in ensuring that our environment is protected from degradation and spoil in the course of economic development. I have always been committed to that and believe that most of the Australian society demands a very sensible balance between economic development and protection of the environment, unlike Senator Coulter, who has now left the chamber but who believes that goldmining is an unsustainable activity.

         In what could only be described as fairies at the bottom of the garden type economics, Senator Coulter said that gold is worth the same in the ground as it is out of the ground. The reality is that you actually have to go through the process of getting the gold out of the ground to make it worth anything. In many parts of Australia and through generations of Australia's history, the balance between extracting gold from the ground and the price you get for gold is one of the crucial determinants in Australia's national financial success.

        I suspect Senator Coulter would not have wanted some of those important contributions to the world economy from Australia's goldmining and mining industries to have occurred anyway. He probably would not want a heavy chemicals industry or, indeed, oil exploration in the Middle East. The reality in world history is that Australia has been a leader in mining.

         There is another reason I support the now entirely agreed set of words. It is important that the mining companies themselves—I think Senator Murphy made this point very well—have a very strong sense of responsibility. I am sure they do. I do not think North Ltd would have set out at the EIS stage of the mining operation or at the feasibility stage, or at any stage of the development of this mine, to have a tailings dam that would have the environmental consequences that have very unfortunately occurred during the past few months. I am sure they earnestly sought to ensure that such devastation did not occur. I am quite sure that with their proposed dam at Lake Cowal their good intentions will also be there. Good intentions are simply not enough when you are dealing with sensitive environmental matters. There is no doubt that in a wetlands situation the potential for environmental damage is very high.

The mining companies these days do have a number of matters they need to take into account.

That created an enormous threat to not only the wildlife, the fish and the other life in and around that river, but also the population of something like 18,000 people who live on and around that river and who rely on that river not only for drinking water but also for the sustenance of their farms and animals.

It will ensure that, where a company is required not to allow cyanide levels to reach toxic states, that will have to be more closely monitored. It will ensure that when tailings dams are built the floors of those dams, whether they be clay or some sort of plastic, are not going to be penetrated and cause risk to the environment.

         It has been said to the Senate many times, but it bears repeating, that goldmining is an extraordinarily valuable industry as far as this country is concerned. If you take steaming coal and coking coal together, they are our No. 1 export at $8 billion, but gold is our No. 2 export at $5.3 billion every year. It is a major industry and one that is certainly not going to go away and one that we should be quite rightly concerned about.

         There has been enormous growth in gold mining. For example, in Australia in 1987-88 there were 119 tonnes of gold mined. This has gone up to about 260 tonnes of gold in 1994-95. There is tremendous growth in goldmining in Australia, quite apart from its significance as an export. I think some history will help us better understand the unfortunate circumstances that happened with North Ltd's Northparkes mine where some 2,000 birds, the company itself has admitted, were killed by its tailings dam—2,000 birds which included significant numbers of endangered species.

         You have to go back to the introduction of the gold tax in 1986, something which I remember very clearly because I was working as a stockbroker at the time and I was buying and selling mining company shares. What happened in 1986 when the Labor government decided to introduce a gold tax or proper taxation on gold companies was that there was an enormous scramble amongst gold mining companies to mine very high grade ore. That rush continued from 1986 until 1990 when the tax was finally effected.

         What then happened was that these companies had to find some way to maintain their earnings for their shareholders and they had to mine lower and lower grades of ore. To give you an example of that, in 1986 it was reasonable for a mine to be mining some five grams per tonne of gold in its ore. That is a very tiny amount of gold and a very large amount of ore.

         If you look at what is happening today, the Telfer mine, which is a major mine, is now operating on just over one gram per tonne and it has been able to do that with the increasing use of more sophisticated technology. In this case, it is cyanide leaching technology. Cyanide, to anyone, is a highly reactive substance and is very dangerous, indeed. There has been pressure, in other words, on the gold companies to use new technology and this has led to the sorts of risks we have today.

         The problem will not go away. ABARE has forecast there is increasing demand for gold. It is a major source of export earnings. Companies have to maintain their dividends so it is natural that there will be an increasing use of technology to deliver these sorts of results. I think that is the point from which we should take some lessons.

         What we need to do is better understand how industry works to come at these problems not just from the environmental protection angle, which is where this problem has landed in our lap, or from heritage considerations where people are concerned about the value of the natural environment but also to anticipate what companies are going to do—what sort of technologies they are going to use which are going to lead to these sorts of degradations. In that respect, the motion before the Senate is entirely appropriate because unless we address things in this fashion what we will have is the perpetual situation where we are closing the door after the horse has bolted and that serves no-one any good at all.

         —Unfortunately, what statements were made by the government on 7 August 1995 in conjunction with the managing director of North Ltd may well have been a public relations invention. As that was happening, North knew about its own tailings dam and it was saying things about international best practice. The reality is quite different.

         What we are talking about today is not an isolated incident. We have had mentioned by a number of people other dams in which birds have died. I am a bit concerned about the comments of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) that he was aware of about 100 tailings dams throughout Australia because the reality is that in Western Australia alone we have about 164 known gold tailings dams. In parts of the Pilbara there could be many more that have not been traced or located yet because of the nature of some of the operations.

         If we do not know where the dams are, there is no way of monitoring whether they are complying to any conditions. Almost none of them are lined in Western Australia. If the reality of the situation was brought out in an inquiry, perhaps we could put some of these statements at rest, that what we are dealing with is a nasty isolated incident and that once it appears to be dealt with everything will be sorted out.

         If a small miner in those areas breaches environmental conditions, someone is down on them like a ton of bricks. But if a large miner, like KCGM, breaches not only once but continues to breach the conditions and does not fix up the problem year after year, as long as they say, `We might have to move out if these conditions are enforced,' they do not have to fix up the problem. That is the problem. It is an ongoing thing. The bigger you are the more immune you are from the realities of whatever state or federal laws exist to try to fix the problem.

         The reality is that this is happening again and again. From the Greens' point of view, any action that takes place must firstly recognise the extent of the problem in Western Australia in particular and right across the country. Secondly, that recognition must go beyond a public relations exercise and make sure that in the future communities and the environment will be looked at seriously and that urgent action is taken, not just a glossing over.

         Introduction
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         1. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994 (the Bill) was introduced in the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994. On 8 February 1995, the House of Representatives referred the Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities (the Committee) for consideration and an advisory report. The Committee's report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 2 March 1995. The House of Representatives subsequently amended the Bill to take account of the Committee's recommendations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         2. The Bill was introduced into the Senate on 23 March 1995. On 23 August 1995, the Senate referred Items 1 to 4, inclusive, of Schedule 4 of the Bill to the Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee's report was tabled in the Senate on 30 August 1995.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         3. The Government thanks the members of the Committee for their willingness to take the reference at short notice, and for providing their report in such a timely fashion.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         4. Together with the Committee, the Government acknowledges the valuable contribution made by those persons who appeared before the Committee to give evidence, and who provided written submissions to the inquiry.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         5. Items 1-4 of Schedule 4 to the Bill introduces a new distinction between large and small proprietary companies. The concepts of exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies are to be abolished. Currently, exempt proprietary companies must prepare annual accounts, but are not required to have them audited or lodged with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). A non-exempt proprietary company must lodge audited accounts with the ASC. (A proprietary company whose shares are held by a public company or a foreign company is non-exempt.)
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         6. The Bill will require large proprietary companies to lodge audited accounts with the ASC. A proprietary company will be `large' if it satisfies at least two of the following three criteria:

        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">

        <para font-size="-=2">
         7. Under Corporations Law subsection 313(2), the Commission may relieve a company from compliance with specified requirements of the Law relating to the audit of accounts. Corporations Law subsection 313(11) defines the circumstances in which the Commission may make an order under subsection 313(2). They include the circumstance where compliance with the requirements would impose unreasonable burdens on the company or a class of companies. Therefore, if to require certain large proprietary companies to comply with the audit requirements of the Law would impose unreasonable burdens on those companies, the Commission will be able to make an order relieving those companies of the obligation to comply with those requirements.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         8. The Committee noted concerns that the audit requirement to be imposed on large proprietary companies by the Bill may not be justified in some cases.

         9. The Committee made the following recommendation to address this concern:

         The Bill be amended to provide that in exercising its discretion under section 313 of the Corporations Law to exempt a large proprietary company, or class of large proprietary companies, from the audit requirement the Australian Securities Commission should have regard to, but not be limited by, the following criteria:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         10. The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation. It proposes that the Bill be amended to require the ASC to have regard to the matters identified by the Committee in the exercise of its discretion to relieve a large proprietary company of the requirement to have its accounts audited.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         11. The Committee indicated in its report that it anticipates that the ASC will exercise by way of a class order its discretion to exempt large proprietary companies from the requirement to appoint an auditor. The Chairman of the ASC, Mr Cameron, indicated to the Committee that if the Bill were passed in its present form the ASC would engage in full public consultation to identify appropriate classes, which would in turn be publicly exposed for comment. The Committee made the following recommendation:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 2
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee recommends that the exercise of the ASC's discretionary power in the manner described in Recommendation 1 be made subject to a process of public consultation and scrutiny. The Committee also recommends that the ASC include in its Annual Report details of how it has complied with its procedures.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         12. The Government agrees that class orders should be made following a transparent consultation process, and that the ASC should include details of this in its annual reports. The Chairman of the ASC has advised the Attorney-General that in the exercise of this discretion the ASC would adopt a process of public consultation and scrutiny.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         13. The Committee considered that the small/large distinction and the criteria for granting exemptions should be examined in the light of their application in practice and of the need to ensure that companies of significant economic importance meet higher reporting standards. It also considered that the cost to the commercial community of the exemption process should be reviewed. The Committee made the following recommendation:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         14. The Government agrees that these matters should be reviewed after a period of two years.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         15. The Committee considered that a large proprietary company may face difficulties in meeting the audit obligation if the obligation is imposed some time after the commencement of the company's financial year. The Committee made the following recommendation:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 4
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In view of the delay in the commencement of the legislation, the Committee recommends that the Bill be amended to defer the commencement of the audit obligation on large proprietary companies until the 1996-97 financial year.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         16. The Government acknowledges the Committee's concern, and proposes to amend the Bill to provide that the first financial year for which large proprietary companies must have their accounts audited is the first financial year that starts after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         17. Currently, exempt proprietary companies are not required to lodge their accounts with the ASC if they appoint an auditor. Some of these companies will be large proprietary companies after the Bill is enacted, and will therefore have to lodge audited accounts with the Commission. To avoid undue disruption to the commercial arrangements of these companies, the Bill proposes that existing proprietary companies which have their annual accounts audited, which are large and which elect to continue operating under the existing rules (`grandfathered companies') will not need to lodge their accounts with the ASC (proposed subsection 317B(3)).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         18. The Committee supported proposed subsection 317B(3) in its report of 2 March 1995. However, the Committee reconsidered the matter in light of the evidence presented during its recent reference. In its report of 30 August, the Committee referred to concerns that proposed subsection 317B(3) would allow a business already being audited, and coming within the large category, to be indefinitely exempted from lodging financial statements. The Committee made the following recommendation:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 5
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Whilst not within the Committee's terms of reference, the Committee considers that the proposed section 317B(3) (the "grandfathering" clause) in the Bill be amended to include a sunset period of three years from the date of commencement of the legislation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         19. The Government notes that Recommendation 5 was not within the Committee's terms of reference, and that persons who would be adversely affected by this recommendation were not given an opportunity to comment on the issue.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For this reason, the Government considers it would not be appropriate at this stage to amend the Bill to include a sunset period for proposed subsection 317B(3).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         20. However, the Government recognises the need to closely monitor the impact of proposed subsection 317B(3) on affected persons and companies. The Government therefore proposes that the operation of subsection 317B(3) be reviewed after it has been in force for two years. This could occur as part of the same review, recommended by the Committee and accepted by the Government, of the operation of the small/large distinction for proprietary companies.

        This bill is an incredibly complex area of legislation because it is an amending bill, amending a 1982 bill which itself has a number of schedules. Parts of this proposed legislation impact on other legislation. Some of it is picked up elsewhere, in matters not strictly before us today. But, in discussion on the amendments I will be moving on behalf of Senator Kernot, some of these other bits of legislation will be mentioned. That is the reason it has been rather difficult to get a handle on some of this.

         The first amendment goes to schedule 10 on page 31 of the amending bill. From time to time we will need to refer to pages and sections in the original legislation as well. The clause in the amending bill proposes omitting the subsection, substituting words to the effect that the designated authority must from time to time, as soon as it is practicable to do so, prepare a document setting out a number of particulars, which it lists. Our amendment is to the effect that the designated authority must from time to time, but not less frequently than every 12 months, prepare a document setting out certain particulars.

         The reason for this is that there has been a lack of information in the past in relation to those matters—permits granted or authorities given, refusals to grant permits and so on. As this is an area of a great deal of interest to people concerned about wildlife protection, exports and imports, we thought that it was appropriate that a time be put in there so that this simply cannot drift on—that there would be a regular reporting requirement which would allow everybody to have access to the information and, therefore, have an input to that.

         On the other hand, views have been put to me that six months is perhaps unduly restrictive. We feel that there needs to be order and certainty in this process. So, as the Democrats now propose a 12-month reporting requirement, we would support such a requirement.

         , as is currently required under the act, is prohibitive. The effect of the government's current amendment will be that reports can be produced at regular intervals and at minimal cost.

This will also ensure reporting compatibility with other requirements such as the reporting requirements of the ANCA annual report and the CITES annual report.

        This series of amendments would allow for a one-month public comment period on applications to import or export schedule 1 species; that is, CITES appendix 1 species and certain other native endangered species. Schedule 1 contains taxa believed to be threatened with extinction. The public has a legitimate interest in ensuring that any proposed import or export of these species would not further endanger them.

         The amendments are consistent with the CITES requirements. We believe it is in the public interest and is also in the best interests of the species. There is a growing trend in the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act to allow for public comment; that is, the introduction of public comment periods for management programs in a previous amendment act and for alterations to schedule 6 in the 1995 amendment act.

         It is also complementary to and consistent with measures under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act. The amount of import and export of schedule 1 species is not large.

The ivory must have been obtained prior to CITES controls taking effect—that is, prior to 1976. The import must not be for any commercial purpose. The management authority of the country of export must have issued a CITES export permit, and that permit must confirm that the ivory was pre-CITES. Once these matters are fully met, a permit to import might be granted.

         A public comment period will not assist me in making a decision on applications to trade in schedule 1 material.

As I have indicated, the act provides no discretion to the minister.

I am disappointed that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has indicated that the government does not support it. I note he said it would not assist him in his process, but I think the real aim of the amendment is to ensure public participation in the process. I think that is a very important component of any piece of legislation, no less with bills that deal with the care of the environment.

         Because this area of wildlife protection is widespread and diverse, the ability for the community to scrutinise the suitability of persons and organisations to receive permits to engage in export, re-export and import of species is, we believe, of paramount importance to ensure government accountability. It is also a way of gathering information about practices in the community. We indicate our support for the amendment and hope the opposition has given this due consideration.

        This amendment is to schedule 14 and page 43 of the amending bill. This schedule sets out, among other things, the appointment of members to the Exotic Birds Committee.

         We are seeking to add a fifth subclause to that appointment because we are concerned that in relation to this Exotic Birds Committee—I think senators who have received approaches on this matter would be aware of this fact—there are some fairly strong forces at work in relation to the commercial and pet use of exotic birds which may well be in conflict with the interests of birds, the conservation of birds and various other aspects, such as the introduction of exotic diseases and so forth.

        The government is already accepting the idea that there should not be a dominance of persons employed by the Commonwealth or authorities of the Commonwealth. We are seeking to extend that so that it becomes a proper multi-interest body without any one particular interest body being able to dominate and constitute a majority and therefore dominate the voting on this body. After all, this is quite an important plank in this piece of legislation. For those reasons, I strongly urge the committee to accept this amendment.

We are speaking of interest groups, and it strikes me that there are a number of interest groups within the aviculture area and groups which perhaps give a particular emphasis to issues which may not be shared to the same extent by other groups. I look forward to hearing the minister's response on that issue. There was some initial concern that the views of specialists in this area may not have been given due weight in the advice of particular species to be registered.

        This is where we start to get a bit complicated. Turning to page 52 of the 1982 act, we find section 53 which deals with the possession of illegally imported specimens. Section 53(2) states:

        Turning to page 57 of the amending bill which is before us, proposed subsection 53(2) suggests that we omit `in the person's possession'.

        We argue here that this deletion of `in the person's possession' should not hold. In other words, there is a sort of a double negative involved in this amendment.

We suggest that that section be retained. The second part of this, being 4A which relates to proposed subsection 53(4), is simply consequential upon the earlier section.

In the way that a person who breaks the speed limit on the road and endangers the lives of others is not permitted to argue that he or she did not know the speed limit was 80 or 110, because it is regarded as an offence which should be punishable simply because the offence is sufficiently serious in that it imposes a risk to others and lack of knowledge of the law in that case is not a defence, in a similar way we are seeking in this legislation—and I simply go back to the title of the bill—wildlife protection.

         However, my understanding is that its removal from this legislation does not mean that under common law a person cannot actually have as a defence the excuse that they were unaware and be able to use that if they were in a situation in which they could be challenged. It is on that basis that I would also feel the same concern expressed by Senator Kemp, if we were saying that nobody could claim they did not know about it and their level of knowledge or lack of knowledge was not able to be used as an argument mitigating the consideration that was being given to them.

         The understanding is that it does not deprive them of their common law right but simply deprives this act of a position which in some way undermines what we are trying to do—which is to say that it is very important we deal with the protection of wildlife, and that emphasises the importance of that within the act and does not give a kind of escape clause that is also written into it. So, on that basis—and I would like the minister's clarification that this does not go against the principle of the common law of not knowing being a defence—we support it.

         —That is my understanding also. I will go a little further and say that, clearly, if you are dealing with a particular case, the seriousness with which a breach of the law is considered by a court would take into account those very facts. Whether in fact it was a defence in an absolute sense or not, nonetheless the court would clearly give some weight to the circumstances, and the circumstances might be that the person had no way of knowing. But, as Senator Chamarette has pointed out, to write it in here as an absolute defence is simply going too far when the purpose of the bill is the protection of wildlife—and I come back to that point.

It is my view that the existing subsection 53(2) in no way offers such a defence. The defence that the existing subsection 53(2) offers is ignorance of the illegal importation. This is an ignorance of fact and not an ignorance of the law.

         I have been advised that under existing subsection 53(1)(a) all that the prosecution has to prove is that the defendant had a specimen in their possession that was imported in contravention of the act. The prosecution does not have to prove any fault element on the part of the defendant for a successful prosecution. To avoid conviction, the defendant has to prove that they did not know and had no reasonable grounds of knowing that the specimen had been imported in contravention. In other words, the defendant has to prove that they had no criminal intention in relation to the offence.

         The effect of Senator Coulter's amendment would be to remove this defence capability from the defendant, thereby leaving the defendant open to prosecution regardless of whether criminal intent existed in the mind of the defendant. Considering the high level of penalty that is available under section 53—five years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000—it would be most inappropriate to remove this defence provision from the act. I ask you to think about that as you consider the appropriateness of your analogy to a speeding fine, and I think you might think again. It is for those reasons that the government does not accept the Democrat amendment.

However, these are maximum penalties. There is no minimum set in here. It is well within the discretion of the judge hearing a particular case to take these matters into account.

         But in cases where there might be mitigating circumstances, such as lack of knowledge, I would be very surprised if any judge were to take a serious view, whether this clause was in there or not. The insertion of this clause does give a person a clear out written into the legislation, in addition to the sorts of discretionary power which the judge would have in respect of knowledge and the discretionary powers that the judge would exercise in respect of all the other circumstances that surround the particular act which is in contravention of the legislation.

         But I note that the subsection you are seeking to remove indicates that the person must prove that `he or she did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that the specimen in the person's possession had been imported in contravention of this act'. There is a test that is required there.

Because of the comments made by the minister and because of the penalty that goes with the criminal activity of importation—we are basically trying to stop the importation and exportation—at this point I will withdraw the support of the Greens.

        This is a long amendment to section 53C(1). It follows section 53B, which is on page 58 of the amending bill. This amendment seeks to add the concept of the sale of illegally imported specimens. I have had considerable discussion with the officers in the minister's department about this section. I am not sure whether we want to push this point very strongly. The officers have claimed that possession is what is at issue here as opposed to sale.

        The particular concerns that have been raised with us relate very much to therapeutic goods, as has been mentioned, and the fact that there is still a very flourishing trade in relation to oriental medicine, particularly Chinese medicine. A number of the products which are offered for sale contain, or purport to contain, a number of CITES-listed species such as bear, leopard, musk, deer, rhino or tiger, and this has already been mentioned. Many species of these five groups of animals are listed in appendix 1 of CITES. The most demand for their body parts is by medicine. That constitutes one of the principal threats to a continuing survival of those animals in the wild.

         A number of factors were found to be contributing to this illegal trade, including inadequate levels of targeted law enforcement effort, confusing non-comprehensive laws for the possession and domestic sale of illegally imported endangered species and the lack of a coordinated and culturally sensitive education campaign, which is something that Senator Chamarette has already mentioned, to inform the traditional and Chinese medicine using community of the legal and conservation implications of the continued importation and use of endangered species medicines.

         The concern here is that there is an element involved in the offering for sale of these materials, which is in itself a great stimulus to the continued exploitation of these species and which goes beyond the mere possession. That is why we want to pick up this issue of offering for sale. Although the amendment goes to many sections, that really is the essential point that we are making in these proposed amendments under amendment No. 5.

         —I do not think anyone would argue with the sentiments that were well expressed by Senator Coulter. We all share those concerns. The issue that we have to address is: does this particular amendment strengthen the bill and would it more effectively achieve the goals that Senator Coulter has well expressed? I look forward to hearing the minister's remarks—I think Senator Coulter alluded to this—because I understand that the issue of sale is already covered in the bill in terms of possession. If that is the case, I am not sure whether this goes further. It seems to me that if possession is the test, is that not a more rigorous test than sale? I would be interested in the minister's observations.

         —I agree with Senator Kemp and I also agree with his sentiments that a new offence relating to the sale of illegally imported specimens would assist in the restriction of trade in oriental medicines. That is a laudable one. I say to Senator Coulter that it is unnecessary. I have been advised that the creation of such an offence would result in the prosecution having to prove more than is currently required under the legislation. The word `sale' includes the concept of possession. Possession is already covered under the present legislation and an addition would weaken the act. Such a section relating to sale of illegally imported specimens would require the prosecution to produce proof of the defendant taking action to dispose of the item for the purposes of reward as well as having to establish beyond any doubt that the item was illegally imported.

         Advertising for sale or offering for sale is covered under section 7A of the Crimes Act. This section makes it an offence for any person to incite, urge, aid or encourage or to print or publish any writing which incites, urges, aids or encourages the commission of an offence against any law of the Commonwealth.

         I would not mind foreshadowing what I will not now be pursuing. There was some concern in supporting Senator Coulter's amendments. We felt that they had a very worthwhile purpose. We were concerned that there may be people who unknowingly were penalised by the new provisions and the creation of new penalties. We felt that if those penalties came about there should be some obligation on the government and on the minister to produce a public information strategy to inform the community that this new change had come about and the reasons for its enactment and allow some kind of parliamentary scrutiny of it.

         I will summarise my response to the three amendments—the Democrats' one, which we are considering at this point; amendment No. 6 that they are also putting; and our amendment to their No. 6. I believe that, because they are not supported, I will not indicate my support. I am always very loath to be involved in the creation of yet another criminal offence because I believe wholeheartedly that gaol penalties do not deter and they do not change people's attitudes and minds if they are deliberately engaged in criminal actions. They can, however, destroy people's lives and make it very difficult to remove themselves from criminal activities.

         While I was not totally happy about supporting criminal penalties, I did not also realise what the minister pointed out—that the burden of proof becomes so much harder with this more detailed offence which means that people are more likely to escape the sanction that is being applied. For those many reasons, I indicate that I will not be giving the Greens' support to the amendments.

The turning point in my mind is that my understanding as a result of this debate is that the goals that Senator Coulter is seeking to achieve with this amendment are, in fact, already achieved in the act but in a way which is more liable to achieve success. Whereas I do not argue at all with the goals that Senator Coulter has expressed to the chamber, I find myself in agreement with Senator Chamarette. We will not be supporting the amendment as proposed by Senator Coulter because we simply believe that the objectives that Senator Coulter has outlined will be better achieved under the act as it now stands.

         We have all seen programs on television of Indian tigers—those poor creatures whose remaining area is becoming more and more restricted—being hunted down simply to produce bone. How anybody could believe that that has any therapeutic value, I do not know. Like rhinoceros horn, I find the whole idea of medicines of that sort rather ludicrous when one knows anything about the chemistry of these things. However, that notwithstanding, there is a belief in the efficacy of these things for all sorts of weird and wonderful purposes. It does remain a very significant impact on wildlife which needs to be discouraged as much as possible.

        These relate to the export of live native freshwater fish. Let me read from a letter which was sent to Senator Faulkner in March of this year by the Humane Society International. Michael Kennedy, writing the letter, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At our recent meeting with you in Canberra, during the Peak Conservation Organisations week, we discussed the issue of exporting live native freshwater fish.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We had explained that during the consultation process with conservation NGOs, almost two years ago, for the preparation of amendments to the `Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, 1992', agreement was reached to "Amend the Act to restrict the commercial export of live fish and invertebrates to material that has been bred in captivity" . . . This corrected an anomaly which permitted such exports, despite a longstanding Commonwealth prohibition on exporting live native animals. We stress, that this was accepted as appropriate policy by the Wildlife Protection Authority (WPA) of ANCA. The agreement to allow exports of "captive-bred" native freshwater fish was a compromise agreed to by TRAFFIC and WWF, in order to secure the export ban.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On February 1st, HSI received a draft proposal from WPA, prepared by the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries, for approval to export live native freshwater fish for commercial purposes (for the export aquarium fish trade). Apart from the fact that the application is for a "Controlled Specimens", and not for a full "Approved Management Program", which, in the view of HSI, is not acceptable for live native fauna, this appeared to be in direct contradiction with the agreed amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, currently awaiting passage through Parliament. As noted, these amendments, or so we thought, sought to plug an unintended loophole in live native fauna export laws.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ANCA had often mentioned to us that they were concerned for the practicalities of implementing an essential ban of live native freshwater fish exports, though HSI did not agree that there were any insurmountable problems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, during these irregular and brief discussions, we were never informed that the amendment had, as it now seems, been removed well over one year ago. Part of the reason for HSI's concern for the delay in the passage of the amendments, and for which we urged your intervention, was the need to see the freshwater fish export ban imposed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The primary reasons that ANCA now forward for omitting the amendment are as follows: 1. That it is not possible under the Act to differentiate between prohibitions on native freshwater fish and control methods for other marine fish species; 2. That such a prohibition would impede the ability of ANCA to instigate further export controls on marine fish exports; 3. That permitting such exports would lead to better conservation of native freshwater fish in Australia. ANCA now also renounced the previously and jointly agreed position that the current situation represents a legal and policy anomaly. They have taken a complete 180 degree turn in approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        HSI rejects all these arguments—
       </para>
       <para>
        and this is the support for these amendments. It continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        TRAFFIC Oceania and the Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia, the two organisations that negotiated the amendment in question, also reject these arguments, as do the Peak Conservation Organisations. To briefly rebuff the ANCA arguments: It is entirely feasible, and indeed practicable, to list in the schedules to the Act, clear indications and definitions of the specimens of fish, freshwater or marine, that are exempt or not exempt from the operation of the Act; problems in dealing with the attitudes of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, or other state fisheries departments, are hardly a reason not to take appropriate conservation action; and suggestions that permitting exports will act as the best conservation mechanism are puzzling in the extreme.
       </para>
       <para>
        That last paragraph really is the summary of the arguments that have been put to the Democrats, and the arguments which we support in support of this amendment. That is the argument that the Humane Society International is putting and it is an argument accepted by the Democrats. It is evidently supported by a number of the conservation groups, and we see merit in it.

We have been approached by various groups, including the Humane Society International and the Worldwide Fund for Nature. We believe it is important to look at the new schedule that will include freshwater fish and also to look at the international spread of environmental pests, which I assume are also covered in this amendment. Additionally, I think there is another schedule that provides protection in relation to the import of environmentally damaging species. Because of this, the Greens will be supporting that.

Those suggesting we do this really have not provided any evidence that the existing arrangements have led to an unacceptable risk to the conservation of native fish. Indeed, the level of export trade which has existed in native freshwater fish has been extremely small.

         Banning the export of live native freshwater fish, although intended to address a supposed discrepancy in the act, will introduce additional anomalies. These arise from the discrepancy between the prohibition that would apply to the commercial export of live vertebrates and the fact that trade in live invertebrates and plants would continue to be permitted. It is difficult to see how the conservation of native vertebrates is dependent on a total ban on live exports while conservation of plants and invertebrates is not.

The precautionary principle surely applies here. If one is unsure of what the consequences of doing a thing might be, then it is better not to do it until you get more information. We have seen recently—not in the freshwater fish area—a mass extinction of pilchards across southern Australia and a very, very detailed and intensive investigation into that has failed to prove one way or another whether that was or was not due to an exotic disease being brought in by pilchards, in this case dead pilchards.

         There is a difference, if I can pick up what the minister was saying, between live fish and other animals because you necessarily are exporting a watery medium and various other quite unknown factors along with the fish. There is no other way you can export them. It is in that area of ignorance that I think we need to tread very, very carefully.

         program last Wednesday night. Among other things, it suggested that the mass extinction of frog species in the tropical rainforests of Australia may well have been due to the importation of exotic fish for aquarium specimens and, again, the introduction of a virus in the water with those fish which has then been released into streams, either deliberately or inadvertently, and has then spread a virus which is going through the amphibian population. Certainly a virus has been isolated, but, again, the lack of knowledge precludes us from understanding whether that virus was formerly exotic to Australia, was introduced, and has caused a condition or not.

         I simply make the plea that, on the one hand, we seem to be going overboard to protect commercial interests in a situation in which we have a very poor knowledge of what we are doing, rather than adopting the precautionary principle and saying, `Look, we are really ignorant in a lot of these areas. Let us be very cautious until we have a lot more knowledge of what in fact we are doing when we export these species.' It is not easy. It is not just the fish that you export. It is everything else that the fish is carrying, the water that the fish is in and so on. We are really very, very ignorant. I think the report of the investigation into pilchard deaths reveals just how ignorant we really are.

The amendment picks up a point that was made earlier, that in relation to information, the minister must publish in each state or territory, in at least two of the newspapers which circulate generally in the state or territory, a notice in plain English setting out the effects of this section and calling for nominations of plant or animal species, the export or import of which is not controlled and should be controlled by inclusion in schedule 1 or 2, as the case may be.

         This amendment—like one of the other amendments—is simply an attempt to increase that area of public knowledge and public participation in the process. It lays a further requirement on the minister, but I think the requirement is fairly minor in view of the advantages which are to be gained from it.

We believe that there is a great danger that if the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act 1982 are not enhanced by increased nomination, increased public participation in that and the allowance for public comment, then there is a danger that it will be mere rhetoric we are following.

Previously, leopard skin imports were illegal in Australia. As a result of the CITES management plans being completed for areas from which leopards come, we are now proposing to legalise leopard skin imports from these areas where there are the management plans. CITES recommended this. As it recommended that management plans should be in place indicating that leopards are listed as vulnerable by CITES, this amendment then says that they should therefore be available for imports.

         The hunting of leopards by Australians is usually in response to commercial safaris organised by Australian hunting and shooting groups, to send Australian people to Africa to shoot these animals in their natural, open woodland habitat for no other reason than what we would feel is gratuitous and barbaric sport. The money paid by Australian tourists in the country to take part in that activity more often than not goes straight into the hands of that country and the governments, not even to the local African landowners. We have to be aware that, while some people may say, `Barbaric though it is it assists those countries,' it does go into the hands of the country and it actually perpetuates a practice that I think on a global scale we have to evaluate in a different manner.

         —The act current provides for the export under permit of certain native Australian birds as household pets. The act requires that a person must have owned and possessed the bird or birds for a minimum of three years prior to the export and that the person must have resided in Australia for a minimum of four years and be leaving Australia to take up permanent residence overseas. Under the current provisions, up to a maximum of six birds can be exported.

         The proposed amendment eliminates the necessity for a person to prove ownership of a household pet bird. The ownership provision has always been difficult to establish, especially when there is no necessity to have permission to keep the species in many Australian states and territories. A lot of time is wasted in trying to establish ownership without any direct conservation benefit.

         The proposed amendment also restricts the number of birds that can be exported as household pets to two. Budgerigars are additional and are therefore excluded from the amendment, as specific controls on that particular species are already provided for separately under the act.

         —The minister has raised an issue which has been raised with me separately in relation to this section of the act. There were great problems in establishing that they were your birds and your pets. This did lead to a lot of problems for those who had to depart our shores and wished to take pets with them. I think the minister does raise in this context a real issue. My understanding is that the government has tightened up on the numbers of pet birds that can be taken but has eased the tests on the need to establish ownership.

         —As I understand it, schedule 7 only applies to certain species of parrots. The government is adding on to that relatively short list budgerigars. It is reducing the number of birds to two, but the schedule that Senator Chamarette is seeking to amend changes the period from three years to just immediately before export. It does seem to me, although I hear what the minister says, that that does open up the possibility that somebody might have acquired an animal from the wild immediately before leaving Australia. Although none of these species is a threatened species, I think we are opposed to the taking of animals from the wild and their immediate export. That is one issue that I think stands out in direct relationship to Senator Chamarette's amendment.

         The other question I would like to ask the minister is: given that we are dealing with the parrot family, which classically carries things like psittacosis and various other diseases, and the possibility that rabbits and other animals have caused problems in Australia, is the minister confident that in exporting any of these animals even as household pets we are not in danger of possibly spreading diseases to other parrots in other parts of the world? Do we know enough about the diseases carried by Australian parrots to be sure that they are not transmitted overseas?

Are we, again, bending over too far towards a nice warm feeling in relation to household pets, rather than protecting wildlife in other parts of the world with respect to diseases that might be carried by our parrots but not by their parrots and, secondly, recognising the possibility that our parrots might become pests in other parts of the world if they are exported? I would like some assurance that we are not just simply giving away to that nice warm fuzzy feeling in relation to household pets something that, from the environmental point of view, is very important.

         We oppose the arbitrary definition that refers to the exporter having kept the animal as a household pet immediately before export. I know that as a lay person I am getting confused here but it seems to me that, while the minister is defending the transportation of a household pet, calling it an export only makes things more difficult. To be able to define as a household pet something you have in your possession seems to leave the way open for the transfer of native species overseas and cause the problems Senator Coulter referred to.

         The Western Australian state Liberal government has been seeking to have workers in my state take up individual contracts and move out of the award system. The government has been driving a campaign to get those workers to take out individual contracts both in the private sector and in the government sector. They have been putting a great deal of effort into that attempt.

         It seems that as part of that approach the Western Australian government has come up with a concept called `flexible remuneration packaging'. At first sight that would not seem to be a particularly big deal. Many employers offer salary packaging; there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that provided appropriate taxation is paid.

         Senators would be aware that this government has a proud record of introducing the fringe benefits tax which helps to ensure that all elements of a remuneration package are taxed and that the tax avoidance measures that have grown up around salary packaging have largely been eradicated. If the benefits are not taxable in the employees' hands, the employers are taxed for providing that fringe benefit.

         I have discovered that the Western Australian government has been offering flexible remuneration packages to many of its higher paid and senior employees within the health sphere. These packages are offered only to selected employees and the key element in this is that they are offered only to those who sign a workplace agreement—that is, those who are prepared to opt out of the award system and accept the individual contract approach that the state government has sought to introduce.

         Those employees are allowed to sacrifice up to 30 per cent of their salary package. They can take their salary in other than cash benefits up to a maximum of 30 per cent. So, for instance, an employee who agrees to move out of the award system and sign a workplace agreement can sacrifice part of their salary and have their employer—this is essentially the state government—pay their children's school fees, mortgage repayments, superannuation payments into private superannuation firms or the lease of a private motor vehicle. There is a range of other options that are available. These benefits can be provided as long as there is no increase in costs to the employer. But the employer claims that this packaging will improve the employee's total remuneration package. So you have this situation where the employer says, `By salary packaging, you will be better off, but it will be at no cost to me, the employer.'

         So how is it that this inducement can be offered and a supposed advantage flow to employees without any cost to that state government, the employer of these people? Simply put, it is because of tax evasion. The state government is encouraging the avoidance of payment of tax by its employees. It has erected a tax avoidance scam. The scheme induces employees out of their award system into the workplace agreement on the basis of helping them to avoid paying the appropriate tax on their incomes. For those senators who would be—

         The other important element of this is that it increases the burden on other taxpayers. It reduces the amount of tax that is flowing to the Commonwealth.

It really is a bit rich for a state government that constantly whinges about the perceived reduction in the federal revenue that flows to the states to be erecting tax evasion schemes for selected employees to pursue its ideological and industrial relations goals at the same time as complaining about the lack of federal funds.

         —Australia's decade of the 1990s is shaping up to reveal a concerted attack on the provision of a public education system as a matter of right and community responsibility. I make it clear that the Australian Democrats regard the right to a publicly funded secular education system as a basic feature of our Australian culture. It is not just an obligation because Australia is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; it has been and ought to remain a fundamental component of that which characterises Australian nationhood. It ought to be something for which we as a nation—a nation which espouses principles of egalitarianism and social, if not Christian, responsibility—hold proud and something that we will defend.

         Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. We have almost thrown it away in our collective greedy mania for embracing economic rationalism as we replace the idea of public responsibility with principles of user-pays and market driven decision making. As governments spend less and less on education, schools are closed, teachers sacked and class sizes steadily increased. As schools are placed into an ever increasing bind, they turn to sponsorship and fees.

         Cynically, we have state governments which are creating the legislative frameworks that are meant to facilitate public schools in becoming increasingly financed from a system of user-pays under the guise of providing greater autonomy for those very same schools. My own state of Tasmania is a good example, having recently passed a new education act. Although this act has been hailed as landmark legislation providing new opportunities for parent involvement in the decision making processes of schools, it has clearly built the slippery slope towards a user-pays education system.

         Section 41.3 of this new Tasmanian education act of economic rationalism allows school principals to set and impose charges for incidental costs and expenses. The only restraint is that, where there is a school council, such levies must be approved by the council. At the time of its enactment, however, far fewer than half of the schools had school councils. Even now, few of the parents realise that one of the fundamental responsibilities of the school council is to approve the school budget, levies and charges. In the absence of such a council, the principal decides on the need for fees and how much they will be.

         In some respects this sounds quite progressive; it seems like a mechanism for participatory decision making. In fact and in practice, it is a device by which the state government can off-load some of the odium of fundraising on to school councils—which in effect means the parents. There is no limit on the amount that can be imposed as levies and charges. That is supposedly the responsibility of the council, which may refuse to approve a budget. But here is the deadly punch: if the principal and the council fail to agree on the budget, it is the council which can be sacked by the minister. Moreover, there is no definition in the act of fees, levies and charges. There is no limit on the amount that can be imposed and no limit on the scope of their applicability. As the squeeze on education resources becomes tighter and tighter, the pressure for increased revenue from this source will be irresistible.

         Currently such fees are voluntary, or termed as voluntary, although it is noted and indeed explained that parents are expected to pay. It is not clear just what is to happen if a levy is not paid. The act does not describe what will occur in that instance. How long will it be before these charges are regarded as compulsory? With no limit to their scope, the capacity for such fees to become an increasingly central component of school budgets is frightening for those of us who regard the provision of education as a government responsibility. Is it too cynical to predict that, just as Hilmer is potentially the vehicle for facilitating a major leap towards user-pays in all manner of local government provided functions and services, so too the new education act will signal the end of the public education system? I think that has to be a rhetorical question.

        (1)(a) Government policy welcomes and encourages the use of existing range facilities within Australia by United States (US) forces. US use of our ranges contributes to the level of interoperability between the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and US armed forces, further strengthens the defence relationship between our two countries and by contributing to the support of a US presence in our region, furthers our shared interests in the stability and security of the region. In accord with this policy, US forces have used the Lancelin Range on a regular basis since 1989.

        (b) The US armed forces have expressed interest in using Lancelin Range to conduct major exercises and have been briefed on the range by Australian Defence personnel. The visit to which you refer was that of the Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Clemins, who visited Lancelin Range, accompanied by members of his staff, on Wednesday 31 May 1995. Vice Admiral Clemins was escorted by the Lancelin Range Officer who briefed him on the facilities. After viewing the range from the air, Vice Admiral Clemins advised that he considered Lancelin Range not to be large enough to conduct any major exercises.

        (2)(a) There have been no exchanges of notes, letters, or contracts with the US forces over the use of Lancelin as a bombing range. The majority of activities on the range have been conducted as, or associated with, combined exercises between Australian and US forces, or with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), in accordance with the ADF's scheduled exercise program. Occasionally, US Navy battlegroups transiting the area may request unilateral use of this range. Such requests are approved by me as required. If approved, arrangements are then made directly between US Embassy staff and Headquarters ADF. Local arrangements are made between the range management staff and other Australian military agencies, as appropriate. Use of the range by US forces is subject to full cost-recovery procedure.
