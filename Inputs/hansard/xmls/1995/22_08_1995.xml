This question is aimed at one of the areas of the Australian economy that is not as good as we would like it to be. But, taking the whole of the economy in its context, in this economy we have: strong employment growth; strong overall growth; a continuing low level of inflation; a high level of investment; and a great deal more confidence among Australians, either in business or as consumers, as a consequence of the innate strengths of this economy than we have had for some time. We also have our own forecasts and the forecasts of private sector economists as well pointing to many future years of strong, sustainable economic growth for Australia.

         —The answer to this obviously has to be seen in context. The final point about context that I was making is that we have a number of private sector economic forecasters saying that Australia can look forward to, over the next six years, unprecedented, ongoing, sustainable economic growth. That is something for all Australians to celebrate, and it is in that context that one ought to approach the issue of the current account deficit.

         One of the reasons why the current account figures are poorer than we would like them to be is that Australia went through a long drought and, as a consequence, our earnings from agricultural exports were less than they would ordinarily be. One of the other reasons why our current account is not as good as we would like it to be is that we have had in the private sector a number of international borrowings—borrowings on the foreign markets—to finance growth in industry.

         I do not know that the opposition is going to say that that is wrong but, if it is, it had better go off and explain to the Australian business community why they should not finance growth by borrowing internationally. That shows up in the figures as an interest rate on those borrowings.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the other reasons why the current account is at its present level is that we have bought capital goods abroad to expand the capacity of the Australian economy. Because of the buoyant economic conditions in Australia, Australian industry has bought capital goods to expand their operations to take advantage of the burgeoning markets in Asia which has created and underpinned our employment growth.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For all those reasons the current account figures are high, but they are by no means alarming. In the budget we will bring down the level of the current account deficit. As well, because of the consistent work we have done on micro-economic reform and the increase in the competitiveness of the Australian economy, we will grow our exports to a higher level.

         The final point I make goes back to the structure of the current account. Australians are confident about their economic future; they are buying consumption goods abroad. That shows up in the current account as well and it is one of the reasons why the figures are high.

         The review is designed to ensure, cooperatively, that our policies are both effective and appropriate. My state colleagues had no hesitation at a meeting of ARMCANZ in Perth last Friday in endorsing the Commonwealth's proposals for a review in line with the principles laid down in the national drought policy. I might add that my colleagues agreed to that, with the exception of the Victorian minister who was busy attending a National Party conference in Darwin. Therefore, Victoria was not represented at the conference in Perth at all. Despite having more to say about it than anyone else, the minister was not there.

         The state ministers also had no hesitation in re-endorsing the principles of the national drought policy and the framework for declaring and revoking exceptional circumstances. None of the states expressed any desire to go back to the old days when drought was declared under the natural disaster arrangements and Commonwealth fodder subsidies were the go. The reason I mention that is that that is the only proposal for dealing with drought that has so far been suggested by the coalition—which also released that proposal a year ago next week.

         , one of the major rural newspapers, last week which said, `Farm leaders back drought policy'. The reason is simple: no-one except the federal opposition seriously advocates revisiting those natural disaster arrangements where assistance was granted to producers—that is, people who gained their income from stock, not from crops—regardless of need or of their current or long-term financial status. Even John Anderson conceded publicly that those fodder subsidies had been `rorted to the back teeth'. No-one wants to revisit a policy that totally distorts the marketplace through fodder subsidies except the federal opposition. It is a discard from the 1980s.

         The national drought policy has the support of the Commonwealth and all state governments because it is the correct policy for the 1990s. The review is another step in the continuing evolution of this policy by the Commonwealth in cooperation with the states, which administer it on our behalf. It will allow us to finetune our collective responses to the drought.

         The Commonwealth commitment to farm families in the face of this drought has been the most comprehensive ever delivered by any federal government. It enjoys the endorsement of all the key players because they know it is so. Over 10,000 farm families have received the drought relief payment and associated allowances since its inception. In fact, the Queensland minister at ARMCANZ said last week—and I think it was very accurately said—that, if it had not been for this package, rural Queensland would now be on its knees.

         The Commonwealth is fully committed to helping rural Australia cope with and recover from the drought. Unfortunately, because of the continuing nature of the  drought in regional New South Wales and Queensland and the beneficial statutory requirement that we provided to extend drought assistance by a full six months after revocation, I have no doubt that the full amount of $600 million that has been committed by the Commonwealth will have to be spent.

When your government agreed to fund a private legal action by Dr Lawrence to try to scuttle the Easton royal commission, was the government aware that Dr Lawrence, in her own right, may not have had sufficient standing to initiate that action herself and that it would be necessary to join another party to the proceedings such as Mr John Halden? Was the government also aware that Mr Halden was unable to fund such an action? Why did the government even entertain using taxpayers' funds for a challenge by Dr Lawrence when, in her own right, she may not have had standing to initiate such a challenge?

There would, of course, be a problem about the Commonwealth picking up the tab for Mr Halden's costs in relation to that action. But, contrary to speculation or misleading reports, the truth is very different from that. The Commonwealth made it very clear from the outset that it was not going, under any circumstances, to bear the cost referrable to any other party that might be involved in the challenge to the royal commission or, in any other way, involved in the proceedings.

         No payments will be made unless they are certified as fair and reasonable by the Australian Government Solicitor. The Australian Government Solicitor wrote to Mr Halden's solicitors as early as 19 July asking that all expenses in relation to their representation of Mr Halden which do not relate to Dr Lawrence be separately itemised in order to ensure that they can be completely quarantined from anything the Commonwealth separately pays for. All bills submitted by Dr Lawrence's solicitors will be carefully scrutinised to ensure that the government is under no circumstances meeting Mr Halden's legal expenses.

         The Commonwealth is absolutely entitled to support Dr Lawrence in the exercise of the carrying out of her functions as a minister in defending herself against a challenge to her fitness to hold public office and, in particular, to carry out her functions as a minister. It is absolutely entitled to do that. That is the nature of the challenge against her. Moreover, she is defending the institutions of which she is a part. She is defending the institution of parliamentary privilege. She is defending the institution of cabinet confidentiality, which is manifestly under threat and in which the Commonwealth has a major interest. There is a very clear legal authority for the particular payment the Commonwealth is making in this respect and we have no doubt whatsoever about the legitimacy and the propriety and the morality of the course we have taken.

Did it have anything to do with the fact that former Senator Stephen `let me at the money' Loosley is a consultant to that firm? What involvement did the government and Stephen Loosley have in the appointment of Dunhill Madden Butler? Is the government yet again helping a string of mates at taxpayers' expense?

Of course that is the fact. Of course you know it. The only reason that royal commission has been set in train is not because it is Dr Lawrence citizen, it is because it is Dr Lawrence federal member of this particular government. As to the question of the funding of Mr Halden's legal expenses, the cost of Mr Gyles or anybody else, that is a matter between Mr Halden, his solicitors and his counsel. It is of no interest to the Commonwealth and we have made that clear in correspondence which was on the record as early as 19 July.

         It is very much up to the Western Australian government to provide assistance in this case. I suppose, from the federal government's position, it is very important to place on record that we are still awaiting a response from the WA government in respect of this particular matter. We have taken no decision to fund proceedings in this matter, but we are waiting for the government which historically has the responsibility to provide funding—responsibility based on notions of fairness. Certainly, that responsibility and those notions are well established in instances such as this. I think we should, in the first instance, place our focus on the WA government. If the WA government does not eventually decide to assist, then the Commonwealth government will not allow a minister of the Commonwealth to financially destroy themselves and place themselves particularly in such sordid situations. We will have no option but to step in if WA persists in abdicating responsibility here.

         In terms of your reference to the guidelines, Senator, I think it is important for you to look at the guidelines, to look at them as they are formulated and to look at some of their history. It is consistent with precedent of the Commonwealth paying legal costs of ministers obliged to defend themselves by reason of their ministerial function. Not only is there Commonwealth precedent, there is also precedent at the state level for this matter. There were no guidelines, for instance, until 1984. When guidelines were introduced, those guidelines were intended to cover proceedings in which a minister was a defendant.

         If you look at the title of the guidelines, they are  `Guidelines for the Provision of Assistance' for certain people `in Relation to the Defence of Legal Proceedings'. If you look at the actual guidelines, they list the sorts of proceedings we are talking about, both civil and criminal proceedings. They go very much to situations where ministers and parliamentary secretaries find themselves in defence of proceedings, not in respect of royal commissions. There were no guidelines intended to cover royal commissions in 1984, nor were there guidelines in place before 1984 when the government put these guidelines in place for these particular circumstances.

         In terms of what happens in the absence of guidelines, what happens now is what has always happened. For the last 50 years or so, in circumstances where a minister has had to defend his or her fitness before a royal commission, governments have assisted them—Commonwealth governments, and there are instances there, and state governments. Two great examples in recent days of state governments acting to provide legal assistance for members of those governments were both the Fahey government in respect of Nick Greiner just a few years ago and the recent Tasmanian government in respect of Robin Gray. Assistance was provided for those members not only to appear before the commission but also to contest the ambit of the commission.

         We have taken this decision. We have done it consistent with subsections 4(a) and (b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. As Senator Gareth Evans said earlier on in question time, there is legal entitlement to do it, there is precedent to do it, and there is precedent from both sides of parliament to do it—precedent going back some 50 years or so. As well as those that I have mentioned, there are also important legal issues that have arisen in this inquiry and that are always going to arise. There is parliamentary privilege and, as we saw just a few days ago, the whole question of cabinet confidentiality—cabinet confidentiality which is quite critical to the running of government on both a state and federal level. There are issues that are not just dormant and relevant in Western Australia but also relevant on a federal level and nationally.

         In terms of the guidelines mentioned in the second part of your question, I suppose it is best to say that we have made a contingent decision with respect to that. With respect to the guidelines, as I have said to you, Senator—and you had better go back to my first answer because I do not have enough time to give you a comprehensive one now—the guidelines when we look at them go very much to a minister defending himself or herself against civil or criminal proceedings.

         —I appreciate the question from Senator Childs. On 13 July I did sign, on behalf of the government, an historic anti-doping agreement with the International Olympic Committee and SOCOG, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. This agreement commits all parties to actively pursue a drug free Sydney 2000 Olympiad. No previous agreement has ever formalised the intentions of the IOC, the host national government and the organising committee in this way. Sydney 2000 must not be contaminated by cheats using drugs. I will be doing everything possible, as I have been already, to beat the cheats.

         As sports minister, I am determined that this government will do everything it can to ensure that the games will be a sporting and financial success. A drug free Sydney 2000 does have the potential to re-establish the credibility of international sport and provide a launching pad to take a drug free sporting ethos into the 21st century. The signing of the agreement follows a cabinet decision to implement a wide range of measures aimed at pursuing a drug free 2000 Games. These measures include the implementation of an effective drug testing program that targets international athletes competing and training in Australia, the implementation of effective drug testing programs at the 2000 Olympics and the test events leading up to the games, and the maintenance of an internationally accredited drug testing laboratory in Sydney.

Senator Alston asked the question while claiming that this has nothing to do with Dr Lawrence's position of being a federal minister. Senator Vanstone was on radio yesterday publicly stating very loudly that there would not have been a royal commission if Carmen Lawrence had not been a federal minister. `Well that may be', she said. She let the cat out of the bag. They go public, claiming that the person is not fit to hold office. Senator Alston then has the gall to come in here and argue that it has nothing to do with her job as a Commonwealth minister.

         The reality is that Carmen Lawrence has to defend herself as a Commonwealth minister of the Crown. In doing so, some fairly important principles of law and institutions relating to her position not only as a minister but also as a member of parliament are involved here. There are fundamental principles going to parliamentary privilege and cabinet confidentiality. That is why the federal government is concerned to involve itself in this matter.

So there is footing and, as I said, there is precedent on the state and federal levels for governments to be involved in funding in this way. There is legal authority to do so.

         What did I mean when I referred to some aspects of the legislation being unusual? I was referring to reports at that stage that not only was there an exclusion of double-dipping in the sense that there was a proposed legislative requirement, as I understood it, that people were not to be able to sue; there were also some fairly extraordinary provisions referred to in the press reports suggesting that there be criminal penalties attached to anyone who did have the effrontery to issue a writ or initiate proceedings.

         The difficulty, however, for those who want to get excited about that is that we are advised by the Papua New Guinea government that there is no intention to proceed with those; that was just an early draft that Slater and Gordon somehow got hold of. It was an idea that was thought by Papua New Guinea's own advisers not to have much to commend it—a judgment which I in turn commend—and they have not proceeded with it.

         But what is involved here is an exercise of legislative exclusion of a compensation payout which would otherwise be damaging to the Papua New Guinea economy in the judgment of the Papua New Guinea government. They have made the judgment that the compensation package is sufficiently large to be fair for the landowners concerned and that there is no particular justification for allowing a foreign firm of lawyers to enrich themselves with some sort of contingent fee exercise with the prospect of protracted legislation at the end of the day which, if it were successful, would be very damaging indeed. I am not saying that these are the Australian government's judgments; these are unquestionably, however, the judgments that have been made by the Papua New Guinea government. Essentially, the Australian government's position is that that is a matter for them.

         As to the question of whether there should be some kind of code of conduct or restraints on what mining companies do in Papua New Guinea, I note that there has been an application by the Australian Conservation Foundation for a project in Papua New Guinea to draw up such a code. Because that project is highly controversial, extensive consultation has proven necessary with relevant organisations in PNG, including government, community and industry groups. I expect a decision to be made by the government soon on that. There are obviously a lot of questions of principle involved here and one needs to tread pretty warily, again paying very close regard to the responses of the Papua New Guinea government, which is, after all—and I keep saying this—the government which has responsibility for in the first instance its own environment and its own people's welfare.

         It is a legitimate question to ask, but it does involve a lot of difficult questions that need to be balanced and, at the end of the day, that is in the first instance a responsibility of the Papua New Guinea government. If they sought some such exercise by the Australian government, that would obviously add a degree of sharpness to our consideration of this. If they do not or if they seek the contrary because they are worried about the implications for other investment and so on, that is something we would have to take seriously into account in contemplating the worth or otherwise of such a policy exercise.

At a time when she has had this terrible distraction, she has been concerned to see that negotiations with the states continue to make sure that special funding and extra funding, particularly in the light of the review of funding from the Commonwealth to the states, might be able to provide even further assistance from the Commonwealth to assist with whatever numbers of procedures surgeons and doctors in various states determine patients might need.

         The allegation by Mr Court is that we do not spend enough on defence in Western Australia, basically that we leave it undefended. I think the first point I should make is that at no stage in defence do we ever allocate resources on the basis of a state—that you can get 20 per cent and that is your percentage. That obviously is what Mr Court wanted. If we did that on a per capita basis, I am sure that Senator Tambling and Senator Bob Collins would be very upset at the massive reduction we would have to make in defence expenditure in the Northern Territory.

He does not know about the two bases at Learmonth and Curtin. Of course, 25 per cent of the expenditure on K95 was in planning and exercising in Western Australia in the last few weeks.

         I will give you an example, Mr President, of what I was talking about. I thought, in the context of the Batman preselection, that one candidate quite clearly was better than another—the same as, I am sure, most people would have taken the attitude in the Boothby preselection that it would have been better to have Senator Hill as the candidate but that it was fairer to have the processes he went through.

Once again you have come in here with a fragment of an interview and totally distorted what was said. The difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party at the moment is that, even though we go through convoluted procedures, we can manage our own affairs. But you cannot. You have had to strip preselection from three candidates in New South Wales; you have had to chuck out two candidates, two sitting members, in Western Australia, and you cannot even agree on a joint Senate ticket in Queensland.

        A two-year investigation into the national drought policies has labelled the Federal Government's approach to the nation's 85,000 farmers as "ineffective, misguided and counterproductive".
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to say that the approach is based on false assumptions that farmers can battle long-term drought as part of the farming business environment. The report attacks the government's advice to store feed and to keep cash reserves. It uses tax incentives instead of direct fodder help and uses the exceptional circumstances criteria for drought ravaged farmers applying for assistance. It goes on to conclude, very damningly I think, that the whole focus of the national drought policy—including the assumption that farmers are self-reliant and can become drought proof in cyclical downturns—is misguided.

         This finally nails the minister's approach to drought. We believe that when he received the response to this report in his office he went off the deep end, because when they set up this inquiry into drought policy he was expecting a pat on the back for the great things this government has done for the farmers over the last several years.

         Let me remind the Senate that this drought has been going on now for four years. It was a little over a year ago in about July last year that the government really started to get involved with coming to grips with the drought and to give up its previous policy of hoping it would just rain. They did institute a number of measures, including their extreme drought relief policy, and time after time in the Senate we have condemned the way in which that policy is administered, we have condemned the guidelines in that policy and we have condemned the criteria that is used to select drought areas. If Minister Collins managed to actually go up there and look at what was happening in areas like the Upper Hunter he would see—

It also came to the brilliant conclusion that preparing for drought—that is, drought proofing a property—is effective with moderate drought but is not so effective with long-term drought. You would not disagree with that.

         —It is rather sad that some people, on the backs of people in primary industry who are in dire trouble, take an opportunity to take a shot at the minister, not about the drought policy but about the operations of a small part of it. It is well known—and it is on the record—that there was an expert inquiry that was conducted some four years or so ago. People who were a part of that inquiry body had personal and long experience on the land—and other people also had expertise. They made certain recommendations. One of those was that natural disasters such as drought should no longer be considered as part of that system. There has been a lot of argument about whether that should be so or not. I believe it should not, but I believe that the circumstances are dire and have to be dealt with.

         The people we talked to clearly indicated that it was important that they be self-reliant and that assistance in regard to tax benefits would only be worth while for those people who were making money. After all, if you are in a loss situation, tax benefits are not available to you. So we considered the question of assistance from the government and the question of people having access to certain family payments and other payments when they are in dire circumstances.

Never at any time did anyone say anything other than, `We cannot afford to lose the families that are on the land. We need to keep them there. To the extent that the community is capable, through the taxation base, we should support them and see that they stay there.'

They developed a drought policy as a result of recommendations of the expert committee and some of the views expressed to the rural and regional affairs committee. We also looked at the rural adjustment scheme.

         I must say that members of the opposition on that committee very clearly suggested to witnesses on a number of occasions that they should get their minds around the importance of tax benefits and that they should understand that it is important that the money that was generated as a result of their activities in rural areas should be used to make provisions for bad times. They suggested that they should put money into funds which they could take out when needed, and store water, money and fodder so they become self-reliant. That view was accepted and expressed by people during those hearings.

         I think it is unfair, unjust and sad to hear the criticism that the government's drought policy is a total failure. After all, the minister provided $160 million in that area.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Vanstone this day, relating to the Minister for Human Services and Health.

        Senator Gareth Evans did not answer the question that he was asked. He simply chose to avoid the question clearly put to him. He was asked: when his government agreed to fund a private legal action to scuttle the Easton royal commission were the cabinet ministers who made that decision aware that Dr Lawrence, in her own right, probably did not have the standing to issue such proceedings? Did the federal government agree to fund proceedings or contingently fund proceedings—it does not matter which; in the end there is a commitment to pay if it is required—which Dr Lawrence, in her own right, probably would not have been able to initiate?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That has not been answered. It is a very simple question: did the government know that at the time that they agreed to pay the money? Did they know that it would be necessary to join someone else? It follows that they would have known. Did they consider that Mr John Halden may be the person who would have to be joined or did they know that he had already agreed to be joined in those proceedings—in other words, to lend his name to proceedings to get them on foot provided he did not have pay a cent? Did the Commonwealth know that? Did the cabinet ministers sitting around the table thrashing this out understand that that was the case? Were they aware that Mr Halden was simply unable to fund such an action?

         If they were aware that Dr Lawrence had limited, if any, standing to initiate proceedings on her behalf, why in heavens name was Commonwealth taxpayers' money used to fund such proceedings? Why were steps not taken to ensure that Mr Halden would not be able to simply piggyback on Dr Lawrence's legal counsel—namely, at the taxpayers' expense. All Senator Gareth Evans has chosen to say is that he is quite sure that Mr Halden's solicitors will be keeping a clear record and there will be separate bills, but there has been no comment from the minister with respect to the payment to barristers, in particular Roger Gyles QC who is appearing for both.

The question still remains: did the government take steps to ensure that Mr Halden would not be able to piggyback on Dr Lawrence's legal counsel whose fees are being paid by the Commonwealth? It is reasonably clear that they did not take any such steps. They cannot get away with the ruse that they are not paying for anything that Mr Halden is getting, but if Roger Gyles chooses to do his work for nothing and then gets paid top dollar for Carmen Lawrence's work they will nod and turn the other way.

         He was further asked why the Sydney based law firm of Dunhill Madden Butler was chosen to act for Dr Lawrence. These are Western Australian proceedings; it is a New South Wales firm. There are necessarily added expenses in operating out of New South Wales and—surprise, surprise—former Senator Stephen `let me at the money' Loosley is a consultant to that firm. Senator Evans was asked whether Senator Loosley had anything to do with that firm being appointed; whether the government had anything to do with that firm being appointed. There are no answers.

         The minister has chosen to say—I will come to the gross misrepresentation by Senator Evans and Senator Bolkus in a personal explanation at a later point—that this commission in Western Australia would not have come about unless Dr Lawrence was a federal minister. I have made it abundantly clear that the commission in Western Australia has come about not because Dr Lawrence is now a Commonwealth minister but because she was then the key minister in a Western Australian government. It relates to Western Australian activities well before she ever got here. It goes to the heart of whether the parliamentary system in Western Australia can be relied on, whether electors can believe what their ministers tell them. There could be no greater purpose for a royal commission than that.

         But the bottom line is it has nothing to do with her duties as a federal minister, and the Commonwealth has no business spending hard earned taxpayers' money to fund such an action. Sadly, we find Dr Lawrence hiding behind her gender in the last couple of days doing the `poor me, I am a victim' only because she does not want to be seen as the perpetrator.

         The only matter in issue is whether the Commonwealth is paying for Mr Halden's legal fees or Dr Lawrence's. We are not paying for anybody's at the moment, we have only made at best a contingent decision, because we regard all these things as the responsibility of the Western Australian government, including collateral challenges to the validity of the commission itself. Just as the New South Wales government funded Mr Greiner's collateral challenge to the ICAC commission once he got caught up in it, and just as the Tasmanian government funded Mr Gray's collateral challenge to the Rouse royal commission once he got caught up in it, so too it would be appropriate for the Western Australian government, we believe, to fund not only those people appearing before it in terms of the cross-examination of the witnesses and so on, but also those who challenge with every interest in the world to do so the nature of those proceedings as being inappropriate and a misapplication of public funds.

West to cover the problems that might be thought to exist with section 48 of the Constitution, which provides a specific statutory head of power, we believe we are perfectly well covered. That is a matter which we are perfectly happy to debate with you at any time and any place.

         —The simple situation is that some years ago Dr Lawrence embarked upon a certain political campaign to try to destroy a then leader of the opposition, Richard Court. That action has totally and utterly backfired on her, as it should have done. She is now facing a situation where the chickens are coming home to roost. The Australian Labor Party government knows exactly what the consequences are for Dr Lawrence. In a desperate, and might I add pathetic, bid to protect her they have embarked upon funding all manner of legal defences for her to try to avoid her obtaining her just desserts.

         It was interesting to read in the media just recently the headline `I won't quit, says Lawrence'. You can always bet your bottom dollar that, when a person is starting to use those phrases, they will be gone within seven days. That would be my prediction in relation to Dr Lawrence, irrespective of the amount of money that Senator Evans and the Labor Party are going to channel in to try to defend Dr Lawrence.

        So the Labor Party is going from bad to worse. It started off with an attempt to sink a Liberal leader of the opposition, and we now have an inquiry into those activities. The Labor Party now knows what is going to arise out of this inquiry. Indeed, the evidence is there. Her own former deputy premier was about to resign because of Dr Lawrence's behaviour and he was dissuaded. They then tried to fund a defence to stop any of this coming to public light, and they are now using a fund, according to Laura Tingle, quite improperly. She describes it as a rort.

He somehow came back to life in 1992 to ask a question about this matter. Duncan Kerr, who is now the federal Minister for Justice, also had the audacity to make comments about this.

         So it seems that if it is a Labor mate, it's all okay. The principles all of a sudden seem to change; the morality changes. It is a bit like what Senator Ray said, isn't it? It is not about fairness; it is about results. It is like what Senator Richardson said, `Whatever it takes.' That is the morality of this government. That is the way Carmen Lawrence embarked, to try to destroy Richard Court. She is now getting her comeuppance—and she deserves it. I believe that the people of Australia should not be required to fund such a pitiful defence.

         That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Wednesday, 2 August 1995, of the Honourable Frederick Michael Daly, AO, member of the House of Representatives for the division of Martin from 1943 to 1949, member for the division of Grayndler from 1949 to 1975 and Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

        Fred Daly was born in Currabubula, near Tamworth, New South Wales, on 13 June 1912. He was one of 11 children of an Irish pioneer farming family. His father, Michael Joseph Daly, migrated from County Clare, Ireland, to Australia in the mid-1860s. At the tender age of 11, Fred lost his father. Later in his book
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         From Curtin to Kerr
        </emphasis>
        , Fred noted that this tragic event was to change his family's whole way of life and eventually turn his steps towards Canberra and the Commonwealth parliament.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The family had to move to Sydney and struggled through the worsening depression that followed. Fred left school at 14 to assist the family.
         <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         </emphasis>
         His first job was with a bicycle firm as a messenger, and he soon became an active member of the Federated Clerks Union with which he was to maintain a lifelong association. It was during these early years of hardship that Fred started to develop his passion for politics and his unswerving dedication for the Labor Party cause. He joined the local branch of the ALP and resolved that he would try to enter parliament. Fred achieved his ambition in 1943 when Australia was at war.

         In his maiden speech on 7 October 1943, Fred was able to look beyond the war to postwar reconstruction, to a better social and economic order. Having come through the Depression, his concern was for fundamental issues affecting the ordinary people: employment, housing, health and social services. He declared that his goal as a member of parliament was to see the people of Australia:

        Fred's passionate commitment to ordinary working men and women and their families was very eloquently testified to by the turnout at his funeral in his own home suburb, at which there were just so many people present giving silent witness and testimony to their enormous affection for Fred and the role that he played in their lives—coming as they did from so many different backgrounds—during his years of service to, and residence in, the electorate.

         Throughout his political career Fred remained true to his commitment to a better social order, most notably through his achievements in electoral reforms when he served as Minister for Services and Property in the Whitlam government. In his three decades of illustrious and memorable career in the House of Representatives—and it was both of those things—Fred was Opposition Whip from 1950 to 1956, and Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House from 1972 to 1975. He also served as a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security from 1943 to 1946, a member of the Rationing Commission from 1946 to 1950, a member and later Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee on the ACT from 1967 to 1972 and a member of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council from 1970 to 1973.

         Fred made a huge contribution to Australian public life. But perhaps most significantly of all, he humanised the parliamentary process and brought it closer to people through his understanding of the forms and practices of the parliament and the way he handled the place and, above all, through his brilliant wit and his enduring sense of humour. In the introduction of his book
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Politician Who Laughed

         , Fred offered the following account of his personal philosophy, which I think is worth putting on the record:

        I was privileged to serve in Parliament with some of the great political performers, masters of the arts of scorn, ridicule, satire, and humour, who used them devastatingly to win their point. Humour as practised by the masters of these skills—in Parliament or in the public forum—was not for amusement; it was to win an argument, cheerfully yet effectively. Humour to be good should be without malice. It should be good natured, pertinent, and effective in its application—and you must be able to laugh at yourself.

        I think we would all acknowledge these days that that is very good advice. Fred Daly, above all, was a great Australian character and it is worth saying that there are not too many of those left in the Australian parliament these days. Maybe it is just nostalgia talking with all the error which we are prone to with nostalgia, but the political process does seem to dry up the juices of the current generations of politicians in a way that never seemed to be the case in earlier years.

         When Fred retired from politics in 1975 he was the Father of the House and had the distinction of having served with 10 prime ministers, spanning the terms of nine governor-generals. He will be remembered very fondly indeed and missed greatly by both sides of politics. He was truly a unique and outstanding parliamentarian. In 1978, recognising all that, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia, AO, for his services to politics.

         He lived life to the full—as, I guess, his family present among us today will readily testify. In the 20 years of his retirement, he became a much loved writer and public speaker about Australian politics. His fund of memories and anecdotes—even if we heard them all about 53 times; and they were never any less funny on each subsequent occasion—did serve to keep younger generations informed and interested in the political history of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s where so much of his political life had been lived.

         Fred Daly died at his daughter's home in Sydney on 2 August at the age of 83. In his own words, his allegiances were to his God, his family, his party and his football teams—and, as was said of him, he kept the faith. It is a bit difficult to imagine a simpler, more modest description of the man and his aspirations than his description of himself. Equally, it would be difficult to imagine a more honest statement about the man and his values. He had no special advantages in life—born of Irish immigrant parents with an elementary education—yet he became a minister in our national government, a formidable tactician, Leader of the House, and a professional and dedicated parliamentarian.

         As was said by Senator Gareth Evans, although Fred Daly retired from the House in 1975, he certainly remained a national figure. Indeed, as a result of his conducted tours of Canberra and the precincts of Parliament House, Fred probably became better known than he was as a minister. Through Fred thousands of Australians gained a better appreciation of their national capital and their national parliament and a more tolerant view of us, their representatives. As parliamentarians, we could not have asked for a better emissary.

         Fred Daly spent 32 years in the parliament, his first two terms as the member for Martin and the remainder as the member for Grayndler. He entered the parliament and made his maiden speech during the war. He was the embodiment of Labor traditions; he provided a continuity. He served under 10 prime ministers and four former prime ministers and, interestingly, in his own superministry laid out in his political memoirs excluded most of them. Perhaps that was his way of having the last laugh. We on the opposition side acknowledge Fred Daly's contribution and his achievements and offer sincere condolences to his family.

         He was a parliamentarian for more than 30 years, something which I think would quite surely try one's sense of humour, and a minister in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975. In his retirement he became well known as a humorist and as a witty and well loved commentator on Australian politics. He was a man of generous spirit and great wit. For me and for my colleagues he symbolises that larger than life type of Labor politician that came out of the 1940s and 1950s—a type which has unfortunately become all too rare in Australian politics today.

         But it is important that Fred Daly be remembered for more than his ability to entertain and amuse. As former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pointed out, Fred Daly made a significant contribution to government in Australia. He was largely responsible for the voting age being lowered to 18, for major electoral reform, for people in the territories obtaining Senate representation, and for the first legislation requiring parliamentarians to declare their financial interests. I found it interesting, too, that Mr Whitlam observed that nothing Fred Daly ever said in the House could not be said in public or in private. That, I think, says much about the integrity of Fred Daly, both the man and the politician.

         In this year, when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Second World War, Fred Daly's death takes on a particularly poignant significance, and that is because he was the last survivor of the wartime government of John Curtin, a government which served Australians well in one of the most difficult and darkest periods of our history. The very fact that I can stand here and say that Fred Daly was a member of that wartime government and, some 30 years later, a member of the Whitlam government, says not just that his political career was a long one but that he was there right in the thick of things at some of the most crucial and dramatic moments in this country's history. It says that, despite his regret at spending so many years in opposition, he lived a fine, full and vigorous life.

He made no secret of the fact that, although he was a Labor man through and through, he personally had little time for the privatisation agenda of the Hawke and Keating governments.

To people of my generation in the Labor Party and the labour movement, Fred Daly was our continuing link with the Curtin and Chifley governments. Through Fred's speeches and stories he brought to life the personalities and the political events of the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. Of course, Fred's great heroes—John Curtin and Ben Chifley, Prime Ministers of Australia during the war and postwar years—have been noted by other speakers.

         It is somewhat ironic that in this year, which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, we remember that John Curtin passed away just a few short weeks before the end of the war in the Pacific and we note that Fred Daly passed away only a matter of days before that 50th anniversary commemoration. As has been noted so often in the obituaries and speeches about Fred, he was our last link with the Curtin government.

         Many of those years, particularly during the 1950s and the 1960s, were turbulent years for the Australian Labor Party. Fred was a very active participant in all the struggles and internal battles which, dare I say it, somewhat approached civil war at times. Fred Daly was always able to convey to those of us who were not around then both the seriousness and the drama of those occasions, and he was able to do it with genuine humility, with good humour and without rancour. Fred truly played it tough, but he always played it fair.

         Unfortunately, whilst Fred Daly spent over 30 years in this parliament, he spent only a short three years in government and in the ministry. That was too short a time for a person who had made such a great contribution and who so richly deserved the honour and distinction of being a minister in government. Fred's contributions during those three years of the Whitlam government have been well documented, particularly his efforts in regard to electoral reform and the granting of the vote to 18-year-olds. Fred's contribution to the Labor Party was honoured with life membership in not one but two branches, the New South Wales branch and the ACT branch.

         Recently I was reading the biographical notes put out by the Parliamentary Library about Fred Daly, and I was interested to note a couple of things that have not been as widely publicised about him as have many of his other great attributes. For instance, Fred Daly was a great battler for backbenchers and took steps when he first got into government—in the ministry—to improve the lot of backbenchers. He had spent such a long time in opposition that he knew what the requirements were going to be of future members of parliament on the back bench and he did something about them.

         But Fred also was campaigning as far back as 1953 on the impact of aircraft noise on the residents of Sydney—something that a few of us are going through at the moment on the Senate committee. As far back as 1953, Fred campaigned hard and campaigned long on behalf of those residents in his electorate and in surrounding electorates—an issue ignored at the time by the then Liberal government but belatedly discovered by some of the opposition members today.

         I listened to the remarks of supporters of the Government who took part in the debate tonight. What a weird and wonderful collection they were. First we had the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Robinson), who lives on the north coast of New South Wales. He is one of the people whom the aeroplanes carry over my electorate at midnight and keep half the population awake.

         Fred of course, as we all remember, was dismissed along with the Whitlam government in 1975, and anybody who was around in those times will never forget that experience. As a person who believed in fairness, in democracy and in the right of governments to govern, Fred Daly was naturally offended by the dismissal of the Whitlam government. Yet he could still bring humour to even that grave crisis. One of his most famous and wittiest speeches ever delivered in the parliament was at the time of the Khemlani affair when he described in humorous terms the cloak and dagger comings and goings of Tirath Khemlani around Canberra, and at one stage actually referred to Khemlani as somebody who was probably a half-brother to Leilani, the then Melbourne Cup racehorse.

         I have particularly had the great pleasure of knowing Fred Daly through his family, Lawrie, Margaret, Anne, Kate, Clare and Michael who are in the gallery today. The Dalys moved into the area in which I lived some years ago and joined my local branch. Fred was always available for fund-raisers and we came to know and love him like anybody in the Labor Party and in general who knew Fred. I am pleased to be able to acknowledge today the presence of the Daly family, great friends of mine and my wife, Jan, and to record that Fred's son, Lawrie, and his daughter, Margaret, and the family carry on Fred's great tradition. They are great workers for the party, for the local schools, for the parish community and for the sporting organisations. I cannot help but think that what was so touching at Fred Daly's funeral in Sydney was the long lines of local people who took communion that day at the church. It was a real symbol of how loved Fred was in his local community by the ordinary folk.

         It has been said that Fred had three loves: his family; his faith; and his party. He also, of course, loved his football. But he also had another love and that was for the institution of parliament itself. He had great respect for it and he was always willing to encourage others, whether they were younger members of parliament or political aspirants like myself or people who were visiting Canberra. He was always interested in bringing them to the parliament to pass on his great store of knowledge and good humour to them.

         He was indeed loved in this community. He was, as has been mentioned, involved in the territory getting representation in the Senate. Of course, a measure of his humour and the way he dealt with people was his comment to Senator Forshaw, and to me, about life after death—`She's a senator. Ha, ha, ha!' But Fred Daly was the person who, in fact, made sure that the territory got representation in the Senate. However, that sort of comment was never hurtful or malicious. There could frequently be a cutting edge to the things that he said, but they were not personal comments to the person to whom they were directed.

         I think I first met him when I was in Western Australia and he was a minister in the Whitlam government. I knew him for a long time after that. I admired and respected his consistency of purpose and the contribution that he made. I always enjoyed his company. I am pleased that in people's assessment of him they have consistently made two points that would otherwise have led him, I think, to be underestimated. The first point is that, whilst he was a great humorist, he was more than a humorist; he was a person of substance. Secondly, whilst he was a popular person and a person of goodwill and many good deeds, he would never have wanted people to have thought that he was some sort of soft touch. He was a pretty tough old politician because he did the things that he thought were important to achieve the outcomes to which he was committed. He would not have wanted people to describe him as some sort of saintly milksop. That would not be the view that he had of himself.

         He has been fairly accurately, appropriately and positively described by others. I simply want to join in those remarks and say something about Fred Daly and Canberra. I join with Senator Reid in doing so. The list of things that one could say about Fred's contribution to Canberra is too long to even attempt. It is hard to remember that it is 20 years since he ceased being a member of parliament in 1975. In all those years he continued to be an active and effective participant in the social and public life of Canberra and made a great contribution as an advocate for and an activist within Canberra.

         The last time I saw him—and it summed up several of the elements of his life—was on the day when he was made a life member of the ACT branch of the Labor Party. I was overseas when I heard, to my great shock, that he had died. That he was made a life member of the Labor Party and that it was in Canberra, in addition to the recognition he received in his home state of New South Wales, was appropriate in relation to both his political commitment and his contribution to the ACT. He made a very effective speech that day. It was short, to the point, and witty, but with a substantial political thread running right through it.

I first got to hear Fred, not to know him, when as someone leaving the country and coming to the city I discovered one could listen to the broadcast of parliament. This is about the time when my interest in politics was being awoken. Listening to Fred as Leader of the House in the Whitlam years was to me, sitting at home on my days off from nursing, an opportunity to spend the whole time hearing what was happening and how Fred was leading the House: his humour, his barb, his political nous and his ability.

         It was a great honour to meet the gentleman, to know him, and to know his family. I joined the Labor Party the year when Fred ceased to be the member for Grayndler, but he never left parliament. He was often to be seen in the corridors of parliament and whilst, yes, we were told that there was life after death when we met him, he was still interested to know what we were doing, how we were going and what was happening. He never lost that interest.

         I saw him just a couple of weeks before this place adjourned for the last recess. At that time I had an opportunity to have a short and quick but delightful discussion with Fred about what was happening. He could tell you what the opposition was doing wrong and how they were going to make fools of themselves—all those wonderful things. As everyone has said, his sense of humour was wonderful and his wit will never be forgotten.

He also never forgot what his colleagues and his opponents had done. In 1983, as a change of career, I started work for David Simmons. I came to know Tony Luchetti, a contemporary of Fred's, very well. I had been at a function with Fred and he had asked me what I was doing, where I was working, and just generally catching up. I told him I had seen Tony. The first thing he said was, `Ah, but Tony voted such and such a way at such and such a time on such and such an issue.' A couple of weeks later I met Tony Luchetti and I said, `Fred asked me to pass on his regards.' Tony said, `Yes. Fred voted such and such a way at such and such a time on such and such an issue.' They had been on opposite sides of the debate in the caucus room and 30 years later they still remembered.

         He was always happy to attend ALP fundraising functions. I know he travelled long distances to do so. I have fond memories of attending a fundraising function one night at Temora. I think two former state ministers who attended the function were Harry Jensen and Syd Einfeld. It was billed as a retirement farewell for them by Terry Sheahan. Whilst they were the guests, Fred was the MC for the evening. For 40 minutes Fred had his audience almost rolling on the floor. Temora is not a Labor town and it is not in the middle of a Labor area. But the number of people of all political persuasions who came to hear this legendary figure was wonderful. It was a great tribute to him. Today I wish to be associated with all of the tributes. To Lawrie, Margaret, Anne and the children can I say that my sympathy and thoughts are with you.

The great thing about Fred was that you could bring on a parliamentarian and a minister at a dinner and you might get a few people interested—those who were really committed to the Labor Party—but if you had Fred along he would attract a whole group of people, Labor supporters, Labor Party members and a lot of people who just came along because they were interested in the witty things that Fred could say.

He believed things absolutely and he believed in things absolutely. I have to say that Lawrie, Anne, Kate, Clare and Michael, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing, have carried on that tradition of believing in things very strongly.

         Fred Daly was a character that comes only once in a lifetime, particularly in this place. I think the measure of the man was not only in the funny jokes that he could tell but also in the way in which he performed in this place as a member of parliament in the Whitlam government, the way he performed after he retired from parliament and the way in which he set an example for a large number of people within the Labor Party. I am sure that he was also admired by a lot of people on the opposite side of this chamber.

         Fred Daly was the type of person, no matter where you were, particularly in this parliament, to spend some time having a long discussion about not only politics but also, as someone mentioned before, the Raiders and football. I must say that that was one area that Fred and I never agreed on because of my support for the Broncos and his support for the Raiders. But we had a lot of discussions that we could agree on, and  those discussions were in relation to what was happening politically in Canberra and what was happening on the political scene in other states. He would always ask what was happening in Queensland and I would give him a run-down. He would then say to me that he thought they ought to do this, this or this, in no uncertain terms. The way in which Fred Daly used to become a part of a discussion and take an interest in not only the political situation here but in other states is something that we will not see again for a long time.

         If one were to say something about Fred Daly, from a Labor Party point of view one could say a lot—and I think a lot has been said. But the one thing that shows the type of person he was, was his friendship with Jim Killen. Jim Killen was a Queenslander. I think Fred might have had some sort of liking for Queenslanders. I can remember Fred and Jim on many occasions having a quiet discussion—more than a quiet discussion on some occasions—but always remaining strong friends. For anyone as strong politically as Killen and as strong politically as Daly to remain friends shows very clearly the measure of the person that I speak about—Fred Daly.

I thought something had happened to one of the members of my family. He said, `Fred Daly died and his funeral will be on before you get back, dad.'

         —I will end the debate by sharing a brief vignette with you. Senator Forshaw mentioned that Fred Daly was a regular visitor to the gallery. So it was. You would often see him up here with 20 or 30 people around him. Those people were generally public servants taking part in the parliamentary familiarisation seminars that Fred Daly was conducting.

         But he did not want to give them any ordinary tour. Anybody can go and see the Great Hall, the public areas and come in to see the chambers—the ordinary public can do that. Fred wanted to give them something extra. I do not know how many others he used this way, but he used to burst into my office with 30 or 40 people in tow behind him and simply take over the office. It did not matter what I was doing or where I was. He managed to get past all those officers who normally guard my privacy so well and burst in.

         His comment was not the usual comment about life after death as a senator and so on. It was, `Here is obviously a man who has no worries,' as I looked furrowed and tense before question time, because he would usually observe question time just after his visit to my office. Nobody dared knock him back. Who knocks back an icon or a national treasure? That is the way he was seen in the office. He was always a welcome visitor to the office and welcome wherever I met him.

I also hope that somebody else takes up the political tours of Canberra, because it would be a great loss indeed if they were not to continue, based on the knowledge that Fred has given us but building on it as we go along. I would like to join in what everybody has said and add my condolences to the family who are present with us in the gallery. I ask honourable senators to stand in silence to signify their assent to the motion.

         —Senator O'Chee, by letter dated 11 July 1995, has raised with me matters of privilege under standing order 81, and asked that I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. I have determined that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence. Because of the significance of the issue arising from those matters, it is important that I set out in some detail the reasons for my determination. With the concurrence of the Senate, I will incorporate a statement of reasons into

         The essence of the first matter raised by Senator O'Chee is that certain persons have been threatened with legal action and that the basis of the threatened action is, at least in part, the provision by those persons of information to Senator O'Chee concerning matters which he has raised in the Senate. Senator O'Chee suggests that the purpose of the threatened actions is to intimidate those persons in relation to the provision of information to members of Parliament.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator O'Chee's letter raises the very significant question of whether actions taken against persons in respect of their provision of information to members of Parliament may constitute a contempt, in the words of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, as conduct which
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or a committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This question has not been determined, either by parliamentary cases or by judgments of the courts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is well established that a threat to take legal action against a person may constitute a contempt where the threat is intended or likely to influence a person in respect of the provision of evidence to a court, a House or a committee. The courts have made this principle clear in relation to contempt of court, and the Senate Privileges Committee, and other parliamentary privileges committees, have accepted the principle in the course of their work.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The question is whether such a threat constitutes a contempt when directed at the provision of information to a member of Parliament for the purpose of having a matter raised in Parliament. A strong case can be made out that the contempt jurisdiction extends to that area. Obviously the provision of information to members for the purposes of raising matters in Parliament is highly significant to the performance by members of their parliamentary functions and an important means by which matters may be raised in Parliament. Members would be significantly affected in their work if such provision of information were to be regularly subjected to threats of legal action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator O'Chee also raises the question of whether the provision of information to a member for the purposes of raising a matter in Parliament may be protected by parliamentary privilege in so far as it may fall within matters "for purposes of or incidental to, the transaction of the business of a House or a committee" within the meaning of subsection 16(2) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. The answer to this question, however, does not determine the answer to the question concerning the contempt jurisdiction, although, if it were held that such provision of information is covered by parliamentary privilege, this would be persuasive in any consideration of the question of the contempt jurisdiction. It is not necessary for me to consider the question.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am required by Resolution 4 of the Senate's Privilege Resolutions to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence, having regard to the following criteria:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        (a)the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for Senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        (b)the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to criterion (a), it is clear that interference with the ability of citizens to provide information to members of Parliament could substantially obstruct members in the performance of their functions; the question of whether the contempt jurisdiction is necessary to provide reasonable protection probably depends on the open question of extent of the contempt power. In relation to criterion (b), the only other remedy is for the persons concerned to defend any legal action against them, but, as has been indicated, the legal question involved does not determine the question of the extent of the contempt jurisdiction, and, as Senator O'Chee points out, threatened actions may have a chilling effect on persons who might otherwise provide information to members, and a threatened action which is not proceeded with can put a potential defendant to a great deal of trouble and expense.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I therefore think that the matter raised by Senator O'Chee substantially meets the criteria I am required to consider, and I think that I should allow the matter to be referred to the Privileges Committee so that that committee can determine the very significant question which arises in relation to the Senate's contempt power.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee, of course, will also determine the questions of fact in respect of the particular cases raised by Senator O'Chee; I am not required to determine those questions of fact for the purposes of determining whether a motion for a reference to the Privileges Committee should have precedence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator O'Chee also states that legal action has been threatened against him in relation to his intention to raise this matter as a matter of privilege, and he indicates that this threat was made in order to deter him from so raising the matter. It is well established that threatening members of Parliament with legal action in order to influence them in the conduct of their parliamentary duties may constitute a contempt. This matter therefore clearly meets the criteria I am required to consider.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I therefore determine that a motion in respect of the matters raised by Senator O'Chee may have precedence.

        We have been debating a lot of important matters here so far today, but none more important, I think, than the current account deficit. The current account deficit for 1994-95 was over $26 billion—the highest ever. This represents a $10 billion deterioration on last year. It means that for every $100 we as a nation earn we are spending almost $106—overspending we could only finance by increasing foreign debt or selling off more and more of our national assets to foreign investors.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Our current account deficit is now the largest of any OECD country, even higher than Mexico. It is true that we are probably close to the peak of this particular economic cycle and, perhaps, the deficit will start to fall. We certainly hope so. But the fact remains that the current account has been in deficit for 24 years running. How much longer can we, as a nation, continue borrowing and selling off our assets to fund a way of life which we want and have become accustomed to but which we cannot afford?

         Jacking up interest rates to the highest level in the world, then waiting and hoping for the cycle to turn, is an extraordinarily blunt, short-term and, ultimately, destructive policy answer. But that so far is all this government has offered. My colleague Senator Spindler will concentrate on our export and import performance and the inadequacy of this government's trade and industry policies, but I want to concentrate on the government's financial market policies and the impact that these are having on the current account.

         It was no surprise to the Democrats that in the last quarter imports of consumption goods in July rose by nine per cent, while imports of capital goods fell by 15 per cent. This reflects the slowdown in business investment going on because of interest rates, in our view, and also the build-up of consumer spending, much of it financed by debt. In the same week as those figures were released, the Reserve Bank revealed that personal loans jumped $1.6 billion in the three months to June—the largest quarterly rise since figures have been kept, that is, since 1989. That increase comes on top of the massive 16.5 per cent increase in housing lending over the past year to a new total of $158 billion. Household debt is twice the level it was just five years ago. Despite the rhetoric, incomes have not risen all that much in recent years. Not surprisingly, households are saving much less. In fact, our national savings rate is just one third of the rate of a decade ago.

         In the 1980s when the current account went through the roof it was because of a massive debt-financed speculative boom by business. But this time business has been more restrained, funding growth mostly by savings. It is households which are spending, spending and spending—spending money they do not have but which the banks, with the benefit of enjoying fat profits on home and personal loans, are more than happy to give them. With higher interest rates and low income growth, an increasing number of households have been caught in this vice.

         What the Democrats believe is needed is a stronger commitment to national savings, and it is needed now—not in three years or 10 years or when the government sees fit to respond to the FitzGerald report in detail. It means a few things. It means attacking the debt culture in this country, it means making it more attractive to save, it means reducing the taxation on medium-term interest bearing savings, promoting employee share plans and better targeting superannuation tax concessions. Yet the government sits on its hands and the opposition criticises.

         —No, it is using the five minutes at the end. The government rejects this urgency motion moved by the Democrats. We have heard most of this comment before from the Democrats. We know the prescription that Senator Spindler has, which is to turn Australia into a cloistered, closed economy which all through the `50s, the `60s and the `70s made Australian industry uncompetitive. It meant Australian consumers paid far too much for goods that were not of international standard or quality. It also meant that our manufacturing industries were going backwards.

         In the 15 minutes that I have available, I want to put on the record some of the facts and figures that deal with the issues raised in Senator Kernot's motion. The 1995-96 current account deficit is expected to be $27 billion. That has been stated in the budget clearly and unambiguously by the government. It is similar in nominal terms to the preliminary outcome of the 1994-95 budget of $26.1 billion. However, as a proportion of GDP, the current account deficit is forecast to improve from the budget forecast of around six per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 5 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1995-96.

         An improvement in net export volumes in the terms of trade is expected to be offset by a rise in the net income deficit, resulting in the small increase in the current account deficit. Imports of goods and services in volume terms are expected to rise by eight per cent in 1995-96 compared with the expected increase of 17 per cent in 1994-95. The forecast slowing in import volume growth largely reflects the anticipated slowing in the domestic demand growth in 1995-96 as relative to 1994-95, which is clearly the government's stated policy in the budget of this year.

         Exports of goods and services in volume terms are forecast to increase by nine per cent compared with four per cent in 1994-95. The pick-up in export volume growth will reflect a growth in rural exports, given the assumed return to more normal weather conditions in grain growing areas. Though New South Wales is still suffering, in southern Australia, particularly in South Australia at the moment, we may well have one of the best crops ever in cereals and grains. Strong growth is expected to continue for elaborately transformed manufactures and service exports, reflecting the ongoing strength of international demand and competitiveness of Australian industry.

         The improvements in the terms of trade reflect strengthening in commodity prices in 1995-96, as world industrial production increases and fundamentals such as falling stockpiles improve in many commodity markets. In particular, higher coal and iron ore contract prices negotiated with the Japanese for the period April 1995 to March 1996 are expected to boost aggregate export prices. The net income deficit is expected to rise in 1995-96. This reflects higher interest payments flowing from increases in world interest rates since early 1994.

         As you can see, we do not run away from the fact that we still have a problem with the current account deficit. We want to put those figures on the record, as we did in the budget. Even today in the parliament Senator Cook acknowledged that this is a major problem that has to be dealt with. In dealing with it, there are a number of issues which the government has taken on. First of all, it is to improve the savings pool in Australia by the establishment and expansion of superannuation to allow Australians to improve their ability to fund their retirement from their own superannuation. This is a long-term program. I have seen criticism in the media by some commentators saying that the full benefit of this will only be received by people who are now 18 years of age and who will get it after 40 years of work in the Australian work force. This has been criticised as not being able to provide the full benefit.

         —No, Senator Kernot, some commentators have said this and have accused the government of taking this long-term view. I have to say that Australia has culturally suffered in many ways by the fact that we have not taken the long-term view in planning, the long-term view in structuring our economy and the long-term view, particularly in this case, of the savings pool. We say with some pride that we are thinking about 18-year-old kids going out to get a job in the next year or so. When they retire in 40-odd years time, they will be able to retire with very close to average weekly earnings for the rest of their retirement period.

         We believe that the savings pool is being addressed, as are other micro-economic reform measures, of which there are too many to mention now. We have taken many measures through the 1980s and the 1990s to make Australia more competitive. It means that, over the longer term, particularly as we move to a higher expansion of exports from elaborately transformed manufactures, this is where the best growth will be in our economy.

         Often we hear criticism that our Australian economy and industry is being affected by the import of cheap  manufactured goods from low wage countries. If you look at the figures for all of the countries with a substantial trade with Australia in the north Asia and east Asia area—most of them with wages a lot less than Australia—only one at the moment, I think it is China, has a balance of trade which sometimes is a bit negative for us and which sometimes is in surplus. Other than China, we have a substantial trade surplus with the countries with the very lowest wage levels. Whether it is Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia or Korea, we have a substantial trade surplus. The countries with which we have a substantial trade deficit are the countries with the highest labour wages in the world. They are North America, Canada, the US, eastern Europe, Germany, France, Great Britain and Scandinavian countries. They are the countries with the highest labour wages because we import from them the high value added products that our mature economy needs.

         It is not until we get a high level of elaborately transformed manufactures into our export mixture that we will be able to effectively address the current account deficit. Certainly in the Working Nation statement and in a number of statements over the last decade, the government in industry policy, in my own portfolio area, has consistently aimed to make Australian industry in the manufacturing area and in the value added area internationally competitive. For example, we have seen car exports in a decade grow from barely $100 million or more to $1 1/2 billion. Not only the major car manufacturers but also many car component manufacturers, particularly in my own state, are now exporting successfully.

         Foreign debt is also mentioned in the motion. Australia's net foreign debt at the end of March 1995 was $166.9 billion or 37 per cent of GDP. Although the peak was reached at the end of September 1993—$174 billion, or 42 per cent of GDP—we admit the level is significantly higher than the level of net foreign debt in the early 1980s. A build-up in foreign debt as a result of the current account deficit is not necessarily an undesirable development, so long as the deficits are geared towards exploiting investment opportunities which are capable of generating sufficient returns to cover servicing costs. It must be remembered that 61 per cent of Australia's net foreign debt is owed by private sector borrowers. Unfortunately, every time the community hears about Australia's debt, they believe it is all Commonwealth debt, government debt, but it is overwhelmingly private sector borrowers. It is they, rather than the economy as a whole, that accept the risk associated with holding this debt and, so far, they have been able to service that debt.

But no-one has suggested—and we have to be careful about this, Senator Kernot—that this debt is not serviceable in the private sector.

Over a five-year period we have halved the service costs as a proportion of exports. This is a significant improvement. The main reason is that our policy of encouraging our manufacturing and service industries to grow their exports has meant that we are in a better position to service the debt. That has not been acknowledged often enough by senators opposite. Government and industry policy, through the Working Nation statement in particular, is to encourage our SMEs—our small- to medium-sized enterprises with between 15 and 25,000 employees and which are not exporting at the moment—to get into exports to further grow the real value-added exports that help our Australian economy.

         Senator Kernot in her remarks mentioned household debt. Certainly household debt has increased since 1983 but, again, this fact has to be kept in balance. People should not get carried away by a fear campaign that the country is going broke. While we acknowledge that household indebtedness has increased in Australia, we realise it has been at a much more moderate pace than that in other countries. Household debt in Australia is much lower than in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. They are a reasonably good cross-section of OECD economies that people often like to compare us with. When we compare ourselves with them, we find our household debt level is lower. So before people start on fear campaigns, saying that this country is overwhelmingly swimming in debt, let us do a comparison with most of our OECD partners and see we are doing quite well. We do not run away from the current account deficit problem. We have addressed it in the long term by improving the savings pool through superannuation structural changes.

         We certainly fully endorse the calls for the government to take action on the horrific state of the current account deficit in our external accounts. For a long time now we have been calling on the government to address this problem. It is a problem which is getting worse and which has been chronic throughout the periods of the Hawke and Keating governments and which is due, essentially, to the policy mismanagement of the government. We have been calling on the government to address both the macro- and micro-economic deficiencies in their policies that have led to the situation we find ourselves in today, where Australia's current account deficit is the highest in the developed world.

This year, Mexico's current account deficit is forecast to fall to less than two per cent of GDP; and probably to move into surplus in the next two years. By comparison, our current account deficit is six per cent of GDP.

The Argentinas and the Mexicos of this world have absolutely put us to shame in that respect. The tragedy is that, despite all the hardship that the Australian people have gone through over the last decade to attempt ostensibly to correct our balance of payments problem, we have a bigger problem today.

You might also recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was that current account deficit in 1989-90, particularly with the huge growth in expenditure relative to the growth of production in our economy, that caused the government to engineer the recession which started towards the middle or end of 1990.

The reason for that is the failure of the government to take the policies that are necessary to release the potential in the Australian economy through its people, resources, skills and talents, and its place in this region of the world, which is the highest growth region of the world, to allow us to capitalise and realise our tremendous potential.

         Instead of a healthy balance of payments situation, which we certainly should have, we have now just racked up in the last 12 months the 11th current account deficit of more than $2 billion. That is an obscene figure. If people suggested five years ago that we would have deficits of that order, they would have been laughed out of court. Yet we now have the situation where the media in Australia, some of the financial markets and certainly the government are saying, `Isn't it great if the deficit falls from $2.9 billion, the greatest level ever recorded in Australia'—as was the case in May—`to about $2.5 billion', which is the second largest figure ever recorded.' We went from the greatest figure ever recorded to the second greatest figure ever recorded, yet the government, through the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and others, has said that things are on the improve.

That compares with a figure of $23,000 million when this government took office in 1983—in other words, the present figure is seven times higher.

         The Democrat motion does not go far enough. It should call on the government to address some of the more obvious and overdue areas of reform which are essential to addressing the current account deficit problem, such as industrial relations reform and continued micro-economic reform. In his speech today Senator Schacht talked about the car industry and its potential. That industry has great potential.

The necessary micro-economic reforms could boost the local industry to about 700,000 units per year and create thousands and thousands of additional jobs. What the government has done by its failure to address these basic issues is to increase unemployment to a staggeringly high continuing level, to restrain growth in Australia, to smash savings, to inhibit investment and, through that, to impose long-term structural problems which this country will have the greatest of difficulty in solving unless urgent, immediate changes are made to the whole stance of policy making in this country.

Economic or capital transfers remain a huge problem because of the flow of money offshore as interest payments, the repatriation of profits and assets and investment subsequently reinvested overseas. But we are seeing a growing imbalance between imports and exports. This is driven by the increase in consumer imports. These are two sides to the same coin.

         The consumer issue results from a failure to address the need for a viable domestic economy. There is almost exclusive concentration on the export economy, but we import what we do not make ourselves. The impetus for developing a diverse and higher value export sector often comes from the development of industries for the domestic market.

         The problem has been exacerbated by the pre-emptive reduction of tariffs and trade barriers and a willingness to sacrifice industries at the altar of free trade. Our industries are now competing in an international arena in which many of their competitors are heavily subsidised and can depend on other governments to use non-financial power to secure deals, and where other nations rigidly protect their own domestic economic interests. Japan and the United States are both notorious for such practices, while most developing nations retain high tariff barriers and actively support the development of their domestic industry.

         One impact of this failure is that we are increasingly dependent on imports for all our normal consumer goods: clothes, appliances, hardware and tools, as well as most of our high-tech electronic goods, manufacturing equipment and many of our secondary materials, including steel. With the takeover of most of the remaining Australian brands in the food industry by Nestle, we can now expect that the profits of this industry will almost totally flow overseas.

         The gulf between rich and poor increases. The government claims the welfare net is better, but a means-tested handout to compensate for lack of real wages is not real equity. More and more people are belonging to the working poor. As price becomes more important, people are pushed more and more to buy the cheapest option, usually an import. They are more dependent on loans to cover wage shortfalls. Historically, the evidence shows that savings does not lead to a good balance of payments figure. It is actually the other way around. When the economy is doing well, when people have money, they save. When people are hard-pressed, they do not save—they borrow.

         The most recent assault is the United States attack on the Foreign Investment Review Board, an ironic attack given the record of the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Greens have been calling for some time for an abandonment of the export market transnational corporation orientation of government. We have been calling for a refocus on the domestic economy and the development of industry, trade and investment policy. It is time we realised that the purpose of national government is to look after the real wellbeing of the people in our nation, not to serve an ideology that says the only way we can get ahead is to sacrifice ordinary people in the interests of corporate profits.

         —I would like to start by making three fundamental points. Firstly, Australia's current account deficit is fundamentally and structurally too high and, as a percentage of GDP, I understand, it is currently the highest in the Western world. No economist or commentator sees that as sustainable. It is caused by a lack of savings, both public savings, despite the shonky 1995-96 federal budget balance, and private savings, which basically revolve around a lack of after-tax savings to provide an environment for investment. In addition to that, there are these road blocks on our productivity which make import replacement unattainable and real pie-in-the-sky objectives. We wait in vain to see the J-curve working and we have heard a lot about it for a number of years.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second fundamental point is that, because the current account deficit is too high, when we have a real crisis like the continuing drought where we have seen wheat exports halved, grain imported, wool exports substantially reduced, and beef and lamb exports under pressure, the only avenue for escape is to go further into hock because we cannot pay our way. I want to make the point that at the moment about 60 per cent of New South Wales and 40 per cent of Queensland—an area at least twice as big as the state of Victoria—remain critically drought declared, with many farmers facing their fifth consecutive year of drought and crop failure.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Despite this, we had the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, last week predicting an extra $2 billion in wheat export earnings between November and February, basing his confidence largely on what he described as `the breaking of the drought' on ABC radio on 16 August. It is glaringly obvious to me that this government has no concept at all of the grave outlook facing Australian farmers, farming families and farming enterprises. In every sense we are looking down the barrel of a national disaster of which this government—or any government ever in Australia's history—is totally unaware.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third fundamental point is that our economy has not been structurally reformed to be able to cope with the five minutes of economic sunlight experienced after the recession. We have had a number of quarters of economic growth, but meeting demand for consumer goods has meant that the current account deficit has been increased by these imports. So the present current account crisis is based on the underlying structural problems of the economy, on a consumer debt push which is continuing and on our inability to export through particularly difficult seasonal conditions. I think that those points need to be made.

         This Labor government has had 13 years to get the economy right. It keeps telling us, `Everything is fine. Don't worry about the current account deficit. Don't worry about our past performance of high interest rates and unemployment; just continue to trust us.' I want to take a brief look at past budgets and at comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with respect to economic management, the current account and the level of our foreign debt.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If we go back to 1983, in the budget of that year Mr Keating said, `1983-84 holds the promise of a considerable improvement in economic performance.' At that stage our foreign debt stood at $23 billion. In the 1984 budget, he said:

       <para>
        Foreign debt stood at $28 billion. In the 1986 budget, he said, `The 1986-87 budget, which I have presented tonight, rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy.' He was entitled to his view but the foreign debt spiralled to $75 billion. In the 1990 budget, he said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This year, inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up . . . (all) delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.

         Then we have the Prime Minister's specific comments on the current account deficit. In 1986 he said—and this is the famous banana republic quote:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia is so undisciplined, so disinterested in its salvation, in its economic well being, that it doesn't deal with this fundamental problem . . . The only thing to do is to slow down growth to a canter . . . Then you are gone—you are a Banana Republic.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later, in March 1991, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current account deficit . . . remains Australia's most pressing pressure. I think you have to be quite clear about that.

        Later in the same month in 1991, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The worst is now behind us. The government established the strategy to deal with the current account deficit and inflation and has stuck to it and is succeeding.
       </para>
       <para>
        The foreign debt at that stage was $130 billion. In February 1992, he was quoted as saying, `Labor's plan for the next four years will create 800,000 new jobs without increasing the current account deficit.' Foreign debt at that stage was $140 billion. Recently, in July of this year, Mr Keating said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . as the economy gets back to a sustainable rate of growth, so too will we see a subside in the current account deficit. In other words, we have got the position covered.

         The Australian people are not so stupid as to continue to believe this diatribe of rhetoric and slick phrases. They know that Labor's strategy has faltered.

         We are now recording the worst current account deficit in our nation's history. Australia's accrued deficit of $2.9 billion in May works out at about $4 million per hour. In June the current account was $2.3 billion, which was seasonally adjusted.

        He said that on 29 November last year. The government has sought to restore national savings through a longer term superannuation strategy and increased public savings. The strategy is a longer term one which will leave the current account very high in the next few years, and hence the economy vulnerable to adverse overseas developments and adverse domestic developments like the present drought.

         The budget strategy is partly smoke and mirrors, as I have mentioned, because asset sales and promises of keeping to the forward estimates of spending has been something that this Labor government has consistently failed to project accurately. Vince FitzGerald, in his national savings report, has identified the lack of public saving as the main cause of our structural decline in national savings. He said:
        </tab>

        While both public and private saving have fallen, the major structural decline is in public sector saving.

        The Prime Minister, as one of his major diversions from high unemployment and economic disintegration, has concentrated on our need to change our constitutional make-up. His preoccupation has been couched in the language of national pride and independence and how to cut off our shackles of the past. Simply put, Mr Keating, we have a much greater threat to our independence from the crisis in our current account and the similar and connected foreign debt than from our constitutional make-up. If Australia were a company, the receivers would have the cheque book. There is a much greater threat to Australia from the potential intervention of the head of the International Monetary Fund than who is our head of state.

         —in reply—The gist of Senator Schacht's argument was that the current account deficit is self-managing. We say to that: at what economic cost? At the cost of the loss of economic independence and the selling off what is left of the farm. It will probably get up to the army, ultimately. His second argument was, `We are doing something about savings. We have the got superannuation guarantee charge.' Yes, we have and yes, the Democrats voted for it, but it will not realise any addition to savings that is worth mentioning until the year 2035. In the meantime, it will cost in terms of disposable income for low income earners and it will cost in the way in which it is regressively subsidised, and the government is regressively subsidising superannuation tax concessions which flow through to high income earners. So, savings for whom, Senator Murphy?

         Another point Senator Schacht made is that debt is overwhelmingly private sector debt. We agree. He says it is serviceable. Why, then, has the number of people who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments jumped by nearly 40 per cent in the last four months? As a measure of serviceability, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw that to Senator Schacht's attention.

Their attitude to the banking industry comes down to supporting a reduction in competition by an increased number of mergers. Senator Murphy says, `Well, what are your answers?'

         Current account deficits are not intrinsically bad except when they get too high. Forty years ago our current account deficit averaged about 2.5 per cent of GDP; last financial year it was six per cent of GDP. If we add to that the fact that a much higher proportion of the current account deficit is being financed by borrowings from foreigners and that they become more anxious about lending to us as our debt rises, therefore they charge us higher interest rates, we know we have an urgent problem. We have to produce more and consume less. We have to save more so that we can finance from our own savings a higher proportion of own economic development.

         For example, I refer honourable senators to page 233 of the report. Table 5.19 shows the estimated wage increases in Part VIB wage agreements, by gender industry classification. When we look at the number of agreements in the gender industry classification, which in this chart are listed as female dominated—in other words, where 60 per cent or more of the work force is female—we see there were 22 agreements over the period that were surveyed and that there were 35,700 employees covered by such agreements.

There were 225,300 people covered compared with 35,700. I think that information speaks for itself. These agreements are more readily reached in male-dominated employment areas rather than female-dominated employment areas. I commend the report.

         Those sorts of charts, diagrams and graphs are an extremely useful set of information, again demonstrating the value of monitoring the effects of government legislation after it has been passed. Far too often we are told by the Prime Minister and his ministers that some new reform will deliver the earth, the moon and the stars but, in the past, we really have not initiated or established monitoring practices to show whether in fact those things are delivered. Here we have the proof of what actually happens. We should perhaps see more of this type of report as we can use this sort of report to check on the initial hyperbole that is promoted by the government when it introduces things.

         That is not to condemn this legislation. I do not want to be misunderstood and for it to be thought that that is what I am doing here. I am saying that the basis for any criticism can more easily be established when we have monitoring such as we have here. Instead of hyperbole, I wish more often we had the actual factual bases upon which we could make our criticisms. I want to be constructive in my criticisms. I appreciate the fact that, in the area of industrial relations and enterprise bargaining as it affects women in the workplace, I now have something upon which I can establish that constructive criticism. Without it we only have the assertion that some people will be better off than others under this new system.

         Of course, this report enables us to make the judgment that enterprise bargaining is an imperfect vehicle for achieving a better economic and social balance between work and family responsibility because the report shows that fewer than half of the registered agreements have included family leave. That is a very poor take-up rate of the 1994 test case that Senator Kernot initiated.

         We are able to see in objective, factual material that is presented here the rate at which those recommendations are taken up. So we see that it is far from perfect, that it does need more consideration by the employees and their representatives in unions, and also a greater effort by employers to understand that not all employees have the capacity to bargain, to negotiate on their own behalf; especially those employees who are in part-time work or are part of a greater proportion of people who do not have English as their first language, or who do not have the training-education in the areas of negotiation. Of course, we do have those industries and it is wrong to assume that all people have equal capacity to negotiate. The negotiation can be taken up and represented by trade union organisations or even other representatives. But in this report we have a demonstration that that is not necessarily taking place and that we should consider whether it is necessary to institute other protective measures.

         The report also gives us the opportunity to see whether the people themselves are affected. I understand that 1,000-odd workplaces were surveyed and that that covered several thousand employees—I cannot remember the figure exactly, but it was something like 10,000. As part of that survey the employees themselves were asked whether they thought they were better off or not and whether they were satisfied with the system. That is the sort of monitoring that is probably even appropriate in other legislation—whether it had the effect that it was designed for or that the government led us to believe that it would have.

         I again congratulate those responsible for undertaking the report itself. Of course I have not read the entire 390 pages yet, but I intend to use this as a piece of valuable reference to establish a basis upon which, as I said before, we can all make constructive criticism. I again say that it may yet give us an example of what we can use as a future monitoring tool on other legislation.

         PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE SENATE ON GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OUTSTANDING TO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REPORTS AS AT 30 JUNE 1995
        </para>

         PREFACE
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a schedule listing Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The practice of presenting this schedule to the Senate follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement.   Subsequently   the Government has
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         advised that responses to committee reports will be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Senate has been taken as the date that the response is presented, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Senate legislation committees are often required to report on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations and therefore require a response are listed in the schedule.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The schedule does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills, though such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.

          The important point I would like to make is that it now allows the committee reference to take place—and a number of people in the community are looking forward to being involved in a reference which looks at the importance of a good standard of shipping in Australia. A number of coastal communities and fishing communities, indeed, people right throughout Australia, for some months have been looking forward to making a contribution to this committee. Obviously the performance audit by the Auditor-General is important, but it will also be important to listen to the community on issues relating to the standard of shipping in Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill contains a range of major and important reforms to bankruptcy law. It constitutes the second part of the Government's program of wholesale reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the first part of which was contained in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991, which came into operation on 1 July 1992. The major reforms contained in that Act have been very successful in ensuring that returns to creditors are increased, that appropriate weapons are available to bankruptcy trustees to deal with those who seek to avoid their obligations to disclose assets and contribute from their income and that small consumer debtors are able to get early discharges from their bankruptcy where appropriate. This Bill further advances the Government's aim of modernising this area of the law and ensuring that an appropriate balance is achieved between the aims of financially rehabilitating debtors and providing proper returns to creditors.

        In the context of this important Bill it is opportune to address briefly some of the recent ill-informed criticism of the effectiveness of bankruptcy law. This has included calls for introducing harsh provisions to strip away the wealth of the families of bankrupts, regardless of where and how it was acquired, and to nullify transfers of property made long before bankruptcy, regardless of the circumstances. These calls, if heeded, would result in substantial injustice in a large number of cases. It must be remembered that most bankrupts are ordinary people, small business people or wage and salary earners, who have got themselves into financial difficulty for a wide variety of reasons, some of which are beyond their control. For example, some farmers and small business people in rural areas have gone bankrupt because of the drought. Draconian provisions of the kind some are calling for would have an extremely harsh and unjust effect on these people and their families.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In our system, the law enables people to set up artificial entities to carry on business, restricts exposure to unlimited liability, and the commercial community relies on the various legal protections conferred on such entities in making investment decisions, carrying out entrepreneurial activities and contributing to economic growth. Risk taking and speculation are fundamental features of economic activity in our system and, while non repayment of debts, or repayments which are trifling in comparison to level of indebtedness may be highly undesirable, they are an inevitable incident of ordinary economic activity. The law also enables people to transfer assets and property freely when an individual has no creditors, although subsequent insolvency may result in such transfers of assets or property being set aside, in certain carefully defined circumstances. A rational and orderly insolvency system must concentrate its attention, as this Bill does, on defining these circumstances so as to do justice to all, not on arbitrary confiscation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is why the Government is committed to sensible, rational and balanced law reform which promotes the best interest of all Australians and improves their access to the justice system, and the measures in the Bill will further those objectives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The policy objectives underlying the many initiatives contained in the Bill are dealt with in some detail in section 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill, and I commend that to honourable Senators. In outlining the principal features of the Bill, I will also take the opportunity to respond to some of the criticism of its provisions made in submissions by the Law Council of Australia (the LCA) and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia (the IPAA), which were canvassed in debate in the House. The Government is grateful for the interest expressed by these bodies in this legislation and that both have expressed their strong support for the majority of reforms contained in this Bill. It must be remembered however that the LCA and the IPAA are only two of the stakeholders in this particular area of law—they are amongst the welfare groups, the Financial Counsellors and Credit Reform Association of Australia, community legal centres, credit providers, and the community generally. The submissions of the LCA and the IPAA express some disagreement with or reservation about the policy, not about the manner in which the Government proposes to implement the policy, contrary to what is suggested in their submissions. Whilst the LCA and the IPAA contributions are important, and they are of course entitled to express disagreement with some policy aims of the proposals, it is the Government which must determine the appropriate policy in consultation not only with them but also with the other groups, with whom they share a place at the table of debate. It ought also to be said that although the formal submissions of the LCA and the IPAA were only received shortly before the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives, the Government and its advisers were already fully acquainted with the views of those bodies, having been involved in consultations and discussions with them and their members since late 1993.

        ONE STOP SERVICE

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill proposes the abolition of the offices of Registrar and Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy, and the distribution of the functions performed by them among the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, the Official Receivers, trustees and the Federal Court. This will ensure that the public is provided with a much better service, having to deal with one administrative agency in relation to bankruptcy and personal insolvency matters, that is, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) in the Attorney-General's Department, rather than 2 agencies, ITSA and the Federal Court (by virtue of the fact that the Court's registry staff are the Bankruptcy Registrars).

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The IPAA suggested that the legislation should include provision requiring debtors and creditors to seek to obtain consents to act from registered trustees, in order to channel as much work to them as possible. Such a system was used in the early 1980s, being introduced by the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981, but it was a time consuming process which did not achieve its intended result. An examination of the Annual Reports on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 for the 1981-2 to 1985-6 financial years shows that the proportion of bankruptcy work taken on by registered trustees did not increase significantly, and the Government considers that it would be pointless to reintroduce the system. Registered trustees are conducting businesses, and it is up to them to promote and advertise their expertise and services, and by doing so to increase their share of the market. The One Stop Service will provide them with ample facilities to do so, should they so wish.

        REVISION OF ANTECEDENT TRANSACTION AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A fundamental feature of the law of bankruptcy is that, in certain circumstances, it operates to enable property and money given or transferred by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt to be recovered by the bankruptcy trustee, to enable its sale and the distribution of the proceeds of the sale to the bankrupt's creditors. The current law provides for a period of `relation back', and makes specific provision in relation to `settlements' of property (section 120), fraudulent transactions (section 121) and preferential payments or transfers to creditors (section 122).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposals in the Bill to revise the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions, and the income contribution scheme to which I shall refer later are in the Government's firm view sensible, rational and balanced, and will well serve the interests of the Australian community. The terms used in the current antecedent transaction avoidance provisions are somewhat esoteric and full of tautologies. The provisions focus largely on the nature of the transaction being impugned, and the intention of the parties to the transaction. The changes proposed to this area of the law will simplify it by changing its focus to the nature of the transactions and the likely effect on the creditors. For example, the Bill proposes the replacement of section 120 with a much simplified provision, under which a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt is void against the trustee if it took place not earlier than 5 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, and the transferee gave no consideration or consideration less than the market value of the property concerned, as at the time of the transfer. If the transfer took place more than 2 years but not more than 5 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, the transfer will be valid against the trustee if the recipient of the property proves that the transferor was not `technically insolvent' at the time. The term `technically insolvent' refers to a situation where a person's property and income are insufficient to meet the person's liabilities, including any secured liabilities and potential liabilities under a guarantee for another person.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The LCA and the IPAA expressed concern that no attempt is made in the Bill to achieve consistency with the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions applicable to the liquidation of companies under the Corporations Law. Quite simply, the provisions of the Corporations Law are simply not capable of being adapted to relate to the situation of insolvent individuals. The Corporations Law is based on the premise that a company is ordinarily managed to preserve its asset base, increase its net worth and maximise returns to shareholders through profitable activity. Giving away property is not conducive to that aim. If, for example one were to attempt to apply the test of whether a person had entered into an uncommercial transaction, of the type defined by section 588FB of the Corporations Law, the results would be absurd. That section defines uncommercial transactions as being transactions which a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into having regard to the benefits and detriments to the company of entering into the transaction, the benefits to other parties and any other relevant matter. An individual could very well benefit from giving away his or her property to a relative, a family company or a trust. A person may wish to gain tax benefits, for example, by asset planning, or the person may wish to ensure that most of the wealth that he or she had generated would not be available to creditors in the event of subsequent financial failure. The only `detriment' an individual may suffer from giving away property is the depletion of the assets he or she directly owns. However, this depletion of assets may be, and frequently is, to the person's long term advantage, particularly where the assets are given to a relative, or associated entities which the person is able to materially influence or control, even without having any direct legal control. The Law Reform Commission in its report on the General Insolvency Inquiry recommended that the law provide for the avoidance of transactions at undervalue, and the Bill does just that.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The LCA was also critical of the term `technically insolvent', which underpins the revised antecedent transaction provisions, claiming the definition is wide and uncertain and likely to lead to endless debate. That is not, of course, a reason for not changing the law to improve it. Whenever new law is introduced, it takes time for case law to settle the meaning of particular expressions. This is not a process of `endless debate', rather part of the traditional way in which the law is developed. The definition of `technically insolvent' is quite straight forward, requiring an individual's entire financial position at the time of entering into a transaction which may be void to be examined.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It must be kept in mind that the term `technical insolvency' has no relevance until a person has become a bankrupt and only then where the person has entered into a transaction which is possibly void against the trustee. The test requires the person's liabilities to be looked at against their assets and current income position at the time the impugned transaction is entered into—a balance sheet test.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As regards guarantees, all that falls for examination is the individual's maximum potential liability. How the person's liabilities may be affected because of the liabilities of co-guarantors, sureties or the principal debtor is irrelevant. A person who enters into substantial guarantees for others' debts should not, in the Government's view be able to transfer assets away from himself or herself and thus diminish the pool of available assets in the event that he or she later becomes a bankrupt. What is the meaning of a guarantee if a person can enter into one, but nevertheless avoid its consequences by transferring all of his or her assets away, notwithstanding its existence? This is undesirable, and the measures in the Bill address this.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The LCA raised some queries about the use of the test of `market value' as a determinant of whether a transaction is possibly void against a trustee. The IPAA, on the other hand, expressed strong support for the proposed new concept, stating it was much clearer and more readily capable of objective ascertainment than the present test of `valuable consideration'. There is, in the Government's view, nothing inappropriate about using market value as the determinative factor in deciding whether a transaction occurred at an undervalue. Opinions will often differ about what the actual market value of a thing is, and opinions will usually give a range of values which may be the worth of a particular item. Whether a transfer of property took place for market value will be determined by inquiring whether the item was purchased below its minimum market value. The difficulty with the existing test is that it frequently allows related parties of a person who becomes a bankrupt to retain the benefit of a transaction even though the consideration given is substantially discounted and much less that ordinary value, or even returns that might be obtained at a fire sale. It must be remembered that allowing these transactions to stand could have an adverse impact on a person's creditors, and a possible insolvency flow on.
       </para>

        Finally, in relation to the proposals in the Bill relating to avoidance of antecedent transactions, concern was expressed by the LCA that the provisions are retrospective in that they will apply to current bankruptcies, at the date of commencement of the Bill. Current bankruptcies are those in which a final dividend has not been paid to creditors. Application provisions are something to which very careful consideration is given by the Government. In bankruptcy, 3 categories need to be addressed, persons who are not yet bankrupt but who will be so in the future, persons who are currently bankrupt, and persons who have been bankrupt, but are so no longer, either because they have been discharged, or because their bankruptcies have been annulled. The proposals in the Bill will affect all 3 categories of person, except for those in the last category whose bankruptcies have been annulled, or in the cases of persons who have been discharged from bankruptcy, where the final dividend has not been paid to creditors by the trustee. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in Alert Digest No 5 of 1995 noted that although some amendments had retrospective operation their purpose `is to seek to increase the amount available for distribution to creditors whose rights to be paid in full may be considered to have been trespassed against'. That statement encapsulates what the provisions are about and is sufficient justification for the approach proposed. It might be added that to have the changes only apply to bankruptcies occurring after commencement would result in a system which would be administratively complex and burdensome on trustees and creditors, particularly as there would be parallel sets of rules operating depending on when the bankruptcy occurred, and this duality could continue for very many years into the future.

        IMPROVING THE INCOME CONTRIBUTION SCHEME
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 made a number of important reforms including, among other things, the introduction of a regime of compulsory contributions from income by bankrupts whose incomes exceed a specified threshold. This regime has been extremely effective in ensuring that those who can afford to do so make some contribution to paying their debts and increasing returns to creditors, but experience has necessitated some improvements to it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The key amendment proposed to the Act by the Bill in relation to the income contribution scheme established under Division 4B of Part VI of the Act is the revision of the definition of `income', in particular to overcome the restrictive interpretation placed on it by the Federal Court in the case of Bond v Ramsay (1994) 125 ALR 399.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the income contribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to or on account of a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, or worked or provided services for or on behalf of the benefactor. However, the Federal Court in Bond v Ramsay considered the definition of income was inadequate to enable the value of benefits provided to a bankrupt in other than an employment context to be included. The Bill includes amendments to restore the position to what it was believed and intended by the Parliament to be prior to the Federal Court decision. The LCA in its submission stated that it could not be certain that the proposed change to the definition of income would overcome the problem exposed by the Bond case. However, the Government closely studied that decision, and it turned upon the use of the definition of "fringe benefit", which is a subset of the wider term "benefit", and is inclusive of benefits other than those provided by an employer, or by another in an employment context. It can confidently be expected that the effect of the Bond decision will be overcome by the proposed change.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The LCA also stated that the power to modify any provision of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act as made applicable by the definition by regulations should be condemned and could be subject to Constitutional challenge. This statement is misconceived. There is nothing unconstitutional about enabling the provisions of an Act to be modified by subordinate legislation. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, one of whose terms of reference is to comment upon any inappropriate delegation of legislative power made no reference whatever to this in its report in Alert Digest 5/95.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Also, the definition of `income' is to be further expanded so that it will encompass the value of `loans' given to the bankrupt, whether or not the loans are strictly loans in a legal sense, or whether they are advances pursuant to some arrangement or understanding whether or not enforceable at law or in equity. Some bankrupts are given the benefit of so called loan accounts by family or related companies, in the same manner as they may receive non-cash benefits. Again, it is considered reasonable that where the bankrupt gets a benefit of this kind, it should not be to the exclusion of his or her creditors, as such loan facilities are in many cases made available by persons or other entities who have been the recipient of largesse by the bankrupt in earlier times. Entitlement to moneys accumulated in loan accounts can sometimes be regarded as assets, which vest in the trustee. These amendments are designed to ensure that benefits obtained by bankrupts from loan accounts that cannot be characterised as assets forming part of the divisible property of the estate are taken to form part of the bankrupt's income.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Income contributions are assessed in relation to contribution assessment periods (CAPs). The first contribution assessment period begins at the commencement of bankruptcy, and ends on the anniversary of that date. Subsequent periods last for one year and the final period ends when the bankrupt is discharged or the bankruptcy is annulled. The Bill proposes an amendment so that the first CAP in a bankruptcy will begin at the date of the bankruptcy, rather than at its commencement. The commencement of a bankruptcy could be many months before the actual date of bankruptcy, and it has proved difficult in practice to make assessments of income in relation to periods before the bankruptcy begins.

        REVISION OF PART X OF THE ACT BY STREAMLINING ESTABLISHMENT PROCESSES AND MAKING MEETING PROCEDURES ALIGN WITH THOSE IN BANKRUPTCY
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Part X of the Act provides for debtors to enter into insolvency administrations outside bankruptcy. In particular, a debtor can enter into a deed of assignment, a deed of arrangement or a composition. The manner in which a Part X administration is initiated is provided by a debtor signing an authority under section 188 of the Act in favour of a registered trustee or a solicitor. Within 10 days before giving the authority, the debtor must complete a statement of his or her affairs, which is given to the registered trustee or the solicitor. A solicitor's obligation is to call a meeting of the creditors. In the case of a registered trustee, the trustee, as well as having to call a meeting of the debtor's creditors, must take control of the debtor's property. The debtor is not able to deal with the property without the express authority of the trustee. The control period continues until the creditors resolve to release the debtor's property from control, a deed of assignment or deed of arrangement is executed by the debtor, a composition is accepted by the creditors, the Court releases the debtor's property from control, the debtor becomes a bankrupt or the debtor dies, whichever happens first.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill proposes a number of changes to Division 2 of Part X. First, the functions of a solicitor and those of a registered trustee will be made the same, that is, both will assume control of the property of the debtor after consenting to exercise the powers conferred by an authority under section 188. A new section 210 dealing with the accountability of controlling trustees is proposed to be inserted, which makes the provisions of Part VIII of the Act, relating to registered trustees applicable to `controlling trustees', that is registered trustees and solicitors. It is proposed that regulations should be made modifying the operation of Part VIII so that solicitors who wish to accept authorities under section 188 of the Act will have to undergo a similar sort of accreditation process as persons wishing to be registered as trustees under the Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also includes provision for the control period to come to an end by operation of law. At present, the control period can continue indefinitely, if creditors do not agree on any Part X proposal or release the debtor's property from control, the debtor does not become bankrupt or die, and no person applies to the Court for an order releasing the debtor's property from control. In these circumstances, the debtor and the controlling trustee may be exposed to liabilities for offences or costs, and it is appropriate that the period should come to an end without the need for applications to the Court or the convening of a meeting of creditors for these purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When an authority under section 188 in favour of a registered trustee comes into effect, the trustee is able to deal with the debtor's property as if he or she were the attorney of the debtor, and the debtor is not able to deal with his or her property, except to the extent the trustee authorises. The Bill will modify this position so that the coming into effect of an authority will give rise to a statutory charge over the debtor's property, so that the trustee's control over the property is enhanced, and property potentially available to creditors under a possible future Part X administration is not dissipated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provisions dealing with the calling of meetings and procedure at meetings are proposed to be repealed, and the comprehensive provisions of Division 5 of Part IV of the Act, laying down a code of meeting procedure in relation to bankruptcy, is to be made applicable to meetings under Part X so that the same set of basic rules about meetings will be applicable in all the forms of administration available under the Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another important change is that proposed to section 204 of the Act. One of the special resolutions that a meeting of creditors called pursuant to a section 188 authority can pass is that the debtor present a debtor's petition for bankruptcy within 7 days of the passing of the resolution. There are instances where the debtor does not do this, and creditors are then put to the inconvenience and expense of having to bring proceedings against the debtor. Accordingly, the Bill proposes that meetings of creditors be able to pass a special resolution that the debtor become bankrupt, and the debtor will become bankrupt by operation of law on the 15th day after the passing of the special resolution, unless the debtor applies to the court for an order setting aside the resolution. If the debtor does apply to the Court for an order, the control period will continue until the application is disposed of by the Court. If the Court dismisses the debtor's application, or the debtor's application lapses or is withdrawn, the debtor will become a bankrupt at the time of the dismissal, withdrawal or lapsing of the application. If the Court grants the debtor's application, the special resolution of the creditors will be set aside, and the debtor's property will be released from control.

        DEBT AGREEMENTS—A NEW FORM OF INSOLVENCY ADMINISTRATION
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Over a number of years, there have been calls for a form of insolvency administration outside bankruptcy and Part X that can be availed of by people with low levels of debt, few assets and low incomes who are not able to afford to enter Part Xs and in respect of whom the comparative formalities of Part X and the full rigours of bankruptcy are not necessary or desirable. The Bill proposes the insertion of a new Part IX into the Act which sets up a simple form of insolvency administration to be known as debt agreements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Debtors with levels of liability not exceeding $20,000 will be able to put forward a proposal to creditors for dealing with debts. Proposals might relate to matters such as the payment of less than the full amount of all or any of the debtor's debts, a moratorium on payment, periodic payments out of income, or an undertaking to seek financial advice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The debtor would put the proposal to the Official Trustee, that is, ITSA, which would be responsible for ascertaining whether the proposal was acceptable to the debtor's creditors. This could be done in 2 ways, either by calling a meeting of the creditors, or sending notice of the proposal to the creditors, and requesting them to indicate by voting letter whether they accept the proposal. Before a proposal can become a debt agreement, it must get the approval of 75% in value and a majority in number of creditors.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The same mechanisms will be able to be used to vary and terminate debt agreements. In addition, the Bill provides for the termination of a debt agreement by the Court, and will empower the Court to declare a debt agreement to be void. A debt agreement will otherwise come to an end when the debtor has fulfilled all of his or her obligations under it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A debt agreement could provide for the debtor to make payments to creditors directly, or for this to be done by some other third party, or perhaps, one of the creditors on behalf of the others. A debt agreement will release the debtor from debts which would be provable in bankruptcy as if the debtor had become a bankrupt when the particulars of the agreement are recorded on the National Personal Insolvency Index. The making of a debt agreement will operate to stay legal proceedings for enforcement of debts, other than debts or liabilities arising under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Used in conjunction with the existing pre-bankruptcy moratorium provisions, the Government is confident that small debtors will be able to avail themselves of this new, simple and economical form of administration, thus avoiding bankruptcy, its disabilities and stigmas, while at the same time, arriving at arrangements with creditors likely to result in a better return for them.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to these measures, the Bill proposes a new system for registration of trustees, a more contemporary statement of the duties of trustees, enhancement of investigative powers of trustees, the creation of a new statutory register of bankruptcy information to be styled the National Personal Insolvency Index, and related reform measures which will greatly improve the operation of the bankruptcy system to the advantage of those in the Australian community who come into contact with it.

        In An Agenda For Families, the Prime Minister noted that `families are the basic building blocks of our national life. They provide care like no government or any other agency ever can. They are the most important providers of education, health, welfare and personal development. Families nourish our potential, and nurture our individual and collective aspirations. They shape our character and pass on our values. They create a sense of belonging and continuity. . . . . .

        The Government already provides substantial direct assistance to families with children, particularly low income families.

        A maternity allowance will be introduced from 1 February 1996. The allowance, equal to six times the maximum weekly rate of parenting allowance ($816 at current rates) will be paid for each child born on or after 1 February 1996. It will be paid irrespective of whether the mother is in or outside the paid work force prior to the child's birth. The maternity allowance recognises that the majority of women in the work force are not entitled to paid maternity leave and, at the same time, recognises the extra financial burden placed on all families following the birth of a child. It represents a further significant enhancement of the social wage by this Government.
       </para>

        Maternity allowance will also be paid for new-born adopted children, stillborn children and for children who die soon after birth. All families who meet the family payment residency and income and assets tests will qualify for maternity allowance.

        A single family payment will replace the existing basic family payment and additional family payment from I January 1996. This change recognises the fact that the different rate structures for basic family payment and additional family payment make it difficult for families to work out their entitlements. A further change will mean that family payment will be payable to whichever member of a couple is the primary carer of a family's child or children. This change will remove the existing gender bias.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Family payment will have three rates, depending only on the age of the child. The maximum fortnightly rates, to be indexed on I January 1996, are $88.90 for a child under 13, $115.80 for a child aged 13 to 15 and $55.70 for a student child aged 16 to 18.

        Under the family payment income test, every dollar of income over the free area will reduce entitlement by 50 cents per year. Families whose income would reduce their payment below the minimum will still be paid the minimum rate, provided their income is below the income ceiling. This ceiling, to be indexed annually, is equivalent to the current basic family income test limit of $61,020 plus $3051 for the second and each subsequent child. The minimum rate may also be paid under other special circumstances, such as hardship and temporary absence from Australia.

        In the past, some families have expressed great concern that they have not been able to have their family payment reassessed when they have a change in family circumstances because their incomes have fallen by less than 25%.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill addresses this problem by making family payment more responsive to the needs of families facing a drop in income. From 1 January 1996 any family who has a fall in their income will be able to apply to have their family payment based on an estimate of their income in the current financial year (rather than the previous financial year) regardless of the size of the reduction in income. This will mean that families will be able to receive additional benefits at the time they need them most. They will not have to wait until the next annual assessment to have their family payment increased. This improvement to the responsiveness of the system will benefit over 62,000 families.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the previous rules, families who needed to advise the Department of Social Security of a change in circumstances and whose incomes increased by less than 25% were not obliged to have their family payments reviewed and were allowed to keep the extra payments for the rest of the year as windfall gains. Under the new rules to be implemented from 1 January 1996 families who have a notifiable change in circumstances and whose incomes increase will have their family payment reassessed if their estimated income is 10% higher than their base tax year income and 10% above their income free limit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Families will be able to amend their income estimates whenever and as often as they choose, and will be allowed a 10% margin for error on family payment income estimates.

        As the Prime Minister further noted in An Agenda For Families, "families change in character and shape with the changing times, but their essential roles remain the same.

        Mr President, the Half Way to Equal committee observed that while cases of overt, direct discrimination still continue, it is indirect discrimination which contributes more significantly to the existence of the glass ceiling.

        Mr President, such claims are simply wrong. Unlike the United States, we have not adopted employment quotas in Australia, but have worked with employers to plan for and improve the levels of employment of women, and eliminate rules and practices which may unfairly disadvantage women. The aim is to break down the barriers to appointment and promotion on merit. In both private and public sector affirmative action and EEO programs, the principle of merit is the premise upon which selection, promotion and transfer decisions are, and should be, made.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Submissions to the legal and constitutional affairs committee expressed concern about the absence from the act and indeed Australian law of a general prohibition against discrimination.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For this reason the government proposes to insert a preamble in the Act incorporating a general prohibition on discrimination and an equality before the law provision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The preamble makes a strong statement that it is a basic human right to live free from discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The preamble also proclaims the equality before the law of all individuals, emphasising the fundamental right that all persons, regardless of their sex, marital status or pregnancy or potential pregnancy, will be treated equally by the law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The wording of this paragraph reflects the need to consider the principle of equality in law by looking at the effects of a law in its entire social context. The statement in the preamble that everyone has the right to the `equal protection and equal benefit of the law' is not to suggest that a simplistic approach of always applying the same rules to every group is necessarily the best way to ensure that equality is effectively achieved. The `equality before the law' preambular paragraph is not intended to preclude or undermine acts taken for the purpose of overcoming inequality or disadvantage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some commentators have suggested that Australia should take further steps in this area, enacting equality legislation. I welcome the discussion and debate which is now occurring on that issue in response to the recommendations recently made by the Australian Law Reform Commission.

        Another important protection provided for by this bill relates to pregnant women and women who are discriminated against on the basis that they are seen as likely to become pregnant.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently the Act provides a defence of reasonableness to a person who directly discriminates on the ground of pregnancy. Apart from the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984, no other Australian jurisdiction provides this defence. The current `reasonableness defence' unnecessarily weakens the protection provided against direct discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. For these reasons, this defence will be removed from the legislation, in accordance with the committee's recommendation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        If, however, some work poses an identifiable risk to a pregnant employee, it will remain open to the employer to discuss the situation with the employee and agree on appropriate action, or an employer can apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) for an administrative exemption.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although the likelihood of pregnancy may already fall within the definition of sex discrimination within the Act—as a characteristic imputed to women—the government believes that it is desirable for the situation to be clear and unambiguous.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For this reason we are including potential pregnancy as a ground upon which a complaint may be made under the Act. Importantly, the definition covers situations in which it is perceived or assumed that a woman is likely to become pregnant. In these situations, it is not uncommon for a woman to be denied the opportunity to advance in her career because of a perception that she will be less committed to her job. It is these sorts of assumptions about women which operate to prevent them from achieving their potential.

         Indirect discrimination
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A major reform made by this bill is the change to the indirect discrimination provisions of the act, which have proven complicated and difficult to apply in practice and which have been criticised for being overly technical, legalistic and complex.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Tackling indirect discrimination is essential because barriers to equality are often the result of the application of practices, conditions or requirements which appear to be neutral but which in fact impact adversely on members of a particular group.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Direct discrimination focuses on different treatment where one person is treated less favourably than another on the basis of an attribute such as sex or marital status, for example, where a woman is denied a promotion simply because she is a woman.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Indirect discrimination is considerably more difficult to identify. It occurs when policies and practices which might appear to be fair and neutral are in fact quite discriminatory in their impact, resulting in an outcome which disadvantages persons of a particular group.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For instance, if a job requirement specifies a minimum number of years work experience in a particular field, and the field is one which has until recently been closed to women, then women applicants are up against a barrier which is not necessarily based on merit. The effect of indirect discrimination has been likened to `built in head winds', a description which aptly conveys the difficulties confronting, for example, women facing employment selection criteria which embody inherently more burdensome requirements for women than for men.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Submissions to the Half Way to Equal committee and to the ALRC under its reference `equality before the law' were critical of the existing test, and particularly critical of the requirement that the complainant has to prove that the requirement or condition imposed by the respondent is unreasonable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill sets out a simpler definition of indirect discrimination. It provides that a person discriminates against another person if the discriminator imposes or proposes to impose a condition, requirement or practice that has or is likely to have the effect of disadvantaging the person discriminated against because of, for example, his or her sex. The focus is on broad patterns of behaviour which adversely affect people who are members of a particular group.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also gives respondents a defence of reasonableness against claims of indirect discrimination, providing that a condition, requirement or practice does not constitute discrimination if it is reasonable in the circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill sets out matters which ought to be taken into account in deciding whether a condition, requirement or practice is reasonable. Assessing reasonableness will involve looking at the nature and extent of the disadvantage to the people affected by the requirement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will also involve considering the feasibility of the discriminator overcoming or mitigating the disadvantage, for example, by reviewing whether there were alternative non-discriminatory or less discriminatory means available which would achieve the same purpose. Costs, business efficiency and business needs might be relevant factors for consideration. The disadvantage to those affected by the requirement will be measured against the result sought by the person imposing the condition.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The matters specified for consideration as to whether a condition is reasonable are based on the provisions in the anti-discrimination legislation of the Australian Capital Territory. They are not intended to be an exhaustive list they are intended to provide guidance to the courts and the  parties about the variety and type of factors which will be relevant in any specific situation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, some opponents of this bill object to the fact that after these amendments it will be the respondent who faces the task of showing that a discriminatory condition or practice is reasonable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In fact it is far more appropriate for respondents to be  expected to prove that a condition or practice is reasonable than for complainants to be expected to prove that it is not reasonable, since the relevant information or reasons for imposing the condition will be within the knowledge of the respondent—the person or corporation imposing the condition.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For instance, an employer who imposes a condition may have taken into account matters such as financial considerations affecting the workplace as a whole—matters about which a complainant may have no knowledge. It does not make sense to expect a complainant to second guess the respondent's reasons for the discriminatory practice imposed by the respondent.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, requiring a complainant to show that a condition or practice is not reasonable could have the result that the complainant undertakes a fishing expedition, seeking extensive document production in the hope that an explanation of the reasons for imposition of the condition will be unearthed. Such practices would, of course, add to the length and costs of litigation for both parties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Providing a `reasonableness defence' for respondents is consistent with the approach adopted in recent antidiscrimination legislation in the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland as well as overseas jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Canada. The changes proposed are also consistent with the recommendations made by the ALRC.

         Australian defence force exemption—combat and combat related duties
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also recognises and embodies another important step which has been taken towards eliminating discrimination within our defence forces. The Half Way to Equal committee recommended that section 43 of the Sex Discrimination Act be amended to include a specified time period not exceeding two years to allow the removal of prohibitive and discriminatory provisions from defence force legislative requirements and administrative procedures.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 43 of the Act provides that it is not unlawful for a person to discriminate against a woman on the ground of her sex in connection with employment, engagement, or appointment in the defence force in a position involving performance of combat duties or combat-related duties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The combat-related duties exclusion has not been applied since May 1990 when the chiefs of staff recommended against its continued application and the then Minister for Defence announced a new policy based on this advice.

         Special measures
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An issue raised by both the Half Way to Equal committee and by the ALRC under its reference `equality before the law' is whether the `special measures' provision in the Act as presently worded, is achieving its purpose.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation currently provides that an act which would otherwise be discriminatory for the purposes of the act is not unlawful if a purpose of that act is to ensure equal opportunity. The legislation currently treats special measures as discriminatory, but lawful, an approach which reflects the fact that the legislation is structured on an `equal treatment' model under which any difference in treatment is prima facie discriminatory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment proposed in the bill makes two significant changes. First, it provides that special measures are not treated as a form of discrimination—instead, they would be considered as part of the threshold question of whether there is discrimination at all. Consequently, the `special measures' provision will be moved from that part of the act which provides exemptions. Special measures should be presented and understood as an expression of equality, rather than an exception to it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, the special measures provision currently focuses on attainment of equal opportunities. This focus ignores the historical and structural barriers which impede women's utilisation of formal equal opportunities. The convention for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women refers to measures `aimed at accelerating de facto equality', and our emphasis should be on measures to achieve real or substantive equality.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To attain substantive equality it is necessary to look at the end result of a practice that purports to treat people equally. In this way structural barriers that prevent a disadvantaged group from attaining real equality can be taken into account. A narrow and formalistic interpretation of equality will not produce equality in fact and may entrench existing discrimination or create new discriminatory situations.

         —I thank the Senate for granting leave. It was unfortunate that I was able to speak for only three minutes on this bill on the final Thursday of the last session. It was equally unfortunate to find that on the Friday, the last day of the session, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) chose to issue a press release saying that the coalition and others here—by definition including the Australian Democrats and the Greens—were seeking to hold up the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and had cost small businesses around Australia thousands of dollars and we were the demons to be hated because we had done this dreadful thing to small business.

         There are two reasons why I was offended by that press release. Firstly, I do not believe that the bill ever got to the top of the list of bills that the government wanted dealt with during the last session. It was on the red, as so many things often are, and was expected to be dealt with at some stage. There would not be a senator in this chamber who has not come in here hour after hour, day after day, waiting for one matter or another to get on. I thought it was a bit rich for the Attorney-General to be complaining that one of the bills in his portfolio had not got through when the situation was that he did not have the capacity to convince his colleagues to put it higher in the agenda. Either the Attorney-General has such a low standing with his colleagues or this bill has such a low standing with them that they were not prepared to make the effort required to have the bill dealt with prior to the close of the last session.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It was a cheap shot when it was really the Attorney-General's fault that the matter was not put sufficiently high on the agenda. In the ordinary course of events on that Friday we would have only had about 17 or 18 minutes for debate on the bill. That is not sufficient time to allow the parliament to express its views on such an important bill. This bill has had wide consideration in the community. Representatives of the business community with whom I have had contact have nothing but praise for the process of the simplification task force and the efforts that have been made. By and large they have no complaints with the first draft.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I want to make it perfectly clear that there is no criticism of the simplification task force and the process that it has undertaken; save to say that parliamentary committees might have been included earlier in the discussion. The task force came up with what it thought was the perfect product and expected a quick tick from the parliament, but it might have been smarter for the task force to have included parliamentary committees earlier. The task force and those associated with it might see the situation as parliament holding things up—which I see as parliament doing its job—but the differences could have been thrashed out and the arguments aired before the bill came to the parliament. There are no other criticisms of the process. We are supportive of this first bill. We made that clear at the very beginning. The bill had a thorough airing at the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities.

         A number of proposals were put before that committee. One particular proposal related to the small-large distinction. I will come back to that matter. I wanted to put into context that the Attorney-General's criticism of the bill not passing had nothing to do with us. At that point we were happy with the bill and it would have passed had it been higher on the agenda.

         The second thing that was offensive about the Attorney-General's press release was this: at the time when the Attorney-General issued the press release—and at this day—he and the minister representing him in this chamber are in contempt of the Senate for failing to comply with a return to order. The Attorney-General is meant to have some understanding of the parliamentary system and some respect for it, but he has a cheek issuing a press release blaming other parties for bills not passing and expressing the view that the parliamentary process had been diminished when he, by his cavalier response to a return to order, was diminishing parliamentary process himself. He was seeking to place himself and the minister representing him here above the parliament. For those reasons I believe that the Attorney-General's press release was a cheap shot.

         As is often the case, when you throw the first stone you find it comes to land in your own backyard. That is what has happened to the Attorney-General. In his press release he sought to make himself a champion of small business. What shockers were we for holding this up! Small business was going to be beating our doors down. We were going to be condemned around Australia. I believe he wrote to thousands of representatives of small business to promote himself, no doubt, and putting the view that I have just put to this chamber.

         Since that press release the Attorney-General has been silent on this matter and has not publicly raised the fact that subsequent to the ending of the last parliamentary session he was contacted by the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry representing small businesses. Those associations were putting the view that there was a problem—an unintended consequence—which centred upon the small-large distinction. It was not an argument that we should move to a reporting entity concept; that argument had been thrashed out in the Joint Standing
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">

         What was raised with the Attorney-General was the three criteria by which we establish whether a company is small or large, remembering the consequences that flow in relation to external auditors. As you may know, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you are covered by two of those three requirements you are deemed to be a large company. The associations suspect that it is an inadvertent and unintended consequence of the pitching of the levels of those three criteria and that a significant number of companies previously not thought to be affected by this legislation would be affected and that something should be done.

         The Attorney, who wanted to place himself as the champion of small business, went silent during the debate because small business was on his back telling him that something was wrong and that it needed to be fixed. The sad part of this story is that it has been put to me that the groups that approached the Attorney were led to believe that he was genuinely listening to the concerns they had and led to believe, by inference, that something was going to be done to fix their concerns.

         That is why, at the bottom of the letter they sent to the Attorney, they said that they believed there should be bipartisan support for an amendment to the bill to fix this particular problem. I might add that they are not wanting to detract from the policy behind it or cause a significant delay. Those arguments have been held. They also said in the letter that because they think there should be bipartisan support for an amendment, they are going to send a copy of the submission they sent to the Attorney to us, to the Australian Democrats, to the Greens and to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I am told that they then received a rather heated call from a gentleman in the Attorney's office saying, `What the hell are you go doing that for? You do not have to notify these people. You just deal with us and we will listen to your concerns.' The inference that was created was that they will fix the problem.

         I do not imagine that the Attorney wants to have companies classified as large companies that, in the ordinary course of events, people might agree ought not be. I do not attribute any bad faith to the Attorney about the pitching of the levels, but there has been a suggestion of some bad faith in dealing with these groups, in suggesting that their problem would be listened to and giving the impression that these levels would be looked at. For that reason, they say that they complied with the request or direction—phrase it as you will—not to send their submission to us because they thought in good faith they would deal with the government, only to find very recently that they have been told to go jump, that no change will be made.

         They are not happy with that; they are not happy with that at all. I understand that the Attorney has done two things. In his own second reading speech he made the point—no-one could deny it; no-one seeks to deny it—that the pitching of these levels is somewhat arbitrary. It is necessary to exclude some people that others think should be included. If you are going to include people that others think should be excluded, you are always going to have an argument about it. Wherever you pitch those levels, someone is going to be unhappy. We understand that and he understands that. But he did make the point that the levels are arbitrary. He further made the point that the levels needed to be watched closely, because they are crucial to the impact this regulation has on the business community. The regulation is not designed—it should not be in its intention at all—to somehow drag the corporate community down. It is meant to be more efficient.

         For that reason, the Attorney quite rightly acknowledged that he would look at these levels. That gave these people hope. When they wrote to him during the break and said that there was something wrong with the levels and they were told not to contact us but to deal with the Attorney's department, they thought they had an open ear and something was going to happen. They feel let down.

         The second thing the Attorney has done—or his office, at least—is to indicate that these people might have some hope by virtue of exemptions from the ASC. They are not actually confident about that at all. They do not think that it is that easy to convince the commissioner to exercise that discretion. Circumstances might not be so exceptional. It might be just a plain matter of fact that we have pitched the levels wrong—and there is nothing exceptional about that; that people fall over the level is not in itself exceptional—and the ASC commissioner may not be able to offer the exemption. It is not that they are attributing, in that respect, bad faith to the Attorney or his office. It is just that what is being offered out might not be the appropriate solution. It may not be possible to make that work.

         We now have the person who held himself out to be the champion of small business having the opportunity to, in a sense, display that that is true. If that is true, he will not mind, and the government will agree with, an amendment that we wish to move by way of a second reading amendment—that is, that the matter of the levels of those three criteria in the bill that distinguish small and large companies, and that matter alone, be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for a short Friday hearing. That is the equivalent of what would have happened had this limited aspect of the bill been referred to that committee—a Friday committee. We would like this to happen so that these people get the opportunity to make their case that these levels are too high.

         What we will seek to do is move a second reading amendment, which I will do now, that that is what happens. I notice that the Deputy Clerk is perhaps concerned about that proposal and may want to take some advice on the matter. There may be some other appropriate way to do this. We want to stress that we do not want to unnecessarily hold up the passage of this bill. We are supportive of the simplification process and supportive of the task force, and the arguments about small/large reporting entities have been held. We do not want to rehash those.

But with the sort of people we are dealing with and the protections they might want, some people could make a case to say that not all of those companies that might fall into the large company grouping are the sorts of companies that we would want to fall into that grouping. That is the sort of matter that we want looked at. I thank the Senate again for giving me leave to complete my speech and giving Senator Ellison leave to follow me and complete his. I know that was messy. It was just an accident of timing at the end of the last session.

         —The Senate is debating the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill which deals with share buy-backs, proprietary companies and company registers. I welcome the fact that it has been drafted in plain English and also includes several features which are intended to assist the user of this bill dealing with the Corporations Law.

         In the past, companies have been reluctant to use buy-back provisions because of their complexity. In fact, those provisions in the current law run to some 15,000 words in 89 sections. The bill will reduce this to 2,000 words in 11 sections. Therefore, it is substantially reduced and, I believe, a lot clearer and user friendly. The bill includes safeguards for shareholders and directors in the share buy-back. Directors become personally liable if a buy-back makes a company insolvent. A liquidator may also be able to recover damages from the selling shareholders if a buy-back causes the company to become insolvent.

         In relation to proprietary companies, the bill makes several changes to the existing law. The distinction between exempt proprietary and non-exempt proprietary companies is removed. The practical effect of this change is to eliminate the current requirement on small companies to prepare financial reports for filing with the Australian Securities Commission, data which has been proved to be of very limited value.

         The bill also contains a new distinction between small and large proprietary companies based on a company's gross operating revenue, assets and number of employees. Like Senator Vanstone, I have received some representations from various organisations, in particular the Motor Trades Association, claiming that the levels for the criteria in these areas have been struck in such a way as to disadvantage a particular range and type of company.

         My attention has only just been drawn to these matters and I am not able to say whether we support the claims. However, we do support the idea that we take another look. So often we hurriedly pass legislation in this place only to find that amendments are necessary at a later stage. The Democrats will be supporting the motion to refer this limited aspect of the bill for a quick assessment by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.

         The bill also reduces the minimum number of members and directors of a proprietary company from two to one. Many people may see this as a somewhat revolutionary change. The change, it is said, overcomes the problem with directors who are, in reality, silent directors, who are recruited by the active director to fulfil the current technical requirements of the law, but who have no effective involvement in company management. The Democrats will not be opposing this provision, but I want to raise the concern that if the director is silent there is nevertheless a second person who is responsible for the affairs of the company who may be held liable in the event that creditors or shareholders are disadvantaged by the management of the company.

         The second point I would like to make is that this sits somewhat oddly with the government's concern in the taxation area where single traders incorporate themselves to benefit from the considerably lower company tax rate. It seems to me that this provision will make it easier for people to take that route and thereby avoid tax. It may be advisable for the minister to address that particular point when responding to the issues raised in the second reading debate. It seems to me that this contravenes the concerns in this area that, from time to time, have been expressed by the taxation commissioner.

         The other point worth mentioning is that the number of registers will be reduced. The Corporations Law currently requires companies to keep eight separate registers. They are registers of: members; option holders; debenture holders; directors, principal executive officers and secretaries; directors' shareholdings; substantial shareholders in listed companies; notices of beneficial ownership in listed companies; and share buy-backs. The bill changes that and reduces it to three registers containing information on members, option holders and debenture holders.

         It is claimed by the government that the other information that has been contained in these various other registers can be obtained more readily from the Stock Exchange or from the Securities Commission. That may well be so. I would suggest that there is an implied obligation on the government to provide easy access to this information and to make information available to people in the commercial world—in particular to small businesses who cannot be expected to have at their finger tips all the provisions of the Corporations Law, where that information is available and what they need to do to access it.

         Subject to these comments, the Democrats welcome this bill. It is an important step forward in simplifying the Corporations Law which is notoriously a very complicated area of the law and one that is still difficult to access. We, however, point out that we must ensure that the safeguards are not sacrificed for ease of operation and that the effects of this bill on shareholders and creditors be considered. The Democrats certainly intend to monitor how this bill governs our commercial dealings after its passage through this parliament.

         —The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill represents the first stage of the government's approach to simplifying the laws as they deal with corporations. In particular, this bill seeks to simplify various provisions of the Corporations Law relating to share buy-backs, proprietary companies and company registers. It is useful to look at the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities which had this bill referred to it. A number of issues were raised during the course of the committee's inquiry, one of which being the new definitions of small and large companies. It is to that that I turn my attention in my speech tonight. Proposed section 45A(2) defines a small proprietary company as a small proprietary company:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . if it satisfies at least 2 of the following paragraphs:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (a) the consolidated gross operating revenue for the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is less than $10 million
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (b) the value of the consolidated gross assets at the end of the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is less than $5 million
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (c) the company and the entities it controls (if any) have fewer than 50 employees at the end of the financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The definition of a large company is the reciprocal of that. So you look to see whether the company has in excess of $10 million operating revenue, whether it has gross assets at the end of the financial year of more than $5 million, and whether it controls more than 50 employees at the end of the financial year.

         The differences between a small company and a large company are important. A small company, by virtue of the bill, has a less onerous obligation to provide financial details and accounting records. A large company does have that requirement. There is a provision whereby the ASC can exempt a large company from having to fulfil those obligations. It is an exemption I would submit with respect to the Senate that would only be exercised sparingly and where the public interest was involved. I do not think it is a situation where that exemption would be exercised merely to save a company money.

         Comments have been made by both Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler that, since this matter was last before the Senate on 30 June this year, there has been some community concern about this aspect of the bill. In particular, I refer to a media statement put out by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Motor Trades Association yesterday which expressed concern that there would be companies caught by the definition of a large company and that, as a result, those companies would be facing extra costs of $25,000 to $45,000 a year by way of auditing and legal fees. That was of great concern to those peak bodies. In fact, it was the Motor Trades Association which put it more simply by stating that some car dealers might have to sell 40 to 50 more cars a year in order to meet those extra costs.

         Although those concerns were not squarely before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities when it considered this matter, there were submissions before that committee which did give rise to some of these matters but perhaps not as vividly as the ones I have just referred to. The committee in fact recommended that the bill be passed, but it did state that it was unable to reach an unqualified view on the test which draws a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. It suggested that the Attorney-General could consider two options: firstly, leave the criteria as is of 50 employees only; or, secondly, delete the criteria relating to employees and replace it with a test of only proposed assets and turnover.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . it would be a sensible precaution for small businesses close to the threshold to keep reasonably accurate figures in case they unexpectedly exceeded two of the three criteria and needed to prepare audited statements.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the moment you have to satisfy only two of the three criteria. It may be that a business is operating close to that threshold and could well qualify by the end of the financial year.

         In that article, Mr Penman was reported as saying that this might not result in less bureaucratic red tape for small business.

         —I wish to address the Dr Lawrence saga and the duplicity of the Australian Labor Party in handling this matter. It should be remembered by all Australians that the genesis of the royal commission that is currently being conducted in Western Australia is as a result of Dr Lawrence's own personal activities in seeking to deliver a body blow to the then Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, Mr Richard Court. That of course failed and history will tell us that Mr Court became Premier and Dr Lawrence was defeated. However, the tactic employed by Dr Lawrence has now gone full circle; it has come back to haunt her. I am sure that ultimately her activities in the Easton matter will deliver a body blow to her political career.

         The matter I wish to address is the way that the Australian Labor Party, through the taxpayers, are funding all of Dr Lawrence's legal fees. At the outset let me say that I believe a very sustainable argument can be made out requiring governments establishing royal commissions to fund the legal representation for those whose activities will come under close scrutiny. However, the Dr Lawrence situation arises out of her activities as a state Premier not as the Minister for Human Services and Health in the federal government. Therefore, no Commonwealth funding ought be provided. If any funding ought be provided, it ought be provided through Western Australia.

         The Labor Party argues that the royal commission was only set up because Dr Lawrence is a minister in a federal government. Clearly that is unsustainable. The situation is that the inquiry has been set up because of her activities as the former Premier of Western Australia. Even if we were to accept what the Labor Party are trying to peddle, it is not a case for justifying the funding.

         In my own home state of Tasmania, the Australian Labor Party set up a royal commission to inquire into the activities of a former premier, Robin Gray. One could argue that the only reason he was pursued through a royal commission was that of his status as leader of the Liberal opposition. I note with some interest that the Australian Labor Party on the state basis did not want to fund Mr Gray's legal costs. Also of interest is the fact that the federal Labor Party did not come running with taxpayers' money from the Commonwealth taxpayer willing to fund Mr Gray because somehow he was a target of a royal commission which was as politically engineered as the Labor Party would now have us believe. Indeed, the exact opposite occurred. The then Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, claimed it was an obscenity that the taxpayers of Tasmania were funding people's legal costs who were appearing before the royal commission, apart from the collateral representations that were made to the Supreme Court of Tasmania.

         People such as Senator John Coates got up in this chamber to ask a dorothy dixer of Senator Michael Tate so that Senator Tate could make this obscenity claim. The now Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, made similar claims. The Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Michael Field, his deputy, Peter Patmore, and a whole host of trade unionists and other Australian Labor Party apparatchiks made the comment that it was an absolute obscenity that Mr Gray had his legal fees paid. There has been a strange silence from all of these people when it comes to Dr Lawrence. The reason is that there is even less justification for the funding of Dr Lawrence than there was for Mr Gray's legal costs.

         I believe that there was a very strong argument for the payment of Mr Gray's fees after the royal commission concluded that there was no way that any charge could be proffered or laid against Mr Gray, and indeed no such recommendation was made. After the event the taxpayers of Tasmania, I think quite appropriately, picked up the tab—quite a modest tab compared with what Dr Lawrence is undoubtedly incurring at this very stage.

         Of course, the Labor Party apparatchiks in Tasmania were very violent in their opposition. There were demonstrations. Senator Tate in his comments in the Senate on 23 June 1992 used very colourful language. He said, `In fact, Tasmania is in uproar this morning as it has been revealed that the state cabinet is prepared to pay those who were involved in appearing before the royal commission.' Tasmania was allegedly in uproar. If Tasmania was allegedly in uproar on 23 June 1992, the Australian Labor Party must be aware that all of Australia is in uproar in relation to the way that Dr Lawrence's fees are being paid for, not after the event but beforehand with an open cheque.

         The Australian Labor Party has asserted that the alleged campaign by the Western Australian government is somehow a political witch-hunt. If that were true, and I do not concede that is the fact, surely it is up to the political party—namely the Labor Party—to fund Dr Lawrence from its own resources and not those of the taxpayer. Indeed, the Western Australian Labor Party has a history of having had sufficient resources to fund gambling debts incurred by its members of parliament—to pay them off so that there are not any adverse comments made by the public. If they can find money for that, one would have thought that they might also be able to find money to fund Dr Carmen Lawrence in her ill-fated attempts, first, to scuttle the Marks royal commission and, second, to try to defend herself before the commission.

         The reason I wished to make some comment on this matter tonight is that there has been such gross double standards displayed, especially by the Australian Labor Party in my home state of Tasmania. People like the Leader of the Opposition, Michael Field, his deputy, Peter Patmore, the Secretary to the Tasmania Trades and Labor Council and a host of other people who basically assist the Australian Labor Party in its political operations called demonstrations and tried to get petitions going. Indeed, the Australian Democrats in Tasmania tried to get petitions going about the funding of people before a royal commission. I believe in principle there is nothing wrong with that, given that it is from the same governmental source that commenced the inquiry. If you allow one government to fund defendants or people before royal commissions in other states, I think very dangerous precedents are set.

         —Tonight I wish to continue with some remarks that I began making in the last session in relation to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Last night with great disappointment I learnt that the opposition will not at this time support the reference of several matters in relation to CSL to the Senate Consumer Affairs References Committee. That was why earlier today I sought to defer that matter for a further week. The matters that I wish to refer to are ones which affect the life and health of thousands of Australians who have been treated with products made by CSL.

         I would have thought that the health of thousands of people who have been treated with contaminated products and so contracted diseases—some have died as a result of these treatments—would have been a consideration that outweighed all others. So it was with great disappointment that I learnt that one of the reasons the opposition was concerned about referring these matters to the committee was that it may affect the share price of CSL. I will not at this stage reveal who used that excuse to me, but I will have no compunction if the opposition continues in its obstruction of this important public interest inquiry.

         Let us leave aside for the moment the morality of measuring the lives of Australians against the share price of a private company. The claim is silly for quite logical reasons. There is a great number of people who will be taking action against the CSL. So one way or another the information which needs to be revealed will be revealed. It is not a matter of whether the information will come out; it is simply a matter of the process by which it comes out. Stopping a Senate inquiry will not stop an effect on the CSL share price if the latter is going to be affected by adverse publicity.

         Secondly, both the CSL and the government claim that the indemnities given to the CSL cover the CSL against any claim relating to events before the organisation was privatised. If that is the case, any effect on the share price is easily covered by the government assuring the shareholders that they are not at risk. If, on the other hand, the indemnities are not watertight—and I am quite sure that the revelations which will undoubtedly come out will cause the government to extend those indemnities, and that will cover the CSL for all its misdemeanours before it was privatised—this should convince even the most right-wing hoon, even if the already established facts do not, that the privatisation of CSL has been a disaster.

         From the intense lobbying to which I am being subjected by CSL and by the minister's staff I am convinced that neither is going to make the task of the affected patients easy. Both will put every obstacle in the way of these people and their worried families. This is most shameful behaviour but it seems the opposition is also happy to impose this very heavy additional burden on their fellow suffering Australians.

         Professor Allars was asked to carry out an investigation of CSL with respect to the disease CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CSL and others have tried to claim that this investigation covered all important matters and that there was nothing more to investigate. Nothing could be further from the truth, as I will now show. The Allars report was based on an inquiry whose terms of reference were inadequate to cover all the important matters. Moreover, there were some matters in which the investigation was misled; and this resulted in wrong conclusions. Specifically, the inquiry into CSL's manufacturing and quality control of hormone products was conspicuously lacking in depth.

         The report failed to note serious problems CSL experienced in producing satisfactory products. It is surprising that it did not draw the conclusion that the products were quite unacceptable in terms of modern concepts of therapeutic goods quality. Professor Allars thus did not explore the circumstances that led to this deplorable situation and caused it to persist throughout the period of the use of human pituitary hormones, a period of some 20 years.

         Professor Allars dealt in considerable detail with the government system of attempts at controlling the quality of therapeutic goods by testing of product samples and with the failure of the National Biological Standards Laboratory to test samples of the hormones and pursue the development of standards for them. By contrast, she dismissed in a few words the much more general and effective parallel government system of inspection and licensing of manufacturers on the basis of the code of good manufacturing practice for therapeutic goods.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          No amount of government sample testing can substitute for the failure of manufacturers to build into products the quality of purity, potency, consistency, reliability and safety. The measures which manufacturers must adopt to ensure such high quality products are laid down in the code. CSL distributed hormones which were neither pure, reliably potent, consistent in quality, nor safe.

         Although the code was not introduced until 1971, it was in formation between 1966 and 1970 and it was being developed contemporaneously with the manufacture of human pituitary hormones by CSL. The NBSL was inspecting manufacturers and developing the code alongside other bodies. CSL was a conspicuous non-participant in the development of the code. CSL held itself aloof from the processes of government-industry cooperation and intra-industry discussion which surrounded the development and progressive implementation of the code. CSL made it known that it did not subscribe to the philosophy and many of the detailed provisions of the code; and had no intention of applying it.

         The Allars report does say, quite correctly, that biological products were exempted from the code; but there were two reasons for this. It did not pretend to deal adequately with biological products because there were some special conditions applying to these products, conditions such as having master seed and production cultures for microbiological products, test and production animals, and microbial safety and containment. However, as far as it went, the code was in general completely applicable to biological products and, in particular, part 2 on sterile products was particularly appropriate in the case of sterile biological products.

         It was only in the last year of CSL's manufacture of pituitary products that CSL commenced to systematically implement the code of good manufacturing practice and be inspected by the NBSL. The full adoption of the code has been achieved only very recently. Therefore, the statement in section 3.84 of the report, `CSL products including hPG and hGH were manufactured according to the code of GMP' is simply untrue.

         The code requires that there be a set of complete and comprehensive master manufacturing instructions for every product formally authorised by management and that this be changed and updated only through formal authorisation. It must be strictly adhered to throughout the manufacture of every batch of the product. This is to ensure that before any product goes into production for distribution, or even for clinical trials, the manufacturer has developed and fully documented a process which will ensure that the product is consistent and reliable from batch to batch and, likewise, that the product clinically trialled will be reproduced after production before general distribution is begun.

         It is abundantly clear from the report that CSL failed to develop satisfactory processes for manufacturing the hormone products before they went into production. They were not clinically trialled. For example, sections 3.71 and 7.159 and table 3.3 show that batches made by a variety of methods, including experimental methods, were distributed. The first four fractionation runs were experimental. Sections 3.88, 3.91, 3.93 and 3.97 and appendix 2 show that finished batches were not infrequently unsterile, pyrogenic, contained hepatitis B, could not be assayed for hormone content, contained uncontrolled amounts of extraneous hormones and caused stinging on injection, et cetera. Pyrexia often followed the injection of hormones.

         There were persistent problems with freeze drying of the products, ampoules were sometimes not properly sealed and batches were often highly discoloured.

        (1) No. The definition of a landmine under Article 2 of Protocol II to the 1980 Inhumane Weapons Convention is `any munition placed under, on or near the ground or other surface area and designed to be detonated or exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person or vehicle'.

        Similarly, rifle grenades do not come within the definition of a mine. Such grenades are launched from a rifle. Firing the rifle both launches the grenade and initiates the process of arming it. The grenade automatically detonates seconds later, either on impact with the target or after a set delay period. Like ordinary grenades, rifle grenades are not target actuated, and therefore are not mines or remotely delivered mines.

        In addition, the opinion of the Group of Governmental Experts preparing for the review of the Inhumane Weapons Convention is that the definition of a mine is only intended to cover individual munitions manufactured as mines. Combinations of other forms of munitions with additional components (such as grenade and trip wire) are regarded as a `construct' and hence do not constitute a mine under the definitions contained in Article 2 of Protocol II of the Convention. Lethal `constructs' can be easily made from commonly available components such as batteries, wire, string, garden fertiliser and sugar. It is intended that `constructs' be dealt with in other articles to Protocol II of the Convention.

        (5) (a) and (b) It is unfortunately by no means certain that there will be international consensus at the Review Conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention, to be held in September and October, on the Australian Government's proposal to ban those landmines which are not detectable and which do not self-destruct and passively deactivate.

        The Review Conference will conclude in mid October. At that time, the Government will review all items manufactured, sold, used or stockpiled in Australia which fall within the definitions contained in the revised Convention. Decisions on changes to export controls, and possible replacement of items used by the Australian Defence Force, will be made at that time.

        I cannot speculate as to what form the revised Convention will take or, what decisions we will make. However, I can confirm that Australia will remain a party to the Convention, and will comply with its rules, and I can guarantee that the position I stated in February 1994 will continue in force: Australia will not export mines to countries not party to the Convention. However, because there are so many different civil and military items which could be used in landmines, this does not apply to components or possible components of mines.

As noted there, the matters in dispute were not resolved during the Court proceedings or, in most cases, in the Settlement Deed.

        (3) The monies paid by way of settlement were $9.5 million. This sum was obtained by a call on all Institutes and Divisions in CSIRO based on a formula, in which the major Institute involved paid the larger proportion of these funds. Ministerial authorisation was given in September 1993 under Section 50 of the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 for CSIRO to enter into the Deed of Settlement and Release and pay the settlement sum in accordance with the conditions of that Deed.

Jones seeking his approval for the Cassegrain Group and CSIRO to enter into a joint venture without prior public advertisement in March 1988. The Minister cleared this proposal on 29 March 1988. The estimated initial contribution by each party was $1.5 million. The approval associated with this minute provided the rationale for entry into the Memorandum of Commercial Intent which was signed by the parties in June 1989.

Taxpayers were not asked to provide an "extra" $9.5 million. The basis for this payment rests on the concept that the Commonwealth of Australia is responsible for liabilities incurred by statutory authorities such as CSIRO.

        (1) No. The National Food Authority is currently considering a proposal to vary the Food Standards Code to regulate foods produced using gene technology. Section 10b of the National Food Authority Act 1991 requires the Authority, when considering food standards, to have regard to the provision of adequate information to enable consumers to make informed choices about food and to prevent fraud and deception. Before developing a draft standard the Authority will give due regard to the full range of sources, including labelling, from which consumers may obtain information about the use of gene technology in food production.

        The NHMRC has been involved in setting standards for the use of animals in research for the last 25 years. It acknowledges the importance of animal-based research to find better ways of preventing, treating and curing human disease, and takes the view that this places a special responsibility on investigators to use animals humanely and to treat them with respect. In 1969 the NHMRC issued the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, in conjunction with the CSIRO. Since then the Code has been reviewed regularly in conjunction with the CSIRO and the then Australian Agricultural Council, to take into account changes in biological science and in community attitudes. In 1985 the NHMRC established the Animal Welfare Committee (AWC) to advise the NHMRC on all matters relating to the conduct and ethics of animal experimentation in medical research. The AWC together with other code sponsors and State/Territory animal welfare representatives is responsible for the regular revision of the Australian Code of practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.

Payment of DSS income support to those aged 15 and over is not related to the outcome of an assessment by the State or Territory but depends upon the young person meeting standard eligibility criteria.

Staff have also been advised that, if it appears that the State/Territory department may not be meeting its obligations to provide support during this period, the matter should be taken up at a senior level with the State/Territory department.

Department of Social Security staff have been advised that claims for income support must be determined within a reasonable period and of steps to take to ensure that this occurs. The Department has also written to State/Territory Departments explaining the need for assessments to be completed within agreed time frames.

Where such action is unsuccessful, the claim for income support is determined without waiting for an assessment to be completed.

        (2) The Bank is self critical and acknowledges that due regard has not always been given to environmental sustainability, and that assessment of the environmental impact of projects has in some cases been inadequate. However, since 1987 the Bank has made substantial and far-reaching progress in integrating environmental concerns into the mainstream of its operations. The Bank now requires borrowing countries to prepare detailed Environmental Assessments for projects with significant environmental impacts; encourages and assists borrowers to prepare National Environmental Action Plans (NEAPs); and supports the development of regional environmental strategies and action plans. The Bank has also expanded its support for the international conventions on climate change, biodiversity, ozone depletion and desertification and is a key implementing agency of the Global Environment Facility and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol. The portfolio of active environmental projects financed by the World Bank now stands at over $US10 billion.

        (8) (a) There appears to be no standard criteria to judge whether grantee bodies such as AESOP spend an appropriate ratio of funds on program and administrative expenses. The bottom line for assessing cost-effectiveness would appear to be the cost per placement and the ratio of employees to placements. Based on figures provided by AESOP, obtained at a recent international meeting in Paris of similar agencies, the unit cost for per placement for AESOP is USD4,128, for the British agency USD4,242, the Germans USD6,495 and the Canadians USD9,458. AESOP has 19.8 placements for every employee, the British 17, the Canadians 13 and the Germans 9. AusAID is not presently in a position to validate these figures, but its Volunteer Programs Effectiveness Review will attempt to provide an objective basis to compare agency performance.

The guidelines are: projects must aim to strengthen the effectiveness of indigenous businesses and organisations, projects must contain a strong training element, assistance will not be provided where professional consultants should be engaged on a commercial basis, priority is given to projects which will benefit the greatest number of individuals in the recipient country, where possible and appropriate projects should endeavour to advance mutually beneficial business and commercial links between Australia and developing countries, and projects from all recipient countries receive equal priority.

Of these, 26 have been implemented, three are on hold, a volunteer is being sought for another and one has been withdrawn. Ramu Sugar is a Papua New Guinea company whose principal shareholders are the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (59.3%) and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, a non-profit investment Organisation originally financed by the Government of the United Kingdom as a vehicle for development (I8.4%). In the early years of the company's existence, disease and crop failure meant that loans had to be rescheduled, and resources diverted from training. AESOP was approached to assist in providing training where commercial consultants could not be used. A large labour force has meant that many Papua New Guineans have benefited from the training provided by AESOP. Mutually beneficial trade and commercial links have been advanced as a result of AESOP projects, for example, European harvesting equipment has been replaced by Australian.

        Regarding the many references in the question to the US Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), it is important to note that in May 1993 the US Secretary of Defense announced that the Strategic Defense Initiative Organisation had been renamed the Ballistic Missile Defense Organisation (BMDO). In addition, the Strategic Defense Initiative was renamed the Ballistic Missile Defense Program. This change was made to reflect the basic shift in the ballistic missile defence program in the United States away from defences against a massive strategic nuclear missile attack on the US by the former Soviet Union and toward the threat posed by shorter range, or theatre ballistic missiles, including missiles of the kind used by Iraq in the Gulf War.

        The letters acknowledge that cooperation between DSTO and BMDO will be aimed at the common objectives of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and affording protection from missile attack. Exploratory discussions to identify cooperative projects that would meet these objectives were foreshadowed in the March 1994 Australia-United States Ministerial Talks (AUSMIN) communique. The subsequent exchange of letters is the outcome referred to in the communique issued after AUSMIN in April 1995, which noted that an initial program of cooperative activities was expected to begin this year.

It remains the case, as Mr Kerin also said in his media release of 2 June 1988, that `The Australian obligated nuclear material which passes through the facility at Tricastin, however, remains confined to exclusively peaceful non-explosive use, that is there is a quantity of low-enriched uranium and depleted tails, equivalent to the Australian obligated nuclear material and which may only be used for peaceful, non-explosive purposes.'  Accordingly, current sales of Australian uranium to France, which constitute less than 3% of EDF's requirements, neither contravene Government policy nor contribute in any way to French military activities; and (c) No. Any ban on the small volume of existing Australian supplies would only benefit France as EDF could readily substitute these supplies with much cheaper uranium from other suppliers, including some whose safeguards arrangements
