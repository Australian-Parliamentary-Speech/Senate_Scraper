        —by leave—This is totally over the top, if I might suggest. Today the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has come in and said that he is going to be away for the next fortnight, bar one day. Forget the parliament, forget the responsibilities of the government and ministers to this parliament because he has better things to do. He wants to go to Colombia to a meeting of the non-aligned movement. You might ask these days what is the significance of the non-aligned movement internationally. But the practice of the government always was, Senator Ray, that it sent the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to meetings of the non-aligned movement. Why does the foreign minister have to go to Colombia as a priority ahead of his responsibilities to this parliament?

        —This is not just a repeat of past speeches. A tired government ought to recognise its responsibility to the Australian parliament. This minister puts his other activities ahead of that responsibility and for that I think he should be condemned. Apart from his role as Leader of the Government in this place, there are a number of important issues on foreign policy before us at the moment. There is the issue of the East Timorese that he has brought into the public debate. That is a matter that is going to be pursued within this parliament during the course of this week. And where is he going to be? He is going to be on the plane to Colombia! In the view of the coalition this is unsatisfactory and he should meet his first responsibility and that is his responsibility to the Australian parliament.

I believe that you should be here.

I do not think anyone has had any criticism in the past of the extent to which I have torn myself apart in trying to get back from overseas trips in time to be here at session times.

        The particular reason why I am going back overseas again is simply the extraordinary significance this year of these particular meetings given Australia's candidacy for the United Nations Security Council—point one; and, point two, the necessity for us to make the maximum possible effort to extract the maximum possible support for the nuclear testing resolution now before the United Nations. When I was in New York the week before last, in a period of 6 1/2 days I spoke to over 70 foreign ministerial colleagues. There are 185 members of the United Nations, so there are still quite a few more to go. My colleagues are intensely concentrated on occasions like the non-aligned movement. It is true that for a number of years I have not been to a non-aligned summit and would not have been doing so this year had it not been for the combination of issues that we are presently pursuing.

If I make any kind of an effort to be there for the 50th anniversary session, there is no point in trying to come home before the end of the week because I could not be here before Friday morning, accordingly, I am also staying in New York, as I indicated, to attend the meeting of the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict which takes place on Thursday and Friday next week. I am sorry but I am also going to the University of Louisville to accept the prize of $US150,000—$A200,000—which has been given to me and which I am about to fork out for scholarships and things of that kind on the subject of ideas for improving world order.

If Senator Alston or Senator Hill think that they can make any difference, or that Alexander Downer—God help us, that galumphing fathead—can make any difference to the way in which we are regarded internationally, they should be sent there too, to assist in this national effort that we are embarked upon at the moment. I frankly do not think that there is anyone who can do quite the sort of job that I can do, simply because of my knowledge of the people concerned and the personal relationships that I have built up over this particular period.

        That is the truth of the matter. It depends a lot on who you know and the circumstances in which you can relate to people by virtue of long association with them. There are many, many people who need to be spoken to concerning these important objectives and I think it is extremely churlish that the opposition and the Democrats should have taken the view that they have on this occasion. It just reinforces me in my view of this place, Mr President.

        —by leave—I think Senator Gareth Evans's last comment said it all. Ever since he made that fatal mistake and decided to go and have a run in Holt, and then found when he was out of the country that Senator Robert Ray actually moved in and insisted that the vote for the deputy prime ministership be brought on in his absence, he has known he is going nowhere in this country, and that is why he wants to get out. Even when Senator Button was leader, and he was pretty much asleep on his feet for the last couple of years, he was always prepared to be here. And you were too; you used to take this place seriously.

        If there is one thing you can say about Senator Gareth Evans it is that he has always had an infatuation with the United Nations. He has always thought it was tremendously important. Presumably he still has the same view. But that did not stop him from attending to his duties for some years. It just happens that, all of a sudden, everything is so important over there; nothing is important here any more. We know that the Prime Minister is going feral because he thinks there is something important happening here but, when you have someone who is so disengaged from domestic politics that he can regard tripping around the world as the best way in which he can make a contribution, it really tells you what his priorities are. In other words, he has given up here; he is not interested in domestic politics any more—he is making a run overseas.

        If he has a department to support him, presumably they can do all of the work, they can make the representations. We have ambassadors around the world; we have a permanent representative to the United Nations. All these things can be done by others, otherwise, why would we ever have a foreign minister attending the parliament? He would always be doing those fundamentally important things that are so interesting to him offshore. But no; the fact is, when you look at his track record, he has had less and less interest in this place ever since he lost out. What he is basically doing—as Senator Cook did before the last election, in that case in relation to the ILO—is putting in his job application. He is going around watering it, seeing if he can drum up a bit of support.

My question concerns the rise to 8.5 per cent of unemployed in this country after 14 years of Labor government, and also reports today of Access Economics that the unemployment rate is expected to top nine per cent next year—in other words, rising again. Minister, is this not predictable, given that economic growth has now fallen below the figure which your government said was necessary to sustain ongoing falls in the unemployment rate? How do you justify this policy failure which is contributing to the development of an underclass of Australians left without hope of a better tomorrow, or is it just, as Mr Keating said on Saturday, that Labor governments are good for the wealthy?

         —Mr President, there are several erroneous assumptions that Senator Hill has supported in framing his questions before he got to his questions. Let me correct a couple of them before I go to the actual questions he has put. The first one is about an assumption he made regarding Access Economics. Access Economics is one forecasting organisation in the private sector. It is one of many forecasting organisations in the private sector. On this occasion its forecasts do not agree with the official forecasts of Treasury, nor do they agree with the forecasts of several other forecasting agencies in the private sector.

          BRW
         </emphasis>
         about six weeks ago, said that Australia looks forward to six years of continuous, sustainable economic growth. That is not what Access Economics has said. If you compare the track record of Access Economics to the actual outcomes on their forecasts, you will see that they have been wildly off the point as well. So that is one of the pillars on which you have based this question, Senator Hill. You ought to go back and re-examine the performance and the facts, because it is not a reliable pillar. I throw in as well the comment that it was Access Economics that worked with the Liberal Party to bring down the GST in Australia and the Fightback package. That proved a dismal failure. I would not rely on it if I were you, Senator Hill.

         The second point is in terms of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. In March 1983, when Labor came to power, there were more than 158,000 young people looking for full-time work. Now the number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest since April 1990. In September, it fell by 2,000 to 88,500. In other words, at the moment there are 88,500 teenagers looking for work. When we came to power in 1983, there were 158,000 teenagers looking for work. That is nearly 80 per cent more under you, when John Howard was the Treasurer of Australia, than under us at the present time. So don't you come in here lecturing us about economic performance.

         The third point I make is that we have an accord in Australia with the trade union movement. We have been able to reduce taxes, lift the level of the social wage and provide an economic safety net for those who are in positions where they cannot defend themselves, are out of work or are in some other circumstance. You have never done that; we have done that. That is part of what protects Australia and prevents the formation of an underclass. Your whole policy, your list of things that you will not do—provided by Mr Howard to ACOSS—do not stack up with the things that you will do when you talk to other audiences. Would the real Mr Howard please stand up? You can lie to one group and lie to another group, but sooner or later the lies catch up with you.

         The level of unemployment is still uncomfortably high, and we sympathise with those in the situation of being unemployed. The question here is: which party or which government will fix it? The policies that we have will deliver about a five per cent level of unemployment within the grasp of the Australian economy by the year 2000. You do not have any policies. You have no policies whatsoever, and when asked to reveal them, you will not. Your credibility is shot to pieces, and on your record you have no legs to stand on at all.

         —Mr President, the minister either does not understand the facts or deliberately misleads. I ask him: doesn't he realise that the record of his accord, this accord we hear of so often, has actually been to reduce average weekly earnings in Australia and to produce 763,000 Australians still out of work? After nearly 14 years of Labor government, 763,000 Australians are out of work. Twenty-seven per cent of young people are seeking work, are out of work, and the figures are rising again. That is why my question was: what hope do you give for three-quarters of a million Australians who are out of work when your projected level of growth is going to be insufficient to reduce unemployment? Surely it must logically follow that there is no hope for these people. This legacy of unemployment of the new underclass that you have created will only continue if you maintain the same policy parameters that you have to date.

There has been considerable speculation in this country about the attitudes that Japan and Korea are taking in terms of working for an exclusion of agriculture from an APEC trade liberalisation program. Is this a response to the rural gerrymander within Japanese politics and the need for Liberal Democratic politicians to maintain the support of rice growers?

         The process we are undertaking is a cumulative and a progressive one. There are not going to be any quick fixes, but we are making substantial progress. It is very important for the Australian people to realise, as Australian farmers and their organisations and the food industry and their representatives understand, that Australia currently faces a real labrynth of trade distorting quotas and subsidies as well as very high tariffs in the agricultural sectors of a number of APEC members. Each step we can take in rolling back these barriers through APEC will mean improved export returns for Australian producers and the Australian food industry and increased employment opportunities for workers in that industry.

         As a result of the discussions which I have had in the last week it is my view that it is now almost certain that Australian agricultural and food exporters will secure some degree of new market opening as a result of the APEC free trade process. What is currently under way is the process of maximising these opportunities within the time frame set down by leaders at Bogor. You would expect—and I did put this to the ministers and others I met with in Japan and Korea, but particularly in the case of Senator Carr's question in Japan—Australia's case for comprehensiveness to be unqualified, undiluted. We put that position fairly clearly and forthrightly, publicly and privately.

         I believe that Japan recognises it has benefited greatly from an open international trading system and that this would hold true for liberalisation within APEC—that APEC is as much in Japan's interest as it is in Australia's. The leadership there are intelligent enough to understand that at least as well as we do and to want to have the opportunity of those benefits. Therefore, I expect that Japan will provide the necessary leadership in the remaining weeks leading up to the Osaka meeting. While a resolution of the comprehensiveness issue may need to be found by the leaders at their meeting in Osaka I think possibly even before that there are real prospects to bridge the gap between APEC members on comprehensiveness in a way which will not compromise the interests of Australian farmers. The government will, I can assure you, be keeping in close contact with Australian food and agricultural industries as well as other interested groups during the countdown to Osaka.

         With regard to the question that Senator Carr raised about the implications of the electoral gerrymander that has traditionally existed in Japanese politics and the capacity of it to distort priorities, the electoral system has been substantially changed and this will start to come into effect from the next election. But there is no doubt that over the last 40 years there has been a massive over-representation of agricultural interests in the parliament as a result of the electoral boundaries and the electoral system. This has reinforced other factors within the Japanese economy and the Japanese society, which has inhibited the process of agricultural reform and their preparedness to open up their markets, even though it is clearly in the interests of Japanese consumers.

         The Australian government has tended to put it fairly plainly to the public in Japan and to the politicians. It is our view that it is the obligation of government to try to deliver cheap, good quality food to citizens.

What the Prime Minister said about housing affordability is right. The main reason why there have been changes in housing affordability in the period of our government is that consumers have become more confident about the type of house they want and they now choose a house which is 19 per cent bigger in capacity and size than the house that they would have chosen under you. I can give you the figures in squares. The house that they now buy is 198 square metres, whereas the house that they bought in 1983 was 167 square metres. So, of course, the price is higher because it is a bigger house.

         The second part of the answer is that people do take out bigger home loans now because the market is much more flexible. Let me go to a couple of comparisons which demonstrate the point of flattering us and condemning you. Interest rates today in a growth economy are lower than they were in a recessed economy under John Howard. Anyone who knows anything about interest rates knows that in recession they fall and in growth they rise, but with a growth economy, they are now lower than they were in the recession period of John Howard.

         For example, interest rates from the Howard era applied now to the Australian house would mean a 30 per cent higher cost to Australian home buyers than currently is the case. In the Howard era banks rationed and regulated home loans and their interest rate was 12.5 per cent—but with a cocktail in order to fund part of it. This meant that the real cost was more like what the building societies were charging in the Howard era—13.9 per cent, which reflected real interest rates.

         Under us, they are much lower than that and you do not have all the cocktails. You have, in fact, true competition for housing loans. So you will now find that people can borrow not only from banks but also from new home loan agencies like Aussie Home Loans, the AMP Blue Line and a number of other sources as well. The cost of the loan in terms of the price you pay for borrowing money is now much lower than it was when you were in power.

         As I have said, there is now a more innovative home loan products market. Fixed rates can be negotiated for up to five years. Those fixed rates are at amounts much lower, in many cases, than the variable home loan rate. If you shop around,

          </emphasis>

         So we have a much more contestable loans market. This means that the price of money to buy the house is cheaper and that people buy and build bigger houses. The flexibility in a financial market has meant that they sometimes buy a car, put in a swimming pool, buy furniture or go on an overseas trip out of their home loan and do not have to finance that out of other loans from other sources at higher rates. All up, the cost of servicing a home loan, including the real value of the house, is larger today. However, Australian consumers buy  bigger houses because they have greater confidence in the economy and in the future.

         Effective action on coastal issues does rely on a very strong degree of cooperation. Coastcare is a key element in the coastal action program. It is a very good illustration of the cooperation and commitment that is needed for a practical coastal program. Coastcare will fund direct hands-on community action on coastal problems around Australia. Coastcare will allow community groups to work cooperatively with local government to do things such as protect or rehabilitate sensitive areas like dunes, estuaries and wetlands; monitor coastal environments and control weeds and pests; or develop coastal management plans to set our future management directions.

         For a start, there is no relationship whatsoever between the question of what country currently exercises sovereignty over Indonesia and who may be nationals of that country pursuant to dual nationality principles and whether or not someone who is a national or a citizen of Indonesia might not also be a national of Portugal by virtue of Portugal's prior sovereignty over that country. That is the only matter in issue: whether or not some, at least, of the nearly 1,400 East Timorese in Australia presently seeking asylum are to be regarded as Portuguese nationals by virtue of having been born in that country during the period when Portugal had sovereignty over it, and whether or not that nationality is enjoyed alongside the nationality which they unquestionably have, we would recognise, as Indonesian.

         I might just add in parentheses at this point that the advice that was given earlier this year to the RRT from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that the people in question were Indonesian nationals was in response to a specific question that had arisen as to whether or not, by virtue of an argument that the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia was illegal, East Timorese were to be regarded as Portuguese and not as Indonesians at all. It was in response to that particular query that came forward that specific advice was given earlier this year that the people were to be regarded as Indonesian citizens, and that status was not affected in the way that had been claimed.

         Whatever might be the point about that, the relevant question that has to be addressed is whether there is a dual nationality status available to these particular people and what follows from that. The important point to appreciate is that if someone does have dual nationality status as Portuguese as well as Indonesian, which seems likely to be the case for quite a number of these people, the responsibility of the person in question if they are unhappy with the situation in the first country—in this instance Indonesia—is to avail himself or herself of his or her other nationality.

         That is what the refugee convention requires—someone who is unhappy with nationality A, argues that they are being persecuted and should enjoy refugee status, has a responsibility to avail themselves of their other nationality before seeking refugee status in any third country. Moreover, from Australia's point of view, as such a third country where that status is now being sought, we not only have no obligation to deal with those cases or to offer protection when Portuguese protection is available, but we also have a positive lack of capacity to do anything about it.

         It is a matter of the proper interpretation of the refugee convention and the relevant international law. If someone is able to avail themselves of another nationality which they possess by virtue of international law and, in particular, the law of that other country, then they cannot avail themselves of the refugee process in Australia. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.

         Therein lies the problem for those people who can avail themselves. Whether they can avail themselves is a mixed question of law and fact. That is what has to be resolved by the tribunal. What we have said is that those people who are not Portuguese nationals or who cannot for whatever other reason avail themselves of that nationality can then of course go before the refugee tribunal, and will do so, and have their cases assessed. We have also said that, whatever may be the situation about their Portuguese nationality or their capacity to go before the refugee tribunal, there are other discretionary avenues available for their admission to Australia anyway under humanitarian discretion. Any which way you look at it, we will do the right thing.

         I did say that this is a bizarre complaint. It is for two reasons. Firstly, this assistance is being provided to farmers who are in desperate need. The suggestion that they should forgo this help as a tax minimisation ploy would be laughable if the implications were not so serious and if the person making the suggestions was not such a senior member of the coalition's frontbench in terms of primary industry. Secondly, Mr Scott fails to mention that the only way that anyone who has received this assistance will have to pay income tax is if they have also received significant income from other sources.

         The RAS interest rate subsidy is fully offset for tax purposes against interest rate expenses and the drought relief payment attracts a tax rebate. The government also ensures that farmers who may have a tax liability can arrange to have tax instalments taken out of the DRP before they receive it. The Australian Tax Office helps farmers work out their potential tax liability if they need that assistance. If some farmers' income is so high that they are paying income tax, this is good news and indicates that they are recovering from drought and that their income stream has recommenced.

         Mr Scott also complains that some farmers' Austudy entitlements have been reduced because their income has increased. Farm families receiving the DRP are excluded from the Austudy assets and income test for the time they are on drought relief payments—that is, for the period of the drought—and for a further six months after the drought revocation is officially lifted. This is a more generous arrangement than applies to other sections of the community.

         In summary, the government has provided millions of dollars of assistance to now between 10,000 and 11,000 farm families that were desperate for cash to support the family and assistance to meet interest repayments. Mr Scott's comments reflect the complete lack of understanding that the federal opposition has of severe drought, its impact on farmers and their families, and how best government can help rural Australia.

         Do I think the salaries are high? Yes, I do, but I do understand that the salaries reflect the payment of salaries in a very highly paid sector of the economy—the Australian merchant banking sector. The salaries in that sector are universally high, and I think all are excessively high. The AIDC called on a private sector consultant to advise them as to what the appropriate going rate was. It received that report and, as a consequence of that report, fixed the salary.

         The salary is made up of a base salary with bonuses upon performance—and the bonuses are varied according to how the performance of the enterprise has gone—and, in the most recent period, a payment for retention allowance to senior executives. It is the retention allowance that pushes the salaries to a high level. The retention allowance was negotiated by the board of the AIDC upon receipt of two private sector consultants' reports as to the appropriate level of retention allowance for this industry, and as a consequence they set them when the two government members of the board were not present and the government had no knowledge of the level being set.

As a consequence of the government's decision in the 1994-95 budget to sell down its 80 per cent shareholding in full, it was believed by us and by the board that, in order to retain the most senior executive staff, retention payments were necessary. We agreed to that but we did not agree to the amount. The amount was negotiated privately and only informed to me the other week when it was reported in the report of the company to the Australian Stock Exchange.

         The merchant banking sector is not the same as the retail banking sector. The comparison between the AIDC and the Commonwealth Bank therefore does not hold. Salaries in the merchant banking sector are excessive by any measure.

I think the criticism, particularly last week of my colleague Senator Evans for interfering, is something based on no fact at all and has been totally unfair.

         I just go to the second part of your question: what do we do with these people and do they qualify under the special assistance category? Raising that question, I think, is also important because not only has the government been prepared to treat people and assess them on a case by case, individual basis but it has also introduced a special humanitarian category to handle people from East Timor, whether they come through Macau or Portugal. In fact, it was only less than 12 months ago that I extended the operation of that humanitarian category and, as a consequence, increased the number of people entitled to come to Australia under it. I must admit that at that time I got criticised for so doing by the opposition; let me just place that on the record.

         That special assistance category operates with time lines. The time lines are there to ensure that we do not, for instance, use it as a backdoor migration program and that we do use it effectively as a special humanitarian program. My understanding is that the time lines will probably prevent people going into Portugal from accessing that, because I think their nominators have to be in Australia for a certain period and so on. But, Senator, I will take on board your question in respect of those time lines and see to what extent these people may be covered or not covered by it.

         But I do stress that final point: we have not interfered; we will not interfere; and international laws will be applied. Not only will they be applied because we feel it is a good thing; they will be applied because section 36 of the Migration Act passed by this Senate ensures that the Refugee Review Tribunal has no capacity but to apply that law.

Why is Mr Loosley a better qualified candidate for this position than the five ambassadors to those countries and the presumably vast numbers of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff with specialised expertise in this area?

         Senator Spindler's second question concerned whether or not the FIRB and the Treasurer approved of this matter. My advice is that both the FIRB and the Treasurer approved of it and that the investment was, in that sense, in order. Senator Spindler and I both know that we debate the question of foreign ownership regularly in this chamber. The Australian government has a view that foreign investment in Australia helps to grow the Australian economy and creates more jobs for other people. That is a process of economic management that Senator Spindler apparently disavows. Let us have that continuing argument as to who will be right and who will be wrong. In essence, the answer is yes, we did approve it at the FIRB level, the Treasurer approved it, and it is a significant investment in Australia.

         —Senator Evans, of course, did nothing of the kind. My attitude to these particular questions can only be based on the experience of the United Nations involving itself at a military level. Those experiences have been mixed so far. There have been both successes and failures. Where there have been failures or weaknesses, various defence ministers and foreign ministers around the globe have looked at how best to address those. In broad principle, of course, we have said that, in terms of our own involvement, one must be absolutely certain that the mission is properly defined. One must make sure, especially if it is peace enforcement or peacekeeping, that there is a political solution in prospect. Thirdly, there should be at least a finite period for which forces are committed.

         Having made those views very clear, there have still been weaknesses exhibited in a variety of UN operations as to command and control and the way the UN can react with sufficient speed. The current difficulty is, if an emergency breaks out around the globe, a whole range of countries are approached to see whether they are able to respond. Not always can every country respond in the way the UN would like them to respond, Senator Newman. Therefore, some thought has been given to a consideration of whether the UN could possibly have its own forces; whether it could have designated forces available to them at their direction in a country; or whether there could be stand-by forces. If you like, they are the three broad alternatives.

         The first alternative is a very difficult one, in my view. It is very difficult because the United Nations for a start does not have an intelligence organisation on which most military commitments would have to rely and judgments be made. On the second issue, I think there would be very few countries around the globe that would give up their sovereignty on issues that would have their own forces being able to be committed by an international body. So the area Senator Gareth Evans—and, to a lesser extent myself—and the Prime Minister have been working on is to give some support to the concept of stand-by forces where each country identifies what assets it thinks it can make available.

         I think if you go back and read Senator Evans's view, you will see that he also did not endorse that.

If there is, it is only at the edges, and that is what government is about—a conflict of ideas and views in which we eventually develop a government policy, and then all sides accept that as the final policy.

         But I also say this: Senator Gareth Evans will find, when he visits the UN next week, that the amount of resources the UN is currently devoting to its military operations is insufficient to be successful. It is one of the reasons why Australia and some other forward-thinking countries have made competent officers available and seconded them to New York, to try to make up that deficit. But it still exists. There are four intelligence officers to cover the whole globe, and they are amateurs at that. They have to rely on other countries to provide intelligence, all of which is filtered and, currently, independently assessed.

No organisational arrangements will substitute for clear-eyed decision-making by the Security Council on the responses and mandates that are appropriate to particular situations, but the implementation of changes of this kind should make us much better equipped as an international community to deal in the future with situations like that in Rwanda, where last time our response was so tragically inadequate.

That might be a workable concept in the longer term, but right now the immediate need is to improve the UN's managerial capabilities, strategic and operational planning capability, logistics capability and all the rest of it at the centre in order to make possible more effective and rapid reaction in the future.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tambling this day, relating to housing affordability.
        </tab>

       <para>
        This is an important issue and, as I said at the time of the supplementary question, Senator Cook was obviously either avoiding the issue or not coming to grips with the reality of Labor's failing economic policies, particularly as they impact on young Australians seeking to secure—whether that is to buy or to rent—a home for the first time in Australia. Very obviously, the housing affordability indices of various bodies—whether it was the Real Estate Institute, which I cited, the Commonwealth Bank or the Housing Industry Association—all make it very clear that we do have a problem of major proportions for many and, in fact, just about all young people in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fact that the Real Estate Institute index shows that housing affordability is now 36 per cent lower than in March 1983 really shows the Labor government's hand on this issue. I was appalled at the response by Senator Cook, who showed absolutely no sympathy for and no identification with young people in Australia. He waffled on about the increase in the size and standard of an average house today. He waffled on about increased areas of contribution. He talked about the costs and wages rising, but he did not put them in proportion to the cost of a house today compared with the increases in an average family's wage or salary or with the costs that they experience. It is that widening gap that is the major issue and threat.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I said in the original question, this matter was raised by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on 5 October, when he said, `The housing affordability index is very good now.' That is a fine quote. It is an easy throwaway line on a radio station, but it really does have no connection whatsoever to the problems or to the identification. I hope people were listening at the time of that radio broadcast, which I think was in Melbourne with Peter Couchman.

         Anyone seeking to purchase a house or rent a house would know that what the Prime Minister said on that occasion was nothing short of absolute hypocrisy. Here we have a Prime Minister who throws taxpayers' dollars around building carports at the Lodge that are more expensive than an average family home in Australia. We all know that Mr Keating has purchased a magnificent mansion for his own retirement in Woollahra at a cost of some $2 million. Senator Cook stands up and talks about the square metres of a house being increased marginally. There is no comparison with what Mr Keating is currently doing. If he is spending $2 million of his personal money—he has probably borrowed the whole lot of it under some fancy arrangement or deal—how does that compare to the position of a struggling family in the outer suburbs of Sydney or, in my case, in Darwin in the Northern Territory? How does the Prime Minister's reality compare? He says housing affordability is very good now. It is very good now for Mr Keating but it is not very good now for the average family seeking to secure a home, particularly those seeking to secure a home for the first time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are many other issues related to housing affordability. The housing industry is in crisis. We have certainly seen a slump, not only in confidence but also in the whole construction industry. That impacts back to every family in Australia. Anyone who knows a young person seeking to be employed as an apprentice or a tradesman knows that it is just so much harder now to get work in industry because it is just not there. The economy is failing.

         So whilst my question today sought more information on housing affordability, what that question flushed out of Senator Cook was the fact that this government had no knowledge whatsoever of how it was impacting on average families and young people throughout Australia, on their jobs and on their homes.

         —Mr Howard won himself a nice cheap little headline a few days ago when he said in a speech that real average monthly mortgage repayments have risen from $674 in 1983 to $951 in 1995. That was reflected in the equally cheap shots advanced by Senator Tambling today. The truth is that the increase of around 50 per cent in real monthly mortgage repayments since 1983, as claimed by Mr Howard, is more than accounted for by an increase of over 60 per cent in the real average loan size. The reason the real average loan size has gone up to the extent that it has is overwhelmingly because people have been buying bigger and better houses. You can attack Senator Cook for talking about square metres and so on but that is the truth of the matter: the increase in real average loan size reflects in the first instance an increase in real average house prices of over 30 per cent since 1983 as a result of bigger and better houses, with the average size of a new house increasing from 167 square metres in 1983-84 to 198 square metres in 1994-95, which is an increase of 18.5 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other reason for these figures showing up as they do is that there has been an increase in the loan to valuation ratio by about 20 per cent since the March quarter of 1983, which reflects the ability to obtain a greater proportion of the required finance from a low cost provider as compared—as Senator Cook again said in his answer—to the expensive cocktail financing that was the only way you could put these things together in the past. It also reflects the use of loans secured against housing to finance other expenditure, which has also become a much more common phenomenon in the community over the last 10 years. The truth of the matter—and it can never be gainsaid—is that mortgage interest rates, which are a major determinant of mortgage repayments obviously, have fallen sharply since 1983. Benchmark variable rates for major banks declined from 12 1/2 per cent in March 1983, and even higher at 13 1/2 per cent in December 1982, to 10 1/2 per cent in June 1995. There are plenty of finance providers, newer banks and mortgage brokers, as again Senator Cook said, who are prepared to substantially undercut these rates. That is the truth of the matter.

         What is the position so far as overall housing affordability is concerned? The truth of the matter, when you cut out the political nonsense that Senator Tambling was going on with, is that housing affordability does remain at a high level, despite a fall which occurred last year, mainly reflecting increases at the time in mortgage interest rates.

         The decline in affordability last year followed more than three years of rising affordability, to a record peak in late 1983. Again, in 1995, the affordability index has improved. The index published by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Housing Industry Association rose by 2.3 per cent in the March quarter and fell back a little in June; but it does reflect stable interest rates and the continued increase in household incomes which have partly offset some increase in house prices. The basic point is and remains the fact that affordability is well above the levels of the late 1980s and is around 42 per cent above the trough in 1989. That is the situation, as the figures demonstrate and as is being experienced out there in the marketplace. Huffing and puffing by Senator Tambling or anyone else is not going to change that basic situation.

         —I was intrigued to hear the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) in his last few remarks say that  the late 1980s was a standard for comparison. Let us remember who was in government in the late 1980s—it was Labor. Comparing a disaster under Labor with another disaster under Labor seems to me a curious way of trying to demonstrate that the Labor government has somehow achieved some great step forward. The fact is that, yes, more battlers in Australia are now finding it more and more difficult to pay off their houses. Certainly, for them—they are the people Labor has abandoned—housing affordability is now a disaster.

         We can see that very clearly from recent media exposure of the gap between what people are owing on their houses and the value of the houses—the negative equity that so many Australians now face. They have borrowed more on their houses than their houses are now worth. This is a disastrous situation that is a direct result of this government's policies. For example, the media has quite properly revealed the enormity of this problem in the marginal seats of Macarthur and Gilmore in New South Wales. Let us consider houses that cost around $120,000. I know members of the Labor Party would not understand a house costing $120,000 when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) happily spends $250,000 on a carport at the Lodge—that is roughly two normal houses for the battlers of south-western Sydney. Naturally, those members do not understand the reality of the problem. This problem is a very serious one. Senator Evans can quote figures about the increase in the amounts of the loan; but that has brought about this sort of result. Yes, there are bigger loans on individual houses—

         Channel 9 demonstrated that, in Melbourne, these people—low income earners who had suffered either retrenchment or some other financial difficulty—were finding that they could not sell their homes because they would get so much less than the homes were worth. I think in one instance there was something like a $9,000 loss facing these people—the people the Labor Party is supposed to represent—if they were forced to sell their house even after having paid interest for some two, three or four years on it.

         I expect that the Labor Party will eventually wake up to this. It happens to be in almost every one of the marginal seats they just hold on to around Australia. Firstly, it is politically stupid of them to ignore this large group of battlers. Secondly, it is grossly unfair that their policies should hit the battlers of Australia, who are struggling to buy their own homes. They are the very people about whom the Liberal Party is concerned. As we will demonstrate when our policies are revealed, they will be protected against the sort of actions that the Labor Party has deliberately chosen to impose on them.

He had a business, did very well at the business and moved himself into a $500,000 house. But that is not the point I am making. It is happening to a large number of people throughout the community. It is not just an isolated case.

         Senator Baume said that battlers who encounter a problem when living in their home have to sell the house and that they cannot gain the valuation of the house or the amount of money that they borrowed against it. There has to be some responsibility in this in relation to the banks. Before you can get a loan, the first thing you have to do is go to the bank. The bank inspects the house and values it. It then decides whether it will lend you the money. You tell the bank that you have the deposit to meet the requirements, and you accept the loan that it offers you. Surely the banks have some responsibility if they are overvaluing the houses and people are taking larger loans than they should be. That is what is happening in lots of cases.

         Today you can borrow money to buy a house on a 10 per cent deposit. A few years ago, you could not do this; the banks were not competing as hard with one another. You would need 25 to 35 per cent or in some cases even up to 50 per cent of the amount of money that you wanted to borrow. On 10 per cent, you are now borrowing the balance of the money against the house. The bank values it. Surely the bank is not stupid enough to overvalue the house. For example, it will not say that the house is valued at $200,000, give you a $180,000 loan and then find later, when it goes to sell it, that the house is only valued at $115,000.

         There is some responsibility in the housing industry. There is a responsibility in the recent actions of the banks when lending money to the battler for a house. Another consideration that has to be taken into account is that the amount of deposit that is being paid by people purchasing a house is much less. They now need a much smaller deposit than they needed years ago. Therefore, if they run into some problems, there is a greater risk to the self. Of course, the amount of interest they pay in the first two or three years does not pay very much off the principal. I think everyone here understands that the interest paid in the first two or three years hardly pays anything off the principal. So it is very difficult to return the money borrowed.

         The other thing that is happening, which I think everyone also knows but no-one has mentioned, is that the building industry is starting to level out.

Now the government has inflation under control I do not believe that in the future costs to this industry will move to the extent that they moved over the last period of years.

        Arnold Drury was born in Adelaide on 23 July 1912. Prior to his election to the Senate, his working life was with the company Julius Cohn where he rose to the position of foreman overseeing the manufacture of food products. During World War II he enlisted in the Australian Military Force and later transferred to the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and served in the South West Pacific area. He was discharged in 1945.

         Arnold Drury was first elected to the Senate in 1958 and took his seat in 1959. In his maiden speech, he showed a special concern for social justice and made reference to the importance of a just wage, family support and basic education. He made many contributions over his 16 years of parliamentary service. Of particular note was his work as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence from 1973 to 1974, and as chairman of a subcommittee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs on the South Pacific region from 1967 to 1972. He also served on the Senate committees on disputed returns and qualifications, publications, road safety, and metric system of weights and measures.

         Arnold Drury retired from federal politics in 1975 but his contributions to the community never ceased. He was active in veterans' welfare, community hospital and charity work in his home state of South Australia. He was a valued member and office bearer of the Lockleys sub-branch of the RSL and the Knights of the Southern Cross. He was also deputy chairman of the RSL Hospital Visiting Committee, trustee of the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Distress Fund and deputy chairman of the Thebarton Community Hospital Board.

He was a staunch advocate for the veterans of the Second World War and he reminded the Senate on key repatriation bills that the freedoms enjoyed by Australians were directly due to the efforts and the suffering of service men and women and that those disabled during their war service had a right to expect every measure of support possible from the government.

When I joined the party in 1965, as a very young person, Arnold Drury was already a senator for South Australia. I appreciated very much the kindness and support he extended to me, and many other people of my age, at that time on becoming active in the Labor Party. I know of no state or federal member of parliament who acted in a more gentlemanly manner in their conduct with both their colleagues and their opponents than Senator Drury. His particular interest in social welfare and repatriation matters is well known. As an adviser in the Whitlam government to the then Minister for Repatriation, Senator Bishop, I remember his very strong interest in these areas as well as his strong interest in the broader issues of foreign affairs and defence.

         Former Senator Drury won the third position in the Senate for the Labor Party team in the 1958 general election and half Senate election. It was not expected that the Labor Party would win the third seat in that election because of the split that had then occurred in Labor Party, but it was Arnold Drury's selection, his campaigning and his support from a broad range of community groups in South Australia that enabled him to win the third position for the Labor Party and to go on over the subsequent 16 years to serve the Senate and, above all else, the people of South Australia with considerable distinction and dignity.

I think he felt a bit disappointed that, at the time of that election in the crisis circumstance of the 1975 double dissolution when the Whitlam government was sacked, he was standing down from the Senate. Though Arnold Drury was a great gentleman, his outrage at the events at that time was very strong indeed.

Subregulation 4(2) provides that if the length of the ship is disputed, the length may be determined by a surveyor employed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority with the costs being borne by the owner of the ship.

        The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the reasons why such reviews are to be conducted by a paid employee of a statutory authority and why the costs are to be met by the owners. In this context, section 8 of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 provides that the Minister may give written directions to AMSA, although these may only be of a general nature. The Committee suggests that the  appearance of independence may be enhanced if the review, or an appeal from a review, could be undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

         —I understand the Labor party's reticence about debating this issue but it is one of vital national importance. We are nearing the completion of almost 14 years of Labor government in this country and we have three areas that are causing particular concern to what we might refer to as mainstream Australia—which really incorporates most Australians.

         The first of those issues is the fact that unemployment is again rising and youth unemployment remains at such appalling high levels. The second issue concerns the decline in housing affordability, and linked to that is the highly unusual situation for Australia where home owners and home buyers are finding that their equity in their homes is falling. In a number of instances the home owner's debt is greater than his equity. The third issue concerns an appalling legacy from a Labor government of a greater gap between rich and poor than existed when it came to office. Those are three areas of debate which are vitally important to all Australians and issues which should be discussed in the Senate today.

         I start with the unemployment picture. This issue is obviously topical in view of the release of the unemployment statistics last week. Those figures showed that unemployment has risen slightly, but nevertheless has risen to 8.55 per cent. Over 760,000 Australians are now unemployed. It is particularly worrying because under this Labor government's policies during the recession, unemployment rose to a record high level since the war. As the Senate will recall, we reached over one million unemployed. During the recovery from the recession the figure of unemployed has very slowly reduced but now, some years on, we find that the trend has started to move up again.

         There is probably no statistic that could be a greater indictment and a greater worry to most Australians than that of 760,000 Australians out of work. For the young Australians who want work, but who are unable to get it, we have a national figure of some 27 per cent. This is the situation in a country that is so potentially rich. It is an appalling record for any administration.

         What is happening should be obvious even to this Labor government. The government made it plain that to continue to reduce unemployment we needed economic growth in this country of 4.5 per cent or higher. Now, of course, that economic growth has slipped away, even in the government's own estimates, to between three and four per cent and trending down. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, did not seem to be able to understand it at question time today, but on those figures it becomes impossible to further eat into this mass unemployment which will be the legacy of the Keating Labor government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The economic growth that is now taking place under this government's economic foundation is simply insufficient to further reduce that level of mass unemployment. Mr Keating himself recognised it when he accepted that 4.5 per cent was a necessary minimum. As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, Mr Keating said, `If you can't achieve growth of four per cent then you ought to give the game away.' It was prophetic because economic growth has now slipped under that level and is projected to go even lower. There can be no other logical consequence than that the government will cease to eat into this mass unemployment.

         Many other statistics are available that reinforce our concerns. If we look at the figures for overtime we find that they reached a peak of 18 per cent in December last year and declined to 16 per cent in September 1995 and are still falling. If the government looks to its own indications, such as the trend as demonstrated in its DEET figures, it will find that it has clearly stabilised and is now starting to slowly reduce. The tragedy of unemployment still shows an average of 27.8 per cent. During question time today Senator Cook tried to talk his way through that subject. For young people who are seeking work the figure is 27.8 per cent—25.2 per cent for males and 32 per cent for females. There is no way that Senator Cook can avoid that.

         If we look at the graphs of history we find that six years ago the comparable figure was 15 per cent. It is now 27 per cent. Senator Ian Macdonald is particularly concerned about regional areas where the situation is worse. The Labor government has failed to address this issue. Areas in the cities are still in tragic circumstances. In Victoria, the Liberal government has been trying to rebuild the state economy after the disaster of Labor governments. Some areas still have over 50 per cent youth unemployment. The same situation applies in western New South Wales. In my state of South Australia much the same picture exists. The disastrous Bannon government practically bankrupted the state. As a result, in the northern suburbs of Adelaide we have 34 per cent youth unemployment, 30 per cent in the western suburbs, 43 per cent in the eastern suburbs, and in the southern suburbs—in such seats as Kingston, the seat of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney)—youth unemployment is at 45 per cent. Thus the picture continues.

         Unfortunately, these Liberal governments have had to pick up the legacy of failed Labor inheritance. The same situation exists nationally. Despite the improving economic circumstances overall, the task of eating into those shameful unemployment figures for youth remains very difficult. That is the picture on unemployment. Not only is it tragic, but it is now on the rise again and there is no greater or more dramatic reason why this government should stand condemned. It does not deserve to be re-elected.

         The second issue I mentioned was this very worrying one of housing affordability. We raise this matter today following the release of the Real Estate Institute of Australia figures. This body does not have any vested interest in talking down the affordability of housing. In its publication the institute keeps saying that it hopes the trend will discontinue. The trend for housing affordability under this government has been a deteriorating trend. The latest figures indicate that loan affordability has declined for the sixth consecutive quarter. Affordability is at its lowest level since 1992. This occurs at a time when the great Australian dream is still so important to most Australians. The fact that people's capacity to afford to buy a home is declining is of great concern to them. It is not surprising that Australians are upset with this government.

         The minister likes to make comparisons. If we compare the situation in the 1980s with that of the early 1990s we find that housing affordability now stands at 33 index points whereas at the beginning of the 1980s it stood at 57 index points. Housing affordability has steadily declined under this government to the extent that it is half of what it was. The decline from 57 index points to 33 index points is a decline in affordability over the last 15 years of 43.3 per cent. What causes that? Regrettably, it is high and rising interest rates—a legacy of this government. Real interest rates are still around the highest in the western world.

         Inflation is rising again. We have the same consequences. The government no longer seems to be able to control underlying inflation. Why? Because of wage pressures. That is not surprising because the government's Accord has artificially suppressed wages in this country and average weekly wages have fallen. It is not surprising that housing affordability has suffered as a result.

         —This is a matter of public importance, raised by the opposition, about the economy, and one can say that we welcome the debate. It is raised by the opposition really out of fear for their own position—fear that, despite their attempt to label themselves as the battlers' party, the public of Australia still see them as a party for privilege, a party for special interests and, most importantly, a party without any policies and only platitudes to fill the gap.

         One of the reasons the opposition has raised this matter of public importance out of fear is that, in today's news services, on the wires, there is a report on what the consumers of Australia think about the future of the Australian economy. What the ordinary people of Australia believe to be their future is an important consideration. This matter of public importance tries to produce a picture of gloom and doom.

         In fact, one is encouraged to ask the question: against what social policy base does the opposition operate, and against what social principles of compassion and concern for those Australians in less fortunate positions than those in employment does the opposition act?

There is a major question mark hanging over what they will not do—a question mark which says, `How can you afford to reconcile what you say you will do in terms of outlays and promises that you have made to other interest groups and balance a budget, as you promise you will do, and afford the welfare costs that there are in Australia because of your concern for the underprivileged and for those less fortunate and less able to defend themselves'?

         Let me just work through a couple of the statistics, and let the statistics speak for themselves. On youth unemployment, the number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest level since April 1990. In September, it fell by 2,900 to 88,500. In March 1983, when Labor came to power, there were more than 158,000 young people looking for full-time work—nearly 80 per cent more than there are today. That hardly speaks to the point of this MPI about youth unemployment, or concern for unemployment. The record of the opposition in government is one of massive unemployment, double digit unemployment, and our record in government is one of bringing unemployment down from those peaks.

         Indeed, with respect to youth unemployment, the figures need to be thought about and considered quite properly in detail before anyone jumps to conclusions, because the figure most commentators have been using is 27 per cent. In fact, the official unemployment rate for 15- to 19-year-olds, as measured by the ABS, is 20.7 per cent, which is the original data. But even this, in many respects, is misleading for this group, as has been recognised by a number of pundits, including the Melbourne

         As an ABS study found, most of the teenagers counted as unemployed are, in fact, students looking for part-time work. While there were 88,500, 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full-time work—and these figures are seasonally adjusted—this is only around seven per cent of the total population aged 15 to 19. So when we have these figures bandied about, as Senator Hill did, of 27 per cent, they should be seen against that fact: that the ABS, in fact, is counting many students who are looking for part-time work in that figure. The real figure is around only seven per cent of the total population aged between 15 and 19. I think that exposes one of the big lies that the opposition is trying to foster in this campaign.

         The other key factor is: which party—us or the opposition—is best suited to manage the economy? When John Howard was the Treasurer in Australia, the average rate of real economic growth was 2.6 per cent. Under Labor, for the nearly 13 years of our government, it has averaged for all of that time 3.5 per cent. If employment is the test, then let us look at the average number of jobs created per year. Under John Howard, when he was Treasurer, 51,300 for the whole of the Fraser period was the average number of jobs created; whereas under us, the average number of jobs created each year is 163,600. Compare those figures again: 51,300 or 163,600. That is the difference between these two parties.

Under the coalition government—and this is the period December 1975 to March 1983; the period of the Fraser government when Mr Howard was Treasurer—the value of the pension for a single age pensioner not renting went down by 2.3 per cent. If they were renting privately, it went down by 2.2 per cent. Under us, `not renting' went up by 11.9 per cent, and `renting privately' went up by 20.4 per cent. For a pensioner couple, they went down 2.1 per cent in both categories under the coalition. They went up 12 per cent and 16.5 per cent under us.

The real value of the Commonwealth social wage per person under John Howard in the period 1977-78 to 1982-83 declined by 17.5 per cent. The total value of the services delivered to the underprivileged in this country and to wage and salary earners reliant on a high standard of health care, a high standard of education and a high standard of other service delivery actually declined during the Fraser years, when John Howard was Treasurer, by 17.5 per cent. During our period of office, 1982-83 to 1995-96, it has gone up by 73.1 per cent. That should be sufficient to put an end to the issue of the underprivileged.

Interest rates in the recession under John Howard were higher. Housing loans were at 12.5 per cent; building society rates, when Howard left office, were at 13.9 per cent. That is their record on interest rates. At the present time interest rates are at 10.5 per cent for the categories of home loans, and now you can shop around in a much freed-up market and get better deals than that.

         Can I just conclude by talking for a few minutes about industrial relations, because there is very little we know about the opposition's economic policies. Under their headland speeches, all they said was that they would create a productivity commission—made up of the Bureau of Industry Economics, EPAC and the Industry Commission—and that that productivity commission would recommend economic policy. All we know is that they are going to shift the deckchairs around, create a new body and rely on the public servants that inhabit that new body to tell the country what their economic policies should be.

But they are foxing clever this time. They know that the battlers—the blue-collar vote that they so carefully try to cultivate—reject absolutely and fundamentally the industrial relations changes put forward by the coalition last time. So what have they done? They have changed the words. The first thing that they have done is said that Labor will run a scare campaign on this. We have no intention of running a scare campaign; we are going to run a truth campaign and expose the vacuous nature of your changes.

In 1994 the figure was 76 working days lost per 1,000 employees. Which government is capable of inducing industrial harmony? It is us, not you lot. The only thing that is fracturing that record is the behaviour of state Liberal governments. Take the example of Western Australia. Tomorrow there will be a state strike in Western Australia directly in protest about the industrial relations so-called reforms that are being enacted in that state. There is one thing that people in the workplace want to hear about this opposition, and that is why they want to pick out the no-disadvantage test in industrial relations law.

So far we have had the usual `our record is better' or `worse than yours' debate, as seen in here regularly. In terms of the motion on youth unemployment, while the absolute rate is falling it is not falling as quickly as adult unemployment. Young Australians are now 3 1/2 times more likely to be unemployed than adult Australians. Yet two years ago they were `only' 2.9 times as likely to be unemployed.

         The government's key employment programs, including a jobs compact between the unemployed, government and business, have largely failed to meet their targets. Jobstart, for example, a subsidy program, has not been taken up by business. In the first year of its operation it has failed to reach its target by 40 per cent. That is 92,000 places. I would say in making that criticism, though, that businesses like Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation so far have shown very little interest in availing themselves of these opportunities.

         The second issue Senator Hill's motion deals with is housing affordability. Again, that is the function of three key things: interest rates, house prices and the ability to save. I have said many times here that our interest rates are amongst the highest in the world. They are kept high, in our view, because of two key policy failures of government—firstly, our excessively high current account spurred on by a debt-ridden public sector and a trade and industry policy which keeps exporting Australian jobs overseas and, secondly, our uncompetitive banking sector, which the government allows to charge margins on bank loans, particularly to housing and small business customers, margins on average twice as large as banks in other industrialised countries. Yet despite warnings from the Reserve Bank last year that margins on bank loans were too high, nothing has been done.

         On the third matter of the motion, the gap between the rich and the poor, every study on income distribution shows that the gap between rich and poor in this country has widened between 1980 and 1995. The OECD now says we have the third worst income distribution of any member country. At the heart of this are the combined policies of the government and the opposition over the last decade, pushing each other to lower government taxes on high income earners to provide tax breaks and government subsidies and support to entrepreneurs while at the same time increasing user-pays charges and decreasing services and support to low and middle income earners. Labor can at least point to a reasonably good record of a well targeted safety net, of social security payment increases, of Medicare and of—rapidly diminishing—free education.

         But if we really want to talk about the disadvantage faced by mainstream Australian families because of economic and social policy failure, we should all cast our minds a few months back to the Competition Reform Policy Bill, passed in here on the combined vote of the government and opposition. This bill converts public services in the public interest into economic goods to be contracted out, to be sold, to be bartered, whatever. Competition might very well be a good thing when you are selling apples and oranges but it is not necessarily a good thing when it comes to delivering health services or aged care services or providing decent housing for low income families.

         The fact is that in some of these areas we still accept a social responsibility to educate or clothe or house people. That social responsibility overrides the dictates of the market, which has been the feature of the government's and opposition's economic and social policy of the last decade. What you end up with often is access to services limited to the well-off or the very poor. The group which misses out are working families—precisely these battlers whom everyone is professing to be so concerned about. In ten years get ready to point the finger back to what we did in here a few months ago, to another economic and social policy failure which will disadvantage mainstream Australian families. How do we know this? Because it has happened already in Great Britain in terms of higher prices for basic services, et cetera.

But what we need to do is not have more of the same but rethink the last decade of economic and social policy failure in this country. They have been totally market based and that has been an inadequate solution. So I hope that I am wrong in saying in 10 years' time people will point back to the last few months and look to where mainstream Australian families have been again disadvantaged.

I refer her back to eight short years ago when then Prime Minister Hawke coined that now infamous quote, some say epitaph: `By 1990 no Australian child will live in poverty.' Eight short years after that ill-fated quote and some 13 years under the Labor government it seems that Australia is no closer to solving the problem of inequality and poverty. In fact, some studies show that during the past decade poverty and inequality have risen dramatically. Poverty, Adam Smith wrote, is `not having enough to live without shame in your own community.' In communities around this country it seems that more and more Australians are forced to live in shame.

         In addition, Australia has the dubious honour of having one of the highest levels of affluence coupled with one of the highest levels of poverty in the industrialised world. Ironically, Australians have always considered themselves an egalitarian society, a homogeneous middle class society, free from the vast disparities of wealth evident in other nations. Yet this perception of middle class society is now nothing more than a myth, a vestige of the 1950s and 1960s ethos when the middle class was a growing sector in our society. In the 1990s we are a much more polarised society. Australia's middle class is shrinking, while both ends of the economic spectrum are growing. In Australia today the wealthiest one per cent control around 25 per cent of the nation's wealth while the top 10 per cent control about 60 per cent.

         We have a society where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer. That is a fact. In contrast with these growing sectors in society, Australia's middle class is now an endangered species. While the problems of the long-term unemployed and the elderly constantly surround us, attention must now be directed at a new class of Australians, a class equally powerless, and some say even more disenfranchised from the power base than the two I have just mentioned. We are now witnessing the emergence of the working poor.

         The greatest cause of poverty in Australia today is unemployment. Unemployment, with its economic and social costs, has a dramatic effect on the rising gap between rich and poor. Reducing unemployment is the first step in reducing poverty and the disparities of wealth, but under the Keating government we have seen unemployment stuck over eight per cent; and the forecast is that it will rise in the new year. What a legacy to have! Some two million Australians are either unemployed or want more paid work.

         Senator Cook disparaged my leader's statements. But only the other day we heard Rupert Murdoch saying that the economy is a disgrace and that an even greater disgrace was youth unemployment. That cannot be denied, either. When measuring the rise in poverty levels in Australia, our ageing society cannot be ignored. With the number of retired people growing by over 10 per cent each year, the level of income inequality in Australia is directly linked to the growing number of pensioners, with more and more people leaving the work force and retiring on the old age pension. The effects of this on the social welfare system and the work force are evident.

In the 13 years of Labor rule, the real losers in the area of wealth distribution are the so-called true believers. These are the young Australians in full-time, low-skilled jobs; taking home low-paying wages, with some wages just above the poverty line. These are the people who are trying to build a home, raise a family and keep some hope—but this hope is fading fast.

         The constant rhetoric about the rise in GDP gives little comfort to the ailing in our society. By allowing funds for the poor, preventative health plans have the greatest chance of raising the aggregate level of health in Australia. Inequity, as we have seen, is not just about income and money; it is about dignity and security. The historical paradox is that change will come about only by the election of a Howard coalition government, a government which has a fundamental belief in a just and equitable society.

Altogether, these payments made by the Commonwealth together with the housing and education programs put forward by this government amount to $1,670 of social wage per person. In fact, over the period of this government—from 1983 to 1995—as Senator Cook said, the social wage has increased by a staggering 73.1 per cent. The fact is that real average household income over the period has increased by 20 per cent.

         While I do not accept those figures, Senator Cook should realise that that has really now become very hollow rhetoric. Australians have stopped listening. No matter how Senator Cook invites us to look at it, the matter is far simpler than the figures trotted out by him. It could not have been put better than by international media baron Rupert Murdoch last week, when he expressed the very feelings that mainstream Australians have. They are not very complicated; they are really quite simple. Rupert Murdoch referred to this country's youth unemployment as disgraceful. That is the feeling in society, and the Morgan Gallup poll and all trending polls reflect it. It is a very simple feeling.

         —The disillusion and disadvantage faced by mainstream Australians is a result of failed economic and social policies. I hope that no-one is under the illusion that the coalition policies are an improvement. It has been axiomatic that there is really very little difference between ALP new right policies and coalition new right policies.

         Where there is a difference, for example on the subject of labour market reforms, it seems that the coalition policies would probably make things worse for mainstream Australians who provide the labour you want to make cheaper. The coalition cannot make things very much more worse; it just makes them more obvious.

         The basic ideology of both major parties is that taxes should be low. Both parties believe the crucial economic factor is to assure and maintain high profitability for big companies. As a social agenda, this is outrageous. Increasing the amount of profit that goes to the rich cannot remedy any problem mentioned in this matter of public importance. It would be one thing if profit was based on technical efficiency, but it is not. The focus is on capital efficiency.

         As a consequence, the push has been to greater labour productivity. This generally means that the mainstream Australian is asked to do more work for less money. It may mean that they are expected to do unpaid overtime or to work harder. It may mean that companies sack workers, leaving those remaining to do more while leaving some things, generally customer service, poorly done. It is often trying to break down extra payment for unsociable hours, which means more people will be working such hours. It means an end to any sense of job security.

         In the days when the ALP presented a real alternative to the coalition, the issue of distribution of profits was central. The principle is that major industry is a social activity, and the profits should be distributed equitably. Failure to do this, allowing for the economic and social power of capital to direct the profits its way, accruing to the rich, is unjust and ultimately counterproductive.

         It is time to reassert that principle, and if we are concerned with distribution of profit, if we are concerned with unemployment and underemployment, and if we are concerned about distributing the benefits of technical advance, we must give mainstream Australians a greater share of the profits their efforts generate. This means higher wages for ordinary people and less exorbitant salaries for executives. Part of this effort at equity should be a decrease in hours in the standard working week.

         Another side of the agenda has been the erosion of the quality and number of public services. The big push to privatisation seems like it will give little benefit to mainstream Australians, will probably mean that some people will pay more and will probably mean it will be harder to get a decent level of service. The main virtue of privatisation seems to be that a lot of people can be sacked, and companies no longer need to be socially responsible in a number of directions. Water authorities will not need to consider conservation. Other areas, such as the privatisation of libraries, will probably mean that services become either more expensive or less available. We have already seen that in the health system. Yes, the disillusionment and disadvantage are issues. Unfortunately, the coalition presents no better alternative.

        First, fringe benefits tax will no longer apply to car parking on employers' premises unless there is a commercial car parking station within a one kilometre radius that charges more than $5 a day at the beginning of the fringe benefits tax year. This will ensure that fringe benefits tax will only apply to car parking in areas where such benefits have significant values, such as in CBD areas.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, employers will be able to adopt a simplified method of valuing car parking benefits. This new method will enable an employer to determine the value of a benefit by reference to the average of the lowest commercial car park fees at the start and end of the FBT year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Also, a further two optional methods for calculating the total taxable value of car parking fringe benefits will be available. One of these methods uses a statutory formula and the other allows an employer to keep a twelve week record of car park usage.

        PUBLIC SERVICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill proposes a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 to implement the decision announced in the 1995-96 Budget to amalgamate the Public Service Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will generate only modest savings of approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and subsequent years, the Government considers that significant benefits will result from the arrangements proposed in this bill. By drawing on the collective experience of both organisations and rationalising their corporate resources, the amalgamated body, which will be known as the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, will be better placed to develop innovative personnel management and service delivery arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will provide the Public Service, and the people of Australia generally, with tangible benefits. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission will bring together two vital streams of people management in the public sector and create an environment in which systemic issues which are brought to light in the grievance and appeals handling process can more effectively inform and improve the policy perspectives of the Public Service Commissioner. Similarly, integration with the Public Service Commissioner will provide staff of the Agency with a better appreciation of the policy issues relevant to their casework activities. By drawing together the Public Service Commission's work on best practice and the MPRA's experience in merit protection and grievance resolution, the new Commission's ability to contribute to the delivery of quality service to the Australian public will be greater than the sum of its individual parts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the Government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation—fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations. The MPRA has an important role in preserving key values in Australian Government employment and, in particular, in preserving the merit system. In its first eleven years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In developing this legislation, the Government has been careful to ensure that the Public Service Commissioner and the Director of the MPRA, who will in future be known as the Merit Protection Commissioner, will continue to exercise their statutory powers independently of each other. The powers of the MPRA in relation to the investigation of grievances and the resolution of disputes will be unaffected by these amendments, and it will be just as vigorous in protecting public servants' rights as it has always been. The Government's intention is that the two Commissioners should have a close and cooperative relationship, but that neither will be able to interfere in the other's statutory role.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the staff of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA, however, is that the Merit Protection Commissioner will no longer have the powers of a Secretary in relation to the staff of the MPRA. These powers will rest with the Public Service Commissioner, but the Government expects the Public Service Commissioner to delegate his personnel management powers in relation to the staff of the Commission who are required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act to the Merit Protection Commissioner. This will guarantee the continued independence of the MPRA from the Public Service Commission, and ensure that there will be no diminution in the rights of public servants to independent appeal and grievance mechanisms as a result of this bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, Mr President, the bill makes a number of other minor changes to the act. Members of the Merit Protection Agency will continue to be appointed by the Governor-General in Council on Ministerial advice. However, the bill will require wider consultation on these appointments than is currently the case. In addition, the bill provides that only the Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to be appointed on a full time basis. This, in fact, has been the situation since the MPRA was established in 1984, and the amendment does no more than reflect the reality of the current practice.

        SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of the bill is to strengthen the curfew at Sydney Airport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable senators will recognise the importance of balancing the interests of noise affected communities against the operational requirements of the airport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The night hours are the most noise sensitive period. Communities affected by aircraft noise during the day deserve to be free of this disturbance during the night. The government is therefore committed to minimising, to the greatest extent possible, the activities at the airport during the night-time curfew period.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government has already made significant improvements to the curfew regime over the past year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Last December, the government introduced a monetary penalty of up to $25,000 for curfew breaches. This replaced the previous arrangements where curfew breaches were dealt with administratively rather than by the courts and without provision for monetary penalties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Last April the government introduced stricter limitations on movements by larger freight jets. Approvals for the operation of Boeing 737 and Airbus A300 freight aircraft have either lapsed or been withdrawn. Moreover, operations by McDonnell Douglas DC9 aircraft are being phased out and must be eliminated by May 1996. Permitted jet movements will then be restricted to the quieter British Aerospace BAe146 aircraft.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A strict approach has also been adopted in considering requests for dispensations from the curfew at Sydney Airport. In the first six months of 1995, an average of 3 dispensations a month have been granted, compared with an average of approximately 25 curfew dispensations per month during 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regulations have been made to ensure that all night-time jet freight operations into Sydney Airport are banned after the opening of Sydney West Airport. The people of Western Sydney can be reassured that the government's comprehensive updating of the Environmental Impact Statement for the new airport will have as its central objective the prevention of noise nuisance arising from night-time operations. It is fundamentally important that we learn the lessons of Sydney Airport and ensure that future generations of Western suburbs residents are not exposed to excessive noise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The private members' bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition into the other House in the last sittings, by proposing only to replicate the current curfew regulations in an act, did nothing to ease the burden of the airport's operations at night on the residents of Sydney. After so strongly supporting the parallel runway development at Sydney Airport, the Opposition now seek to deceive voters into thinking they will do something about the curfew. In reality they would do nothing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the request of the Member for Lowe, the Howard private member's bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure with a view to strengthening the current curfew arrangements. Residents affected by aircraft noise in Sydney are fortunate to have an elected representative such as Mary Easson who recognised the need to strengthen the curfew and at whose instigation the Committee was tasked to look at this issue. The measures in this bill are the direct result of her efforts on behalf of residents living around Sydney Airport
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government is grateful to Peter Morris and his committee for carrying out this Inquiry and reporting in such a tight time-frame. The proposals put forward by the committee comprise a significant package and have been of considerable assistance in the preparation of the bill now before the Senate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill, in building on the current stricter curfew arrangements, goes much further to provide a range of new initiatives to strengthen and enhance the current controls. For this reason the government has decided to draft a new bill, rather than propose numerous amendments to the Opposition bill. The government's bill is aimed at minimising curfew aircraft operations at Sydney Airport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On behalf of the government, I would now like to respond to the committee's proposals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In their first two proposals the committee suggested steps to reduce the number of international passenger aircraft movements during the first and last hours of the curfew. The government accepts the absolute desirability of reducing the number of these movements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consistent with the committee's recommendations, the international entitlements in the bill reflect current usage patterns. This means an immediate reduction in the current international passenger jet entitlements between the hours of 5am and 6am from 42 movements per week, with no more than 8 on any day, to a maximum of 35 movements per week, with no more than 7 on any day. The bill also enables regulations to prescribe lower levels of entitlements. In line with the committee's proposal for a progressive phase-out, the Minister for Transport envisages reducing entitlements whenever practicable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally,  the bill introduces a regime requiring each individual international passenger movement during the curfew shoulder periods to be fully justified.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        International passenger movements during the shoulder periods will not be permitted once Sydney West Airport is capable of handling those movements. In the interim, international passenger movements will only be approved if they can be justified by reason of curfew constraints at overseas airports or lack of available capacity at Sydney Airport outside the curfew.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill establishes a process where operators of international passenger aircraft may apply to the Secretary of the Department of Transport for approval for specific flights. This will require the Department and the industry, for the first time, to assess carefully the feasibility of rescheduling these shoulder hour flights into non-curfew times.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This process is consistent with the committee's proposals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Members of the public have complained about aircraft departing to the north of the Airport just on 11pm and therefore not clearing the suburbs until some time after the start of the curfew. In order to address this issue the bill contains a provision which requires all aircraft to depart over the Bay after 10.45pm. If wind conditions preclude these take-offs the aircraft will not be permitted to depart.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current arrangements allow an aircraft that has received a clearance to push back from a gate before 11pm to depart during the curfew provided it takes-off over Botany Bay. Certain operators have taken advantage of this provision and have been seeking, and receiving, push back clearances well before they are actually ready to depart. This has allowed some aircraft to depart from the Airport well after 11pm without breaching the Regulations. In line with the committee's proposal this push back provision has been abolished. The bill before the Senate contains a provision based on taxi clearance, which means that aircraft will have to be actually available for take-off before 11pm .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I stated earlier curfew movements by the larger jet freight aircraft have been, or are being, phased out. In order to ensure that the gains from this initiative are not circumvented by the use of larger and relatively noisy propeller-driven aircraft, the bill contains a provision which prohibits the use of propeller-driven aircraft which have a maximum take-off weight greater than 34,000kg. This seeks to address the concerns expressed by the committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There has been considerable public disquiet about the issuing of curfew dispensations and the committee made a number of proposals in this area.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In future, guidelines will be used in assessing applications for curfew dispensations. The preparation of these guidelines will be subject to a public consultation process. It is envisaged that, subject to this process, the guidelines will restrict any such operations to fly only over Botany Bay. However, there will be provision for dispensations to be granted for operations on other runways in the event of a force majeure situation arising, for example, civil emergencies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When a dispensation is granted, the bill requires the minister to table a statement outlining the reasons for the dispensation in each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Morris committee suggested that the minister be given authority to increase the number of flights during the curfew for one-off events such as the 2000 Olympics. The government intends to ensure that Sydney Airport and Sydney West Airport, which will then be open, are capable of handling the level of air traffic during the Olympic period without the need to relax the curfew at Sydney Airport. This proposal is therefore not accepted by the government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the present curfew regulations the maximum fine for a breach of the curfew was $25,000 for a corporation. This is consistent with the Commonwealth criminal law policy that penalties in regulations are intended for minor offences only. By placing the curfew controls in this act, the penalties can be increased to be consistent with those imposed for similar offences under other legislation. The government therefore supports the committee's proposal that the bill provide for penalties of up to $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for corporations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government is committed to improving the processes for community consultation on curfew issues. This is already demonstrated through the establishment of the Sydney Airport Community Consultative committee chaired by the Hon Joe Riordan.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Morris committee has proposed that this be further pursued through a general purpose standing committee of the House of Representatives. The bill incorporates the consultation procedures currently before the Parliament in the Legislative Instruments bill. They will allow public scrutiny of any proposals to amend this bill once enacted. They will also apply to development of instruments under this legislation. Adoption of these consultation procedures will not of course preclude any curfew issues being dealt with by a Parliamentary committee when considered necessary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The issue of residents being woken up early on weekend mornings by a succession of landings from the north starting at 6am has been a particular problem. The committee proposed that the feasibility of restricting operations over Botany Bay between the hours of 10pm and 11pm and 6am and 7am at weekends be examined. The bill adopts this proposal to give much needed relief in this area, whenever safe operations can be conducted over Botany Bay.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On certain occasions aircraft approach the Airport from the south at night, but `miss the approach' and have to abort their landings. Although this is an internationally accepted procedure and is essential to safe flying, it results in the aircraft flying over the suburbs to the north and creating significant noise disturbance. In order to explain to the community the reason for these events the committee proposed that operators place an explanatory advertisement in local newspapers within 7 days of such an event.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This proposal has not been taken up in full due to advice of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority which considers that a statutory requirement for airlines themselves to give a public account for carrying out a missed approach may have an adverse effect on flight safety.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, consistent with the longstanding requirement for the reporting of the use of reverse thrust, the bill contains a requirement for an explanatory report to be provided to the Secretary of the Department when a missed approach occurs. This information will be made public through the Sydney Airport Community Consultative committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The committee noted that noise disturbance at night is not restricted to aircraft operating out of Sydney Airport and that a study should be undertaken of the impacts of propeller-driven aircraft carrying out night-time operations around Sydney. The government accepts this. The proposed study will be carried out immediately.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a first step to offset the noise impacts of propeller-driven aircraft operating into and out of Sydney Airport at night, the Minister for Transport proposes to amend the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Flight Corridors) Regulations so that propeller-driven aircraft will be required to adhere to flight corridors over the Kurnell sandhills when landing or taking off during the curfew.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One final matter raised by the committee was that the noise complaint handling procedures at Sydney Airport be reviewed. The Minister for Transport is now taking steps to ensure that this is done.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With their ineffectual private member's bill having been gazumped by our curfew bill, the Opposition has pulled a new stunt in the form of an amendment to "re-open" the east-west runway.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Leaving aside the outrageous cynicism and cowardly deception displayed by the Opposition in attempting to back away from their strident advocacy for the third runway, nothing could be more detrimental to the interests of those in the flight paths.
       </para>

        All our technical advice has been in favour of parallel runway operations, just as it would be if the Opposition were in office. If they ignored such advice from all the relevant agencies and outside experts, they would be directly and singularly responsible for running the airport in a manner that was less safe and a long way below capacity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In reality this notion of re-opening the east-west runway is the airlines proposal to use the eastern end of the runway for stub operations by propellers. Sure this would overcome some of the safety and capacity problems, but it would also free up the north-south axis for more jet operations. Indeed the movement rate to the north could be up to 80-85 jet aircraft per hour. An increase of at least 10 jets per hour to the north.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The airlines would be delighted because they could go on deferring any need to use Badgerys Creek and therefore to duplicate facilities. But the already suffering residents on the north-south flight path would face a huge increase in their noise burden, all thanks to the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Perhaps this is the reason they supported the third runway in 1989. Back then they were absolutely derisory about the issue of aircraft noise. Just as they try to deceive people into believing they now care about the low paid, they now say they care about noise affected residents. Well the government won't let them get away with it. At every turn we will remind the electorate of everything the Opposition has previously said. At the same time we will continue our own drive to provide genuine protection for noise affected residents under the Sydney Airport flight paths.

        GOVERNOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The enactment of this bill would set the salary of the next Governor-General after he is sworn in on 16 February 1996. Because Section 3 of the Constitution fixes the salary of the Governor-General for the term of office, the salary fixed at the commencement of the Governor-General's appointment must be set at a level that will still be appropriate at the end of the term. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the official salary of the Governor-General shall be exempt from income tax.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Governor-General Act 1974 provided for a salary of $30,000. It was amended in 1977 to increase the salary to $37,000, in 1982 to increase the salary to $70,000 and in 1988 to increase the salary to $95,000. It is now proposed that the Governor-General's salary be $58,000. The salary will remain unchanged through the period of the next Governor-General's appointment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In proposing this salary for the next Governor-General, I would like Honourable Members to note that Sir William Deane has requested that the salary be set to take account of the non-contributory pension which he will receive under the Judges' Pension Act after retiring from the High Court. Payment of this pension will continue during his term of office as Governor-General. At the commencement of the term of office, the sum of Sir William's net pension and the proposed salary would be in the order of $130,000.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principle that has governed the calculation of this amount is that used to determine the salaries of Governors-General in the past; that is, to keep the average salary over the notional period of the appointment somewhat ahead of the estimated average annual income, after tax, of the Chief Justice of Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed salary, combined with Sir William's pension as a retired Justice of the High Court, is commensurate with the office, it is economically responsible, and maintains the traditional relativity between the Chief Justice and the Governor-General.

        ANL SALE BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ANL Sale Bill makes the necessary legislative provision to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL Limited although agreement has been reached under which the finalisation of the sale to P&amp;O Australia has been deferred until 31 October 1995.  Finalisation of sale arrangements is subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements and the retention by the Commonwealth of a special share.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ANL is a shipping company wholly owned by the Commonwealth. It formerly operated as the Australian National Line and was converted to a public company, with effect from 1 July 1989.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government first announced its intention to sell a substantial part of ANL in the context of the 1991/92 Budget. A scoping study was undertaken which concluded, in 1992, that given its then trading circumstances, a sale of  less than 100 per cent of the company was unlikely to be commercially feasible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During 1994 a further consultancy was undertaken as the first stage of a due diligence process into ANL. The due diligence process is a thorough examination of the company which, among other things, is designed to give a firm understanding of its assets and liabilities. That report was completed in August 1994 and its recommendation was that due to ANL's poor financial position and bleak outlook a sale was unlikely to be possible at that time and that the Government's best option was likely to be a managed trade down of the company. This would have meant an effective liquidation of the company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Rather than pursue this option, the Government decided to appoint a new Board, headed by Mr Neville Wran, to undertake further analysis, restructure the company and examine future options. The Government also announced its intention to provide guarantees in respect of ANL's debt and any future drawdowns under its Promissory Note facility so as to enable the restructuring to be carried out in a stable commercial environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ANL Board carried out some considerable restructuring of the Line, including the sale of ANL's interest in Australian Stevedores, the winding up of joint ventures with Howard Smith in bulk shipping and with Union Shipping in the trans-Tasman trade, the pay out of a bank debt facility and the lease on the ship River Torrens and some rationalisation of overseas and corporate staff.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Having received and pursued a number of inquiries, the Board reported, earlier this year, that there was interest from a number of companies in the purchase of some or all of ANL, including proposals from two companies which may have involved the purchase of all of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL. In May 1995, the Government agreed to the Board progressing with potential bidders, expressions of interest in the purchase of the Commonwealth's shares in the Company. In the event one bid was received, being from P&amp;O Australia, and this was not for the purchase of ANL with all of its existing liabilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Based on that bid, the Board and Commonwealth officials have been able to negotiate an agreement under which P&amp;O would purchase the Commonwealth's shares in ANL, subject to a number of conditions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has had discussions with ANL unions, with the ACTU and with P&amp;O on the sale option. Deferral of a decision to finalise the sale to P&amp;O until 31 October 1995 will allow P&amp;O and the unions, under the leadership of the Secretary of the ACTU, to conduct negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements. Subject to the satisfactory completion of those negotiations, the sale to P&amp;O will be finalised. If the unions and P&amp;O cannot reach a resolution acceptable to them and to the Government then the option of restructuring ANL to increase the potential for it to return to viability will be pursued.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order for the option of a sale to P&amp;O to be quickly carried out at the completion of the negotiations between unions and P&amp;O, it will be necessary for the ANL Sale Bill to be passed by both Houses of Parliament by the end of October. P&amp;O is keen to be in a position to take action to turn ANL's results around. Any further delay creates uncertainty, with the risk of consequent damage to ANL's market share in its various businesses.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The substantive provisions of the bill do not come into operation until the draft sale contract is signed. Should the contract not be signed by the end of 1995 the legislation provides for its automatic repeal on 1 January 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill makes transitional and savings provisions in relation to ANL employee long service leave, maternity leave, compensation and rehabilitation and certain retirement benefits that have become standard in legislation providing for the disposal of major Commonwealth assets, as for example in the sales of Qantas, ASTA and CSL Limited.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are three major features of this bill which have arisen out of the negotiation of the draft sale contract and the recent discussions between the Government, unions and P&amp;O in relation to the sale.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first feature relates to the provisions which flow from the fact that P&amp;O is not willing to purchase all of ANL's businesses nor take on all of ANL's liabilities. The second feature is the provision of an appropriation to meet any contributions required by the Commonwealth under the draft sale contract. The third feature is the need to provide for the protection of the future industrial arrangements that are being negotiated with P&amp;O.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To move the required businesses and liabilities out of ANL and convert ANL into a company with reduced liabilities, the bill provides for the transfer of certain of ANL's assets, rights, liabilities and obligations to a nominated company (or a subsidiary of that company) or to the Commonwealth direct. The nominated company, which is called "RetainCo" in the bill, must be wholly owned by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ANL, under P&amp;O Australia's ownership, will continue to hold around $140 million of debt, in the form of ship and container leases and drawdowns under ANL's Promissory Note facility.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The assets, liabilities, rights and obligations to be transferred out of ANL will primarily be long term ship leases and associated transaction documents, as well as several dormant ANL subsidiary companies. If a sale of ANL's shares in the Coastal ExpressLine business on satisfactory terms is not concluded prior to a sale to P&amp;O, a holding company structure will be utilised to protect the Commonwealth's interests in this business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        After the sale the Commonwealth will continue to hold liabilities in the form of obligations under the long term ship leases transferred from ANL to RetainCo. RetainCo's obligations under the ship leases are, however, to be substantially matched by reciprocal income streams under long term sub-leases of the ships to major companies (including ANL after the sale). These long term sub-leases are either in place or the subject of negotiations in train.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The liabilities of RetainCo, in total around $183 million, will progressively diminish over time as the leases are paid out and it is expected that RetainCo will be at least cash neutral to the Commonwealth over the long term; that is, there should be no net call on Commonwealth funds to meet RetainCo's obligations over its life.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides for a Commonwealth guarantee to be granted in respect of the obligations transferred to RetainCo. As the company will not be a commercially operating company in the ordinary sense, a guarantee will be required to give comfort to financiers that it will be able to meet its obligations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is the possibility that RetainCo or an ANL company transferred to the Commonwealth may require operating funds in its initial year and the bill appropriates any funds necessary to provide working capital for 1995/96 for RetainCo or for the holding company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also appropriates up to $15 million to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the draft sale contract. There are three elements to this contribution. The first element is to cover the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights which would impose additional costs on the Commonwealth. Those financiers have, however, already provided in principle consent to the change of ownership. Other elements of the $15 million include any expenses, such as legal costs, related to the transfer of businesses out of ANL to RetainCo or the Commonwealth direct, and a contingency to provide for the possibility that ANL's operating results up to the date of sale are significantly worse than forecast.  Current expectations are that only a small percentage of the $15 million will be required.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In respect of the industrial arrangements to be negotiated in respect of ANL, the bill provides for the articles of association of ANL to contain special articles which will enshrine the outcome of those negotiations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The special articles will not be able to be altered or removed without the consent of the Minister, and the Ministerial consent is to be an instrument required to be laid before Parliament and subject to disallowance. The consent will not be effective until the disallowance period has expired.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides for the Minister to have the power to seek injunctions in the Federal Court to enforce the observance of the special articles and to prevent their removal or alteration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also provides for alterations to ANL's tax position as a consequence of the sale. ANL's accounting period is to be aligned with P&amp;O's and the holding of the special share by the Commonwealth is to be deemed not to prevent ANL being treated as a wholly owned subsidiary of P&amp;O for tax purposes. ANL's accumulated tax losses, of about $70 million, for the period before the sale will be extinguished and will, therefore, not be available to P&amp;O to offset against profits post-sale.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government believes that a sale is the preferred option and the bill will facilitate the realisation of a long term future for ANL. ANL is currently losing  around $2 million per month in its operations. ANL has some cash reserves, which were obtained from the sale of some of its assets, but once these have been  exhausted—a matter of months not years—it would require cash support from the taxpayer to continue to trade. This is not a sensible long term approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The alternative to a sale is, therefore, a further major restructuring aimed at eliminating the likely need for taxpayer funding, which would see ANL withdraw from a number of trades and reduce in size. There is a risk that the resulting small organisation will lack sufficient resources to withstand any future poor trading periods. As is currently the case, ANL would not be able to influence in any significant way the freight rates paid by Australian importers and exporters.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the sale is completed, ANL will continue to carry Australia's container imports and exports as a separate entity within the P&amp;O group. P&amp;O has indicated its intention to maintain ships under the Australian flag, crewed by Australian crews under Australian award conditions. Commonwealth ownership is not essential for there to be a continued Australian flag presence in international trades. In order to enhance the prospects of ANL's longer term commercial viability, and in the best interests of Australian taxpayers and the public at large, a sale to P&amp;O Australia is the Government's preferred course of action, subject to a satisfactory outcome to the current industrial negotiations. Passage of this legislation is required urgently to enable the sale to be completed as soon as this negotiation process has concluded.

        The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are designed to correct a number of minor drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which established the Professional Services Review Scheme. In addition, the amendments will allow the appointment, as a President of a Professional Services Review Tribunal, of a person who holds or has held judicial office in a State or Territory jurisdiction. One of the new measures in this bill is to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973.

        The Commission has undertaken a number of consultancies primarily, but not exclusively,under the auspices of the World Bank.

        This bill also contains amendments to parts of the National Health Act 1953 which regulate the administration of nursing homes.

The amendments to the current legislation are essential to address two immediate issues that have been identified.

        Firstly there are a number of technical amendments to the National Health Act 1953 (the Principal Act) consequential upon amendments to the Principal Act introduced by the National Health Amendment Act 1992 which resulted in the entitlement to General Care benefit being calculated by reference to the "notional scale of fees" determined retrospectively under the Principal Act in place of the scale of fees determined prospectively under section 40AA.

        Secondly, there are a number of amendments that relate to nursing homes which have been granted "exempt bed status". The amendments contained in the bill will address public concern about exempt nursing homes which fail to meet required standards of care.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The granting of "exempt bed status" under section 39AB of the act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting "exempt bed status" is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available. However, the current provisions of the act do not enable the revocation or suspension of "exempt bed status" for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing and personal care.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is clearly incongruous to continue to allow a nursing home to charge additional amounts for a supposed increased level of accommodation and services, when the level of nursing and personal care fails to meet the basic standards.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The decision to suspend or revoke "exempt bed status" is to be subject to internal review,as well as review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

        The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 is to specify directly the Health Ministers to be consulted by the Minister before appointing the Chairperson of the Council, the Chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a Principal Committee of the Council, and the member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research. Currently the act provides that the Minister is to consult in relation to these appointments with the other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The composition of that membership can of course vary from time to time and currently includes the New Zealand Minister for Health. The proposed amendment would specify that it is the Health Minister of each State and Territory who is to be consulted in relation to the appointments.

        THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill incorporates and reintroduces all the provisions of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 in regard to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, as considered by both Houses of Parliament last session, and differs from that bill in the addition of one further minor amendment to correct an unintended consequence of a clause in the original legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As outlined in my second reading speech for the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, the amendments included in this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) to cut product approval time to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality, or safety of the medicinal products. The bill provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods, which have been identified in its first 4 years of operation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A mechanism to address shortages, or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation. Also included in the bill are changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the "penalty units" classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality safety and efficacy from the market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A definition for "food" has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of "therapeutic goods" which excludes "food" but fails to define the term. What constitutes "food" in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words "prescribed dose" and "frequency of administration" included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration Trust Account with the Therapeutic Goods Administration Reserve, consistent with changes to be made by the proposed Financial Management Accountability Bill 1995 and related bills that will replace the Audit Act 1901.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This will ensure that technical and scientific data that should be lodged in connection with a general marketing application, will be evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Turning to the new provision in the bill, the legislation currently provides that where therapeutic goods are refused marketing approval within Australia they may still be included in the ARTG as listed goods for export only. The secretary is empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. The secretary's power is currently confined to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only, and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re export.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the secretary's ability to require confirmation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept goods refused marketing approval in Australia, extends to all products, irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.

         —On balance, the coalition does not oppose the principle of the negotiated bulk payments of quantum of double dipped benefits according to a formula agreed between government and compensation payers. It is important that there is no administration tax relating to these arrangements. We accept the government's contention that insurers and other compensation payers were prepared to wear this type of arrangement in return for the waiver of fees, charges and given notification arrangements. We can see the benefits of these arrangements for small amounts of Medicare or nursing home benefits in respect of a given claim, but we do not accept that this is the best option or that compensation payers accepted it with anything but the greatest reluctance. It is a complex structure and will be costly for the compensation payers to service.

         The implication is that insurers and Workcover authorities will have to gear up to adjust to the data and administrative demands of the Health Insurance Commission, rather than the other way round. Indeed, this seems to be the way of this government. Rather than using that well-worn line, `I'm from the government, we're here to help you,' it is a case of this government telling compensation payers, `Complain as much as you like, but we are here to help you.'

         I also place on record the coalition's general view that, if these arrangements do work and absorb most of the insurance related claims, as the government argues, the revenue that would have been generated from this so-called administrative fee would have dropped to almost nothing. This simply reinforces the absurdity of the administration charge proposals. We note the undertaking of the government to review these arrangements after a period of time. I can assure the Senate that the coalition, in the likely event of being in government after the next election, will be reviewing these arrangements after 12 months of operation. We reserve our right to amend these and other arrangements in this bill if they prove inefficient, unfair or overly expensive.

        The provisions of this bill essentially duplicate those provisions of the main bill which relate to the recovery of Medicare and nursing home benefits. The provisions in this bill are intended to have an effect only to the extent that the parallel provisions in the main bill are regarded as provisions which impose taxation. Section 55 of the constitution requires that proposed laws imposing taxation should be contained in a separate bill. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel takes the view that, where charges are imposed or moneys are recovered, this duplication is a necessary precaution. The amendments to the care charges bill mirror amendments 8 and 10 to 13 in the main bill.

         Almost without exception, these important issues have been neglected by successive governments in Australia. I am seeking to present some of my comments in relation to this at the third reading stage because, unfortunately, I was not able to raise these matters during the second reading debate. However, I acknowledge that the Greens have been pleased to support the changes that have been passed in the committee stage and would just like to put on the public record some of these concerns which relate to cost shifting in workers compensation.

         There are nine major workers compensation schemes in operation in Australia, one for workers in each state and territory and one specifically for federal government employees. Moreover, under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988—formerly known as the CERC Act 1988, as amended—licences have been granted to two federal government corporations, Australia Post and Telecom, empowering them to manage their own compensation claims and to administer rehabilitation programs for their injured employees.

         The recently released report of the federal government's Industry Commission on workers compensation suggests that there is invidious competition between these various schemes, which was based partly on who could shift the most workers compensation costs onto individuals or onto the taxpayer funded health or social security systems. This report makes nonsense of the claims by insurers and compensation payers that they do not cost shift to the Commonwealth and that they fully meet their obligations to fund the treatment of those with compensable injuries. By their very nature, compensation insurers are driven by the profit motive. It is unrealistic to expect them to always act in the best interests of injured workers.

         It does not seem to matter whether the compensation insurer is a private commercial enterprise or a federal government agency or corporation, cost shifting is rampant. In Western Australia, an organisation known as the Injured Persons Action and Support Association, or IPASA, owes its very existence to the injustices suffered by many injured persons as a result of exercises in cost shifting perpetrated by compensation insurers.

         IPASA has repeatedly drawn attention to Telecom's campaign of harassment and victimisation of those of its employees who developed RSI in the early to mid-1980s. Telecom, well known for its insensitivity in these matters, continues this cynical exercise in cost shifting to the community, as evidenced by its insistence that many of those women be regularly examined by a doctor flown in from Adelaide. In fact, that doctor was the very doctor who coined the term `kangaroo paw'. Telecom prospers mightily in the 1990s, but it does so over the bodies of many of its female workers who were injured in the 1980s.

         IPASA also exposed the nefarious exploits of certain of Australia Post's compensation delegates in WA. These revelations resulted in the then state manager apologising in person to one of his employees who, as a result of the continued harassment directed against him and his psychiatrist by the compensation section, had been driven to the point of contemplating suicide. According to IPASA, there have been many other injured persons employed by Australia Post who have been unfairly deprived of their compensation entitlements and forced onto social security benefits by these zealous delegates.

         In 1992 Comcare laid down fairly stringent claims management standards for licensees under the act. However, its own claims management practices have attracted criticism. Areas of complaint outlined in the IPASA newsletter of November-December 1994 included: the fairness and rationality of decision making on some claims, both new and long-established ones; continuation of the practice of doctor shopping; incorrect interpretation of medical reports; removal of rights to compensation and rehabilitation without adequate reason; and interference in the medical referral process. Clearly, if Comcare cannot get its own house in order, it is hardly in the best position to ensure maintenance of claims management standards by those to whom it has granted licences under the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992.

         The state compensation system in WA has recently been extensively overhauled by the Court government. The major changes to legislation were specifically designed to remove lawyers from the system and to thus curtail cost. A conciliation and review directorate was established to speedily resolve disputes between employers and injured workers. Although it had to cope with a huge backlog of cases left over from the previous system, the government claims that the directorate has been an outstanding success.

         However, an upper house committee of review has recommended that major significant changes be made to the system of dispute resolution. This criticism is not unexpected when one realises that the directorate commenced its operations with `conciliators' who were untrained in conciliation, with review officers devoid of legal training and with ad hoc medical panels selected from a list of those doctors volunteering to serve on them—for a fee of $400 per hour.

         Considering that disputes can be, and often are, created at the whim of the insurer, injured workers often find that the conciliation process is a complete waste of their time. In addition, when they do have to attend conciliation and review hearings without legal representation, injured workers find themselves opposed by experienced insurance personnel representing their employer. This is obviously a most inequitable situation. As the promised speedy resolution of compensation disputes has not eventuated in WA, there has probably been no alteration in the extent of cost shifting to the Commonwealth practised by compensation insurers.

         In Australia women who are injured at work fare less well than work injured men. This conclusion was reached by Worksafe Australia in its report of October 1994 entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Occupational health and safety: the experience of women workers, Australia, 1991-92
         </emphasis>

         When his government's record on this matter is scrutinised, the assistant minister's remarks would hardly inspire much confidence amongst the working women of Australia. When RSI became so prevalent over 10 years ago, the health and safety of women in the workplace was prominently placed on the political agenda. However, it was quietly taken off the agenda by this federal government when economic expediency became the order of the day.

         In 1986 Worksafe Australia's working party on repetition strain injury expressed concern both at the high degree of emotional and anecdotal debate on RSI and at the attitudinal barriers of racial origin and gender which could prevent sufferers from receiving appropriate and early attention. The report was severely criticised on the grounds that it failed to properly address these issues and that its authors appeared oblivious to the medico-legal conflicts which were proving so distressing to RSI sufferers. Such conflicts often resulted in great economic hardship for sufferers as well as interruption or curtailment of their working careers.

         For many with RSI the not infrequent consequences of having this diagnosis applied to them were harassment and victimisation, family relationship problems, social isolation, loss of their former self-image and depressive illness. Other complaints by women with RSI included denial of access to correct medical management, to rehabilitation and to psychological support. The federal government and Worksafe Australia prefer to downplay and then to ignore these major problems affecting working women, perhaps hoping that they will just go away. Now, like the proverbial scapegoat, they have returned.

The Greens (WA) see this admission as being one of guilt as well as a national disgrace. We look to the federal government for a positive commitment to rectify this matter. Buck-passing or, as it is known, cost shifting is only a symptom of a more widespread illness which exists within our society.

         A popular cliche claims that all good things come to those who wait. In this instance we have had to wait a long, long time, so in this case there must be a whole lot of good in this bill. So long have we waited that this bill has had to change its name to get debated in this chamber. I must inform you that the bill was once known as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994—a change of name, but still another tax bill.

         At an administrative level, this bill contains a significant advance in the presentation of taxation legislation that should in future prove a valuable tool for the parliament. I refer to the inclusion of compliance cost impact statements. These statements were recommended by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts following its inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office in 1993.

         The initiative is important for two reasons. It will provide an indication to taxpayers of the estimated cost of complying with particular changes in the tax laws. More importantly though, these statements will necessitate government actually considering the cost they impose on our economy—that is, on the people of Australia—of administering the government's taxation policy.

         It is always easy for governments, particularly those that have been in power for 12 years, like this government, to believe that every tax change they introduce can be implemented without cost. It is easy to believe that governments should be required to only consider making good laws and that it is for the citizens to obey those laws regardless of the administrative costs of doing so. Such a view of the world is highly dangerous as it suggests that we are in this place to impose laws on the citizens of Australia rather than to make laws on behalf of those citizens. It is important to remember this distinction, especially with tax legislation.

         I say quite plainly that I welcome the development of these impact statements. I do wonder, however, how serious the Labor government is about this reform. How serious is the government about informing Australians how much taxation changes will cost them? When I look at these statements, I have to ask how much effort is being devoted to estimating the cost of compliance. Could it be that the government cannot make these calculations? Maybe they can; maybe they cannot. If they can, then I believe the general statements which are contained in this bill are insufficient. It is important that people be able to appreciate the cost of our taxation system; that is, the cost of compliance. Perhaps the tax office has found it just too hard to comply with this requirement.

         If the government cannot make these calculations, what does it say about our tax laws? If they are too complicated and their impact is too uncertain, then how does the government expect taxpayers to apply the law in the first place? It is a simple principle which I will state again: if a law is so complicated that the costs of complying with the law cannot be measured, then, in my opinion, that law is a bad law. I can only say in summary on this opening point that the coalition supports the further development of tax impact statements for the benefit of all Australians.

I had considered outlining all the relevant provisions of this bill and their impact on the various parties who will be affected. Senators may be reassured that I have chosen against this course. Indeed, having read through the explanatory memorandum of the bill, I have decided I should acknowledge the value of brevity and refer all interested persons to the detailed and elucidating speech of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in the House of Representatives.

Since becoming Prime Minister, he has increased the Commonwealth's tax revenue grab from $89 billion just three years ago to a forecast $119 billion this year. And, of course, worse than that, since he has been Prime Minister borrowings have gone from $30 billion and are expected to be $100 billion at the end of this year.

         Finally, I would like to briefly highlight two changes contained in the legislation which are definitely in favour of the Australian taxpayer and are welcomed by the coalition without condition. The proposed changes to the civil penalties and taxation offences contained in part 1 of schedule 2 of the bill derive from recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The amendments are designed to ensure that taxpayers are not subject to an administrative penalty under taxation laws for an act or omission which gives rise to prosecution of the taxpayer under those laws.

         These changes ensure that the Taxation Office must choose one path and one path only for seeking redress against a taxpayer. They will ensure, among other things, that the Taxation Office does not have the power to impose an administrative penalty against a taxpayer where a prosecution of the taxpayer is commenced and then withdrawn by the Taxation Office. This change is most welcome as an indication of the Taxation Office's complementary relationship to the tax paying citizens of Australia. It is a change that is owed to the Australian public.

It has had a long gestation period. The thrust of the legislation, as my colleague Senator Gibson said, has the approval of the opposition. However, in matters of detail we would have preferred certain alternative routes.

The small claims tribunal is yet to be established. I have been invited to participate in a workshop on Monday to look into the mechanics of setting up such a small claims tribunal, and I welcome that because there is a problem about the cost of tax justice. All too often we have seen where, if there is a dispute between the taxpayer and the taxation auditors, the taxpayer can take it on appeal if he is dissatisfied. Quite often the amounts involved do not warrant the costs and the hassles accompanying such an appeal. Reasonable amounts of money for small businesses or taxpayers can be involved. I believe that the alternative of a small claims tribunal is the appropriate way to go in providing an independent adjudication of such issues.

         Another amendment to which I wish to refer concerns the payment of instalments by companies. When the government reduced the income tax company rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, as part of the trade-off it decided to bring forward the time schedule within which payments had to be made. Initially, in the euphoria of a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate, a lot of people accepted the concept of perhaps having to pay their tax somewhat earlier. But the proposal was more draconian than people had envisaged. The tax rate has now moved up from 33 per cent to 36 per cent and people are caught with these very tight schedules for meeting company tax.

         An instalment taxpayer is liable to pay tax instalments under the new company tax instalment regime in accordance with a table contained in section 221AZK(2). Under the table, the timing of the amounts of the payments differ depending upon whether the instalment taxpayer is classified as small, medium or large. Under subsection (3) of that section of the act the taxpayer's likely tax for the current year is calculated in the first day of month nine. It is possible for a taxpayer to have more than one amount of likely tax on the first day of month nine. This may happen where an estimate is lodged during that day. Accordingly, section 221AZK(3) has been amended to make it clear that an instalment taxpayer will only be classified as at the end of the first day of month nine.

         In the legislation there are provisions in relation to the valuation of livestock involving the cost price of natural increase of livestock. We have amendments to the law which will ensure that the natural increase of livestock, for which no minimum value is prescribed, is valued at its actual cost. Taxpayers can elect to value stock at its actual cost. I acknowedge that the effect of the amendment is to eliminate an inappropriate deferral of tax but, with some new primary production type varieties, if the absorption cost method is used you can have an exceedingly high value placed on your natural increase vis-a-vis other items of traditional livestock for which there are prescribed minimum values such as sheep, horses, goats, and pigs.

         I have had some discussions with officers of the Taxation Office and they assure me that efforts are being made to contact primary producers and their associations at state and national level to try to accommodate such new varieties to expedite the setting of minimum prescribed values. I seek assurances from the minister that arrangements have been made today in terms of meeting the undertaking that the Taxation Office will use its best endeavours to get minimum values applied as expeditiously as possible. This would certainly apply to new varieties such as alpaca and emu. Without that assurance, in the initial years there will be a higher tax payable even though there may be limited sales due to the application of the increases in natural livestock items. We will have the high cost associated with the application of the absorption cost placed on closing stock values and this will enhance the closing stock amount.

         There is an interesting feature in the superannuation guarantee, and this is an area in which I have some interest. The bill extends the present annual superannuation guarantee contribution requirements under the superannuation regime to 1994-95 and later years until the regime is more established. This is somewhat curious because, obviously, where an employer receives an employee contribution it must be remitted within a month. But the employer's responsibilities and obligations can be met only by a once a year payment. I would have thought that perhaps the gestation period would have been well and truly satisfied. From the way that the explanatory memorandum is worded, it appears that it can go for quite a few years yet.

         It is said that there is no cost to revenue, but I notice in other areas where the collection period is being brought forward there is a gain to revenue as a result of the earlier collection of money. In a sense I suppose that is correct because if it has never been collected in advance in the past a decision not to change the method will not result in any change to revenue. With the development of superannuation and its basic acceptance, I think perhaps quarterly instalments would be somewhat more appropriate.

It ensures that there will be a liability for capital gains when an asset is created and held by its creator as the trustee of a discretionary trust.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my concern about the increased tax impositions placed by this government on friendly societies. Friendly societies were established to help the less well off in the community but, as a result of changes in the tax legislation, those societies are being forced to move towards clients which they have not traditionally done a lot of business with in the past.

Perhaps nowadays, with the sophistication of the tax file number system, you might be able to develop a range of tax rates to suit the particular income levels of those members of the community who are not, say, in the top quartile. I am referring here to those members that friendly societies traditionally dealt with, the less well off—those people who sought to form an association to improve their lot in life and to provide for their security.

You can go around to a particular branch of the tax office and apply that ruling which suits you best. In other words, there is not enough liaison within the Taxation Office itself. There does not seem to be an officer who is actually in overall control of these rulings.

One-tonners or more are treated in the same manner throughout the taxation law, irrespective of whether they are derived from passenger motor vehicles. This has been an impediment in the past. Some time ago I brought in a private member's bill drawing attention to the problems associated with that, and the unfair advantage that, say, imported vehicles had at the time over local vehicles. Of course, my private member's bill did not cover the same matters as this legislation but it dealt with the same sorts of issues, including derivatives of passenger vehicles.

         —The Senate is gripped in a frenzy of enthusiasm as it debates the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. When Senator Watson commenced his speech, he referred to the fact that at one time this had been Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). I can verify that. Indeed, on my briefing paper the `5' has been crossed out and `1' has been inserted, and the `1994' has been crossed out and `1995' has been inserted, giving eloquent testimony to the fact, if you like, that this has been around for a long time and was expected to come on a lot earlier but, for one reason or another, it has come on now.

They would certainly have come here had there been disagreement, but it is not likely they would come to express their agreement. So I take it, therefore, there is strong support for these measures in the chamber, and that they will pass.

         Returning to the cost price of natural increase of livestock, can I say that a number of groups which represent breeders of exotic birds and animals have expressed concern about the proposed new basis for valuing natural increases, and that is because there have been no prescribed minimum values for these exotic species. They include things like emus, ostriches, crocodiles and alpacas—I think Senator Watson referred to emus and alpacas—but obviously the list could be longer. At present, the income tax regulations only prescribe minimum values for sheep, cattle, horses and pigs.

         I can advise the Senate that the Australian Taxation Office is undertaking a project to develop minimum values for the natural increase of several exotic species, together with a value for their breeding stock. The Taxation Office is consulting with the various bodies representing breeders of these species who are providing information on these values. The national body representing emu breeders, for example, has worked closely with the ATO in developing a minimum value for emu chicks. I am advised that the ATO and the breeders are happy with this value. The ATO hopes that regulations prescribing these minimum values will be in place early in 1996.

         —The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is a timely attempt to make the anti-syphoning laws in the Broadcasting Services Act more workable. As we know, the anti-syphoning laws were designed to protect free-to-air broadcasts of events which are deemed to have national or cultural significance. The Democrats are strong supporters of the objectives of that legislation. Viewers should not be forced to pay to see major events that they normally see free of charge. Economists would, of course, argue that people do pay for so-called free-to-air broadcasts: our taxes pay for the national broadcasters and our consumer spending funds the advertising revenue which keeps the commercial networks going. But a pay TV subscription comes on top of those existing imposts. It is an additional cost which many Australians either cannot afford or do not want. Because of technical limitations, many Australians cannot receive pay TV broadcasts even if they want to. Free-to-air coverage is far more comprehensive.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Having said that, the Democrats also believe that the present system is flawed and needs to be improved. In trying to describe what is wrong with the present system, it is hard to know where to start. The first problem is that this list is too long. It contains events which are not normally screened in Australia. It is hard to see how an event which has never been screened here can be classified as highly significant to the Australian public. It is particularly hard to understand how Australians can be used to seeing an event free of charge when it has not been shown on our free-to-air networks at all. The fact that some events of this kind are on the list shows how much the government has departed from the original concept. I am not a conspiracy theorist but I can understand why it has been rumoured that this list was basically drawn up by the networks. For example, free-to-air viewers have never seen a test or a one-day cricket series played in India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka, yet they are all on the list. The tour of Pakistan was by all accounts very exciting but was not screened here. Nor was the 1994 Australia-New Zealand Davis Cup match, even though that too was on the list.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This chamber did have the option of trying to make the list more balanced by using our disallowance power. The Democrats considered taking that step at the time. We decided not to proceed because disallowance would have been too blunt an instrument. The list was drafted in such a way that we would have had to strike off many events which actually should be on it. This would have created a vacuum while a new list was drafted and gazetted. The result could have been chaotic and counter-productive, so we dropped that idea at the time. But the fact remains that the list is too generous, and that is one cause of the problems which we are now experiencing.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second problem is that the delisting procedure is too restrictive. It is wide open to legal challenge by a very litigious industry. It does not allow delisting where a commercial network hoards rights by buying them but not showing the events solely to prevent them from being screened on pay TV. In the Democrats' view this bill will help to solve that problem. It provides the minister with a more useable mechanism to amend the list. It proposes a completely discretionary power to add or to delete items from the list, subject to the approval of both houses of parliament. It blocks off the avenues for legal challenge which would otherwise constrain the exercise of that power. Ordinarily, such a wide discretion might be seen as unfair and even dangerous. However, this is a special case. The anti-syphoning provisions give the free-to-air broadcasters special privileges and these should not extend to an open invitation to take the minister to court.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Having said that, it is essential that guidelines be developed to help the minister exercise those powers consistently and transparently. The note in the amending bill gives some guidance on when the minister might exercise power to delist an event. The note does not, however, give any guidance on when events might be added to the list. Guidelines for the minister's listing and delisting an event should be developed as a matter of urgency so that the industry can better understand how the minister will use his powers under the act. For example, I am mystified that the Australia-Pakistan one-day series held in October last year is still on that list, even though it was not bought by any free-to-air broadcaster and the minister has been asked by Australis to delist it. Pay TV subscribers deserve better than to wait 11 months to see an event which the free-to-air networks have shown no interest in whatsoever.

         Channel Nine publicly stated that it was happy to have the 1994 series delisted but not any future series, just in case it decides that it wants to screen them in the future. In other words, Channel Nine sees the list as reserving to it a range of choices which it might take up or, then again, it might not. It hardly needs to be said that this is not what the list is for. The list is not an exclusive smorgasbord for the optional consumption of the free-to-air networks. If the networks are not deadly serious about screening an event then it should not be on that list.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third problem is that the act prevents pay TV licensees from acquiring rights to listed events unless free-to-air networks have bought them first. This puts the networks in a strong position to veto a pay TV broadcast or to extract cheap rights from pay licensees instead of paying full price for them in the first place. This is not just a theoretical concern, as Nine has demonstrated in the West Indies case. The only recourse available to pay licensees is to request that the minister delist the event. But the wheels grind very slowly—far too slowly for that to be any kind of realistic solution.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What this means overall is that if the free-to-air networks do not buy rights to a listed event before it starts, it cannot be shown on pay TV, even if the networks themselves have been unreasonable about it. It does not matter if they were not serious about buying or imposed outrageous conditions; it still cannot be shown by the pay operators. That gives the networks too much leverage. The networks should not have a power of veto over pay broadcasts. If anyone should have that privilege it should be the minister. Given that this bill solves only one of the three problems with the list, I have had an amendment to the anti-syphoning provisions drawn up to make the system operate in a more balanced fashion. The Democrats' amendment would automatically delist an event once it is ended.

         Automatic delisting will not diminish the public's ability to see most major events live on free-to-air television. As the Australian Broadcasting Authority's recent report on the operation of the list shows, most events on the list are already shown on free-to-air services live. While the ABA's broadcast figures are only for Sydney, and only for six months, they show that over three-quarters of the broadcast hours of list events were broadcast live on free-to-air channels. All of the finals of sporting events were shown live and the majority of delayed broadcasts, comprising only about 14 per cent of the broadcast hours of list events, were delayed broadcasts of international events. Therefore, automatic delisting of the event after it is over would not cut into those live broadcasts.

         What automatic delisting will do is allow pay operators to purchase rights to broadcast an event immediately after it is ended, whether or not free-to-air broadcasters have acquired the rights to that event. It will ensure that pay television operators will be able to broadcast events which the free-to-air broadcasters do not want to broadcast or do not want to broadcast in full. Arguments have been made that automatic delisting would reduce the value of free-to-air broadcasters' rights to list events. That argument ignores the fact that the government's stated policy reason for introducing the list was to ensure that the public did not have to pay to see major events that they could see on free-to-air channels. It is not to preserve or to add to the commercial value of free-to-air rights.

         The Democrats are also concerned that the act does not provide an easy and a quick way for pay television operators to find out whether events have been acquired by free-to-air broadcasters and whether the acquisition of highlights of an event amounts to acquisition for the purposes of the list. Acquiring rights to programs can be anything from a handshake over dinner to the signing of complex legal documents, yet the outcome in both cases will determine whether pay operators can or cannot bid for the right to the event. There are also events where free-to-air broadcasters do not want to buy rights to more than program highlights, which may or may not amount to acquiring rights to the event. In both cases pay operators need advice on whether or not rights to the event have been acquired for the purposes of the list.

However, the extent of the ABA's role in advising on acquisitions of rights under the list is not spelled out in the legislation and we would urge the ABA to clarify its powers to advise pay operators as part of its guide.

         The ABC's pay television licensee AIM has the highest Australian content provisions of any pay operator. AIM's Australian content requirements for general programming go from 25 per cent to 35 per cent during the day and peak viewing hours. The news channel's Australian program content went from 40 to 50 per cent. In contrast, the Murdoch/Packer news channel, according to news reports, will be little more than reruns of free to air news bulletins, with Murdoch's BSkyB providing more foreign input. There will be no additional journalists hired in Australia, and there is little promise that the channel will offer anything new in the way of either Australian or overseas news and information. This sorry state of Australian content of news on pay television is possible because the only Australian content requirement put on all pay TV licensees—other than AIM—relates only to Australian drama.

         Back in 1993, the Democrats argued for stronger cross media regulation, which included the satellite pay TV operators as well as the press and commercial broadcasters. Once again, this chamber rejected Democrat proposals to strengthen those cross media rules. Unhappily, the two intervening years have, as a result, seen not the diversity of new players promised by the government, but the same old players acquiring more of our media. We are all familiar with Mr Murdoch's domination of the press. We can add to that his interests in free to air broadcasting, pay television, program production and, indeed, ownership of a studio that produces the product. We are also becoming aware of the linkages between Mr Packer's magazine holdings, his interests in Fairfax press, his control over a free to air commercial network and his involvement in pay television. Last Friday, we were treated to the spectacle of those two media barons combining to create a news channel which, perhaps coincidentally, severely threatened the ABC's pay TV news channel.

         Since the matter came before the parliament in 1992 we have been concerned about the way in which pay television has developed. Given the government's response to many of the developments in pay TV and in telecommunications generally, we do not have a lot of confidence that the government got this matter right initially. Certainly we do not have a lot of confidence that this bill is the complete answer. One of the things I want to do today is go through some of the ways in which the original legislation was flawed and go through some of the problems that are still presented by the amendments before us today.

         Minister Collins had a very poor start in that whole area. I remind the Senate of the basic nature of that start. When the minister was setting up the first licences in pay television, he had a determination before him which he signed without reading. It was for an auctioning system for the pay television channels on satellite. That auctioning system did not require any sort of deposit. This led to a number of collapsing bids, meaning that one series of companies could put in a number of bids.

         What we are considering here today is tied basically into the matters of the anti-siphoning list for pay TV. One would have thought that it is basically a fairly simple and straightforward matter. You do have a list. On the basis of that list, you can tell what events should be on pay TV and what events should be left free to air. Indeed, the minister came out very boldly early in this process and seemed to be saying that he would set up this list and that all these events were going to be available to people who did not want to purchase pay TV rights. We were happy with that initially. But when it hit its very first test, which was the Windies test last year, they ran into trouble. Viewers had to go without or pay for events that they had always viewed for free. Such events included the football code grand final, the Melbourne cup, cricket tests and one-day cricket matches.

         The bill has two principal effects. It removes the reference to live televising. This clarifies the intent of the act but removes the only reference to the quality of the broadcast to be provided by free to air operators. The other effect is to give the Minister for Communications and the Arts complete discretion to vary the anti-siphoning list. This is freedom to list or de-list sport and cultural events at ministerial whim. This could be against the interests of regional Australia particularly, as was mentioned earlier by my colleague, which has little access to pay TV services.

         Let me raise some of the specific questions that the industry—that is, pay and free to air operators—and the public still want answered: free to air operators blocking pay TV access to listed events by dragging out negotiations and then not acquiring the rights until the last minute and free to air broadcasters refusing to acquire rights to a listed event thereby denying pay TV operators the opportunity to get the pay TV rights.

         An example of this situation was the Australia versus Pakistan cricket test and the one day series last October. Free to air networks could buy both free to air and pay TV rights and then hoard the pay TV rights to stymie the other pay TV operators. The New South Wales Rugby League is an example of this with Channel 9 holding the free to air and pay TV rights. Here, uncovered or partially covered matches would be unavailable to pay TV operators and their viewers. The definition of an event is confusing as the free to air operators may televise highlights only and pay TV operators may be prevented from carrying the event at all.

         Another weakness of the current provisions is that there is no objective criteria for the inclusion of an event. Also, there is no objective process for removing an event. Section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 also promised that free to air audiences listening to normal commercial ABC-SBS stations would see the cricket, or whatever, free as always. The legislation still does not ensure this. It simply says that a commercial or national channel has the first right to show it. So one small regional TV station with pay TV connections could buy the free to air rights and show the event to a small free to air audience and then in the major cities and regional towns the events would only be available by pay TV.

         So Minister Lee and this Labor government are facing their worst fears because of the inadequate legislation they have created: the prospect of presiding over a media environment where a paying elite will have privileged access to major Australian sporting and cultural events. On the other hand, the TV anti-siphoning law seems to treat in some circumstances pay TV operators very unfairly. Minister Lee must ensure that this legislative mess is fixed otherwise it will be treated to a similar unedifying spectacle every time subscriptions and free to air networks are both attracted to major sporting events. This legislation fixes some of the problems but it does not fix all the problems.

Just as their share values start to rise, the Labor government is cutting back their pensions. Lately the Meridian Trust units have been steadily increasing in paper value, and so the paper value of the shares is on the rise. Many of these shareholders are pensioners.

         In the 1992 budget, this Labor government put legislation through this House which established that unrealised capital gains on shares would be treated as income for the purposes of assessing the pension. We said that we would review that when in government because it was not to come into effect until 1993. Unfortunately, we were not in government to do that. However, we did the best thing we could in opposition; we moved a number of amendments to try to address the issue. A private members bill went through the Senate which tried to repeal the legislation but still the government would not listen.

         There is not really much choice for these pensioners. Both options—keeping their shares or selling them—make them worse off. The choice of pension reduction can mean the difference between, on the one hand, being able to pay the bills and buy necessities and, on the other hand, having to go without. The other choice is to sell the shares after holding on to them for so long and avoid a pension reduction. These people cannot gain anything from their investment. They cannot even get back to where they were before. As I said, the government is giving these pensioners a rough deal. It is giving a great deal to the people who are buying these units.

Several weeks ago I travelled with a number of parliamentarians from both this parliament and a number of other parliaments to Tahiti, where we objected to the French nuclear testing in Mururoa and Fangataufa. A week or so after that I was invited by the people of East Turkistan in Adelaide to address a rally in Adelaide, because those people were also very concerned about the testing by the Chinese of nuclear weapons on their land. It was interesting in speaking with both the Polynesians and the people from East Turkistan who are in Australia that precisely the same processes of occupation of land, the dilution of the local population by an influx of migrants and the use of that land for purposes which would be intolerable on the home territory were being carried out.

The same thing is happening in East Turkistan. The people of East Turkistan gave me an open letter to Senator Gareth Evans regarding nuclear testing on their original home territory.

         In 1955 China built its first atomic base in Lop Nor and in 1964 they exploded their first atomic device. This led to a dramatic change in the ecology and environment of Eastern Turkistan. All water resources, soil, air, flora and fauna were contaminated and polluted with radioactivity. More than 250,000 East Turkistanis have died from radiation related illnesses, such as liver cancer and skin cancer. Today we can say that there is not a single East Turkistani who has not been affected by radiation. We have witnessed the affect of this radiation in East Turkistan's famous pear and rock melon exports which are now rejected on the world market and are returned to East Turkistan and sold in local markets by the Chinese. After all this devastation, how can one say that Lop Nor is a more stable area than Mururoa Atoll?

         Your comments give the impression that China is justified in its actions because it has not signed the nuclear test moratorium. But regardless of this, China's atomic bomb and its ability to mass destruct is no different to France's—bomb and its ability to mass destruct.

        The methodology provides for costs to be measured for each "mail path" (ie from the point at which a letter enters the network to the point of its delivery). The Australia Post network has 150,000,000 national "mail paths". The CSO costs are calculated from a model which reduces these to a more manageable 350,000 "mail paths". The model provides for the total cost of maintaining the letter service to be distributed over the total number of letters carried on the 350,000 "mail paths". Where the cost per letter on a "mail path" exceeds the revenue it generates, the whole of the "mail path" contributes to the CSO cost.

        (4) Australia Post is keenly aware of its responsibilities regarding fair competition. Its pricing practices recognise fully the cost of each product or service offered to the public. This enables identification of cross subsidies between products and services. In recent years, the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Australian National Audit Office have each examined Australia Post's product costing methods and application thoroughly, and endorse its practices. Australia Post assures me that prices of its complementary products, such as greeting cards, packaging and wrapping paper, are not cross-subsidised by its `reserved' services.

        Results, by product, are closely monitored to ensure there is no cross subsidisation of established products and services. It is possible in the starting phases of a new product or service, eg EDI Post, that positive results are not achieved until target volumes are reached but this outcome never persists for a protracted length of time. In this, Australia Post is no different to any other trading enterprise which introduces a product or service.

        (6) Australia Post performs its functions, as far as practicable, in accordance with sound commercial practice. In doing so, it purchases goods and services from a range of suppliers, on a strict commercial basis. It enjoys no special advantage in the form of exemption from taxes of any sort, or exemption from State or other laws. Similarly, retail complementary products are marketed and retailed on the open market on a truly "competitively neutral" basis.

        (1) and (2) The Government provides a number of different types of pensions, including, for example, age pension and service (age) pension, disability support pension and sole parent pension. The levels of pension and supplementary benefits vary according to the status of the pensioner (ie. whether single, married, or married but living apart due to illness or infirmity). The Department of Social Security releases a guide to Social Security payments on a quarterly basis. The Department of Veterans' Affairs also releases similar information.

        All recipients of taxable pensions face exactly the same income tax rates as other individual taxpayers, including a tax free threshold of $5,400. Recipients of taxable pensions also have access to the pensioner rebate at a level determined by their taxable income. These rebates are a means of providing assistance through the tax system to people who are in the most relative need. The pensioner rebate is available to people who receive either a full-rate or part-rate pension, ensuring that full-rate pensioners (including those who earn non-pension income not in excess of the income test free amount) do not pay tax, and that most part-rate pensioners have a reduced tax liability.

        The Government chose to assist age pensioners with a tax rebate rather than an increase in the tax free threshold because raising the tax threshold would also assist high income earners and those with substantial assets at a significant cost to revenue and encourage the practice of income splitting, which would also add to the cost to the Government.

The rebate levels are calculated annually, following the release of the December quarter CPI figures. For example, the shade-out threshold for a single age pensioner in 1994-95 has been calculated taking into account a basic pension income of $8,380 plus social security income test free non-pension income of $2,340.

Payments of pharmaceutical allowance and telephone allowance are also non-taxable, as are some bereavement payments. Such supplementary payments are tax exempt because the payments are meant to cover specific purposes (rather than being a primary source of income), and the Government intends that the full amounts be made available for such purposes. None of these amounts, however, are included in the calculation of the pensioner rebate or shade-out threshold.

        (3) As noted above, pensioners and non-pensioner retirees face the same tax-free threshold of $5,400. Pensioners receive a pensioner rebate which operates to extinguish tax liability on the pension plus non-pension income up to a specified total amount. In July 1994 Treasury provided the honourable Senator with an estimate of the cost of extending the rebate for age pensioners to non-pensioner retirees. That is, the cost of extending the pensioner rebate to female non-pensioner taxpayers aged 60 years or over and male non-pensioner taxpayers aged 65 years or over, who have income below the level where the pensioner rebate shades out but who do not receive the age pension, was estimated to be in the order of $70 million for the 1993-94 income year. While the cost of such a measure has not been re-estimated, I understand the estimate would not have changed significantly since that time.

        (1)(a) At 3 October 1995 there are 25 joint, select, references and legislation committees supported by the Department of the Senate, comprising 8 references committees, 8 legislation committees, 6 select committees and 3 joint statutory committees. Nine other joint committees on which senators serve are administered by the Department of the House of Representatives.

        (b) The 25 committees administered by the Department of the Senate have 52 current inquiries listed in the Notice Paper. These do not include the statutory monitoring functions of the joint statutory committees (7 ongoing functions), the examination of annual reports by legislation committees or the examination of budget and additional estimates by the legislation committees. Over the financial year 1994-95 these committees, together with other select committees in operation during that year, received 157 references from the Senate, not including estimates and annual reports (Source: Department of the Senate Annual Report 1994-95, pp. 103-104).

        (2) Inquiry costs vary according to the type and duration of an inquiry. References and select committee inquiries cost considerably more than legislation and estimates inquiries, in both staff costs and administrative expenses. The Senate Committee Office Review of Resources, tabled in the Senate on 27 September 1995, estimated that a typical references committee inquiry would cost $15,000 in administrative expenses (advertising, postage, printing and photocopying, consultants, venue hire, staff travel, witness expenses), while a typical legislation inquiry would cost around $2,000. Including staff salaries, which is the largest component of Committee Office costs, and senators' travel allowance in association with committee meetings, the 157 inquiries undertaken during the 1994-95 financial year cost an average of $30,800 each.

        (5) The workload of Senate committees has been steadily growing as committees have become capable of performing any of the functions of the Senate, including its primary legislative function of considering proposed laws, scrutiny of the conduct of public administration and consideration of policy issues. The restructuring of legislative and general purpose standing committees added no new functions to committees but reorganised existing functions into the different structure of references and legislation committees. New functions had been added in 1989 with the referral of annual reports to committees for biannual reporting and the referral of bills to committees, and in 1993 with the introduction of supplementary estimates hearings to replace consideration of the Appropriation Bills in committee of the whole.
