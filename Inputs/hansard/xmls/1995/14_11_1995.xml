         —Order! The committee is considering the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 [No. 2]. When the committee last considered the bill it was considering an amendment moved by Senator Vanstone to clause 31, proposed section 63D, lines 31 to 35, and three amendments moved by Senator Spindler to Senator Vanstone's amendment. The question is that Senator Spindler's amendments be agreed to.

        In moving these amendments, I wish to draw to the attention of the chamber that in subject matter and in direction this amendment is similar to amendments 10 and 11, which I have moved previously. This amendment is intended to provide guidelines for the Director of Court Counselling and for the court when deciding when counselling is contemplated or when parties are to attend a conference that they should consider whether, in all the circumstances related to the parties, this procedure is appropriate. The procedure we are referring to is a primary dispute resolution in preference to court proceedings.

        This amendment provides a court with a power to give directions concerning the conduct of conferences between the parties and family and child counsellors or welfare officers. This will include the power to order that the parties must not come into direct contact during the conference process. This is particularly important because it may reduce the chance of a violent confrontation where the particular case before the court has a history of violence. It is my understanding that the coalition may consider supporting this amendment.

         —There does appear to be some merit in amendment No. 14 moved by Senator Spindler. There may well be occasions when it is not appropriate for certain things to happen and the judge in question may well be aware of that and, presumably, should be able to give those directions. It is not necessarily to be seen as a judge assuming that they have the capacity to stand in the shoes of a counsellor and have all those skills. It is just that the judge may well be aware of certain matters that ought to be taken into account in the conduct of the parties as they proceed. Therefore, amendment 14 may well have some merit in it. I would be interested in the government view as to why it should not accept that amendment.

         —My advice is that Senator Spindler's amendment gives the power to the court to make directions as to the conduct of a conference it orders under the proposed section. The section will allow the court to direct the parties to proceedings affecting children to attend a conference with a family and child counsellor or welfare officer to discuss the care, welfare and development of the child and to try to resolve differences between the parties. Counselling ordered under this section is confidential and a conference ordered under the section must be distinguished from a conference conducted for the purpose of preparing a report under proposed section 62G.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am told this amendment asks the court to make decisions about how the counsellor or welfare officer should conduct that conference. Those decisions are, we believe, most appropriately made by the counsellor or the welfare officer who has the appropriate experience, training and capacity to determine what procedures are most appropriate to assist in successful counselling. We agree that counselling should not require a person who is in fear of another person to come into direct contact with that person. The issue here, however, is who is the appropriate person to make a decision about appropriate procedures. A conference will be ordered under the proposed section only if the court considers that discussion of the care, welfare and development of the child may be of assistance to the parties in reaching agreement. That is unlikely to occur in circumstances where the court considers it is inappropriate that the parties come into direct contact.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We are concerned that the insertion of the provision may well indicate to counsellors that the absence of a direction that the parties do not come into direct contact means that the court considers that a face-to-face conference is appropriate. That is of concern to us. This could, of course, lead to counsellors not feeling able to exercise their professional judgment about the appropriate procedures which could be used and this could lead to parties being placed in situations of risk which would not occur if the judgment was exercised by the person best placed to do so, the counsellor or the welfare officer. There is a concern that in the absence of a court order a counsellor may feel as if there is no impediment to such a meeting. Our concern is based on that.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We would rather leave the discretion totally in the hands of the counsellors, without any indication—direct or indirect—that could lead to a situation where counsellors may feel as if there is a green light when in fact it should be up to their judgment to make a decision.

         —In answer to the concerns that the minister has expressed, it seems to me that it is perfectly in order in normal circumstances for the counsellor to make that decision. We are not making the court's intervention mandatory; we are simply providing the discretion and the power for the court to do so when it is brought to the court's notice that there are circumstances in a particular case where the parties should not be brought face to face. It is simply an additional safeguard that is introduced. I think the committee should think carefully before it decides not to provide that additional safeguard.

That seems to me to confirm my point that, unless this amendment is passed, the court will simply leave it to the counsellor to decide. We are saying that in normal circumstances we are quite happy to do that, but there may be the odd case where the counsellor overlooks or disregards whatever evidence is available about previous violence in that situation, and in that case the court, when its attention is drawn to it, should have the power to make such an order.

        This amendment makes two amendments to part VII of the bill, dealing with children. The first restates the fundamental principle that the welfare of children is the paramount consideration. Presently, this section appears to suggest that parental responsibility is the paramount consideration. Insertion of the object concerning the need to ensure safety from family violence makes the object descriptive of the contents of the part. Part VII includes division 11, referring to family violence. This amendment obviously is directed again at making the objectives of the bill transparent for all parties dealing with the legislation. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

I think we would all agree that to ensure safety from family violence is an absolutely important and essential element of any aspect of family law legislation. As I read the objects of the part `to promote the best interests of children and in particular to ensure that children receive adequate and proper parenting', I would have thought those words, as of necessity, would have meant that if family violence were to occur children would not be receiving adequate and proper parenting.

         All that Senator Spindler is doing is adding an example of a type of behaviour that would indicate that children are not receiving proper parenting. Whilst I agree with that, why don't we also add in protection from child abuse or protection from a father who might gamble away all the income of the family, so that the children do not have to live in poverty, or ensure that the children are properly fed, that the children are properly clothed, or that the children's spiritual needs are met? A whole host of other examples could be raised.

         Whilst I agree with the motive of Senator Spindler in moving the amendment, I think in a way it detracts from child welfare in total because there would be nearly the suggestion that if you want to promote the best interests of the child all you have to ensure is that there is no family violence. Sure, we do not want to see family violence, but I do not think we want to have a specific clause which, in effect, detracts from the generality and the importance of ensuring that a child's welfare in total is looked after. I would be interested to hear Senator Spindler's reason for only picking on family violence as opposed to all the other matters that I have referred to.

Certainly, we have received submissions from diverse women's organisations concerned about the aspects of family violence and concerned that they are not adequately covered in the bill as it stands. It is on that basis that the amendment is put forward.

         We have a particular concern, which we will raise in our own amendments later, that these points need to be made explicit in the legislation rather than to have parts of the bill ignore them, even though the minister has said he believes that they are implied or even stated in other parts. Just to ease the speed of the debate, I will not be rising to each of these amendments. But I would say that we support this amendment and all other amendments that the Democrats are putting.

        Amendment No. 17 provides that parents should be encouraged to reach agreement only where it is appropriate in the circumstances. This recognises that in some situations—for example, as I have said before, where there is a history or a risk of family violence—pressure to reach agreement is unhelpful and in the worst situations could expose one or more of the parties to violence. Amendment No. 18 improves the definition of `family violence' by deleting the unnecessary words: `to protect a person from family violence'. I have been advised that this is advisable because the definition of `family violence' differs between state and Commonwealth law. The amendment will avoid confusion and reduce the chance that the operation will have limited effect.

        In the view of the Democrats, these amendments describe what constitutes parental responsibility more clearly than the bill currently does. To simply state that each separating parent has parental responsibility is not enough. That may only encourage separating parents to assert their right to parental responsibility in ways that may not be in the best interests of the child. Therefore, these amendments set out what types of parental responsibilities there are.

         Section 61B of the bill is deleted and replaced with a definition of parental responsibility which is more descriptive. It provides for day-to-day parental responsibility which comprises all the duties, powers and responsibilities associated with the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child and long-term parental responsibility which deals with the duties, powers and responsibilities associated with the long-term care, welfare and development of the child. Amendment No. 21 provides that, in proposed subsection 61C(3), parental responsibility for the child continues only subject to a court order or any provision in a child agreement or a registered parenting plan.

I do not think it is detailed enough to be limiting, but it does clearly define the day-to-day as against the long-term parental responsibility and it provides that it is obviously subject to court orders and any relevant provisions in a registered child agreement or parenting plan. It leaves the way open for flexibility. I would think that it provides us with a more detailed definition rather than a general statement which could create in the minds of some parents rights which may not be in the best interests of the child.

In one substantive amendment, if I am reading it correctly, Senator Spindler will delete the word `authority' in proposed section 61B. It currently reads in part that parental responsibility in relation to a child means all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authorities which by law parents have in relation to children. If you look up the word `authority', I know it is bit old fashioned, you find it means the right to determine, adjudicate or otherwise settle issues of dispute.

Sure it is not the jackboots-type stuff that Senator Spindler is calling for, but, in order to get rid of some of the disputes that little children have, a degree of authority is required. I think it is appropriate to leave that in the legislation.

        The amendment seeks to ensure that the effect of the Child Support (Assessment) Act is not limited by the provisions of a parenting plan because in clause 31, page 30, line 19, we say that the parenting plan may provide for the maintenance of a child. The Democrats wanted to make sure that the provisions of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 are not limited in any way. Again I understand that the coalition is considering support for that, but I would be interested in hearing the minister's view. If the Child Support (Assessment) Act remains paramount in all cases, this amendment may not be necessary.

         —The government's position is close to your last point, Senator Spindler. Ensuring that parenting plans are not used to circumvent the provisions of the Child Support (Assessment) Act is, we believe, adequately dealt with in the bill. The amendment, for instance, does not take into account subsection 63F(5) which provides that a provision of a parenting plan which deals with child maintenance has no effect if an application for an assessment of child support could be made under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. This ensures that parenting plans cannot be used to limit or vary the operation of the act. So we would maintain that your amendment is unnecessary.

My understanding is that Senator Vanstone has an amendment to which Senator Spindler will move a further amendment. My further understanding is that we have all agreed to accept Senator Vanstone's amendment with Senator Spindler's addendum. I suggest that we accept Senator Vanstone's amendment first and then accept Senator Spindler's amendment. Given the fact that we spoke about this for three hours on another occasion, we do not have to get into a big debate now.

This matter ought to be put on the record. We all know about it because we were party to the discussions, but those people reading
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard

         record shows, that it is appropriate for people to have some legal advice before they enter into an agreement which they want registered in the court—after all, parents of intact families and parents of separated families are entitled to make whatever arrangements they would like to with respect to their children—once they register one of those agreed arrangements and give it the imprimatur of a court, it is then appropriate for them to have at least some legal advice.

         I have a difference of opinion with respect to counsellors. I am not at all sure they are the appropriate people for this situation. I do not think they are badly motivated, but they are not legally trained and they do not have experience in looking at the range of orders that are accepted by the court or what variations someone might be successful in getting. For example, the weaker party—generally speaking, the female—may well need to be advised that, in the experience of the practitioner, she could have more holiday time, every other Christmas or something, with the children. A practitioner who is day after day churning through what we now call custody cases will have much more experience with that than a counsellor.

         We also believe that, if a person has complied or has not been able to comply with the location order over a 12-month period, it is unlikely that they would do so over a longer period. If there is still reason to believe that information may come to them about the child's location, then another order can be obtained. In practice, orders requiring a person to do something over a period longer than 12 months are likely to be ineffective, as the time period is certainly too long for people to remain aware of the importance and the effect of such orders. As I have said, if there is a need for a continuation, then a further order can be obtained. That has a trigger effect of reminding people of the existence of the order after 12 months as opposed to having a longer period of application.

I think the Democrat amendment provides for a court which is seized of sufficient evidence on the facts before it to make an order which could perhaps go longer than 12 months and save people having to come back to court and go through the process again. I understand the minister to have said that after 12 months you get the parties back again and the matter is considered again. I think it is desirable in all cases for there to be finality about matters as much as possible to save the parties having to come back after 12 months. I cannot see any prejudice in the location order staying in force for 12 months or such longer period as the court thinks fit.

        The penalty is both unnecessary and objectionable. The court objects strongly to it and points out that such a sanction is found nowhere else in the Family Law Act. The capacity in which registrars will often deal with this type of information is in the exercise of delegated judicial power, and it is particularly inappropriate that those with such power be liable to a criminal sanction arising out of its exercise. Under the court staff structure, registry managers and not registrars have line responsibility for registry staff and so for the recording and storage of court records. The registrar to whom this sanction would apply consequently has no capacity to direct the secure receipt, storage and handling of the information. Given the sensitive nature of the court's records, it is illogical that there be a criminal sanction in respect to the treatment of one type of information alone.

         I ask you, Senator Vanstone, to maybe reconsider your position, given the all-embracing nature of conduct which would escape from the operation of the law. I wonder whether you would consider, for instance, looking at Senator Chamarette's amendment, which, though not embracing criminal sanctions, does substitute fines for the penalty of imprisonment. That course of action is one that should be attractive to you, given that we are moving in such a way that, when you contemplate both intentional and reckless disclosure of sensitive information without sanction, I think goes a bit far down that route. So I wonder whether you would consider the Senator Chamarette midway option. It is one that the government would be prepared to consider as well.

         No doubt no government can be 100 per cent successful, but the privacy of information held by the government, by government instrumentalities, by courts, is of course vital and has to be protected—particularly, one might say, in these sorts of matters. Before we rush in and say let us lock registrars up, perhaps we can have outlined some examples and what steps have been taken by the government and the court thus far against the flocks and flocks of registrars who, out of ignorance or bad faith, have let the side down.

         —Let us just look at what we are dealing with here. Proposed section 67P(1) deals with information with respect to location orders. Secondly, it covers not just the conduct of registrars. I can read out the relevant section to you. It refers to the conduct of a registrar or conduct of any other person who obtains information, whether directly or indirectly, and whether under this section or otherwise. So we are dealing with a group of people broader than that of registrars. We are dealing with a group of people which includes those who have the information, both legally and illegally, and we are talking essentially here about location orders.

I do not want to take up a free kick but yesterday afternoon we had in this place Senator Crichton-Browne complaining about family law information in his case being leaked.

         So you can accuse us of being quick to try to dump people in prison, but we are talking about information about the location of a child. Information about the location of a child, if it is released in contravention of this act, could very easily place at risk the child or the other parent. So we are talking about extremely sensitive information. To let that through to the keeper without a sanction is something which I do not think this chamber should be into. That is why I suggested that, while you may not like imprisonment, the Chamarette midway option of a fine should be attractive to you.

         I also place on record the fact that the Family Law Council has recommended the imposition of this sort of penalty. I acknowledge that there are provisions under the Public Service Act, but I think what we are trying to do in this legislation is to send a message that we just see it as an administrative type of offence. For instance, the Family Law Council has recommended the imposition of a penalty. In its report in relation to the power of the Family Court to require the provision of information for the recovery of children just a couple of years ago the council endorsed the proposal that a penalty of some $12,000 or two years imprisonment or both be imposed for the unauthorised disclosure of information obtained under the equivalent provision at the time.

         In making its recommendation, the council's report noted acceptance of the proposal by the Family Court of WA, the New South Wales Bar Association and the Privacy Commissioner. Further, in its letter of advice on the operation of the UK Children's Act 1989, the council recommended that amendments to the act in relation to obtaining information should provide for a penalty for unauthorised disclosure. There is a body of opinion that would demand that we do respond with some sort of sanction under this act. That is why I asked you to reconsider particularly the fine as opposed to imprisonment.

My understanding is that the minister is of a mind to support the Greens' amendment, which seeks to remove the penalty and substitute the penalty units, whereas Senator Spindler's amendment, which we are considering now, seeks to remove the penalty altogether. This leads me to wonder whether the Greens have got it wrong because it is so unusual. If there was some argument and support for removing the penalty altogether, I would have to reconsider that. My understanding was that that would be unlikely.

         Therefore, it would be preferable to do what the Greens do routinely on all similar clauses—that is, we do not believe imprisonment should be put in legislation because it fosters the idea that prison is the penalty of first resort rather than of last resort and implies that it operates in some way as a deterrent. We are not opposed to penalties per se, but we are opposed to prison being thrown around and fostering in the minds of the community the feeling that somehow having a prison penalty will make people into law-abiding citizens when we know that to be untrue.

         The point we got to in considering the Democrats' amendment was that the support for it was urged upon us by a member of the judiciary on the basis that it would be an affront to the staff of the court to have any penalties. We do not necessarily agree with that, but we think that to use prison as a penalty is inappropriate and that a fine structure would be preferable. I hope that explains to the opposition where we are coming from. I would not want them to not consider the merits of Senator Spindler's argument, even though we have a slight preference towards ours and we are very pleased to see that the government is indicating some openness to that.

         —Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I suggest to the minister that it is not really the registrar who has the responsibility for registry staff dealing with information, records and so on. The Chief Justice of the Family Court has said that, under the court staff structure, registry managers, and not registrars, have line responsibility for registry staff and the recording and storage of court records. Are we not chasing the wrong person?

We are chasing any person who is in the web of people having that information and who releases it illegally and in a way which is in contravention of section 67. We are not talking only about the registrar; we are talking of the registrar or any other person. If information is provided to the registrar, of course the registrar has some responsibility, but we acknowledge that it is not just the registrar who is an important cog in this network; any other person may be as well. We are not out to get the registrar, but at the same time we do not want legislation that grabs everybody else but excludes the registrar.

        We are really arguing—if there is any argument, and I am not assuming that the opposition has excluded supporting this amendment—that if we argue against having any penalty at all we are really arguing for privilege of officers of the court and saying that there can be no malicious or intentional errors in this regard because the court is such a safe place.

         If there have been breaches and they have been followed up, I would be interested to receive any evidence of them. But I would be very concerned if the opposition felt that if none could be produced we would not need this clause or the penalty that goes with it. In my view, out in the community there is a suspicion and a fear of court proceedings. If people felt that somehow there were no safeguards on the information and that court officers, of whatever capacity, could act with impunity because there were no penalties, whether they did that or not, it would give apparent grounds for that concern in the community.

         For that reason I urge people to support what I believe is a very reasonable amendment. It is removing the penalty of two years imprisonment, which I think could be an affront to the court, because I believe it is using imprisonment in a wrong way. On the other hand, to remove penalties altogether implies that we do not feel that the registrars and the officers within the court who might be associated with the disclosure of information should have any sanctions placed upon them should they breach the trust placed in them. It is a community trust we are talking about and I believe a penalty is worth while, whether it has been pursued in the past or not. Senator Vanstone, I hope you are not saying that you are going to stand back from supporting the amendment until the minister produces the evidence.

In the absence of the evidence, I believe there may be a strong argument to include the penalty, and perhaps raising it in this place may alert people to their responsibilities under the law. Chief Justice Nicholson was the person urging us to do this because he felt it would be an affront to the court staff to imply that anybody would be engaged in that conduct. I am sure he would also want the community to perceive his officers and the officers of the court as being as susceptible to penalties as is anybody in the community; and, as we know very well, penalties of this kind are sprinkled right throughout our legislative system.

         —Rereading 67P(1), it appears as though even a judge could potentially fall foul of this legislation if a judge were to become aware of the contents of a location order and then intentionally or recklessly pass that information on. Undoubtedly, the judge would fit into the description `or by any other person who obtains the information'. Chances are if it applies it ought to apply to everybody equally and judges should not be quarantined from that. I suppose that makes sense.

         What does not make sense to me is that you cannot pass it on to anybody other than somebody who is a registrar of another court, an officer of the court or of another court whose responsibilities or duties include service or execution of process. The assistant to the registrar who might be sitting in court when the location order is made could well become aware of that information. Although he is an officer of the court, I would suggest that person would not necessarily be engaged in service or execution of process on behalf of the court. The typist who in fact would type up the location order would become aware of the information, courtesy of the registrar, but she or he, I would suggest, would not necessarily be involved in the service or execution of process but rather only be involved in the typing up of the order.

         Technically, if the information is passed from the registrar to his associate or assistant in court and that assistant or associate is not engaged in the service or execution of the court orders, the registrar would fall foul of that. There is also the possibility that the person who types up the location order will become aware of that information and because the person typing up the process order is not involved in the service or execution of process by the court that person could also fall foul. I hope I have it absolutely wrong, but I would like to have that explained. Somebody is nodding that I have got it all wrong, so I would like to hear why.

If he really is talking to the point, which is the amendment to change the phrasing of the penalty, I think I do have a point or order. I do not make them very often.

The associate may have had to tell the judge's secretary about that because it was something to do with the listing order or whatever. That is, nonetheless, conveying to another person the names of parties in a Family Court matter. The reason they are not pursued is that it is a part of their duties and a part of the court process.

But you are now trying to change what has happened in the past by a legislative regime and by imposing a criminal sanction. That, therefore, changes what used to be the inherent jurisdiction of the court. If you start fiddling with the common law and have legislative law which impacts on the common law applying to the jurisdiction of the courts, then you have to be aware of the potential consequences of that.

        That is very interesting because in some of the smaller registries around the place, I happen to know—I have done it myself—that information provided to the registrar of a court under a location order has in fact been provided to a judge. If the location order information is provided to a Family Court judge as opposed to a Family Court registrar, then one would assume that this whole regime in 67P would not apply, because that is the trigger for everything that follows—that the information had to be provided to the registrar.

         If you do not have a judicial registrar in a particular registry but just a judge, or if the judicial registrar is off on leave and the judge is dealing with all judicial matters and he or she happens to then deal with a location order, the judge can go off willy-nilly and intentionally and recklessly disclose the information and not fall foul of this regime, whereas if a registrar were to do exactly the same thing under the government proposal they would go to gaol for two years, or under the Greens' proposal they would cop a fine of $12,000.

But I am not won over because I do not see why we should strike out this one, when it applies to what I believe is a place of privilege, but we will not strike it out in the Social Security Act, where I believe it has absolutely no place, and right through a lot of legislation where it is as inappropriate, as Senator Abetz has alluded to.

         Therefore, I believe it should be in there—just from the point of making an equality between the way we deal with people who are in this position of extreme community trust and those people who have to provide information to, for example, the social security department and have equivalent penalties of imprisonment put underneath any breaches of information they provide. I think it is unjust to give such favouritism saying, `But we can trust people who work in the registrar of courts and we cannot trust disabled people to give us correct information about their address.' They, too, have a two-year prison penalty for providing information inaccurately. That is why I am trying to seek equivalence. I would be more than happy to drop all of them.

         I have a question for Senator Abetz. He seems to be arguing for the position against the amendment, which I believe we have support for, so I really do not want to prolong the debate too much. It is a fascinating point. If we remove the penalty altogether, is he still comfortable for the clause to be in there? My concern with his argument is that he does not want even the clause in there and he does not want people to have to obey that clause. If that is the case, then he really should be moving another amendment to delete the entire clause, not speak against the simple change to the penalty for that behaviour. That was why I rose.

         I think he was correct if he was saying that he was discussing it in order to assess the seriousness of the penalty that was needed. But now he seems to be arguing to the point that it is an unrealistic clause to keep in the act altogether. If he is happy for it to go in, I would suggest that he should also be happy that there is some kind of sanction that applies to it because without a sanction it becomes meaningless to include it.

         One of the difficulties with the drafting of the penalty is that it does not appear to contemplate that the Registrar may not personally store the relevant information. It would be unrealistic to make it unlawful for the Registrar to disclose it to officers of the Court whose duties are to assist the Registrar in the storage of such information.

        That was the considered opinion of the total committee.

Now being November 1995 and some eight months down the track, having had this concern noted as of March 1995, with respect, I would have thought the minister might have been able to come in here with a more detailed explanation as to why paragraph 1.62 of our report is so inherently wrong.

        This amendment seeks to make it mandatory on the court to provide separate representation for a child or children where the care, access or visitation rights—whatever the terms now are—of the child or children are in dispute. It is a provision that has been in force in New Zealand for some three years. On a number of occasions previously I have argued for that to be inserted also in the family law of Australia.

         It is based on the simple principle that children are not chattels, and that they should not be treated as chattels. Where two parties are debating what should happen, we cannot always go behind the agreement that is made or behind the evidence that is provided to the court. Very often the interests of the adults, the separating partners, may well not reflect the interests of the child. The partners may make a deal or agreement that suits them. They may trade off financial advantages against factors that affect the welfare of the child or children. While the court has ordered separate representation a lot more frequently since the decision in re Kay, I believe that we should enshrine as a principle that children are entitled to separate representation.

         The matter of costs is very often brought up as an argument. One could simply look at New Zealand and say, `Well, New Zealand hasn't gone broke.' In fact, New Zealand is doing rather better economically than Australia at the moment. So that, I believe, is not an argument. The argument really is: are we prepared to put some financial savings in the running of the Family Court ahead of the interests of the child; or do we say that a child is a person and is entitled to representation so that the child's interests can be impartially assessed and brought to the notice of the court?

         Mr O'Reilly, the child commissioner from New Zealand who was in Australia earlier this year, has stated publicly that it is working well and that he is supporting it totally. It is in line with our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we have signed and ratified. Yet there seems to be a certain reluctance to bite the bullet on this one—and very often it is on the basis of cost, putting dollars ahead of the welfare of the child. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

They have protection, in that the court has a discretionary power to order that representation. The court obviously has a responsibility to exercise that power in the best interests of the child. You are saying that you want the discretion taken away from the court and you want mandatory representation. That is entirely different from saying that you want a principle established that children are entitled to representation. That already is established. The court has got a responsibility to look at the interests of the child and ascertain whether the child needs representation and, if it does, to so order. So it is a bit rich to come in here and present an amendment when all you are doing is seeking to enshrine some principle that is already there.

         Senator Spindler, you cited the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but you stopped there as if to say, `Well, there is this convention and it therefore follows that my amendment ought to be passed.' But it does not automatically follow from that convention that your amendment ought to be passed. That is a disingenuous argument for you to put. It is an argument that does encourage some people, whom I admit are less informed than yourself, into the blind thinking that, because there is a convention on this, anything that someone wants to propose that is vaguely attached to it somehow has to become a law. You are encouraging the argument that the presence of a convention diminishes the responsibility and right of this chamber and other parliaments to decide the best way for Australia to comply with its international responsibilities. A convention is not a magic wand that just somehow falls down and says, `This amendment is okay.' That is not the case at all. The responsibility is with us.

The court has an obligation to look after the interests of the child. It will order separate representation when it is appropriate. There is quite possibly a down side in insisting whenever custody matters go before a court that there always being separate representation for the children. It in-builds the argument that might be going on between the parents. It somehow creates the image that that argument is also between the children when it need not be. I am happy to rely on the court and the court's discretion as to when it is appropriate that the children or the child be separately represented.

         In addressing clause 39, I do not think there is any need for a child to be represented on each and every occasion, no matter what the circumstances. This will say that, even if consenting orders come before the court and even if mum and dad have agreed as to what ought to happen with the children, the children should somehow still be subjected to an unnecessary third party. It is bad enough for children to have to go through counselling and the difficulty of the parental split-up without requiring them to be interviewed by a solicitor, who is usually a complete and utter stranger with whom the children have no relationship, no trust and no shared values. Somebody who is appointed by the court is virtually foisted upon them. Clearly, where there are major disputes between mum and dad, and the children are of an age where they can give expression to their views and wishes, it would be appropriate to possibly have the child separately represented.

         What usually happens, which I think is appropriate, is that, if a matter does blow up to a major battle in the court, the court can order a family report, which is prepared by the court counselling service which interviews family members and, if need be, the extended family. It talks to the children, et cetera, and then provides a report to the court which is then part of the material on which the judge relies to make his or her decision about the future of the children.

In general terms, I think the legal aid commissions around Australia do that relatively well. I cannot see any need for there to be a change. If every case that comes before the court, even consent orders, has to involve a third lawyer I think that will increase the cost of justice and will be of no material benefit at all when we consider the best interests of the child.

         —I follow on from the remarks of Senator Vanstone and Senator Abetz and agree with the comments they have made in relation to Senator Spindler's proposed amendment. I think this would tend to open the floodgates on separate representation for children. Leaving aside applications for principal relief—namely, dissolution of marriage—we find that with ancillary applications the vast majority of cases involve children in one way or another. The vast majority of cases going to trial or involving disputations involve children. If they were to have separate representation there would be a cost problem and a problem which the legal profession itself, I venture to suggest, could not even meet.

         I think that some of the problems one faces with separate representation for children is finding someone who is uniquely suited to represent the child. I note that Senator Spindler has included in his amendment personality, cultural background, training and experience and the fact that they must be suitably qualified. I can tell you that, in my experience with family law, if you applied that test to most family lawyers you would find them failing in one way or other on any one of those discrete grounds. It would be extremely difficult to come up with a lawyer who fitted the bill in all instances as mentioned in the proposal.

         Leaving that aside, my experience with family law has revealed that there are only special instances where children need separate representation. In the vast majority of cases the matter is adequately dealt with by the two parties—that is, the mother and father, husband or wife—being represented. It is only during the course of the proceedings if something arises which indicates child abuse, some aspect of violence or something untoward that the court looks at separate representation.

         In my opinion, the current situation is suitable. I have been appointed to represent children and I can tell you that it is a very difficult task indeed. It is rather unusual you might think to have a practitioner who has no children of his own representing children. That was something which was brought home to me.

         The question of cultural background, training and experience alone offer fantastic scope for questions to be applied in these instances. I once dealt with a family dispute involving a family of ethnic origin. If you had a solicitor of similar background, the rights of the women and the rights of the child would have been very much subjugated because one of the problems with this break-up was the fact that the female child was restricted severely in her freedom. There was one particular case recently which dealt with a father who plotted the murder of his own daughter because she would not accept his demands to abide by the rules of the household which were deep seated in a cultural and ethnic background.

         I think you could run into problems with the personality alone, as Senator Abetz has mentioned. Who is to say that someone has had sufficient training to represent children. I have seen practitioners who I would have thought would have been eminently suited to represent children by their very disposition, but not necessarily because of their training. This does open a Pandora's box.

         I do not think this amendment is needed. I think that children are adequately protected within the framework of family law in this country. I think the courts are sufficiently vigilant in matters which touch on the welfare of children. I understand Senator Spindler's concern and I know that he has expressed on many occasions in this chamber a concern about the rights of children and the welfare of children, but I do not think that this proposal will work. I do not think it has the efficacy to succeed and therefore I oppose it.

         —I will respond to some of the comments that have been made. The arguments put forward by Senator Ellison that the court can handle it adequately rests on the assumption that the court will always know when there is a case that requires separate representation. I am not aware of any provisions which indicate that counsellors must always talk to children. We cannot assume that that will happen.

         My understanding is that, in most cases, the counselling is carried out between the two separating partners rather than with the children. It is therefore rather facile to say that the court can handle it, the court has handled it, the court will know what to do and the court has the discretion. The point is that the court may not know. The system may fail the children and it is simply to ensure that it does not that a representative is suggested.

         It seems to me that Senator Vanstone has got some difficulty with interpreting the term `entitle'. She says children are entitled now. To me entitle means that I have the right to something. Children have not got the right to a representative at the moment. They get a representative when the court decides they should have one. If the court decides they should not have one then they do not get one. That right is not there. It seems to me that entitle means that you have that right, but children do not have that right at the moment. It is mandatory on the court to determine that. It is simply wrong to suggest that children are entitled to that representation. They may get that representation if the court decides that.

         At the same time, I hope we will reach the position where we can guarantee that the child's views and interests will be represented in a dispute before the court. A consent order does not fall into that category, Senator Abetz. But where there is a dispute involving children before the court, at some stage we might have an insight that we possibly have the responsibility to provide someone to ensure that the child's voice is heard. I believe that day should not be too far away and I feel rather sad that the chamber on this occasion is not prepared to take this action.

       <para>
        The amendment seeks to allow somebody to assess whether counselling is appropriate in all the circumstances. It is basically allowing a decision to be made by a counsellor. We believe that the cautionary principle in the provision under which a party to proceedings under the Family Law Act can seek a counselling session for the purposes of discussing child welfare, care and development should be asserted. The bill as it stands makes such a counselling session an absolute right upon application, which concerns me in that it allows for a vindictive party to create a confrontation with an unwilling former spouse.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While we believe that that can be misapplied and this cautionary amendment does not head off the counselling at the point of application, it does place an assessment component between the application and the substantive counselling session. This would allow the counsellor to determine whether counselling is appropriate in the circumstances rather than allowing a right which can then be instituted without the capacity to judge whether it really is in the most appropriate interests of the child at that point. I urge the chamber to support the amendment.

        I have moved the amendments together as a short cut to assist the process of the committee. They are not totally connected. Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 4 are associated with each other and they relate to the practical difficulties that arise when a parent who is providing accommodation moves interstate or overseas. While the Western Australian Family Court has taken this into account, recent case histories from the United Kingdom, where the distances are nothing like those in Western Australia, have made their way into decisions made by the court in other states. It is a trend for the court which stands in the way of the parent providing accommodation living wherever they wish, but it creates a very difficult balancing act between the freedom of parents to live where they choose and the rights of the child to have contact with both parents.

         What we have done in amendment No. 3 is to relate the amendment to a parent as against a person in whose favour a contact order is in place, because it would be too great a limit on the other parent's freedom of movement if the provision extended to other people—for example, grandparents. The list could be endless as contact orders can be made in favour of any person concerned with a child's care, welfare and development.

         At this point, we probably would not need to have my amendment No. 1, but we will need it shortly so I will address it. The amendment incorporates the Convention on the Rights of the Child into the relevant part of the Family Law Act. The convention embodies three important principles: firstly, that children not be discriminated against, ensuring non-discrimination between children and between children and adults; secondly, that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in decision making; and, thirdly, that the choice of the child be heard and given due weight. Who in this chamber would disagree with those principles? I am sure that none of us would.

         The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill will remove the capacity for those principles to be considered within decision making that might be involved in the bill that we are considering for debate today. This amendment is being moved to simply affirm in law what the common law has been saying since 1969: Australian citizens have a legitimate expectation that if Australia becomes party to an international treaty then we will conform to its provisions. Where a decision maker does not act in conformity, they must give notice and provide an opportunity for a person affected to respond.

         The doctrine of legitimate expectation is a very modest principle. It is very hard to fathom why the government wants to stamp it out.

         As the Greens, the coalition and Democrats have pointed out, our treaty process is fundamentally flawed. We may believe this for different reasons. What we need here is a comprehensive approach to the debate and not a piecemeal approach. The opposition, in supporting the government's Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill, is allowing the government to have unbridled capacity or licence to sign international treaties with total impunity. It does not have to take into consideration the principles enshrined in those international treaties. We believe that, while administrators obviously would not be bound or obliged to fulfil those treaties unless they were enshrined in domestic law, they should have some obligation to consider those responsibilities, even if they then decide against them. That is the reason why this amendment is being put in place.

         I would like to read a copy of a letter which has been put out by Defence for Children International—Australia. It underlines the concern which has been expressed and is the reason for the amendment being brought to the chamber. It relates to the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill, the need for such an amendment and for those in the chamber to support it. The letter is to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and states:

        I consider that this Bill, and the executive statement issued by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 10 May, are a betrayal of the promise Australia made to children when it ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and signed the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in 1991. I note that this promise was repeated in commitments made by you in the National Action Plan for Human Rights (1994) and the Report "Our Children, Our Future" (1994).

        The Bill is a disgrace in the eyes of the world community and brings shame on Australia's human rights record. No longer will our representatives at the UN be able to claim that Australia is fully committed to implementing human rights and children's rights in particular.

        The High Court has clearly indicated that Australia's past position on international treaties is untenable. The proper response to this decision is not to nullify it but to develop legislation to implement it constructively and promptly . . .

       <para>
        That underlines the concern of many people in the community who had what is now being exposed as a false sense of security: that Australia's becoming a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child would have some protective function in administrative decision making, not—and I stress `not'—an obligation that it will have a force of law, but simply a legitimate expectation that those factors would be taken into consideration. Amendment No. 1 states:

        "60BA.(1) Unless and until this section is expressly repealed, the fact that Australia is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child gives rise to a legitimate expectation, on the part of any person, that to any extent that this Part does anything less than implement the requirements of the Convention:

       </para>
       <para>
        So it is simply giving a procedural right to people who feel that the spirit of the international treaty, to which Australia is a party, will be honoured in administrative decision making in the Family Law Reform Bill. That is not an unreasonable expectation whatsoever. In fact, I think the government is being utterly unreasonable in foreshadowing that it is not intending to take the natural consequence of its becoming a party to the treaty into account.

I think the vast majority of middle road Australia—when I say `middle road', I think it would be 95-plus per cent of the population—would say that it is appropriate.

Balance between facilitating contact between the child and a non-resident parent and allowing the parent with whom the child lives to manage his or her life has always been difficult.

It would overtly place control over a place of residence of the parent. It would potentially restrain the parent from moving in order to obtain employment, to go on holidays, to visit relatives, et cetera.

Subclause (2) lists various criteria: the wishes of the child, the relationship of the child with each of its parents and the likely effect of the separation, as well as other matters. But none of them specifically addresses the right of the child to have regular contact with either parent.

         It would seem to me that the Greens' amendment (da) addresses this very important point, when it says that the court should be mindful of the practical difficulty that a parent might have in getting access to a child. That is the reciprocal of the right of the child to have regular contact with a parent. Regular contact would imply that the parent and child can get together regularly. Of course, if there is the tyranny of distance—which this country of ours knows only too well—there might be a problem in getting such regular contact. How does the minister reconcile that object in 60B(2)(b), and what is his argument for excluding the Greens' amendment No. 4?

In the three family law inquiries, of which I have been a part, many witnesses told quite horrendous stories about the difficulty that they have experienced in maintaining that contact. Therefore, I am very pleased to express the Democrats' support for amendment No. 3 and for amendment No. 4 as amended.

It did so after consultation with the state governments. At the same time, Senator Abetz does not think children should have a voice in family law proceedings before the Family Court. On the one hand, he says that we should consult children but, on the other hand, he is quite prepared to deny them separate representation which would give them an effective voice in court proceedings.

We should be conscious of that and should try to reduce that in whatever way we can.

         I believe that the Family Law Act 1975 with these amendments adequately sets out a comprehensive regime dealing with the welfare of children and what is considered to be the best interests of children. The people of Australia are sufficiently well served by this legislation without having to resort to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to achieve any further equality, justice or advancement of the welfare of children. As such, we will only complicate matters by referring to a convention which is not drafted with the particularity and clarity of the legislation that we have before us. In general terms, conventions and treaties by their very nature have to be so drafted because they are dealing with many parties coming from many different parts of the world. A good many treaties and conventions are stated in terms of general principle.

        We know the attitude of the Prime Minister to this parliament. We know his attitude to the Senate, which he sees as totally irrelevant except for nuisance value, but we we think that we have responsibilities and one responsibility is that ministers should be here to answer questions. If this was happening occasionally, it would be okay. When Senator Evans was foreign minister early in his career, he was here most of the time and we thought that was the correct and proper process, but in recent months he has hardly ever been here. We are entitled to protest that. He ought to give us an explanation as to why he needs to go tonight and miss yet another sitting period of the parliament.

        —by leave—What the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) is saying would be slightly more credible if the opposition took advantage of my presence here to ask me some questions. The last time we had a little fulmination on this subject was on 16 October, when there was a similar exchange across the table. I sat here for the duration of the following question time. The first question that came to me from the opposition was 55 minutes into question time. It was the only question for that day. Yesterday, in the very week that you are getting so excited about the need for my presence, I sat here for an hour and not one single question was directed towards me; not one. If I am such an indispensable presence for the morale of the opposition or for the information needs of a sadly depleted opposition, they have shown an utter incapacity to demonstrate that need by their performance over recent days.

        I will have been absent from 17 days of parliament this year out of something over 80 sitting days at this stage. I will tell you what they were. For three days in June, I was in Paris for the previously unexpected but absolutely unavoidable delegation made to the French government on the nuclear testing issue. I spent two days in September at the World Economic Forum meeting in Singapore, which was the forerunner for the Asia-Europe meeting next year.

That is a spectacular demonstration of your ignorance, indifference, incompetence and irrelevance to the government of this country, because this was the most important single meeting of the year bringing together business people and government leaders from Europe and Asia. It was highly desirable and necessary for me to be there, and I was.

         Three days in September at the United Nations General Assembly: was that irrelevant? Was that a waste of time? One day of that was devoted in Madrid to a dialogue with the current Chairman of the European Union. Even with your utter indifference to matters Asian, you would at least, I think, acknowledge the continued relevance of that particular dialogue framework being maintained.

In 1993 there were 10 visits too, It is more consonant with the number of parliamentary days I have missed in previous years. There were only two days away last year; there were eight the year before; and seven the year before. It has been more than that this year, but for the reasons that I have described.

Reports indicate that there is a discrepancy of up to $20,000 between the wages of those on individual contracts and award employees. We are aware of claims that the company is actively de-unionising its work force and requiring every worker to sign away his or her rights of collective bargaining in order to achieve a wage increase. We would be concerned if those claims are true. We are concerned that the principles of collective bargaining, which underpin our industrial system, be preserved. We are also concerned that individual contracts not be used to de-unionise or to discriminate against unions members. They are the principles that we are concerned about; they are the issues that we are concerned about in this case.

The industry must develop the commercial tools to manage risk. An acceptance of this by industry is fundamental to its future. In this regard I was pleased to see that the Commonwealth Bank announced yesterday its intention to establish a $330 million credit facility for China to purchase Australian wool. The Commonwealth Bank is already involved in financing the wool trade with China. This is a very welcome initiative, coupled with the predicted falls in wool production to the lowest levels since 1982-83 and industry evidence that I have been given in the last two weeks that wool stocks in Chinese bond stores have now fallen significantly and the fact that Wool International has less than 20,000 bales to sell by the end of this year to meet its fixed disposal schedule. This financing initiative may give some added impetus to the current market.

         I am pleased to say that the Australian agricultural sector in general is now beginning to recover from the drought affected situation of 1994-95. Given the market fundamentals, wool should again take its place in that recovery. My latest advice from ABARE is that net value of farm production is forecast to rise by 81 per cent to $4 billion in 1995-96. This will be the highest level in real terms since the late 1980s. The value of farm exports is forecast to rise by around $1.3 billion to $19 billion in 1995-1996. Again, this is the highest since the late 1980s.

         ABARE expects the most significant improvement in the cropping sector. This season, total winter grain production is forecast to be 27 million tonnes, some 88 per cent up on 1994-95. Wheat production is forecast to rebound to 16.7 million tonnes in 1995-96, 85 per cent higher than the severely drought affected 1994-95 crop. At the same time, importantly, with these significant production improvements, the world prices for grain remain favourable due to falling world grain stocks, which suggest that Australians growers will obtain a good return for this larger crop.

Whether they choose to have a parent at home with their children, particularly when they are little, or whether they choose to have parents in the work force or studying or training, our government policies support them in doing that, particularly through our significant family payments of over $12 billion. Most of those payments go to single income families.

That company is about to proceed with a major recapitalisation of the works to increase the throughput from 950 animals a day to something like 1,200. It is going to involve the expenditure of some millions of dollars by the company.

This meatworks is producing an excellent throughput rate. The relationship between the staff and management is excellent. I met with representatives of the union, representatives of management, and all the AQIS meat inspectors on duty that day and great satisfaction was expressed in that works in Rockhampton.

Where it is provided as some form of limited vocational training, therefore we believe that it is not contrary to the position we have outlined about undergraduate degrees. We have made that very clear. We have made that clear to the universities concerned.

         , and remind you that the government has spent $420 million of taxpayers' money in an attempt to gain improvements in Australia's waterfront productivity. Is the BIE right when it states that in the area of handling of containers Australian productivity has actually stepped backwards while most overseas ports have moved ahead? Is the BIE also correct when it claims that higher loading costs for break bulk reflect the combination of low productivity and relatively high wages in the industry? Judged by productivity improvements, is it not true that the government's waterfront reform process has been a monumental failure and a waste of taxpayers' money? What exactly is the government doing to make the urgent improvements to waterfront productivity which the BIE states are necessary?

         It is important to know that we have a process since the Baume inquiry that requires us through the Therapeutic Goods Authority to accept an application for approval of drugs, and that is usually in confirmation with the European format. But we make it clear that Australia retains the responsibility to do its own assurances by examining the data, and so on. We do not take the approval in other countries for medications without very close appraisal of our own. This is, I think, a very important matter for Australian sovereignty in this area, the reputation we have established, and also to be able to assure people that if it is approved in Australia it has been rigorously examined.

         As for the drugs saquinavir and 3TC, I have some detail here, Senator. The usual time from application for approval until finalisation of approval within the TGA is about 255 days. That is the time that people aim for, but in fact the usual time is about 160 days. In other words, we have speeded up the process, sometimes even to 125 days. Drugs of the sort that you have mentioned that demonstrate potential for effectively treating serious or life threatening conditions indeed take priority through the TGA process and sometimes can be turned around in 125 days.

         I have been advised that the application for 3TC, which was not lodged until late July this year, is likely to be considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee at its first meeting next year, which means the total time for review will be in the order of six to seven months. The application for saquinavir was only lodged with the TGA late last month. Again, it has been under review by the FDA for several months prior to being lodged in Australia. The pharmaceutical benefits branch of the department has been informed that TGA has assigned priority to both 3TC and saquinavir applications so that it can anticipate a speedy referral to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee once it has gone through the TGA and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee process.

That is the concern that I think you are referring to, Senator Spindler. The concerns raised by Mr O'Connor are currently under consideration by the Attorney-General's Department.

There are some pretty basic and fundamental issues which go to the definition of sex discrimination and the relevance of sexual preference within the ICCPR. Once these legal issues have been fully reviewed, the Attorney-General will consider whether these matters should be raised; whether there is legal capacity in fact for the federal government to pursue these matters; and whether these matters do fall within the ambit of the ICCPR. But once these matters have been reviewed, the Attorney-General will raise them with the Victorian Attorney-General, Mrs Wade.

         Their only demur from our position on APEC has been that they think it should be MFN. Maybe you do not, but Mr Fischer advocates that whatever we offer should be on an MFN basis to everybody. That is the only criticism I can remember hearing from the opposition about our position: not that we were proceeding too quickly, but that we were not making our offers comprehensive enough; that we were not proposing that it should be MFN. We were saying, `Perhaps not'—although it is actually our preferred position. But that has been your criticism—not that we were proceeding too quickly. I suppose I should have realised that you would not have the same policy as Mr Fischer, but I was not aware that you were so publicly part of the conspiracy to undermine him.

         Can I deal with the rumour that has been perpetuated by some initially inaccurate reporting of what I said in briefing journalists and which led to a misunderstanding by one industry association, that Australia was going to offer some reduction in the effective rates of tariff at Osaka. Although I am not going to give all the details of what we intend to do—because it is all part of a balanced package that we are seeking to achieve in Osaka and I do not intend to weaken our capacity to get the best outcome by disclosing our hand too early—I can tell you that what we are proposing to do will relate to the bound tariff, that is the bindings that we offer, not the effective rates, and that they will therefore not affect the operative rates of tariff in any area of Australian industry and certainly not even the bound rates in the more sensitive areas.

         As to what the other countries will offer, I have a fairly broad understanding of what is likely and so far it looks encouraging, though it is not for me to announce their offers before they put them on the table in Osaka. I will wait for them to do that. But I think you will see that it is a useful, balanced package which will be a clear indication of progress towards trade liberalisation in the region. Australia will do all right out of it, Senator. You do not need to be concerned about that.

They are quite right. They should be satisfied with it. It will be good, it will be in our interest and it will attract a balanced response from the other 17 members.

        I am not sure whether Senator Evans actually did provide an answer to Senator Parer's question, but I have moved that we take note of the answer anyway. This government is beholden to the ACTU and the trade union movement. That is why the government during question time today failed to refuse to condone the trade unions' defiance of the Industrial Relations Court. If the government wants to tell us that its system of industrial relations in this country is so good—the system that it has implemented—it should have the courage to stand up and say that the decisions of that court ought be abided by by the trade union movement.

         So we had the President of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council announcing on behalf of the Australian Labor Party what Labor would do if it were to win office. That is why the government is unable today to come out and say that it does not condone the behaviour of the trade union movement, that it will call upon the trade union movement to behave in a responsible way.

Well, that is a great surprise to the vast majority of workers in this country, because the trade union movement has never had a heart, has never had a soul and has lost its purpose a long time ago.

         When the workers are given a choice they leave the trade union movement. That is why the Labor Party senators over there are so concerned with our policy of giving workers choice. By giving the workers choice, do you know what we are in fact doing?

         Here the government talks about an $8 a week safety net wage increase. They could deliver that to the workers of this country by simply saying, `We will no longer allow compulsory trade unionism.' But the Labor Party is scared of giving choice to the workers because they know what the workers will do. The workers will leave the trade union movement because they get better deals under enterprise bargaining than they do under the centralised award system. The workers know that. That is why they are moving in that direction.

         Now the Labor Party and the trade union movement are desperately trying to regain the confidence of the workers. That is why they got rid of Martin Ferguson—told him to go into the parliament—to get Jennie George to assist. But I have to say that Jennie George was able to attract only about 200 people to a rally in Western Australia, which is hardly the sort of inspiring confidence that the trade union movement needs. If they want to get the confidence of the workers again, if they want to get support from the workers, I suggest that they make unionism voluntary, stop being henchmen for the ALP and in bed with the ALP and look after the interests of the workers rather than the interests of the ALP.

The position is that, for a number of years now, the CRA company and a number of its subsidiaries have set out on a deliberate course to de-unionise their work sites. They took that action not as a result of any industrial disputation or any problems with the unions but simply because they hate unions. The management of CRA has set out to get rid of trade unions off their sites.

In 1990, one of the subsidiaries of the CRA company, Peak Hill goldmine, negotiated a consent award with the Australian Workers Union for one of its goldmines in New South Wales near Cobar. In fact, its general manager praised that award as being one of the most forward thinking modern awards under the new industrial relations provisions. But within 12 months, what did the CRA subsidiary company do? It went around and convinced its employees, after holding three or four secret ballots with no advice to the union whatsoever, that they should resign from the union. On what basis? They offered them a bribe. The bribe was to give them huge pay increases in return for giving up any right to collective bargaining or any right to unionisation.

That is the sort of attitude you are supporting in this country today by the actions of CRA. There is a group of workers up there who are fighting with the only weapon they have left—that is, their labour—to stand up for a fundamental democratic principle that they will not be discriminated against and that they will not be forced to do the same work but accept $20,000 a year less simply because they want to remain members of a trade union and to be represented by a trade union.

         —Senator Abetz is right—the unions will not let them. Signing the staff agreement will give them between $10,000 and $20,000 a year more than the award will give them. That is fact one. Fact number two is that the company was quite happy to have those people come back to work. There was no problem there. Fact number three is that the company was quite happy to have those people belong to a union. This is not a battle where the company is trying to drive people out of unions. The union official that I spoke to said that the company had made it perfectly clear that the workers were perfectly welcome to remain in a union, should they so desire, with no financial penalty.

         The only issue that was separating the company and the workers the previous weekend was whether the workers had the right to have an advocate represent them in future negotiations with the company. I understand the concern that the workers may have in that regard. If it had not been for the intervention of Mr Pallas perhaps this situation would have been sorted out. Instead, what happened was the ACTU—Senator Murphy's mates and Senator Forshaw's mates; all the vested interests on the other side of the chamber—came in and said, `Brothers, this is a fight for collective bargaining. This is a fight to preserve the integrity of the union movement. This is a fight for what people shed their blood for in South Africa.' That is what Senator Forshaw would have us believe.

We had Senator Forshaw giving us another five minutes of his prejudice, five minutes of his ignorance, and five minutes of his obfuscation. I believe the Australian public deserves far better than Senator Forshaw, far better than Senator Murphy and, indeed, far better than the ALP sitting on the treasury bench.

         I, as the president of the metalworkers union in Queensland for many years, had responsibilities in areas of construction. On many occasions I successfully negotiated  two-year contracts and agreements to ensure that both sides received the advantages of reasonable industrial peace while the contract was in existence.

         Back in the 1960s and the 1970s when the mother lode was found and Weipa first came into existence it was recognised that there was a need to do something about establishing an award. The company at that time was quite happy to sit down and put forward some of its demands as to what should be contained in that document. The unions did likewise. A construction agreement came into being.

         For many years it worked quite well. There were some small disputes as a result of, for instance, 1,000 workers on the job and no doctor being available. A sister had to take care of the workers' health and deal with accidents that might occur. There were really no arguments about wages and conditions. With the commencement of production of aluminium and the beneficiation of the bauxite another award was necessary. That award contained an area which catered for construction workers. For many years there was not much construction work carried out in that area. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of other agreements were negotiated in Queensland in areas such as coalmine construction.

Comalco, which is the company that has now been able to bring into being contract arrangements with individuals of some hundreds, even though they have not done it for everyone, had an award in an area for construction which was miles behind everyone else.

         People said this new idea of individual contracts was trying to take us back 100 years. The Tolpuddle Martyrs back in the 1800s were sent out here because they dared to get together and ask their farmer employers collectively for a wage increase from about tenpence to a shilling a day. They got sent out here for 15 years.

         From that time onwards, from the 1900s, the trade union movement grew and was able to collectively bargain and to put in place arbitrated awards. Now the company sees an opportunity to make an offer of some $20,000 a year to more people if they will make individual agreements. Senator O'Chee talked about talking to the shop steward who represented them. When you make a collective agreement you do it one on one, you do not need a shop steward. All your problems will be attended to by you and by the company. It is an effort to destroy the trade union movement and disadvantage workers.

It is important that we look quite rationally and from a factual point of view at the issue raised in the question. With regard to the Weipa situation and CRA you have to look back at history in my own state where the company CRA sought to implement individual contracts. It did so in a way that I do not think any Australian person, even those on the other side of the chamber, would support.

For three years those workers at that site did not get a wage increase. The company then turned around and offered wage increases of between $8,000 and $13,000 per employee but it did so on the basis that they would sign up on an individual contract, that they would not be a member of a union and that they would basically remove all their rights with regard to any national wage increases that may come on.

         Can I say that essentially this matter ought to be resolved by the Industrial Relations Commission. They have sought to do that and there is a process in place. It is my understanding that if the Industrial Relations Commission makes a finding a certain way, the government may well intervene in the dispute. With regard to compliance with the Industrial Relations Commission's decisions, I have had some personal experience with another company, namely North Broken Hill Peko. I took two cases to the Industrial Relations Commission as the secretary of the timber workers union. I won both those cases against the company fairly and squarely. They were caught with the underpayment of workers whom they had stood down illegally.

We did not have the financial capacity to pursue that claim. To this day, that decision has not been honoured and the company has never paid those workers. It is very clear, in terms of Australian workers, that this is the very reason we have to have an industrial relations system that has fairness and equity in it for all sides.

         What we have here is a law which is being wilfully broken by a rebel union. The government brought in the Industrial Relations Act. The company concerned has complied meticulously with the act; it has not broken the law in any way. It has offered under the act the opportunity for individual work agreements. As a consequence of these individual agreements, it has had increased productivity; it has been able to pay those employees more. The lazy, loafing bully boys in the union movement do not like it. It was quite wrong for Senator Forshaw to get up and say that the company had penalised the workers who did not join the enterprise agreement. That was not true.

         —Madam Deputy President, the interpretation of standing order 190 in the 17 years I have been in this chamber has always been on a very narrow focus that a senator claims to have been misrepresented, and that narrow point is the point for which the senator is granted leave. Leave is always granted but for only that narrow point that the senator has been misrepresented on. It is not a general licence to conduct a four-hour debate or even a 40-minute debate.

It is a good try, Senator, but you would know that is not a circumstance in which leave is normally given.

       A request for leave to make a personal explanation under standing order 190 does not have to be based on a claim to have been misrepresented.

Senators habitually ask for leave under standing order 190 on the basis that they have been misrepresented and the leave is granted on that basis.

         Madam Deputy President, you suggested that we could look at this new standing order 190 and place a literal interpretation on it. I can see an administrative minefield in this chamber if we go through all the standing orders. They have been largely rewritten not once but probably twice or three times in the period I have been a senator. They have been rewritten in light of a reasonable approach by reasonable senators. If we go through this relatively new set of standing orders and apply a literal interpretation to all 210 standing orders we are in for a great deal of confusion and lack of goodwill in this chamber, which is entirely unnecessary.

While there might be some expediency in the government giving Senator Crichton-Browne licence to pursue this matter at the moment, we do not want to open up circumstances where precedents are set and could be used continuously to disrupt the government's program.

         I share some of the concerns that have been expressed, but from our point of view, subject to an understanding of that time limit not being extended—and I accept that it is not an enforceable understanding, but I am prepared to take it on face value at this stage—we would be prepared to give leave, but I do not want to make light of the serious concerns which Senator Hill and Senator MacGibbon, in particular, raised.

         —Firstly, Madam Deputy President, according to Odgers this procedure is usually employed to respond to some misrepresentation of a senator. But, as appears from the literal interpretation of the wording in the standing order and as is the view of Odgers, certainly a senator may be given leave under this standing order to explain matters of a personal nature, but such matters may not be debated. If Senator Crichton-Browne is seeking leave, the leave will be given only in these terms; that is, to explain matters of a personal nature, for a period of five minutes. If he is prepared to acknowledge that is what he is seeking to do, then in the spirit that has been put to us by Senator McMullan, notwithstanding our reservations for obvious reasons, I would agree to that.

         He is straying exactly in the way that Odgers cautions him against, which is that matters may not under this standing order be debated. If he wants to explain a matter of a personal nature, he has been given leave to do so. Under that, he cannot enter into a debate on something that Senator Knowles may or may not have said. There are different times and processes for covering that. He has already indicated that he is not seeking to put the record straight.

         —Today we are debating the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, which is a near duplicate of the private member's bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. We are debating this bill simply because the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, introduced his bill into the House of Representatives. He introduced it because of the total mistrust of the people of Sydney in regard to the actions by this government that has resulted in the problems at Sydney airport.

         The bill highlights the total disaster that is the government's Sydney airport policy. It did it all on its own. The government has ruined the lives of thousands of Sydney residents by closing the east-west runway and concentrating the noise generated by the airport north and south of Kingsford Smith airport. Since that time the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, has come up with a whole range of half thought through policy initiatives in an attempt to reduce the noise generated by the airport. I might say most of them were peripheral and some of them have been plain stupid.

         One in particular was a proposal by the minister for the landing aircraft to have a six degree flight path coming in to land. This was totally rejected not only by the pilots, who refused to accept it on safety grounds, but also by his own Airservices Australia. The minister is so lacking in imagination that he has now resorted to plagiarising a bill drafted by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. Mr Brereton described Mr Howard's bill as a `stunt'—a brave word from a minister who was not prepared even to consider entrenching the curfew in legislation until he was trumped by the Liberal-National coalition.

         The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill would ensure that the curfew could not be altered without adequate consultation and debate. It would also implement a number of minor alterations to the curfew. The Howard bill proposed to make a number of changes to the curfew system. The bill would have forced the Minister for Transport to consult widely before altering the curfew. The reason for this, as I mentioned earlier, is that the thousands and thousands of people of Sydney who have been badly affected do not trust this government any more. In addition, it would have required the minister to table in the parliament any exceptional circumstances dispensations that he or she made.

         The government referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for an advisory report. The whole aim of this, of course, was to take away the thrust of the fact that the bill had been initiated by Mr John Howard. The committee endorsed the bill but proposed a range of representations, some of which appear in this bill introduced by the government.

         The bill is necessary because of the hundreds of thousands of Sydney residents who do not trust this government. They do not trust the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and they do not trust Mr Brereton. They know, claim and believe that they have been lied to and deceived.

         The residents of Sydney were rightly concerned that the minister could alter the curfew regulations without consultation. They feared that the government might decide to alter the curfew arrangements. Who could blame them, when the best response the minister could give to the residents was that `they will have to learn to live with it'. That was his response to the complaints by those people to the north of Kingsford Smith airport. Who could blame them, given the government's sorry history of misleading and deceiving people about the effects that the construction of the third runway and the closure of the cross runway would have on their lives. It is no wonder the battlers of Australia are fed up with this uncaring and arrogant government which has clearly shown that it is out of touch with the vast majority of Australians.

         The deceptions began in 1989 when the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and Mr Keating ducked, weaved and compromised to get the decision through cabinet. It is worth quoting from the autobiography of ex-Senator Graham Richardson, when he said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Only a matter of days before the first Cabinet discussion, Hawke and Keating had given assurances that they were opposed to a third runway and we were entitled to believe them. When Gary Punch and I held a press conference to dispel rumours that the Government would consider building a third runway, we did so after seeking yet another assurance from Hawke. Keating was making the same noises, so we went into these Cabinet discussions feeling pretty confident. But a funny thing happened on the way to the forum, and to this day I have no idea what it was.
       </para>
       <para>
        What happened is that somewhere along the way they all got mugged, and the leader of the group that did the mugging is the current Prime Minister. The
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        , which was on the drip at the time, reported that Mr Keating came up with the idea of closing the east-west runway. His suggestion answered many of the political objections to the runway project, because it meant the noise impact on seats like Barton and St George would be reduced. Of course, it meant sacrificing the people who lived to the north of the airport, but they were dispensable.

         The residents of Sydney were also misled about the runways that would be used once the parallel runway was opened and about the number of people who would be adversely affected by the noise. The environmental impact statement forecast that prevailing winds would mean that the aircraft could take off to the north only 12.8 per cent of the time. During the 11 months since the third runway was opened, it has become clear that the EIS forecast was a gross underestimate. In the first month of the runway's operations, 38.2 per cent of departures were to the north compared with the forecast figure of 12.8 per cent. The government initially blamed unusually strong summer winds, but it has become clear as the seasons have gone past that the 12.8 per cent figure was a gross underestimate. We now have more than double the number of planes taking off to the north than predicted.

It claims over and over again that under the flawed system fewer people are seriously and moderately affected. It claims that this issue is about a handful of voters in Hunters Hill. That is typical of the sort of line being run.

         The vast majority of people who are affected by aircraft noise is not a handful of people in Hunters Hill. It is the battlers who live in suburbs like Leichhardt, Marrickville, Drummoyne, Annandale, Haberfield and so on—the true believers; the Labor heartland. They are the vast majority of people who have been affected. Yet the minister says that the only reason the opposition is complaining is a handful of voters in Hunters Hill. Nothing could be further from the truth. A cursory look at today's crazy flight paths would soon dispel this notion. It is interesting to have a look at the flight paths.

         In recent days I have noticed that a new group has set itself up in parts of Sydney. It has looked at those sorts of figures and has said that they are disturbed that, with the new flight paths that have been introduced by the government, instead of aeroplanes flying over the least populated areas—whether it be to the south or the east—they are now going over some 60 kilometres of suburbs—60 kilometres of built-up Sydney are now being traversed by aircraft noise in Sydney.

         Airservices Australia argues that about 75,000 people are affected by aircraft noise. That figure dramatically underestimates the number of people who are affected. It does not take into account many other areas that are affected by noise, such as Kuring-gai. There are serious flaws in the way that figure was calculated. In fact, no-one who was outside what they call the 20 ANEF contour zone was included. That is where the government has made a major mistake. Evidence put to our committee from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital suggests that there may well be somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 people seriously and moderately affected by this situation.

         The government has continued along this path of deceiving the residents of Sydney by advancing three myths about the east-west runway. The first myth was that the runway was closed on safety grounds. Prior to November 1994 there were two active runways at Sydney: a main north-south runway and a crossing east-west runway. The latter was built in 1954 as the original jet runway. Both were active runways. At that stage, while there were certainly complaints, there was not a major noise problem.

The east-west runway was closed except for exceptional circumstances. This prompted incredible outrage, blockades and demonstrations—led, I might say, by leading Labor figures such as the Mayor of Marrickville, Mr Barry Cotter.

         The reason for the proposal in 1988 was that the MANS committee back in 1982 or 1983 had recommended what is called a narrow spaced runway or a closed spaced runway. The reason why the FAC recommended the medium spaced runway was that the narrow spaced runway produced what is called wake turbulence. In other words, a big jet coming in could cause wake turbulence for a lighter plane coming in behind it. This can cause all sorts of problems, including turning the lighter plane on its side. Not so long ago, even without the east-west runway, an incident happened in the air because of wake turbulence. But the reason for the proposal by the FAC back in 1988 was that with a medium spaced runway we could have better capacity and we would not have the wake turbulence problem.

Last month, one of ex-Senator Graham Richardson's former advisers gave evidence.

         The third myth concerns the capacity implications of reopening the east-west runway. There is considerable argument about the peak capacity of Sydney airport. It depends on the configuration that is used and, of course, the weather. There are many permutations and combinations in using a runway system. The air traffic controllers at Sydney airport are now achieving rates of around 60 movements per hour, which is approximately the same rate they were able to achieve before the east-west runway was closed. The opening of the new control tower and the use of simultaneous approaches will increase the capacity to about 80 movements per hour.

         The government has not been able to decide which line to take on the capacity implications of reopening the east-west runway. The Prime Minister has said that reopening the east-west runway would decrease the capacity of the airport by 35 per cent. One of his ministers said that it would increase the capacity of the airport. In fact, Minister Brereton said that if the sale of airports is delayed, there will be many more planes coming into Sydney. They cannot have it both ways. One of them has to be wrong.

         The assertion that reopening the east-west runway would decrease the capacity of the airport by 35 per cent is clearly wrong.

It is drawn from a hypothetical runway configuration that Airservices submitted simply to show the worst case scenario. The option is not the most efficient way that they put up of using three runways, as Airservices demonstrated later in answers to questions.

The government has already introduced measures to further restrict movements by larger freight aircraft, to phase out movements by noisier aircraft and to tighten dispensations from the curfew. For instance, in the first six months of 1994 there were an average of around 25 dispensations a month. In 1995, there are now only three dispensations a month.

This means, for example, that we will not have clever freight operators running Hercules aircraft in and out of Sydney throughout the night, which I understand has actually been floated as one way of getting around the curfew and producing a situation of noisier aircraft operating into and out of Mascot.

There will be wider community input into the guidelines for assessing applications for dispensations from the curfew. On weekends, shoulder curfew operations—that is, between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. and midnight—must be over Botany Bay, weather and traffic density permitting.

        John Howard and other members of the opposition knew that when the final decision was made to construct the third runway—quite clearly a decision not popular with many members of the Labor government at the time but nevertheless made—that decision also involved the downgrading of the east-west runway. It was clear. It was in black and white in the statements made by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Minister for Transport, Ralph Willis. Opposition members knew that was to be the case. They knew that once the third runway was in operation the system of intersecting runways, with or without Simops, would effectively be abandoned in favour of the safer and quicker operation of parallel runways. John Howard acknowledged that in evidence to the Senate committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. He did that on 25 July.

These changes are, in fact, a long time overdue. It has been clear for some time now that the new third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has resulted in quite intolerable levels of noise and general distress to thousands of residents of Sydney whose homes are in noise affected suburbs. The fact that the government has taken this long to respond with this type of legislation does not reflect well on its ability to respond to community concerns. It is no wonder that the suggestion has been made that the motivation behind this legislation has much more to do with the forthcoming federal election and the government's belief that it could well suffer an electoral backlash unless legislation such as this is passed.

If the proper processes had taken place, then some of the current problems at Sydney airport could well have been prevented.

He has found this recently in the Flight Transport Associates report, which he has made so much of. He now declares that this means that his option of re-opening the east-west runway is safe. Let us look at what that report was based on. The report was prepared in 1989. It was a theoretical computer model exercise of capacity options at the airport. It did not represent a detailed analysis of operational safety issues. The report said:

        So even there you can find that there is no real support for the proposition that the other side are putting up. So where do we go with this? What is the real result if you are going to bring back the east-west runway to full operation? The first thing you will have to do is reduce capacity. It is impossible to land the same number of planes at the airport as is currently available under two parallel runways. If you are going to reduce capacity, who will be the first to suffer? It will be the residents of regional New South Wales. The only way you would possibly be able to do it would be to consolidate the flights going into Kingsford Smith on a hub and spoke basis.

         Let me give some sort of indication of the ramifications which would be the inevitable consequence of opening up the east-west runway. If you, for instance, were in Dubbo and you wanted to fly direct to Sydney it would take you about 55 minutes and the current cost would be about $338. However, if you had to hub through Orange to consolidate the number of passengers going in, the flight time would go up to an hour and 55 minutes and the total cost would be $436. Another example would be Albury. If you fly direct from Albury to Sydney it currently takes about an hour and 10 minutes and costs $432. If you were hubbed through Canberra to consolidate the number of passengers into bigger planes you would be looking at two hours and 15 minutes and a cost of $528. I could give other examples.

Obviously he has a lot to hide, and that means a lot to lose. The then Treasurer, the man who frequently told the media how he had to push his Labor colleagues into adopting those policy decisions, stampeded his cabinet colleagues in 1989—and we have heard from Senator Forshaw exactly how that happened—into approving the third runway and reversing plans to direct most take-offs and landings over water. That plan had initially been intended to substantially reduce the problem of airport noise for many thousands of people in suburbs all around the airport and its approaches.

Each of these mates hold seats, state or federal, which had been affected by noise from the east-west runway and, what a surprise, suffered no adverse reaction from their constituents when that noise was suddenly removed to other areas north and south of the airport.

He says it is impossible to operate safely the east-west runway in conjunction with the north-south parallel runways. This is drivel. Numbers of leading airports around the world happily operate intersecting runways without any problem whatsoever. There is, of course, a theoretical risk of collisions with crossovers. But it clearly can be very easily managed if effective operational measures are put in place and has been managed for something like 40 years.

Again, a reliable guide that the government's recent claims are based on political, and not genuine, safety concerns. Expert witness after expert witness before the Senate inquiry, including: the Australian International Pilots Association; the regional airlines; the air traffic controllers union, the Civil Air Operations Officers Association; and numerous pilots, who must know what they are talking about, say there are no grounds for concern if the east-west runway is reopened.

         As we heard previously from Senator Forshaw, in the first six months of 1994 there were 25 breaches a month. That is how useless the curfew was. It is only exposure of the issue by John Howard which has raised an awareness which has led to a fall in that number of breaches. The fact is that more and more airlines were flouting the system. The government's response was to endorse more and more breaches of the rules. It has taken the opposition to force the government into taking this much belated action to enshrine the curfew into legislation, and we are happy to take the credit for that.

         —I rise to support the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill. It is important, when considering the bill, to look at the recent history of the matter and in particular the coalition's position in relation to the operation of the airport. The airport operated adequately and met demands without a large amount of conflict with the surrounding area up until the 1960s. In the 1970s, the concept of the construction of a third runway was hatched. It was given considerable momentum by the Major Airport Needs of Sydney Committee—otherwise known as the MANS committee—which resulted in a joint study which was conducted by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments in 1977. This process went a bit astray and as a result a final report was never tabled, but a dissenting Commonwealth report was produced and tabled by members of the Fraser government in 1979. The report said:

        In October 1982, the coalition Minister for Aviation, Wal Fife, announced the construction of the new runway. Unfortunately for the minister, in the following March he and all his fellow ministers were removed from their portfolios, having lost the election.

         In 1988, a joint Commonwealth-New South Wales task force on the airport needs of the Sydney basin found that a need existed for a third runway at Sydney airport and also a second airport at Badgerys Creek. The task force found that both these were required to accommodate Sydney's growing air traffic. In 1988, the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure also considered the future construction of the third runway. Senator Warwick Parer, the current chair of the airport noise inquiry, said that the construction of a third runway should have started immediately. He issued a minority report to support his view and said:

        In the following year, 1989, the government decided to construct a third runway together with the commencement of the second airport at Badgerys Creek. This decision received considerable support from the then Premier, Nick Greiner, who has since been swept from his position. He said:

        In 1991, Mr Greiner went on to say, in reference to the third runway, that it was the single most important project in Australia. The now Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, in 1989, when commenting on the third runway, said:

        On 4 November 1994, the runway was completed six months ahead of schedule and $30 million under budget. For a considerable number of years the curfew has existed at Sydney airport preventing take-offs and landings between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. each night. This is aimed at reducing the noise effects on the surrounding residents during the time that they are generally resting. It was a result of the awareness and sensitivity of the government to the adverse effect that airport noise can have on the surrounding community and an attempt to limit the effect.

         By the late 1980s, Kingsford-Smith was having difficulty meeting the demands placed on it, particularly as it was still limited by the use of intercepting runways. In 1988, shoulder periods were introduced to the curfew. The shoulder periods allowed for a limited amount of international aircraft movements between the hours of 11 p.m. and midnight and 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.

         It was to meet the overwhelming demand on the use of the airport by both international flights and domestic and country movements. About 17 million passengers were passing through Kingsford-Smith airport each year and the airport just could not cope. In fact, the log jams were getting so bad that, according to the industry at the time, delays and flight cancellations were costing an estimated $40 million. The shoulder periods were trying to cope with this problem by slightly increasing the capacity of the airport. It is these shoulder periods that this bill largely deals with.

         This bill sets in place safeguards necessary to ensure that the curfew periods and the shoulder periods of an hour on each side are not abused by the airlines which have flights coming in at the time. The purpose of the bill is to control, as far as possible, aircraft operations during that period. It does so in several ways. International take-offs and landings—generally the loudest—between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m. have been reduced from the 42 per week presently operating to 35. International take-offs and landings between 11.00 p.m. and midnight will be held at their present level of 14 per week and no increase will be allowed.

         In keeping with the Morris committee's proposed phase-out of curfew flights, the bill allows the following lower operations to be introduced. Operations of British Aerospace flight services will be set at 65 per week until the week ending 5 May 1996. After this date, operations increase to 74 per week but will be offset by a decrease in the operations of DC9 aircraft. Certain propeller driven aircraft and jet aircraft under 34,000 kilograms will be permitted to operate during curfew hours provided that they meet strict international noise standards. In fact, the level of noise that they will be producing will be equivalent to that of a family car.

         Reverse thrust restrictions will be placed on the operators of aircraft, requiring them not to plan to land at Sydney airport during the curfew period if greater than idle thrust will be required.

         These measures will go a long way towards reducing noise during the curfew operations at Sydney airport, even in the shoulder period. The bill also provides a platform wherein operations can be reduced in the future. Such freight service movements as are allowed can be phased out under this legislation. The bill further provides for accountability for operators during the curfew period to both the parliament and the public at large.

         I would like to deal with the amendments proposed by Senator Parer on behalf of the coalition and Senator Bourne on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The amendment proposed by the opposition calls on the minister to increase the use of the east-west runway. I want to emphasise a couple of things in relation to that. The east-west runway is not completely closed, as I am sure most of the people in the chamber appreciate. I realise that many members of the general public would not appreciate this fact. The runway is still used when conditions make it unsafe to use the parallel runways.

       <para>
        I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition believes that this applies to the devastating and extraordinary burden that this amendment will place on the rural people of Australia. Airservices Australia is responsible for the management of air movements and has indicated that the normal use of the east-west runway for full jet operations will reduce airport capacity by 35 per cent. This would require a reduction in aircraft operations at Sydney airport. It will have much the same effect as the amendment proposed by Senator Bourne.

         As a consequence, a number of country commuter services will be forced to be reduced. Larger planes will be leaving fewer centres less often and will cost more and take longer. If I were a member of the National Party I would be very concerned about this matter. Services from small centres that now fly conveniently and more cheaply directly to Sydney will have to fly to larger regional centres, change planes and then fly on to Sydney, or possibly even on to some bigger centre and then again change planes and go on to Sydney.

         The process which I said had been misunderstood in the earlier Senate debate is known as hubbing. This hubbing will provide rural and regional commuters with an inadequate and expensive service. For example, at the moment to travel directly from Port Macquarie to Sydney takes 55 minutes and costs $348; hubbing through Newcastle on, say, Eastern Airlines for the same trip would take one hour and 50 minutes and would cost $470. At the moment to travel directly from Albury to Sydney takes 70 minutes and costs $432; hubbing through Canberra on Kendall Airlines would take two hours and 15 minutes and would cost $528. The opposition's complete reopening of the east-west runway would place a tremendous burden on the country people of New South Wales.

         The other major problem with the increased usage of the east-west runway, which has been referred to by previous speakers in the government, is the safety risk it poses to air passengers and surrounding residents of the airport who may be affected by fallout from a collision. BASI, which was charged with the auditing of air safety, said at a hearing of the aircraft noise committee held last week that `parallel runways are inherently safer than intersecting runways'. It is blatantly obvious to Australians that operations which have planes taking off and landing crossing the paths of other planes taking off and landing are less safe than operations involving planes that take off and land parallel to one another.

         There has been some argument that planes operating on parallel runways cross paths when in the air. This may be true in a purely token sense but, as was pointed out by Airservices, there is virtually a 1,000-metre division between those planes. There is a general argument that crossing runways are less safe. Even Senator Parer's coalition partners know it. The Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said on 13 August 1991:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity with Mascot now operating at near maximum capacity and air traffic controllers bending over backwards to extract maximum efficiency of the present archaic runway set up.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was referring to the crossing runway, of which I am sure everyone is aware. The risk is further highlighted by giving consideration to the number of times crossings would occur if the east-west runway was further utilised. In a recent brief to the minister, Rob Brattner from the Civil Aviation Authority said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A large number of aircraft would need to cross the east-west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runway or in taxiing to the terminals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out miss approaches could not readily be accommodated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Any way you strike it in terms of throughput or in terms of safety, the parallel runway is the way to go. In 1981 an accident almost occurred on the intersecting runways. We have to be grateful that it did not. If it was not for the quick thinking of the pilot of an Ansett jet, who pulled up before colliding with a Thai airline plane, there would have been potentially 1,000 deaths arising from that accident. That is not a risk I am prepared to take, and I do not think the majority of the Australian community is prepared to take it either. I urge the Senate to reject the amendments of both Senator Parer and Senator Bourne.

Kingsford-Smith airport, the international gateway to this country, is the centre of a political shambles that we are all very well aware of. It is a shambles because of gross political bungling by the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton. Labor has cost Australian business millions of dollars in delays and will cost taxpayers at least $260 million in noise remediation works and cost thousands of residents their quality of life.

         The government's incompetence over the whole affair is made clear by its haste to open the third runway. It was opened before the close ground separation radar was working. It was opened before the new control tower was opened. The new control tower is not open yet. At the end of the day, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) engineered the crisis that we are facing today.

        The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating that killed that idea, too, and ensured that all planes operated on the north-south axis.

        I take this opportunity to say something about the noise assessment process, of which there has been much criticism. The noise impact assessment in the EIS was done by using the Australian standard known as the Australian noise enforcement forecast. It is commonly called the ANEF. Airservices Australia, formerly the CAA, says that the forecast on noise contours is accurate. However, many more people feel affected than was expected. It seems to me that is a flawed method of assessment.

         It appears that the ANEF is designed as a land use planning tool. Up to 20 ANEF is regarded as standard urban noise. Many people who are subject to 20 ANEF feel that it is much more than standard urban noise. Many Sydney residents felt that as they were outside the 20 ANEF contour they would be all right.

         The original EIS said that there would be only 82,000 residents inside the 15 ANEF. In other words, it was calculated that with the virtual closure of the east-west runway the number affected would be reduced from 130,000 to 82,000. However, 300,000 people believe they are affected, many seriously, and were, therefore, misinformed.

         I acknowledge the difficulty of estimating the impact of noise. Even at an ANEF of 10, 20 per cent of residents would be affected, and 25 per cent of those would feel seriously affected. It is the constancy of noise along the flight paths, not just the lack of veracity in the assessment process, that has caused the outcry. As I said, 5,000 submissions cannot all be wrong.

         There are some lessons and solutions from this shambles. We must, as a community, find better ways of consulting within the community on these sorts of major decisions. For the development of Sydney south-west airport we must develop additional information on noise or history will be repeated. I acknowledge that when Sydney south-west airport is open we will have quieter aircraft, but the problem of noise is not going to go away, especially with people who quite legitimately expect to have a cleaner and better environment in which to live.

         We support the noise curfew bill with the amendment to reopen the east-west runway. We believe that Airservices Australia should be given the ability to reopen the third runway for normal operations, bearing in mind safety, capacity and noise. I think that if those three requirements of safety, capacity and noise are met, there is no reason—this is supported by the experts that I called on earlier—why the east-west runway should not be reopened. Airservices Australia in their evidence to us agree that they operate to government instruction—and one would not expect them to do anything else, as that is obviously the role that they have—but I believe that the government policy should be changed without prejudicing safety, and it should be done to share the noise load.

         I would just like to finish by pointing out the obvious—the importance of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in its unique position for a major airport in a major city and as a gateway to Australia; what an important part aviation has played in the development of this very vast continent; and what an important part KSA has played in that. I think that that should remain.

         I would also like to make the point that it is absolutely vital for regional airlines and country people doing business in Sydney to have access to KSA because, if they were forced to go anywhere else—to Sydney south-west, for instance—the cost of coming down for a day's business would be made much greater by the necessity probably to stay overnight. That is something that regional New South Wales does not need—now or at any stage. I just make the point that the question is: why can't aircraft operate east of the airport during the middle of the day when there are very few traffic movements? Regional airlines use propjet aircraft, which are much quieter anyway.

         —On behalf of the Greens (WA), I would like to place on the record some concerns and some ideas on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill. We agree with the bill in terms of being able to vote for it; in fact, it puts current regulation in a regulatory framework. However, the timing of it is perhaps either unfortunate or opportune. The timing is unfortunate because there is still a committee dealing with the noise issues at Sydney airport and some of the amendments that we are being asked to consider on this bill are outcomes or responses to the committee's deliberations. It would be extremely useful for us to have those deliberations as a basis for making decisions.

         The fact that there will be no huge changes as a result of the bill, because it largely establishes a regulatory framework anyway—it simply confirms the status quo—would not necessarily make much difference to the way things are now operating at Sydney.

         I am reminded of the process in Perth when city feeder roads got jammed at peak times. The response from a series of governments has been to widen the roads to enable those roads to take more traffic and faster. Another response has been to provide more parking space. The only response, of course, to that has been to increase road traffic and to end up with another traffic jam. Perth has the highest per capita parking space of any major city in Australia. So in that sense, people increased demand instead of thinking more laterally about alternatives to road transport.

         Here we have seen a similar situation with air transport: an increased demand in the use of Sydney airport caused partly by airline decisions to duplicate schedules and by a lack of viable, attractive alternatives. Some of those alternatives could be a properly planned, very fast train from Sydney to major points where Sydney traffic is in demand, and a much greater concentration and availability of video conferencing for all those kinds of one-day trips from Sydney to Canberra or from Sydney to Melbourne.

         The whole atmosphere that has now been created by the opposition—and here it is in front of us in terms of reopening the east-west runway, which I might add has never been closed and is not closed as we speak; and I will talk about that in a minute—is that somehow or other this was an unforeseen consequence when in fact the whole thing was predicated from day one on traffic to the north and south and less traffic to the east and west. That was always going to be the case. Now the opposition, on the road to Damascus and with a sniff of polling day in front of it, wants to more equitably share the distribution of the noise around Sydney airport.

The Leader of the Opposition has been much quoted in terms of the full-blooded support he gave for the construction of the third runway. I will not go over all those quotes again, and the absolutely dismissive position that he took on concerns about noise. That is an accurate description of all the comments he made. I will not read them out again; it is all there on the public record. I can add to that, and I want to add to that, the non-stop representations I received as the minister who was oversighting the progress of the EIS and the actual construction from opposition senators and members for the construction of this runway as soon as possible.

I recall Senator Margetts very well, and not only the full-blooded support for the opening of the east-west runway but the active consideration on a number of occasions by the opposition of the removal of the curfew at Sydney airport. That is how far they wanted to go.

I will explain why in a minute. They are saying: `Let us forget about the days when we supported the construction of the third runway and let us forget about the days when we were lobbying the government for the removal of the curfew at Sydney airport and for 24-hour-a-day operations at Sydney'—not just the conservatives here in the federal parliament but their colleagues in the state parliament of New South Wales.

I was not joking, Senator Parer, when I said that I had constructed in my mind the potential royal commission that might be held into the first major accident at Sydney airport for whatever reason. The nature of hindsight and royal commissions is that it would not matter what the circumstances were about that accident if that accident occurred, for any reason, as a result of simultaneous operations at Sydney airport. I was the minister when this much talked about incident occurred at Sydney airport and I have never forgotten that day. In 1991 there weren't parallel runways at Sydney airport.

         If you want to rewrite history when that statement was made, what I have said consistently is, `Yes, you can operate intersecting runways safely but parallel runways are inherently safer.' I have always said that. The reason I have said it is on the basis of advice that I received then and have received now—it is consistent advice—from people who know far more about it than I do, the people in charge of actual air safety and air regulation at Sydney airport and air traffic control and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, an organisation for whose professionalism and expertise I have very high regard.

Have a look at it. I will tell what you BASI said to me consistently about simultaneous operations.

That is what they said. This is what the opposition has said. Have a listen, Senator Macdonald; you have not read the report, and I know it. I was astonished to see a press statement put out by John Howard, grabbing at this particular straw that went floating past, by saying that the US consultants Flight Transportation Associates report advocated the use of the three runways. I immediately got on to the Department of Transport and said, `Surely, this couldn't be the same report that was done in 1989. There must be another one,' but they said, `No, it's the same report.'

         Here is the real situation with that report. The report was prepared in 1989—this is what John Howard is relying on—as a theoretical computer modelling exercise of capacity options at the airport. It does not represent a detailed analysis of operational or safety issues. The introduction to this report states:

Additionally, to achieve the high movement rates comparable to what can be achieved under a parallel runway system the modelling assumes that the terminal location at Sydney airport is actually between the two parallel runways—which, of course, it is not—and south of the east-west runway. It also envisages rapid exit taxiways off the east-west runway giving direct access to the terminal apron. This is necessary to enable all three runways to operate at the same time. Clearly, this is impractical.

         All of the scenarios modelled in the report involved the use of cross runways that rely on simultaneous operations. I might add one thing that this report does do, as you know, Senator Parer. In respect of capacity at the airport, the FTA report agrees with all of the experts the coalition has chosen to ignore, such as Airservices Australia, CASA, BASI, Department of Transport, Qantas and Ansett, that all of the crossing runway scenarios developed deliver less capacity than the independent use of the parallel runway system—all except the proposal that the airlines want to pursue of propeller aircraft off the eastern stub.

         In fact the report indicates that operations as currently being undertaken at Sydney airport provide significantly greater capacity than any cross-runway configuration.

We were about three seconds away from collision. Of course, we were only saved from it by the professionalism of that Ansett pilot that aborted his landing.

        The reason that crossing runways tend to be the norm at most of the older airports is that they date back from the days when aircraft had to take off into wind directly. As aircraft performance has improved, they are able to tolerate a greater cross-wind component, so the need for that very specific directional element of the airports is no longer there.

        which have been designed in recent years, they have virtually all gone for parallel runway configurations, the reason being that it removes the necessity for aircraft to either approach each other on converging or intersecting runways.

If you expect this parliament and this Senate to go against formal advice on the record from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in Australia that we should not go back to these intersecting runways and simultaneous operations, then you are really sticking your necks right out the window if you put yourselves in place of the air traffic control regime at Sydney airport and the investigatory body that advises it and the government on the most safe procedures to operate at Sydney airport.

         Sure you can operate it safely at a lower frequency, but that is not so if you are going to operate it at 80 movements an hour with intersecting runways. The real problem—and go and talk to them, Senator Macdonald—occurs if something goes wrong. If aircraft have to abort landings, and they do from time to time, those intersecting paths in the air as well as on the ground make it far more difficult—this has been given in evidence to your committee, Senator Parer—for the pilots and the air traffic controllers.

Why the Australian taxpayer should be required to meet costs of that nature is a question that most Australian taxpayers would be asking very seriously. I am sure we are going to hear more about that as time goes on, particularly as the consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) takes place in the days and weeks ahead.

         The other item that I draw attention to is an application for funds for the Department of Defence to meet an operating subsidy for those parts of Aerospace Technologies of Australia which were not sold to Rockwell Systems Australia, RSA, when that company bought out ASTA earlier this year. There were certain parts they did not want. I think they got what they did get virtually for nothing because they said they would take them only on a debt-free basis. But there were certain operating activities that continued in the government's hands and they are requiring extraordinarily large government subsidies just to keep them afloat.

         The August Advance to the Minister for Finance statement detailed two separate payments—one of about $1 1/2 million and the other in the order of $2 million—and that is going to go on and on. We will find that in the September and subsequent applications as well. This is a classic example of a government not being able to get its act together in the operation of businesses. More importantly, what it has done has been to get rid of some assets for free and to leave the others at great operating cost to the taxpayer.

         Let me point out again to the Senate that on 18 August, and again on 1 September, the delegate of the Minister for Finance approved Advances from the Minister for Finance—firstly, an amount of $1.56 million and, secondly, an amount of $1.1 million—to cover the operating costs of this business for four weeks, for just two fortnights ending 4 and 19 September respectively. Since then, the company has advised that, based on fortnightly cash flow projections, there were insufficient funds to meet operating expenses for the next fortnightly period—that is, the one ending 3 October—and on that basis there was a requirement for additional funding of another $1.5 million. It goes on to say in the accompanying documentation:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additional applications will be made as required based on fortnightly cash flow up to 31 October 1995 to meet ongoing operating costs comprising payments to creditors, group tax and salary payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Beyond 31 October it is not certain by any means that there will not be an ongoing requirement. In other words, an extraordinarily large amount of taxpayers' funds is required to meet these operating subsidies. As I said, an amount of something like $2 1/2 million or more each month is required for this process. I do not know how much attention has been given to that by the parliament. It was something that was announced by the government after the 1995-96 budget was released. The decision to do this was made in July. To my knowledge, it has escaped any detailed scrutiny by the parliament. I hope that the estimates processes that we are going through at the moment will allow at least some consideration of this. It is yet another example of how this government can take decisions outside the normal processes of government which lead to a very expensive use of taxpayers' money often without the sufficient scrutiny that the taxpayers of Australia and the electors of Australia would expect this parliament to undertake.

        This is a report by the Australian Taxation Office on taxation statistics. The report contains a very significant table  relating to sales tax for the financial year 1994-95. It is a significant table because we all remember at the last election that the Labor Party was not going to have a bar of consumption taxes. The Labor Party did not have a bar of it then, but it is shown in this table to have collected over $11 billion in consumption taxes. The public of Australia would probably be intrigued to note the items on which the government is collecting consumption tax—particularly in view of the government's totally dishonest campaign against consumption taxes at the last election.

         What has occurred is that Paul Keating—or the Prime Minister, Mr Keating—promised to the people no GST, yet has gone about collecting a consumption tax from the people and is now raising more in indirect taxes than the people of Australia would have needed to pay had the GST been introduced. The scale of the sales taxes paid in returns shown on pages 408 and 409 of the document we are discussing highlights the huge amount of taxes that are being collected by a whole number of businesses, from motor vehicles to tyres and recaps, boats, household appliances, household hardware, domestic furniture, household drapery, blinds, curtains, floor coverings, even bicycles. Chances are not many rich people would get around on bicycles, other than Mr McLeay, of course, other than the then Speaker, who got an extra $70,000. That is part of the Labor Party's commitment to equity and social justice, that the rich Speaker of the House of Representatives could get another $70,000 for falling off a bike that he should not have been on in the first place.

         It once again highlights the hypocrisy of Labor's taxation policies—on aerated waters and cordials, insecticides, confectionary, soaps and detergents. Indeed, Senator Calvert interjected that surely it would not apply to toilet paper. Yes, it does. No matter what, if you buy it, Labor want to tax it. Under us the essentials of food would not have been taxed, but under Labor they are still being taxed.

         The reason I make this contribution is that places such as New Zealand that have introduced a proper regime of indirect taxation are now reaping the rewards. They have an unemployment rate lower than ours. Their economy is burgeoning, is growing, is providing jobs and is paying off their international debt. At the end of this year they will be in credit as a nation.

         I then look at our record. It is a shameful record. The point that needs to be stressed is that under Labor's sales tax regime and indirect tax regime they are collecting more money—I stress `more money'—than a GST would have collected. That shows the hypocrisy of Labor. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

You, however, worked yourself into a frenzy because you could see that you were never going to make that high ministerial office that you seek, because Labor is going to lose the next election. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was undoubtedly of the same view, which is why he did not make that short drive out to Yarralumla and seek to have an election called and to put the matter of his stewardship, and the Labor Party's stewardship, of the Australian economy to the people of Australia.

         There are some matters that are deserving of comment on the conduct of the so-called phoney election campaign and, more importantly, on the conduct of the Labor Party generally. I want to take this opportunity to record my absolute and utter abhorrence of some of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister in relation to the ethnic community in this country. Honourable senators know that I only infrequently rise in this place to deal with matters to do with ethnic Australians, not because I do not have any regard for them but rather because I believe that the best interests of the community are served by serving the community as a whole. However, there are times when it is important that there is a voice for the ethnic community in this parliament, and on those occasions I have never shirked from my responsibility to represent the ethnic communities of this country.

         I want to make it very clear here in this chamber tonight that the most disgusting comments of the Prime Minister in relation to the Chinese community have been treated by most of the ethnic Chinese population of this country as an insult to their intellect. For the Prime Minister of this country dishonestly to say that Chinese Australians know that John Howard will put them on a boat back to wherever they came from if he wins the election was the most outrageous, shameful, disgraceful and overblown piece of paranoid propaganda that I have heard in this parliament for a long time.

My friend Senator Abetz would be just as shocked, and the ethnic German community would be just as shocked, if the Prime Minister said, `Oh, well, the coalition under Mr Howard would put all the Germans on a boat back to the country from which they came.'

We did not come here in any way other than the most normal of deliveries: we were born in this country. They cannot send us back. There is nowhere we can go to. Of course, this shows the Prime Minister's ignorance of the ethnic diversity of this nation. An enormous number of the people that he likes to classify as `ethnic Chinese'—which he is going to scare with some dreadful tale about Mr Howard chopping them up or eating their children or whatever the paranoid delusion happens to be this week—are, of course, people who were born in this country. Where does the Prime Minister suppose that I am going to be sent? Where does the Prime Minister suppose my brother and my sister are going to be sent? This is the most ridiculous paranoia that I have heard, but this is the extent to which the Prime Minister is willing to go to divide the Australian community.

I think it sends out a signal that says that the Labor Party is only interested in the ethnic communities so long as they get their vote. They are not interested in respect. They are not interested in valuing those people for themselves or for the contribution they make.

In the eight months that have elapsed since then, Australia has not been deluged by hundreds of thousands of boat people.

         As I said in starting, Madam Deputy President, I rarely get up and talk about issues to do with ethnicity or race or whatever because I believe that Australia is one of the most tolerant countries in the world and it is a place where race is rarely an issue. It has become an issue and is becoming an issue because of the thoroughly unacceptable behaviour of the Prime Minister. I believe it is time that decent people stood up to him and said, `Enough is enough. Stop this nonsense. Stop trying to divide Australians against Australians. It won't work.' More importantly, all the wonderful progress that has been made in this country is set back 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, probably 100 years. I just cannot understand why anybody would want to do it, except to say that this is typical of the behaviour of the Prime Minister. I believe that everybody in this country, and especially the people up in the press gallery, ought to be aware of these things the next time he opens his mouth and carries on like this. It is thoroughly unacceptable, and it is time it stopped.

         Back in 1990, when I was the Assistant General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, the union was approached by a company called the Peak Hill Gold mining company. That company was represented by the Australian Mines and Metals Association, the major employer association representing mining companies in this country. It approached the union to seek negotiations for the establishment of a new goldmine in New South Wales, near Cobar. That mine was to be operated by a company known as Peak Hill Gold which was, as I said, a fully owned subsidiary of CRA.

         This was a very important project not only to the company but to the nation. As was clearly spelt out in evidence given to the Industrial Relations Commission, this was to be the largest goldmine in New South Wales. In the course of the negotiations that commenced with the union, the company was seeking to establish a greenfield site with single union coverage. It wanted all of the benefits that it could seek through the enterprise bargaining process to make this a model site.

         The company was looking for things like the operation of 12-hour shifts underground—usually unheard of in Australian mining industry. It was looking for aggregate salaries. It was looking for new ways of approaching employee relations on site for solving problems, for identifying work practices which may have been an impediment to activity and ensuring that they would not occur. This was, from the ground up—and from the ground down, I suppose I should say—a new approach.

        Peak has to sell its product on world markets. It doesn't compete within Australia, it competes overseas, and therefore that's where we have to be focused. After visiting Canada and the United States, all those mines were basically single union and were very effective in their man management, and I think we need to learn a little bit about what happens in countries such as Canada, because they are our major competitor as far as minerals are concerned with Australia. But that took us down to single unions, and after a lot of investigation it did become obvious that the AWU, who we ended up doing quite extensive negotiations with over a period of nine months, were really the only union . . . that we could see that had the constitutional coverage to undertake all the things that we were trying do. And, in fact, we found them quite responsive in their discussions, and the consequence is that we had this agreement which we would like to put in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        This agreement was duly ratified by the commission and throughout the transcript of those proceedings praise was given by the company to the processes involved in negotiating this agreement with the union. It was approved in early 1991 and broke new ground in the mining industry. But what happened? About two years later the union suddenly received a bundle of resignation notices, all in the same form, quite unannounced. They just arrived. What did we discover? We discovered that the company had gone around and coerced the employees into signing up on individual contracts—individual contracts which took away many of their basic rights and which were the same for every single employee at the mine. These individual contracts that the opposition is so supportive of are all exactly the same. There is no individuality about them at all. The individual contract had a provision in it such as this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The employee agrees to abide by and adhere to the CRA group code of business conduct during the period of this contract of employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        If you want full details of the code of conduct you find them in the employee handbook. What was one of the requirements in the employee handbook? If an employee joined an association whose objectives may somehow differ with those of the company then they were required to tell the company supervisor about it. That was a requirement in the individual contract. In other words, they were required to go and tell the company if they joined the union, even though the union was not allowed to represent them. The contract also said this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The company encourages the employee to participate in community affairs, provided that such participation does not interfere with the employee's personal effectiveness at work.
       </para>
       <para>
        How generous of the company! They then had in their contract of employment clause of this individual contract:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This contract of employment is the result of direct discussions between the employee and representative of the company and supersedes all previous contracts and arrangements entered into between the parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that occasion, having gone to the commission and having negotiated a consent agreement, having praised that agreement as being at the forefront of industrial relations in this country, having achieved the very things that would make that mine site productive, what did the company do? They tore it up and walked away from it and coerced the employees into individual contracts. That company is a fully owned subsidiary of CRA. They deceived the Industrial Relations Commission to the point where they used the processes to establish an award, then they walked away from it for no reason whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         You say that the people have to abide by the laws of this country. The CRA company in that case totally flouted the Industrial Relations Commission award. We now have in Weipa a continuation of that long pursuit by the CRA to de-unionise its operations, to drive the union movement out of its sites—something that I have said is totally undemocratic and foreign to our way of life.

         —Tonight I want to deal with problems that have emerged from a leaked Telstra internal memorandum, which I raised at question time today. There is no doubt that the savage spending cuts—I am not arguing whether they are justified or not—that have emerged from a changed view by Telstra of its revenues, its earnings before interest and tax and its cash flow, have some clear consequences, particularly for rural Australia and for all those Australians who are awaiting the upgrading of their telephone services to the digital operation that has been promised.

         In the latest annual report, for example, Telstra says that it aims to have 100 per cent digital cover by the year 2000. At the moment, about 62 per cent of the network has been digitised. When in question time today I said that this posed serious problems and a serious threat to the upgrading of the system which was required and which had been progressing at a rate which may well not be able to be sustained, for some extraordinary reason the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) pretended that this was some kind of attack on the diligence of the employees of Telstra.

         I assert now that this leaked Telstra memorandum has effectively ended prospects of the Australian telephone system being upgraded to a 100 per cent digital system by the year 2000, particularly in rural areas. The memo from the Chief Executive of Telstra, Frank Blount, revealed that Telstra would sack most contractors, stop recruitment of new staff, withdraw existing job offers and cut or postpone major projects. What we want to find out is whether the major project to upgrade the system to a 100 per cent digital network is at risk under these cuts. We got no indication from the government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I asked Senator McMullan twice whether he would give an unequivocal guarantee that this upgrading program would not be cut, and he chose instead to suggest that I was somehow attacking Telstra employees. The only Telstra employees being attacked at the moment are those who are going to lose their jobs and the contractors who are going to be sacked as a result of these proposed arrangements. It is this government—not the opposition—that looks like getting stuck into Telstra workers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At the moment, rural areas are falling behind the cities in this upgrading of the service to digital. The digital system is an enormous improvement and provides a far greater service than do the existing arrangements. It is a matter of some concern that there is an apparent threat to this program. Particularly in recent Senate estimates committees where Telstra has been dealt with, I have raised the question of whether or not Telstra's enormous expansion into non-core activities—particularly overseas and into various other enormously expensive activities in cable television and so on—was diminishing the funds available to upgrade the Australian telephone service, which, after all, is Telstra's main duty.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I was also concerned, as many senators have been, that Telstra has been required to pay just under $1 billion in dividends—a far greater proportion than normal—to the government in the latest year to help the government's budgeting problems. The government has plenty of budgeting problems. All the assets that were supposed to be sold do not look like being sold. Here it is milking Telstra to the extent that now major projects are going to be cancelled, according to Telstra's internal memo. Some are to be cancelled; some are to be cut severely; we do not know which ones yet.

       <para first-indent="16">

         But there is no doubt that major projects will be cut or postponed, because that is what the chief executive, Mr Blount, has said in this leaked memo that came to me today. It is from him to members of his executive committee. The memo was sent out on Sunday after an executive committee meeting last Friday. I think it is a disgrace that the government is not prepared to give an assurance that these severe Telstra spending cuts would not delay the digital upgrading program.

         There are plenty of other spending cuts listed by Mr Blount. They are in promotion and advertising. Sponsorship activities will also be severely curtailed. This will be a serious blow to many organisations in Australia who have depended on Telstra for sponsorship.

        I hope Telstra do their property sales better than the group of property sales they tried in Sydney recently where they were selling as subdivided lots land that had not had approval for subdivision and they were selling lots to the public that were contaminated. It was one of the greatest snafus that one could possibly expect. I hope that, if Telstra is going to go into the asset sale disposal business, it lifts its game. Mr Blount said in the memo:

        Let us face it: making the network totally digital by the year 2000 is a major project, a substantive project. Is it going to be postponed, refocused or cancelled? These problems, I think, are very serious, because there is no doubt in my mind that Australian telephone users are now going to have to suffer the consequences of Telstra being forced to pay this huge dividend of just under a billion dollars to help out the government's budget problems and for its diversion of multi millions of dollars into non-core activities, particularly overseas. The memo says about the employment consequences:

         We will immediately move to much more stringently manage the intake of full time staff and of contractors . . . We will force the issue of reassignment of personnel within the Company as an absolute imperative and only in rare and exceptional cases will we be adding people to Telstra's payroll through recruitment from outside the Company. This means that any such endeavours must be immediately shut down (including university recruitment) . . .
        </tab>
       </para>

        So university graduates who are hoping they might have a role to play in Telstra can forget it. It continues:
