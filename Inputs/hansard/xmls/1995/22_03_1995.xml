It relates to the Telecommunications Interception Amendment Bill 1994 that was dealt with by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee last night. This relates to documents which I believe are absolutely essential to the Senate's understanding of what needs to be done—and a lot does need to be done—to change that bill when it comes here for debate. I believe it is essential that the motion be debated today while what happened last night is still fresh in senators' minds and before we debate the bill.

It is near certain that this chamber has authority to do what she asks. Senator Bourne says that this is a matter of urgency. But why is that so when there has been no precedent in the history of this parliament or of similar parliaments overseas? Just because we possess power does not mean that we should use it. When the Senate acts without good judgment, equity and high vision, its exercise of parliamentary power shifts towards tyranny.

         Before I deal with the terms of this motion, I would like to set out some of the history which has led to it. In December 1993 it came to light that the telephone conversations of a number of Telecom customers had been monitored and recorded without their knowledge or consent. The discovery was made by the telecommunications industry regulator, Austel, in the course of its inquiry into the so-called CoT cases, also known as the Casualties of Telecom.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The shock of the discovery was magnified by the extent of the deception involved. Telecom had emphatically denied to anyone who would listen to it that it would ever do such a thing, but the evidence came out, for which Austel was castigated by Telecom in a classic case of shooting the messenger, and the denials were proven to be absolutely worthless. It could be asserted that the interceptions were done in order to diagnose faults on the lines of the customers concerned, and the Australian Democrats do not deny that there are genuine maintenance reasons for listening in on customer conversations, if only briefly, to establish that a proper connection has been made.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          But the monitoring and the taping of the Casualties of Telecom were not done for such mundane reasons. The CoTs had been in dispute with Telecom over the quality of their business phone service for years. They had experienced persistent problems with a loss of incoming calls which had caused them real loss. They were in dispute with Telecom over compensation, and it was in that context that in some cases covert monitoring and recording took place. There is clear documentary evidence that, in the case of Mrs Ann Garms of Brisbane, Telecom staff's failure to tell her that her phone was being monitored was deliberate. They were intent on disproving her claims of phone difficulties in the apparent belief that she was inventing or at least exaggerating them.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The monitoring also put Telecom in an excellent position to get intelligence on Mrs Garms' legal moves and on the strategies being developed by the CoT cases, which had only just formed when the monitoring began. Information gleaned from the tapes was provided to the Telecom lawyers handling Mrs Garms' dispute. This may all sound like the stuff of paranoid delusion, and there is no doubt that there are some unfortunate people who suffer from some unfounded fears that their phones are being tapped, but Mrs Garms is not one of them. She has documentary evidence, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Senators may recall that I tabled some of that in this chamber in August last year.

          Then there is the really extraordinary case of Mr Robert Bray. Senators will recall that I tabled Mr Bray's story last year as well. Mr Bray had just moved to Ballarat and had a silent line connected, but it did not work properly and he asked for it to be fixed. It was, and on the first night the phone was functioning he had a long conversation with a friend in which the friend discussed his childhood experiences of abuse. The following morning Mr Bray was rung by someone claiming to be a Telecom employee who said that his calls had been broadcast in the Ballarat exchange and had been taped. Mr Bray was understandably traumatised and brought this incident to Telecom's attention. In response, a local Telecom manager took it upon himself to contact a psychiatric nurse at Ballarat's lakeside hospital suggesting that Mr Bray was in need of treatment. The nurse was given Mr Bray's silent phone number and promptly contacted him. You can imagine the impact that this had on Mr Bray. There is no doubt that the psychiatric referral took place because the employee concerned admitted that he did it and that he had done it before. There is no hard evidence that Mr Bray's phone was broadcast within the exchange. However, I have looked carefully at Mr Bray's account and his credibility, and the conclusion is inescapable that his phone calls were intercepted and were probably broadcast.

          Now we get to the crux of this motion. Despite the mountains of evidence gathered by the Australian Federal Police, who by all accounts did an excellent job, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided he could not convince a court that the law itself had been violated. If cases like those of Mrs Garms and Mr Bray cannot be prosecuted, the Democrats say that there is something wrong with that law. It should not be legal to broadcast someone's phone conversations within an exchange without that person's consent. It should not be legal to tape calls without consent, but it is. The law should be a strong deterrent to anyone who wants to do these things for sport or for industrial espionage, but it is not.

          Controversies like this are not new. In 1988 the Commonwealth Ombudsman investigated a complaint that Telecom had broadcast a customer's phone calls on an exchange speaker without that customer's consent. Telecom pledged that it would never happen again, but it has. In the last few days, I have received a statutory declaration from someone who wishes to remain anonymous, at least for the time being. That person is in dispute with Telecom. After years of phone difficulties, he recently lodged a modest claim for compensation. Shortly after, he received three anonymous phone calls from different callers implying that he and his family would suffer unless he withdrew those claims. The callers quoted parts of the person's phone conservations with other people, which could have been obtained only by intercepting his telephone calls. The person in question is well known to us. Again, he is sane, straight as a die and one of life's reliable witnesses. I do not doubt his evidence, and I have passed it to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Australian Federal Police.

          My concern is that malicious telephone interceptions are still going on. They are damaging the lives of individuals, many of whom are already traumatised by years of dispute with Telecom. Yet the law offers them little comfort. Now the Senate has before it the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill, which seeks to address the weaknesses in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act which have made prosecution so very difficult in these cases. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee last night held a hearing into the bill in which witness after witness said that the bill was deficient.

          The Casualties of Telecom argued that the DPP's failure to prosecute showed that the bill needed to be strengthened to make it an offence to broadcast or tape telephone conversations without customer consent. They suggested that Austel's approval also be required to bring some independent expertise to bear on the question of whether an interception was warranted. They also called for disclosure of private information by the carriers to be made an offence, which it was in relation to Telecom until 1991. They pointed out that call diversion and tracing can also be used against customers in dispute with a carrier and called for that option to be closed off.

          The carriers argue that the bill is vague and fails to give employees a clear dividing line between legal and illegal interceptions and that the regulations which are supposed to clarify that matter should be finalised before the legislation is voted on, not after. The carriers and the union also argue that individual employees should be immune from prosecution. We could extend that principle to give courier company employees immunity from culpable driving charges, but we disagree with that too. The point is that the bill is contentious.

          There was one glaring omission from last night's evidence. In order to judge the competing claims about the legislation, the committee needs to know whether the Australian Federal Police did uncover evidence of covert interception for non-operational purposes and why the Director of Public Prosecutions felt unable to take that matter to court. That is the purpose of this motion.

I know that my esteemed friend and colleague Senator Cooney, who has strong personal views on this, will speak on this as well, but there is a need at the outset to distinguish between the two issues involved here. The first is the inadequacy in the legislation, which the government concedes and which needs to be corrected; the second is the demand of the Senate to set itself up fundamentally in the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions, becoming a star chamber by the release of police and prosecution material to achieve this end.

          Apart from anything else, as well as creating what would be an appalling precedent, the action proposed by this motion is totally unnecessary. There is a great deal of common ground between the government and the Australian Democrats on this issue. I can assure the Senate that we are as concerned as the Democrats and the opposition to see that any deficiencies that led to a failure to prosecute in the act be corrected. But we do not need to create this most unfortunate precedent. With greatest respect to the precedent quoted by Senator Bourne, which I assume referred to the

          What is demanded by this motion is that the prosecution material that actually led the Director of Public Prosecutions to the view that there should not be a prosecution in this case be handed over to the Senate.

          It is important for the Senate—in particular, Senator Harradine has rightly asked for the position to be laid out clearly—to lay out the process that the government is prepared to provide to the Senate in order to fix the legislation. Senator Bourne is well aware of this because of the extensive discussions that have taken place between the government and herself. The process that the government has agreed to follow is that it is proposed that the Director of Public Prosecutions be asked to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to assist the committee in its deliberations on the proposed amendments. I could not think of any more helpful process than having the director himself being able to assist the committee in determining what needs to be done to the act. That may have prevented him from laying prosecutions in this case.

The DPP's role in appearing before the committee, of course, should be limited to his opinion on the requirements of the necessary amendments to the act to correct the problem.

          Senator Bourne is quite correct to put that on the public record. That is fine in so far as it goes, but when we are talking about asking for police and prosecution material to be made available to a Senate committee that then wants to set itself up as a de facto director of public prosecutions, it is a very different matter altogether. Criminal investigations, the government believes, must be conducted with a degree of secrecy involved for the rights of the individuals concerned. This is so that, where an investigation is current, those involved in illegal behaviour are not forewarned as well.

Senator Bourne knows that we are proposing that the Director of Public Prosecutions directly appear with the committee to assist in that process. All of that can be done without disclosing prosecution material where individuals are mentioned and do not get an opportunity to argue their case—and neither should they have to—in front of the Senate.

          Senator Bourne has said that her reason for the current motion is not that she lacks confidence in the DPP but so that she can be sure that the legislative amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act are adequate. But this is not in fact what is going to happen. Let us have a look at what has happened in this matter. Complaints have been made about possible breaches of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. Those allegations have been investigated by the appropriate authority—the Australian Federal Police. In accordance with normal practice, the AFP sought the advice from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions about whether charges should be laid.

The DPP takes the position that it is not proper for the material considered by him to be released for public debate; he is therefore not willing to release this material voluntarily.

          I would have thought it would be blindingly clear that the position taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the release of this material is the only proper one. Under our system of criminal justice, the DPP is given the key role of deciding whether official action to prosecute should be taken in the public interest. Because the DPP is given this control, it is appropriate that the results of the investigations of alleged offenders by Commonwealth agencies go to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his decision on whether a prosecution should follow and, if so, what charges should be then laid against the individuals concerned.

Consider the political implications, the real implications, of this. I am not suggesting necessarily that the Democrats are motivated by this, but this is what they are setting up. A politically motivated inquiry could be launched into the question of whether any alleged breaches of the law should be prosecuted. After any official investigation had run its course, all the material could be brought before the Senate for it to make its own supposed public interest judgment.

          —Some serious issues are at stake here. I think it is important that the Senate consider carefully what is being proposed. I do not start with the presumption that any senator in this place would wilfully leak documents, even though that might put at risk the reputations of individuals or defame them under parliamentary privilege. Certainly, Senator Collins could point to very few examples of a committee resolving to release material when any fair-minded citizen would regard that as an abuse of process.

          We are talking here about a precedent that is very limited in its operation. I do not go along with the general proposition that somehow you open the floodgates when you make a decision in a particular instance. In this case you have to have regard to the history of the matter. We are not dealing here particularly with the rights of individuals. Senator Cooney is quite right in saying that the last thing you ever want to do is to have someone's reputation besmirched under parliamentary privilege when their opportunities for redress are very limited.

          We are talking here about good corporate behaviour. That is why we need to examine the history of Telecom. I find it very interesting to look at the sea change in the attitude of the Australian Democrats. For a long time the Democrats gave Telecom the benefit of the doubt, even though a number of examples are on the public record of very cynical and manipulative behaviour on the part of Telecom spokespeople. I lost faith in a number of their assurances a long time ago. The people who have come to see us from time to time pushing Telecom's barrow in Canberra have not always reassured me, I can tell the Senate and, hopefully, Telecom in due course.

          There is a very high onus on Telecom to be frank. It is currently 100 per cent government owned. It surely has an obligation to all taxpayers as well as to all telephone subscribers to ensure that its behaviour is utterly ethical and beyond reproach; yet in this instance we have had quite the opposite. Senator Cooney would surely agree that it is odious behaviour to think that a government owned carrier, which happens to be a potential party to litigation, could eavesdrop in order to obtain the dirt on one of the litigants. I do not know the full nature and extent of the telephone tapping. We had denials, which were not worth the paper they were written on, but they were never very specific.

          What I think would emerge from an in camera examination of the material is the full nature and extent of the tapping. From my recollection, in relation to Ann Garms, it was not simply a matter of listening in for a few minutes to see whether or not there was any problem on the line; it was a matter of taping whole conversations and retaining those tapes. If examination of the tapes revealed problems on the line, you would expect Telecom to be in there fixing that line. That is minimum quality of service. There is no suggestion that Telecom ever came to Mrs Garms shortly after the taping and said, `We're here to fix your phone.'

          Why did Telecom keep the tapes at all? It may not be a punishable offence to retain the tapes. I do not know what defences Telecom has put forward. It may, for example, have taken the advice of all those high-powered teams of lawyers it always seems to have on tap to simply tell its employees to say nothing on the matter, in which case there may not be evidence to refute the proposition that this was simply being done for maintenance and monitoring purposes.

          I can recall—Senator Boswell will remember this—an outrageous example of an agreement by Telecom to provide material or to deal direct with one of the complainants in the CoT cases. That person very shortly afterwards was rung up by a very high-powered Sydney legal firm which basically threatened, intruded into the process, tried to up the ante and make life as difficult as possible. The behaviour of Telecom in the CoT cases certainly is not beyond reproach. There was supposed to have been a fast-track settlement procedure put in place more than 12 months ago. None of those CoT cases have yet been resolved and, as I understand it, any request for FOI materials has been fought tooth and nail. In other words, there has been no willingness on the part of Telecom to even act in its own best self-interest, in terms of public relations, and cooperate. It has always been a matter of dragging teeth.

That is why it is important to be able to go back and examine precisely what occurred in this instance. We are talking about one of the largest corporations in the country, a $20 billion-plus outfit. I know we put that figure on it and we were ridiculed prior to the last election. I am sure the government would say it is worth a lot more than that now. It therefore has an enormous market power. Any body in a position of unbridled power is sorely tempted to abuse that power, particularly when it is not only the dominant carrier, but also the only carrier when it comes to local calls. The bargaining positions are grotesquely uneven. That is why it is outrageous that someone in that enormous position of influence and power can behave in such a way towards a subscriber, simply treating the subscriber as though he was an irritant to be squashed.

          In America they used to call AT&amp;T the 600-pound gorilla. There are a lot of other epithets you can use to describe an immensely powerful telephone company. But in this instance it is very important indeed for Telecom to be seen to be acting in the best interests of consumers, even if that means on occasions throwing in the towel or at least making more general settlements. It can well afford to. If anyone has unlimited resources in this country it is Telecom.

          It is all very well for the minister to say, `The DPP is happy to come along and offer advice and be as helpful as possible about the future.' You cannot do that without regard to the past. Where you have a long track record, as Telecom does in this case, of doing absolutely everything you can to frustrate the processes then I for one am not prepared to accept that its behaviour should not be subject to this degree of scrutiny. That is why it is regrettable that if the DPP was not prepared to at least outline some of the matters that he regarded as insufficient for prosecution, someone else should have done it. In other words, the minister should have taken the opportunity to indicate what behaviour of Telecom's fell short of prosecution, but nonetheless was not behaviour of which the government approved.

          I wrote to Mr Kerr on 8 March. I have had no reply. Again, Mr Kerr is in a position to have done something about this. The Democrats and the opposition have raised this matter on many occasions. Mrs Garms's case has been aired constantly in the media. I have never heard one word from the government, even expressing its concern about covert behaviour of Telecom. All we have had, as I recall, is perhaps the odd cheap shot about the politics of the issue. I have not heard any concerns expressed by the government. It may well be concerned for the future, but if you judge the government's attitude by its past behaviour, then it is at best benign neglect and at worst culpable negligence.

No-one is suggesting that he had an overwhelming case in favour of prosecution but he nonetheless chose not to. What we do not know is just what is there in relation to Telecom's behaviour. As I say, if they are advised to say nothing, there may be very little.

She accepts everything that has been told to her by those who have been so victimised by Telecom, and Senator Alston said the same. This is not an exercise of trying to obtain evidence about a matter which they are in doubt about. Senator Bourne's speech today was full of certainties.

Both leaders, both Mr Fahey and Mr Carr, have made law and order speeches backed by victims. The victims in these matters are the ones that are most tragically dealt with. They are the ones that have had to bear the cost of criminal activity against them. Today we have people—they gave evidence last night—who have been tortured by what they have been through. What I am getting at now is how politicians use them. Just as Mr Fahey and Mr Carr had these victims behind them when they made their speeches, so today Senator Bourne and Senator Alston have people here who have been through torture.

         So there is the big invitation: it would be better, says the person cross-examining or examining the Attorney-General over there; there is the poisoned chalice that has been offered to him, that it would be in the interests of the innocent parties, he says, as well as the interests of the committee, if this information was made public. So what does the Attorney-General say? He says:

         Mr Crowther, I hear that suggestion and I do not think it incumbent upon me to express agreement or disagreement. What I do, however, reiterate is that it is extremely important that where somebody has not been prosecuted—

         or where a prosecution has been discontinued against someone, the evidence that would have been available had that prosecution continued should not be paraded in public. There are other reasons; I have given the first one and I think by itself it is sufficient but there are other reasons which I think also engage the public interest. One is that of confidentiality. When a potential offence is being investigated, evidence is given and statements are made by people on the understanding that the evidence is going to be made public, if public at all, in the context of court proceedings.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is very important that the confidentiality should be maintained because if it is not, people will be less inclined to come forward in some circumstances and give evidence if they know that, notwithstanding the fact that there is no prosecution, it will be made public. There is a further ground. It is, I think, of less importance but it is not negligible. It may be that further evidence comes to light which would make it proper to prosecute, would bring it within the parameters of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, would give rise to a realistic prospect of conviction. If, before that stage, evidence has been made public in the circumstances that you have in mind, a subsequent prosecution might very well be prejudiced.
        </para>
        <para>
         What is being said there is that, if, after evidence becomes available which may form the basis of a prosecution, that prosecution may not be able to proceed because the evidence has been paraded in public and dealt with in the way that it has been dealt with here today, with due respect, it would be unsafe to proceed to a prosecution because it would be unfair on the person who would otherwise be prosecuted.

          Senator Harradine was there then. I am not sure how he voted, but I would be surprised if he was not a person who was determined to ensure that prosecutions were to be brought at the instance of the DPP—and that was up to the DPP to do—and that the refusal by the DPP to bring a prosecution or the decision not to bring a prosecution should be respected.

It is up to the committee to say whether it thinks there is insufficient evidence.

What I am saying is that, in pursuing that course, you are bringing into this place some very bad precedents. You are destroying, unfortunately, an institution which since 1983 has been operating very well. You will get to the point where this place becomes as it were a court, second-guessing what the courts do, second-guessing what prosecutors do, and doing that without the stops on them which make what they do fair. We are not burdened with the sorts of protections that are given to citizens by placing these stops on the DPP.

We are asking for the written consideration by the DPP and his senior staff of the AFP brief of evidence, the legal advice provided to the DPP by senior counsel, the summary report which forms part of the AFP's brief of evidence and the advice by senior counsel to the AFP. As I understand it, Senator Cooney is saying—I have to take a fair bit of notice of Senator Cooney, the Chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and a pretty good lawyer at that; I do listen to what he has to say on these matters—that, in each of those subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), there will be identification of such a nature that it would be easy, if the material got out, to pinpoint particular employees of Telecom.

         I suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and to honourable senators that you have a look at page 108 of the standing orders. Under `Procedural orders of continuing effect', point No. 10 at page 108 says what precisely is meant by the disclosure of in camera evidence.

          Before I go on to that, I take the point that was made by Senator Cooney. As he said, the Senate committee gets this material. Why? It is in the motion: `to assist the committee in its consideration of the Telecommunications Interception Amendment Bill 1994'. That is why it gets the material that is sought. What is the use of getting that material if it is not going to have some sort of effect on the consideration of that bill and, through the committee, some sort of effect on how the Senate will consider that particular legislation?

In any event, in relation to the disclosure of in camera evidence, under the heading `Procedural orders of continuing effect', point No. 10 in the

If agreement is not reached, the dissenting Senator may refer to the in camera evidence in the dissent only to the extent necessary to support the reasoning of the dissent. Witnesses who gave the evidence in question should, if it is practicable, be informed in advance of the proposed disclosure of the evidence and should be given reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure and to ask that particular parts of the evidence not be disclosed. The committee should give careful consideration to any objection by a witness before making its decision.

          A question arises in my mind as to why the committee does not demand from Telecom the material that it might wish to receive to assist it in its consideration of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill. There are certain questions. Very serious allegations have been made about eavesdropping. Eavesdropping simply means a clandestine listening to people's private conversations. That sort of activity should not be condoned unless it is in very specific circumstances.

          What we have to be convinced about when we are dealing with this legislation next week is what those circumstances are in which that sort of activity becomes not an offence. Clearly, most people would say that it is in general an offence. But what are the exceptions? In any event, if the interception is for monitoring and repair purposes, why are tapes being kept? A number of questions come to mind. Obviously, they would have come to the minds of those committee members who have been very much engaged in these matters—not least of whom are Senator Bourne and Senator Cooney.

          My involvement with this issue goes back probably longer than that of anyone in the Senate. A couple of years ago, I approached the Australian Democrats and said to them that there were some very serious problems, and that I believed we should jointly take action in the Senate. The Democrats rejected my approach at the time. We were all given assurances from Telecom that at no stage had there ever been any interception on the telephones of the members of CoT. We received comments that—this is a paraphrase—the CoT members were all a little emotional because there was a downturn in business because of a credit squeeze, and that they were looking for scapegoats to blame for the downturn in the business.

When people approach me with problems I always treat those problems with caution. I have known Ann Garms for many years and I have always found her to be very reliable and trustworthy. Nevertheless, I did seek other information to back up what she was telling me.

          A meeting was called of telephone users in the valley and about 80 or 90 people turned up. All of them, in front of Telecom, provided information that their telephones were totally insufficient to give them a decent service. That confirmed to me that what Mrs Garms was saying was very relevant and very truthful. As a member of parliament I continued to talk to her—she being a constituent of mine—while this debate was going on and obviously in the period her phones were being intercepted. I consider it a very serious offence if I, as a member of parliament and a senator for Queensland, cannot talk to a constituent who has a problem with a government instrumentality without it being recorded.

          But it got worse than that. Mrs Garms is a thorough person and she has very good business ability. She never just accepted what 90 per cent of the people did. She recorded every bit of information that came in. She spent excessive amounts of money backing her assumptions up on technical advice and other information. Through freedom of information, Mrs Garms was able to prove that her telephone was intercepted. The messages and information that came from those telephone interceptions were then passed on to Telecom's solicitor in an action that she was taking against it. So Telecom was leaking information to its solicitors that would act in a detrimental way against Mrs Garms. I consider that totally unacceptable.

I should mention in passing one point that we all seem to have forgotten, notwithstanding the inflamed rhetoric of the minister. The DPP should never, of course, be entirely beyond the review of this parliament. Honourable senators will recall that last year we forced the government to admit that the DPP had wrongly advised the AFP that a search warrant could not be executed on Telecom.

         On 20 October 1994, the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges on the motion of Senator Parer:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Whether Senator Woodley was threatened in relation to the Port Hinchinbrook development in the manner referred to by him in debate in the Senate on 21 September 1994, and, if so, whether any contempt was committed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The committee has received and examined comprehensive submissions from Senator Woodley and from Mr Keith Williams, who was the person purportedly involved in making a threat to Senator Woodley.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Both submissions are included in the volume of documents accompanying the report. As Mr Williams's submission indicates, it is clear that he sought to protect his own interests vigorously and outspokenly. The aggressive way in which he prosecuted his campaigns understandably gives rise to a perception that such behaviour is threatening. However, the committee does not regard the actions in this case as having had the effect or tendency of substantially obstructing a senator in the performance of his duties.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          All senators and members of parliament receive threats of this nature and regard them, in Senator Woodley's words, as `part of the risk of public life'. The committee believes that Senator Woodley was threatened by Mr Williams in this sense but observed that he was not in fact deterred nor obstructed by these threats. In this context, the committee notes that it was not Senator Woodley who raised the threats as a matter of privilege, which he might have chosen to do if he had felt himself deterred or obstructed in the performance of his duty as a senator. The committee has not found that a contempt was committed in respect of the matter referred. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         I understand and appreciate that senators may wish to know some of the background to these bills because, whatever my personal view might be, the Senate has carried this resolution and therefore when we seek to have it set aside we should seek to provide information. I think there has been some attempt to generally advise senators about the background to each bill, and I will not unduly delay the Senate by going through all the background information I have, but I am happy, if people think what I say is not comprehensive enough, to provide more.

         The first bill in question is the Anzac Day Bill 1994. It is not a bill that one could say is being rushed through; it was introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994. On 29 November 1994 it was not considered urgent, but the view is that it is important, as an admittedly small but significant part of the Australia Remembers program, that we get this bill passed prior to Anzac Day 1995. I would be surprised if there was not widespread support for that proposal here.

         The reason we seek the passage of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995—and I will not go through what is in the bill—is that we want the new agreement to have effect for the new income tax and FBT years. It is a bill which generates benefits for Australian business. If the bill is not passed, the benefits to Australian business will be deferred for a full year. That would be a problem for trans-Tasman trade in the meantime.

         The third bill is the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The main purpose of the bill is to improve the operation of provisions which allow certain former members and senators who re-enter parliament to repay lump sums paid previously and to receive recognition of prior parliamentary service. There has been a lot of consultation, particularly with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). The bill was introduced on 2 February. It has received bipartisan support. I think the view is that it should get early implementation so that the benefits can be made available.

         The major component of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is the provision of appropriation of $312 million for capital works in government and non-government schools. No funds can be paid until the bill is passed. There is a lengthy explanation, but the first paragraph seems to go to the heart of it as far as I can see.

         The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 is the first product of the tax law improvement project. It includes a rewrite of the substantiation rules and makes a number of changes to the rules to make it easier for taxpayers. If the changes are to be operated from the date intended, we want these changes to apply to this current income tax year. Therefore, we need the authority to put them in this year's Tax Pack as advice to taxpayers, including senators. Senators will remember that there has been some controversy in the past when the Tax Pack presumed parliamentary support for amendments even when such amendments had support of all members of parliament. If they had been included before the passage of the bill, that would have been a cause of concern. The early passage of the bill is critical, as the Tax Pack is currently being finalised. We cannot proceed in the way we and I think the Senate would wish unless we get prompt passage.

         Those are the reasons for wanting expeditious handling of these bills. It would still be open to the Senate, if it does not like the bills, to vote against them or to amend them. We are not seeking other than to get expeditious handling by the Senate. They are the reasons that I have in summary. I urge the support of the Senate for the motion.

I understand that the government and the Auditor-General's office share the view that this will ensure that the transition is smoother and more harmonious and without any significant deleterious effect. If we could have passed the bill earlier and started in 1995, that would have been better, but in the long term the net outcome is the same, with no transitional problem.

         From the comments that Senator Gibson has made, I am sure that the position the opposition has taken is a considered one. I simply want to put on the record that we have a serious concern to see that the transition is a smooth one. If the Senate passes legislation in an amended form and the House of Representatives accepts it, we will try very hard to make it work. I cannot predict what the view of the House of Representatives will be but we would prefer the 1996 date for the reasons I have outlined. There are no other reasons. This is simply a concern to see that the necessary intermediate steps are taken and that there is time available in which to take them all.

         Setting that debate aside, but going to the broader question, the reason for the government's opposition is not at all that it is out of sympathy with the intent of the amendment; the reason for the government's opposition is that the amendment is not necessary. The structure of the legislation in its current form captures all of the relevant agencies including, in my clear understanding, the National Media Liaison Service.

We are not in the business of including in law resolutions of discontent about particular things—that is, the opposition's concern about aNiMaLS—otherwise we would have included in and scattered throughout our statutes references that some particular party or some particular groups of parties at one particular time or another have felt aggrieved about something.

         —The government opposes the amendment. The reason why the standard 15-day disallowance period was not adopted was that the determinations concerned are not standard delegated legislation; they are internal appropriations. Government administration should not be delayed for possibly months at a time awaiting parliamentary authorisation.

         Secondly, they do not become operative until after the period of disallowance has passed. This is unlike other delegated legislation, which normally becomes law until disallowed by parliament. I think that explanation is clear on the face of it. I reinforce it by saying that, while it may appear to reinforce current practice, it imposes, in a specifically different set of circumstances, on the Commonwealth and on its agencies a considerable hardship. If the moneys cannot be spent until such time as the disallowance period has expired, when normally one would want to have access to those moneys immediately, it renders the operation of agencies almost impossible and in some cases impossible. For those reasons, because they are internal appropriations and because the Senate does not wish to delay the operation of the administration of government unduly, we oppose the amendment.

         The Democrats have always given particular emphasis to issues of accountability. I believe that the practice of giving financial rewards to whistleblowers sets a bad example and sends out all the wrong messages to people who have considered blowing the whistle on financial fraud or mismanagement. In short, it does not help to create an effective internal process of accountability. Senators may be aware that the Privacy Commissioner, Kevin O'Connor, has expressed strong concerns about this clause which he voiced in a letter to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee.

         The approach which the government is putting forward in clause 36 has been explicitly rejected by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. It was also rejected by the 1993 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into fraud on the Commonwealth. The Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission also came down with a similar finding in 1991. Financial reward is a cornerstone of the system surrounding whistleblowing in the USA. But it was specifically rejected by many of the whistleblowers themselves when they gave evidence to the Senate committee.

         Dr William de Maria from the University of Queensland, who has undertaken the largest study of whistleblowers in Australia to date, described the system in the USA as a bounty hunting arrangement. He said that rewarding whistleblowers is an incorrect and dangerous inducement on which to expect people of goodwill to come forward. They should come forward on the old-fashioned basis of just being ethically disturbed by what they see. The Australian Democrats agree with that sentiment and hope our amendment to delete this clause has the support of other senators.

He was so happy because his last posting has been at this expanding, increasingly modern equipped naval base near Perth. He was able to show me around the base. I had been there before and was able to see a number of the new developments. One item which is quite marvellous is the new pier. It is a two-decker pier that can service both submarines and surface ships. With every facility within the pier in terms of electricity, water, offices, telephones, cables and data—it also has a crane on top and has the ability for trucks to move about the pier at the lower level—it is a first-class facility for a modern naval base.

         I also saw the new submarine training school, which is still being built and which is already switched over to Collins class submarines. There is a simulated submarine there in a massive hall. All of the commands of those operating the submarine result in a movement in the actual physical structure they are in. The movement is exactly the same as if they were descending at an angle or rising. It even has the swell interacting with the simulator.

         I was able to meet the commander of the Australian Submarine Squadron, Captain Denis Mole, and I have great respect for his contribution to the Australian navy and not least his time as a submariner. He now has the great responsibility of being the commander of all Australian submarines at the time of transfer to the Collins class. I wish him and all those who serve under him the very best success, particularly in these few years. I had breakfast with him and also with Commander Michael Deeks, the commander of the particular submarine, HMAS

         There were about 12 petty officers on board and I spent an hour and a half in their mess, the place where they eat and sleep. It is about half as big as my bedroom at home but it accommodates some 14 people—sleeping, eating, watching entertainment or reading a book in that one space. That is typical of the 64 standard crew on an Oberon class submarine.

         We went through a number of exercises on the ship which I was delighted to observe from the command centre of the submarine. There were two periscopes, a sonar system, a weapons system, a navigation centre, and the controls for all of the air pressure and air into tanks are right there in that central area. Then there is the steering mechanism of the submarine which is like an aeroplane's joystick, but it is actually called a one-man control stick or an OMC. I had the pleasure of being invited by the captain, after proper instruction, to sit at the OMC and actually steer the boat to port or starboard to whatever was the commanded degree and direction and also, with regard to elevation, by pressing forwards—quite a physical effort—to then dive the submarine or to pull back and so elevate the submarine.

         Through various exercises we went to 600 feet. I remember being given a command to take the submarine down to 200 feet and bring it back up again to 180 feet and to do so at a particular elevation not exceeding 10 degrees, and so on. When I was not in command of these controls we went through an exercise—and this is a realistic exercise because there are occasions when you need to get to the surface with emergency—where all air is pumped into the ballast tanks of the submarine and a 20-degree elevation and force thrust on the engine takes the submarine to the surface very rapidly. I was able to look out of the periscope when we arrived at the surface to see the great swirling and bubbling white ocean behind us where the air had reached the surface with the submarine.

         I will not go into describing the various items of equipment that I have alluded to nor the lower level of airconditioning pumps, lighting equipment and so on. But I make the point that there are two diesel V16 engines on board and each would be about 20 feet long and stand about five feet high. They can only be turned on when they are what they call snorting, that is, when the exhaust from the engines is able to go out freely to the surface. There would be all manner of catastrophe if the submarine, while snorting, were to dive below the surface, because all of the exhaust airs would flood the submarine.

         —Honourable senators may recall that late last year in this chamber we debated the legislation which introduced the new widows allowance for women who were widowed, separated or divorced after they turned 50. At that time, I moved a number of amendments designed to make the allowance fairer and more widely available. Unfortunately, those amendments were defeated by the combined vote of the government and the coalition.

         Following that defeat, I decided to initiate a petition in order to show the members of this parliament just how much concern there really is out there in the community for the position of widows. The petition calls on the parliament to make the widows allowance available to women in their 50s who were widowed, separated or divorced after they turned 40, to pay the allowance at the pension rate and to provide all the pensioner concessions to these women. The response to that petition was enormous and this morning I tabled over 10,000 signatures on the petition.

         In my contribution today, I want to put a human face on this issue because if ever there was an issue which demanded a humane response then this is it. I think it is important for the Senate to see how the eligibility criteria for the widows allowance is actually affecting women in the community and to see the great personal difficulty some of the women who contacted me are enduring. At the outset, I acknowledge that my petition did not go as far as some women would have liked and I hope that in the future we can built on that work to accommodate some of the other concerns that they have raised with me.

         Since the petition was first released just a few weeks ago, my office has been inundated with calls. Some women rang up simply to say that they would do anything to help the campaign. Some women phoned because they were angry at the system and bitter that they are to be condemned to another 10 or 15 years on an unemployment payment. Some women who phoned were literally at their wit's end and desperately needed to talk to a sympathetic ear—often these conversations ended with those women in tears.

         It is impossible to listen to the stories these women had to tell without being affected personally. That is why I feel it is important that the Senate sees the human aspect of this issue and I will do that by quoting from some of the letters I received over the last few weeks. Many of the letters spoke of the inequity of the requirement for eligibility for the widows allowance that a woman had to be 50 years or older when she was widowed, separated or divorced. I will read to senators some of the extracts. One woman wrote:

        Many women returned their filled petitions with a little note attached simply saying, `Thank you for caring.' The Democrats certainly do care, and I feel it is time the Senate showed some more compassion and amended the widows allowance. In closing, I indicate that next week I will be moving an amendment to the Social Security Act to relax the eligibility requirements for the widows allowance.

         —During the matters of public interest debate today I will seek to revisit the forestry debate. The forestry issue was a matter that took up some considerable time in this chamber earlier this year especially when there was that substantial blockade outside of Parliament House. The blockaders at the time had a very just cause; they still do. It is vital that the people of Australia and indeed this parliament do not lose focus and do not lose sight of the ongoing struggle that this industry finds itself in.

         A number of issues need to be addressed and a number of factors indicated to the Australian people as to the importance of this industry to the well-being of our fellow Australians. First of all, we as a country still import huge quantities of timber and timber products. That might be hard to believe but that is a fact. That of course impacts on our overseas debt and our balance of payments, which have been blowing out, going through the roof, every consecutive month.

         Secondly, the forestry industry provides a renewable and environmentally friendly resource. It grows naturally, can be cut down, harvested and regrown. Thirdly, the forest industry employs literally hundreds of thousands of people in Australia and in particular in the depressed regional areas of Australia that have suffered so much under the economic mismanagement of the Labor government. Indeed, in my state of Tasmania, the forest industry employs one in seven people. That of course is a very important industry to my state. Within the economy of Australia and each of its states, the industry plays a very large and sustaining role.

         Whilst it is common to hear people talk about the profitability of the forest industry, it is good for us to remind ourselves of the actual costs associated with the industry and the taxes that are taken out of the industry. For example, let us have a look at the taxes that one log truck that travels 110,000 kilometres per year generates. As I understand it, that is a fair and average sample.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         First of all, in the year of purchase there is a one-off tax of about three per cent stamp duty, $6,000. If the truck travels 110,000 kilometres per year it will use about 55,000 litres of fuel. Fifty-two per cent of the retail price is state and federal taxes. Therefore, about $20,000 worth of fuel tax is paid into the economies of the state and federal governments each year. Tyres, the trailer and other items that are required to be repaired or replaced attract a 21 per cent sales tax. Remember the outrage by those opposite at a 15 per cent sales tax? They are imposing a sales tax on this industry of 21 per cent on these parts which, on average, cost the log truck operator $3,500 per annum.

         What about the driver who drives the truck? On average, he pays $10,000 in personal income tax to the federal government. The registration of the truck and trailer is $1,548. The sales tax that is imposed on other spare parts varies from truck to truck but I am reliably informed that it is about $1,500 per annum. We then have to look at the forestry road tolls that truck drivers pay. On average, they pay $25,900 per year and on the state road tolls they pay a further $5,900 per annum.

         All those expenditures add up to $74,343 per annum that is going to state and federal governments out of each and every single log truck. If we take off the $6,000 stamp duty, which is a one-off cost at the beginning, we are then left with a figure of $68,000. In anybody's language that is a huge and substantial contribution to the economy of this country and its various states and that $68,000 is from one truck and driver. There are literally thousands of those trucks all around this country. It is vitally important that in this debate about the forest industry we do not lose sight of the very real benefit of this industry.

         The speech from Senator Woodley just now about the reduction in the age requirement for widows pensions was a very heart-rending account and one that, undoubtedly, we would all wish to be able to provide and assist with. Why has it not been assisted with? Because of lack of funds. Let me say very simply that if the Democrats continue with their outrageous attack on the timber industry there will be fewer taxes gathered by the federal and state governments and, as a result, there will be even less money available for those who are genuinely in need that Senator Woodley referred to.

         What has really hurt this industry that is so vital to this country is the on-again, off-again approach that the government has taken to the industry. We had the 1,300 coupes recommended by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and the 85 adopted by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes in and says, `We'll have 509 coupes logged.' We then have another review as a result of the blockade. There is just gross uncertainty within the industry, and that uncertainty is hurting and hurting badly.

When the workers are cutting up the last log, what does that do for their economic security? How do they feel when they go home that night? Will there be another log there in the morning?

So it deliberately sought ways of retaining its employees to bear the brunt of any economic hardship that might otherwise fall upon them. So, simply, had it not been for the goodwill of all concerned, the situation would have been much worse and, without doubt, many more stand-downs would have been inevitable.

         There is a view within the community that when you talk about the forest industry what you are really talking about is woodchipping.

It is silly and stupid, but it is the same in the forest industry. People are saying, `Use those parts of the tree that are good for sawlog, use those parts of the tree that are good for veneer, and then just leave the rest of it lying on the ground and let it rot or let it burn.' If there is a market for it, why not allow that waste to be used for the benefit of workers, their families and their communities and, at the end of the day, to lessen the huge foreign debt that this country suffers from?

Why pick on Tasmania, which has the highest percentage of world heritage area of any state in the Commonwealth and, indeed, of any country in the world?

         —At 12 noon yesterday, the bankrupt New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party had its debt with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia increased to a little over $10 million. This was made up of its mortgage of around $6 million, secured by a building worth less than $2 million, and overdraft facilities of a further $4 million, secured by the expectation of its receiving $3 million or so in election funding. I will restate that: at 12 noon yesterday, the New South Wales ALP's debt with the CBA had risen to a little over $10 million.

         It is only because of this extraordinary generosity from the Commonwealth Bank that the New South Wales ALP has been able to massively outspend the Liberal Party on advertising in the state election campaign. However, it is evident that the New South Wales ALP is technically insolvent, with its liabilities hugely exceeding the value of its assets, and is surviving only because of the generosity of the bank and other creditors—particularly the union movement, one of whose most senior members is a board member of the Commonwealth Bank—who are owed about $4 million.

         This raises a very serious question for directors of the Commonwealth Bank relating to its responsibilities under the companies code and also for the directors of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd, Messrs John Della Bosca and Terry Sheahan. It is an offence for directors to continue to trade while knowing their company is incapable of repaying its debts as and when they fall due. How can the New South Wales ALP pay its debts when it clearly lacks the necessary security? I understand the bank has already made a request that the ALP's federal property in Canberra be provided as additional security over this debt in New South Wales.

         On 31 March, just a week after the New South Wales state election, the federal ALP will decide whether to provide this or other interventionary help to the bankrupt New South Wales Labor Party. Before the state election next Saturday, voters in New South Wales should be made aware that the New South Wales Labor Party cannot run its own finances, let alone a state government's finances. There are the examples of WA Inc. and disastrous Labor governments in South Australia and Victoria to confirm the fact that you cannot trust Labor with money. Unless there is federal ALP intervention, the directors of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd—that is, the bottomless hole into which the Labor Party's money has been dribbling; the Commonwealth Bank's money has been dribbling; and, as the Commonwealth Bank is the people's bank, I guess the people's money has been dribbling—know they can only continue in business with the support of their banker, the Commonwealth Bank.

         I have dealt with the failure of the Labor Party and its wholly owned disastrous subsidiary Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd to meet the basic reporting requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. It is also reasonable to wonder whether the auditors have advised directors of Labor Centenary House that they are only continuing in business with the support of their banker and that they are technically insolvent. If the auditor has, then the directors of that company have a particular requirement to behave in a way that does not, in fact, damage those people who may be induced to lend them money. Not only that; it is illegal to continue to trade if you know you are insolvent and are unable to repay your debts as and when they fall due.

There is a special requirement under section 232(4) of the Corporations Law for directors of a company, that is, the bank, trading with an insolvent company—it is understood that the Labor Party and its subsidiary are insolvent—to discharge their duties `with a degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person . . . would exercise'. The New South Wales Crown Solicitor has advised that `a reasonable director or officer would not normally lend money to, or enter financial arrangements with, a company which they believe to be insolvent or expect will be unable to repay its debts'.

         This is where it gets really interesting, because the bank has already put the Labor Party in the category of being unable to repay its debts, by transferring the debt from its normal accounts into the hands of its group credit control section as a potential bad debt against which a provision for bad debt would be raised. That is what the group credit control section is all about. In other words, the bank has acknowledged that this is a potential bad debt and has continued to trade in the sense of providing an extended overdraft accommodation to the Labor Party in New South Wales.

I hope the directors of the bank have taken legal advice because, in the absence of any assurances from the federal ALP that it will back this debt, the New South Wales ALP is clearly technically bankrupt and the bank's directors run a personal risk in allowing the debt to blow out even further.

Here we have a situation where a bankrupt organisation, the Labor Party in New South Wales—and Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd—is waging an election using money it does not have. It frankly has no right to borrow it, as it is already massively in debt, in order to outspend its political opponent.

          —I raise a similar matter to that raised by Senator Baume which relates to the Labor Party and the way in which it is conducting itself in the lead-up to this state election. Senator Baume has quite rightly pointed out the very perilous financial position that the state ALP is in. It reminds one of that expression in politics: if you can't govern yourself, how on earth can you govern the state? That certainly applies to the state ALP in New South Wales.

          The main matter I want to discuss today arose out of question time yesterday. It relates to the non-answer to my question given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) about the way in which this federal Labor government is manipulating public policy to assist the state ALP government to win on Saturday. This is really about Richo's doctrine of `win at any cost'—manipulate public policy in any way whatsoever to make sure that you win; that is the important thing.

          Senator Evans yesterday responded to my question about the three ways in which this government has manipulated public policy. The first relates to interest rates, the second relates to woodchipping policy, and the third relates to the third runway. I want to deal with those three matters.

          We have had a history over the last six months where this government has consistently raised interest rates. The background to this is that it missed its chance with the budget last year in bringing down a responsible budget and in cutting government expenditure at a time when it had room to do so. If the government had done this, it would have headed off a great many of the rises in interest rates. We had a very rapid succession of interest rate rises throughout the end of last year. Now there seems to be a rather strange pause. All the main economic commentators are calling for interest rate rises. They see that the inadequate fiscal policy of the federal Labor government will bring about an inevitable rise. But we are not having those rises, are we? Why not? Because Labor fears it is going to be slaughtered at the polls once people realise that, come Monday, interest rate rises will well and truly be back on the agenda next year.

          The second way in which the government has manipulated public policy relates to the commencement of the full operation of the third runway at Sydney international airport. We all realise that completion of the control tower was delayed, and this is the main reason that we have not gone up to the full number of flight movements. But the control tower is now completed—and has been for some little time. But, guess what? The government is not actually going to open the control tower to its full operations until April. Why? Because there is an election on March 25, is there not? So, to help its mates again, the government is going to put off the increase in aircraft movements which will result from the full opening of the control tower and facilities. They will increase from 60 to 80 movements a day.

The government had the opportunity to head it off over the last 12 years. It has failed to do that. The people under the flight path are suffering. The bad news for those people is that the suffering is going to increase from next Monday because that is when aircraft movements over these areas will go up from 60 to 80—an increase of one third. Let us hope that the electors who are right under the flight path in places like Gladesville and Drummoyne realise what the inadequate policies of the federal Labor government have done to them.

          The third area I want to deal with relates to the approval for logging in certain forest areas. At last this federal government has quite rightly approved loggings in a number of the state forest areas. But guess what has happened in New South Wales? There has not been any logging. The minister claimed yesterday that the reason for that is delays by the New South Wales government. Today I want to expose that as the absolute lie it is. Minister Souris in New South Wales has contacted the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) nine times in recent weeks about this issue. Jim Snow from the Eden-Monaro electorate of New South Wales has blown the whistle on this one. He admits that New South Wales has provided ample information. Meanwhile, jobs remain in doubt. In Moruya, on the south coast, a sawmill is about to close because of this uncertainty.

          I believe that this Saturday the New South Wales Labor Party will be judged by these types of manipulations that have been put forward—win at any cost. We have a situation in which Mr Carr is showing up as a one-man band. The clumsy effort by the federal government to conceal bad news is something that the voters really should weigh up on Saturday. I believe that the people of New South Wales are waking up to the ALP's Richo doctrine—win at any cost. I think the ALP tactic of stalling on vital issues at the expense of the wellbeing of the people of Australia is now crystal clear.

         —This is the first opportunity I have had to take issue with the response Senator Evans gave yesterday in question time to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Richard Alston. It is quite obvious that the ALP in this chamber is trying to throw mud at the Premier of New South Wales even in circumstances where the issue is outside the premier's control. I must say that Senator Evans has a good public record of accuracy in responding to questions. However, I think it is unfortunate that yesterday afternoon, in election fever and in his haste to make a point before Saturday's election, Senator Evans's understanding of superannuation law did prove to be defective in his vain attempt to lay blame at the feet of the New South Wales Premier.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The response was really about a nominal, or paper, loss of the New South Wales government's superannuation fund arising from a decline in property values. I remind the Senate that investment of superannuation funds is not, as Senator Evans alleges, the prime responsibility of the premier; the responsibility for the investment of superannuation moneys rests with trustees, who in turn may appoint managers to seek balanced portfolios in superannuation funds. That is the first point.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second misleading point is that the New South Wales government superannuation fund lost a significant amount of taxpayers' funds. This implies to most people that there was a disposal of assets resulting in a loss, whereas the loss is, in fact, a paper loss based on a valuation due to a decline in property values. I believe Senator Evans's answer was a good example of an emphasis on what I term short-termism. Senator Evans failed to recognise that there is a need to look at superannuation from a long-term perspective, not in terms of short-termism and making political points in such an environment. Superannuation is similar to an investment in your own home—which may be the most significant investment or asset a person will have. I suggest that if you valued your own home nominally every month and looked at the interest rates movements, you would have a lot less sleep.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third point I want to make is that Senator Evans's response adds to a growing scepticism in the general community about the value of superannuation. There is no point in the government spending millions of dollars—I think an extra $300 thousand was committed in the last budget—on educational campaigns designed to improve people's understanding of and confidence in superannuation when the Leader of the Government in the Senate effectively undermines people's confidence in superannuation, which he did yesterday when he attacked nominal property loss.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Fourthly, the minister did not bring the Senate up to date. Property values, since he was provided with that information, have significantly changed resulting in an improvement in the overall values of the superannuation fund. I believe he should have brought the Senate up to date in relation to the updated values. After all, they are only nominal values rather that realised ones.

         But the truth of the matter, Mr President, is that the economy is in good shape. The growth that is occurring has been the kind of growth that has made it possible for us to produce over 500,000 new jobs in the last two years as compared with the election commitment about which you were so sceptical two years ago. We promised 500,000 jobs over the course of the three-year life of this parliament. That generated some horse laughs and guffaws from the other side at the time. It was thought to be an impossible objective but, not only has it been not impossible, we have produced it in just over two years in office. That is an outstanding result because we have reduced the unemployment rate below nine per cent, with a participation rate at the moment that, had it been prevailing in the early 1980s, would have had unemployment running at under five per cent.

         I suspect that we saw a very good example of the opposition's commitment to the environment when the Leader of the Opposition appointed someone as shadow minister for the environment with no record and no interest in the environment portfolio and environment issues. The proof is very clear. The shadow environment portfolio is so important to the opposition that the first action of Mr Howard was to drop the shadow portfolio from the shadow cabinet to one of the most junior ministries possible. The former shadow minister for the environment—the third shadow minister that I have faced in the year that I have been minister for the environment—was  ranked eighth in the shadow cabinet. I congratulate Senator Kemp for getting the job. He is ranked about 26th. He has dropped 20 places down the batting order and is ranked sixth from the bottom. What a vote of confidence!

How is it that the New Zealand economy can grow at 6.3 per cent a year with a current account deficit of only two per cent of GDP? When Australia grows at six per cent a year, its current account deficit blows out to crisis proportions—six per cent of GDP. How is it that New Zealand, a basket case 10 years ago, has been able to manage a 10 per cent appreciation of its dollar against the Australian dollar since Christmas? Is the minister not ashamed that Australia cannot achieve a similar growth rate and an unemployment rate as low as New Zealand's while still maintaining a solid currency and interest rates as low as New Zealand's and a lower current account deficit? Will the minister concede that the weakening Australian dollar is really due to the government's poor record on fiscal responsibility and a lack of leadership on micro-economic reform in this country?

It had much higher levels of unemployment and much lower levels of industrial and commercial activity than has been the case in this country, with many New Zealanders having to come to Australia to seek work as a result because of the deeply depressed condition that that economy was in.

         We are concerned, as are many others around the world, that the events of the last week have resulted in over 20 deaths and almost 500 injured, including protesters and police. The troubles began back on 12 March when gunmen in a taxi opened fire on three coffee houses and a bakery frequented by Alawites. Those attacks were followed the next day by street demonstrations involving clashes between police and some 2,000 demonstrators. The unrest spread through the cities that I have mentioned, with several thousand demonstrators clashing with police in Ankara on 14 March.

         As to the military offensive against the forces of the Kurdistan Workers Party, this followed an ambush of a Turkish military convoy by Kurdish rebels in eastern Turkey on 18 March, which left 15 Turkish soldiers dead and 25 wounded. As I said in this place last year, the Australian government, while recognising the real threat that the PKK does pose for Turkey's internal security, urges Turkey to exercise restraint in its fight against terrorism and to do all it can to bring a lasting peace to the south-east region of the country. In particular, we do urge the Turkish government to ensure that its troops return to Turkey as quickly as possible and that, more importantly, the lives of innocent civilians are safeguarded.

In return, the government expects the unemployed to accept a reasonable offer of work or assistance or to face suspension or cancellation of their income support. This is, I suppose, described best as reciprocal obligation. That reciprocal obligation emphasises the partnership between the government and the unemployed to move closer to full employment. In all cases, persons on unemployment allowances are warned in advance that their payment will be stopped and a deferment period applied if they breach this reciprocal obligation—for example, by refusing to take up a job or suitable work.

         It is true, as Senator Woodley says, that the Department of Social Security issued a national instruction in December last explaining to staff the changes to the Social Security Act in relation to deferment periods and advising that no social security payment will be available to persons in hardship during a deferment period and that those persons indeed may be referred to welfare agencies for assistance.

         However, it is also important to note that the department has its own assistance for people who are going through hardship, and indeed people may be able to stay on that hardship provision arrangement through the department, particularly if they appeal against the decision for deferment. So while people are under appeal they will be able to continue their payment and will be able to continue to receive assistance through the department. So there are two ways in which people in a deferment period, and particularly those facing hardship, are assisted.

         In relation to the last point that Senator Woodley raised about whether or not the Department of Social Security is now depending on welfare agencies in a way that has not been done before, no, that is not true at all. The government has had a long-term cooperative arrangement with the relative and geographically near welfare agencies whereby people have often been referred from the Department of Social Security for the appropriate assistance that welfare agencies can give and the Department of Social Security cannot—housing would be one example. That arrangement between the department and welfare agencies has been in existence for a long time, and these deferment arrangements simply build on that arrangement between welfare agencies and the department.

The proposed structure of the RDO for the northern province will take into account the population dispersion rather than the total area of the region.

Unfortunately, their definition of regional development is different from mine. It seems that state and federal government deciding the boundaries is hardly regional development. When I went to a meeting in the south-west, I discovered that it was almost impossible to reach some kind of consensus in the south because there was so much diversity. I ask the Minister for Housing and Regional Development through the minister representing him here: how on earth can decent community based regional development be formed in this way? How can you avoid a situation such as that in the Hunter Valley where the process ends up providing a subsidy for a very inefficient industry like Australian Defence Industries?

When Mr McLachlan returned his copy of the secret women's document, he said then that it was the end of the matter. It was not. When he resigned, the Leader of the Opposition said that it was the end of the matter, but it was not. When the box of documents was eventually returned, once again Mr Howard said that was the end of the matter. But it is not.

Minister, can you simply deny that the Federal Airports Corporation has considered, or is considering, the feasibility of the construction of a fourth runway at Mascot which could run parallel to the two existing north-south runways? Is such a runway seen by the FAC as the means of coping with the extra demand that will result from the year 2000 Olympics? Isn't this why your government has consistently failed to take any meaningful action with regard to the development of the Badgerys Creek airport?

But there is one thing of which I do have strong personal knowledge—that is, most of the non-stop representations that I got from members of the opposition, the federal coalition, to get the third runway built came from National Party corner in the Senate. So if Senator Macdonald wants to get up here and wring his hands about how terrible it is for the noise problems at the most used airport in Australia, he had better give some thought to the numerous representations which his party and his coalition made to get the thing built.

Does the present spending include any money to clean up Heathfield's sewage treatment or any of the other ecological restoration along the Sturt Creek?

I do have some awareness of this as well because I live on the beach near the Patawalonga, and I can remember that last year, on the two days which were sunny enough to go for a swim on the beach, the Patawalonga had been cleaned out and no-one was able to swim safely in the whole coastal area around Adelaide. I think that is something Senator Coulter would be aware of and something that needs to be taken into account when assessing the particular problem of the Patawalonga. The fact that at high tourist periods people cannot swim on Adelaide's beaches is obviously of concern. It is more of a concern because of the health problems that flow from an area like the Patawalonga. That is why the Resource Assessment Commission's coastal zone inquiry identified the Pat Basin as one of the worst polluted waterways in Australia and that is why the federal government has been involved in the clean-up of the Patawalonga Basin and the catchment area under the better cities program in South Australia.

         The better cities program, of course, in this instance is complementing the state government's water catchment legislation to provide a comprehensive and environmentally sustainable approach to the clean-up of the Patawalonga Basin and catchment.

Could he also explain whether the New South Wales ALP will be able to pay, as he says, `every cent' of its debt?

It comes not just from the comments but from the way questions are asked, the way questions are answered and from the exchanges across the chamber. We are all guilty of this. What happens is that you are asked at a particular stage to say what is good and what is bad. When you make a judgment, that is attacked.

          The only way out of all this is for everybody to go back to what we should be doing: to ask the questions reasonably and not to ask loaded questions and thereby attract loaded answers. What we should be doing is asking fewer dorothy dixers—we should be reformed on this side.

          —Mr President, on the point of order: before Senator Baume asks for a withdrawal, I want to make the point, with your indulgence, that there are two ways in which a matter can be withdrawn in the Senate. One is by the President intervening, which he does have the power to do at any time; but if there are 50 interjections going on across the chamber it is difficult to do so. The second method, which I thought Senator Baume was going to get to but did not get the call to do, is to ask for a formal withdrawal. If that were done, it would then be incumbent on you, Mr President, to ask Senator Evans to withdraw.

          But I would think for the future of this chamber we should adopt as a procedure that it is a duty of any senator who hears something offensive to ask you, Mr President, to ask for a withdrawal at that point. Given the degree and amount of interjections, it is possible on some occasions for the President to intervene of his own volition, but not on all occasions. I would suggest that in future you make it a responsibility of senators—

Therefore, this chamber should adopt the process that if something is offensive to a senator that senator should take an objection and the withdrawal process should go through. But, given the robust nature of debate and multiple interjections, the opposition contention that the President can police every remark in this chamber is not feasible. To ask him to do so selectively will disadvantage other senators and any possibility of being able to enforce a uniform rule. I am sorry to interrupt you, Senator Baume. I now cede the floor to you.

          The behaviour exhibited in this chamber would not be acceptable on a football field. Having played football for 20 years and supporting it for 50, I make the point that the kind of name-calling and disgraceful behaviour exhibited in the chamber and which we see from time to time from the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives would not be tolerated by the Australian public nor by footballers anywhere in this country. I wish there to be no imputation made against those who play football. As I understand it, umpires will not tolerate the kind of name-calling that goes on in this place, whether it be in Australian Rules or any other code of football.

It is a ridiculous assertion that these are equivalent to the other opportunities. We had two opportunities to ask questions; the opposition had four or five. Whether opposition senators ask a supplementary is up to them, but to equate a supplementary as a full question is silly in the extreme.

        At the state conference of the Australian Labor Party on 12 June 1993, Mr Carr said `strictly time limited planning and environmental approval processes'. The preamble to my question related to Mr Michael Egan. In New South Wales they call him `You can't stop progress' Egan because he is promising everything. He is promising to bypass ICAC—for example, in relation to the tendering for the Sydney showground sites, which Senator McMullan referred to in answering a question yesterday. The fact is that the state government in New South Wales has to tender for sites for those types of things because that is a requirement of ICAC. You cannot bypass the rules and the considerations that are in place.

         Michael Egan wants to return to the old `a wink and a nod' deals that the Labor Party enjoyed in its previous time in government in New South Wales. ICAC has stopped those types of deals. It now ensures that those things are done properly. Michael Egan also said that he will do away with the proper tendering processes. He is also quoted as saying that the EP&amp;A act would be bypassed if anyone got in the way of any major investments.

         All I wanted the minister to do today was tell us directly whether or not he agreed with that. If he said he did not agree with it, fair enough. By his answer, it seems as though he has agreed that he is very happy for Michael Egan or any members of the Labor Party in New South Wales, if they were to win government—which they will not, by the way—to bypass some of the rules that this minister has so very clearly stuck up for. Yesterday the minister, in replying to a question by Senator Kernot, said that the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act was very firmly set in concrete and it could not be bypassed.

If that were to happen, it would be completely out of sync with the federal minister. The minister agreed with that today, and I think that is something that shows up the Carr and Egan proposals in New South Wales for what they are: in favour of bypassing any environmental protection security in that state.

I believe that the minister stands condemned, as are Mr Michael Egan and Mr Bob Carr for the fact that they would bypass those acts in New South Wales.

        The minister made the point that we are very much a part of a global environment and many global problems affect the way in which we live. Ultimately, that means that there is a requirement for global solutions to those problems. The minister also indicated that the question of environmental policy has been a matter of some debate in this parliament over a number of years. This debate has taken place during estimates committees and in this chamber. Over a long period, Senator Kemp has indicated in his public statements his attitude towards the environment.

         It appears to me that what does not seem to have sunk into minds of members of the Liberal Party at the moment is that there are certain environmental issues, of which climate change is one example, which cannot be effectively advanced without international cooperation, standards, monitoring and a certain amount of international peer group pressure. The scientific evidence is overwhelming. The seriousness of this problem and other international problems means that Australia must be part of those international conventions. It has been the case for centuries that there have been treaties and conventions between nations and governments for mutual benefit and with a mutual understanding between the parties involved.

         In recent times, the coalition's position on international isolationism runs very much contrary to the realities confronting us today. If we look at the question of a world which is increasingly interdependent, we have to examine ways in which we can address environmental problems on an international basis. Of course, those problems are growing in number and complexity. It strikes me as particularly odd that we should have a coalition position being put forward which essentially stands contrary to that fundamental reality.

         It strikes me that some of these issues are not confined to matters of state borders.

Frankly, you cannot possibly try to have the sorts of consultations and negotiations that are required to achieve the sort of protection for the environment that is necessary and which the people of this country demand by relying upon arcane state governments which throughout recent times have demonstrated their hostility to protection of Australian people and the Australian environment.

         —That was an interesting comment about Mr Goss and Mr Cain. I do not know how they would view the remarks that Senator Carr has just made and his condemnation of them. This issue shows me why John Cain wrote a book in which he cast doubt on Senator Carr's mental capacities. Senator Carr has again demonstrated precisely the case it makes. When people do no research or reading, when all they are thinking of is trying to score some pathetic political point and they then do that rather badly, they do not advance public debate.

         Senator Carr has raised a few issues in relation to international conventions. The coalition has always taken a responsible and supportive role in relation to the treatment of international global issues through conventions. Senator Carr's government has been concerned about some conventions. He will recall raising the Basel convention. His government was very unhappy with the results of that convention.

         —I will only rise for a minute and a half because other people want to speak. I rise because Senator Carr indicated that the government is proud of its implementation of international conventions. If Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995 is supported by this chamber, the government cannot be proud. This government is attempting to undermine the convention related to that bill. The convention deals with issues of life and death. Important as the environmental conventions are—and they are important—there is no convention so important as the one that gives protection to persons who have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group.

I take this opportunity—and I apologise for doing it—to urge honourable senators to have a very good look at this matter in time for the debate on the subject, which I understand is to occur next week.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Evans), to a question without notice asked by me this day, relating to comparisons between the Australian and New Zealand economies.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe the minister could not answer the question about the critical differences between the two economies. Let me point out a few of the facts. New Zealand is running a substantial domestic budget surplus currently equal to 0.8 per cent of GDP. It has maintained a strong export performance, with export growth of 14 per cent in the past 12 months. While matching Australia's economic growth, it is currently growing at 6.3 per cent in the year to September last. It has managed a relatively low level of current account deficit equivalent to only two per cent of GDP. Compare that with six per cent here for a similar level of economic growth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The question I asked the minister was: why can't Australia achieve a combination of strong growth without blowing its current account deficit out to crisis proportions? After all, New Zealand has proved it can be done. It can be done only if the government adopts a responsible fiscal policy designed to eliminate the domestic budget deficit, return it to surplus and keep it balanced or in surplus. Through sound fiscal policies the New Zealand government is proposing to achieve further and increasing domestic budget surpluses in the next few years.

         Compare that with Australia, where we have run huge deficits over the last several years in spite of the fact that our economy has been growing fast. No wonder the financial markets have been confused over the past few years and no wonder the rate of interest on 10-year bonds in this country is now two per cent higher than on similar bonds in New Zealand. Two years ago interest rates in the two countries were in parity. Now 10-year bonds are two per cent higher. That is the extra premium we are paying. The chief economist with UBS, Mr Stephen Roberts, was quoted in this morning's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        He went on to say that Australian policy in this area was in a state of flux and that uncertainty about the size of the budget deficit for the next year was deterring international investors from buying the Australian dollar or supporting local financial markets.

         In the latest survey of international competitiveness released in September 1994 by the International Institute of Management Development, New Zealand came in ninth. Australia was 15th. Despite high growth rates, the New Zealand economy has continued to contain inflation with underlying inflation expected to be only 1.5 per cent for this current financial year. Ours is looking to be running towards four or five per cent towards the end of this year.

         In addition to the above economic program, the New Zealand economy has begun to generate jobs. That country's unemployment rate has now dropped to around 7.5 per cent. In addition to this, the value of the New Zealand dollar has surged over recent months and has appreciated by a huge 10 per cent against the Australian dollar since Christmas. The chief executive of Bankers Trust New Zealand, Mr Gavin Walker, was quoted in this morning's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         as saying that the major reasons for the surge in the New Zealand dollar were the new Fiscal Responsibility Act which requires the New Zealand government to be accountable and responsible for its long-term economic policy direction. In addition, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is obliged to take all necessary action to keep the underlying rate of inflation under two per cent. Fiscal transparency, fiscal responsibility and a greater dedication to real micro-economic reform are the only answers to our current economic problems. If New Zealand can do it, so can Australia—but we need the right sort of leadership.

         It is vitally important for us to consider what the Australian Labor Party did during the Victorian state election and the last federal election. It ran the spook campaigns, saying, `If you vote Liberal you will get an economy like New Zealand's.' Of course, that is exactly what we wanted—a country with growth, where inflation was under control and where the foreign debt could be wiped out in a matter of three years. That should be compared with what this country suffers from—a foreign debt of $164 billion, or $12,000 for each man, woman and child. That is the sort of foreign debt that our country is struggling with. Yet the Labor Party went to the election in Victoria and the last federal election, saying, `A vote for the Liberal Party and the National Party is a vote for a New Zealand type economy.'

         We have heard here today, so ably set out by Senator Gibson, that New Zealand is now truly bringing home the bacon, which is what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised he would do for us. Once again, this comparison with New Zealand goes to show the way in which the Labor Party misrepresents the economic situation not only here but also overseas in New Zealand. The point made by Senator Gibson is a very good one and the people of Australia, and in particular the state of New South Wales, ought to remember that the economic promises being made by Labor are ones that Labor will never keep.

        I am not one to attack ministers, particularly for their answers to questions, but I was very disappointed today that Senator Crowley spent most of the time not answering my question.

         I point out that the penalty, the stick, was applied some months before the legislation supporting welfare clients, the carrot, came into effect. In any case, the Democrats moved an amendment to do what the minister claimed is happening—that is, to allow two further fortnightly payments before the benefit is cut off. However, the government and the coalition overturned that amendment. The effect of this is set out very well in an article in `Rights Review' by the Welfare Rights Centre. It states:

       <para>
        I am afraid the minister in her answer was not correct. My question was about the shift of government responsibility to welfare agencies. Those welfare agencies around the country tell me that their client load has increased significantly, if not exponentially. They cannot cope with the additional load. They are having to send clients away. They are having to limit days and times at which clients can come to them for assistance. They are now having to deal with verbal and physical abuse because they are unable to cope with the shift from government to them.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The minister did not answer my question about whether the government would resource the welfare agencies. Instead, she claimed that the government had an agreement with welfare agencies. Well, I say to the Senate that I expect that agreement is about to end.

Some time ago now there were changes to the disability support pension and sickness benefits. With the toughening of the disability support pension requirements and with the very strict adherence to the rules for sickness benefits, we now have a large number of people who qualify for neither. These people are not well. They are not able to work on a full-time basis. Some are lucky to be able to hold a job even part time due to the state of their health. However, because they do not qualify as permanently disabled to the severity level required for the DSP, but their sickness is not short term, they are forced back onto jobstart and onto unemployment benefits.

The AMA has done a great deal of work in trying to educate the community on the very real link between unemployment and poor health. We are talking about the most vulnerable people in this country being put under even more pressure by a government that literally does not care.

         —Senator Lees has raised some real concerns. Certainly we will have to look closely at the matters Senator Lees has raised. I want to tackle one of the comments she made, which I think is the nub of the real problem. We have a government that has been in office for 12 years and its policies have failed. Its policies have comprehensively failed to deliver greater social justice. In order to support those comments, I point to the fact that we have still very high levels of unemployment. We are supposed to be in the midst of a period of considerable  growth in the economy, yet the unemployment figures are still extraordinarily high—800,000 plus.

         Long-term employment is still showing signs of increasing. Many of our young people are without jobs and, in fact, have no prospect of jobs under the sorts of policies followed by the Keating government. One of the most astonishing features of all is that under the Keating government there has been an increasing gap between rich and poor in this community.

         You would have to say that it is an astonishing feature that a Labor government, which has been in office for so long, has so comprehensively failed on one of the planks that it continues to highlight. How can the Keating Labor Party be a party of equity and justice when unemployment remains at extremely high levels—still one of the worst in the developed world? How can it be a government of equity and justice when so many of our young people still cannot find jobs? Above all, how can it be a government of equity and justice when there is an increasing gap between rich and poor in this community?

I try to be scrupulously fair when I call people who are seeking to respond to a minister's statement. I call on both sides of the chamber, fairly and evenly, and I try to include the Democrats and the other minority parties according to the proportion of their representation. If somebody does not get the call, I regret that, but if Senator Neal had stayed here she might have been able to induce the minister to give her an extra five minutes.

         —I am very pleased to see that Senator Kemp has also supported this motion. There is no doubt that this is indeed a very urgent matter, and it is urgent for four quite important interrelated reasons. Firstly, the composition of the global atmosphere is changing faster than at any time in the earth's history. There is abundant evidence of this; it is a matter of fact, it is not a matter of debate any more. The exact consequences are unknown. However, there is a strengthening consensus among scientists that this will result in temperature rise, climate change, sea level rise, very substantial changes in our agricultural practices, and things such as national parks all being found in entirely the wrong places and, therefore, massive loss of species.

         Secondly, it is important because this is the first time that the human species has had such impact on a global scale. While there have been extinctions and desertification in many parts of the world, on this occasion we are talking about global change brought about by human intervention. Thirdly, as I think all senators would know, next week the Australian government will be meeting with other governments in Berlin to thrash out the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

         Fourthly—and this comes to the nub of this motion—Australia's record as a greenhouse gas emitting nation is poor, and our record in tackling the problem, even after it was recognised and after targets for reduction of emissions were set, has been absolutely abysmal. For all these reasons, the matter is urgent.

         Everyone in this chamber must agree with the first part of this motion. Indeed, the government itself has admitted that its strategy has failed to meet the targets it announced back in 1989, that is, the 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005 after stabilisation in the year 2000. The minister has admitted it. The Auditor-General, for instance, found that one year into the strategy it was already a year behind, indicating a lack of any real commitment and support for adequate resources to meet these targets.

         The government has always given itself an out by qualifying its targets with the proviso that action to tackle the greenhouse problems should not have negative impacts on industry or the economy. Its interpretation of this qualifier has always erred on the side of no action. It has been overly persuaded by those in industry and also by narrow, economic advisers that any effective attack on greenhouse would be damaging to existing industries. It has failed to recognise that action will be forced upon it by the imperatives of climate change whether it likes it or not, and that the longer we as a nation delay the worse the impact will be, not only in environmental terms but because the alternative industries will not have been developed in Australia.

         Australia's record is indeed woeful. On a per capita basis we are among the worst greenhouse polluters in the world. While many other nations have improved their per capita emissions, on the basis of emissions per unit of GDP we have lagged behind. To quote a few figures, the total emissions per unit of GDP in 1990 were 1.92 tonnes of CO(2) equivalent per $US1,000 of GDP. The figure for the USA, which is generally regarded as a bad greenhouse polluter, was only 1.04 tonnes, and Canada 0.99 tonnes. Australia's relatively poor position has become substantially worse over the last two decades. From 1987 to 1992 Australia's energy related CO(2) emissions grew by more than the OECD average—by more than 13 per cent compared with the OECD average of only five per cent.

         Lest it be asserted that the reasons for our high per capita use of fossil fuels lie in our vast country and the use of these fuels in transport, let me put on the record that compared with the OECD our transport contribution is slightly less than the average. It is not more. We have failed to make a number of changes in the other areas where changes could have been made, and in this failure the federal government has been conspicuous.

         As a nation, we have failed to redirect many industries such as the electricity industry in ways which would have benefited both the industries and the country as a whole. Enormous attention has been given to the electricity generation industry from the economic rationalist viewpoint without any consideration being given to the environmental impacts of this industry. We have seen efforts being devoted to the interlinking of the grid and the break-up of the industry into smaller competing units devoted to generation distribution and retailing. The simple addition of a requirement that the state legislation under which these utilities have operated be changed so that, instead of being electricity suppliers, they or their supercedents become the suppliers of energy services would indeed have had enormous effect. Yet the government has failed to do this. Thus, instead of these utilities being bound by these several acts to supply electricity, and therefore, in a similar way to private industry, being strongly oriented toward maximising their production and sales of electricity, they would and should become the sellers of energy services. Hot water is needed by people, but not necessarily through electricity. The lifetime costs—that is, the total costs over time—of providing hot water in this way are cheaper than the total costs of the electric alternative.

         What has developed is a situation in which the utilities amortise the large up-front capital costs of installing more generating capacity while the up-front capital costs of solar units are being borne by individual consumers. In the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, the federal government could have insisted—indeed, could still insist—on this change. It could force the states down this economically as well as environmentally desirable road by insisting that no more heavy generating equipment be imported for fossil fuel generating stations for the next 30 years.

         While the contribution to greenhouse amelioration from this development may be small, the contribution to the newer non-greenhouse technologies developed in Australia would be considerable. Very considerable savings in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be made through greater efficiency in house placement, house design and insulation. Has the federal government taken any lead in any of these areas? The answer must be a resounding no.

         A national planning criterion which takes into account the orientation of housing so as to minimise energy use could easily be achieved through building codes. The federal government should reintroduce tax relief for retro-fitting insulation and insist on its use in new housing. Solar units could attract tax benefits. The government has given no thought to these simple measures which would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but substantially improve the comfort of ordinary Australians and give support to Australian industry, which must become the industry of the 21st century.

         —I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important urgency motion and to a number of issues Senator Coulter raised in his contribution in relation to greenhouse science and potential impacts, which underpin this issue. Emissions resulting from human activity have substantially increased the atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, this century. These increases will enhance the natural greenhouse effect, resulting in an additional warming of the earth's surface.

         The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, estimates that the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will be 75 per cent to 220 per cent higher than pre-industrial levels by the year 2100. Model calculations indicate that increases in greenhouse concentrations will lead to increases in global mean temperature of about 0.3 degrees per decade. This is greater than seen over the past 10,000 years and is estimated to lead to a sea level rise, increased likelihood of extreme weather events, possible threats to biodiversity, changes in agricultural production patterns and the need for new infrastructure.

         The Commonwealth government is concerned about the potential impacts of global warming and is committed to playing an effective role in the global response. A clear signal of the government's concern was given when Australia became one of the first countries to sign and ratify the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Under the convention, Australia is committed to adopting and reporting on national policies to limit emissions and enhance sinks of greenhouse gases with the aim of returning net emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, subject to caveats concerning special circumstances that countries might face. I am pleased to note that the convention entered into force in March of last year and that over 100 countries have now ratified the framework convention.

         In relation to a number of domestic issues, greenhouse issues do cut across a broad spectrum of activities. Greenhouse concerns are especially important in areas such as energy supply and use, transport, land management and urban planning. For this reason it is important to recognise the value of an effective greenhouse response strategy for economic as well as environmental reasons. The government has adopted a national greenhouse response strategy as a first step towards meeting its obligation under the framework convention. The strategy contains a range of measures designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sinks, conduct further research, prepare for potential impacts of climate change on Australia and inform and educate the community and decision makers. The government is committed not only to the national greenhouse response strategy as it stands but to working with all relevant parties to further develop a range of measures to advance the strategy. The national greenhouse response strategy is a living document which will continue to develop and evolve. In December the government reaffirmed the importance of an effective greenhouse response program, and it will be considering further measures in advance of the first conference of the parties to the climate change convention.

         In considering these further measures, we need to take account of our current situation. It is now only five years from the end of the decade.

         On a different note, there seems to be increasing recognition that responses to greenhouse need not necessarily be costly; in fact, they can be very beneficial economically as well as environmentally. In the short to medium term, a major focus of any greenhouse response program is likely to be on energy efficiency. By using energy more wisely, industry can save money and can free up resources for other investments.

         The general community can also benefit from using its energy dollars more wisely. Response measures in the land management area can have a significant economic spin-off, as they can help significantly in terms of the restoration of degraded lands. In urban planning, measures which reduce greenhouse emissions can also have economic benefit, as they make urban areas more efficient and competitive as well as better and more vibrant places in which to live. I think we need to recognise that there are also potentially serious costs from inaction in this area. These include environmental costs, especially threats to biodiversity, potential costs of lost agricultural production, necessary new investments that would have to be looked at to deal with the rise in sea level and increased health costs. In relation to health particularly, doing nothing could be a very expensive option.

         Perhaps the most important change that is taking place is a growing recognition that greenhouse response is not a matter for government action alone. While the Commonwealth will continue to have a major role in leading a national response, there is a serious limit to what the Commonwealth government can do on its own. The national greenhouse response  strategy recognised the need for a partnership between all levels of government. There have been a number of recent events which indicate that other governments are facing up to their greenhouse responsibilities, especially in the energy area. New South Wales and Victoria are developing internal markets for electricity by separating generation, transmission and distribution, and by introducing competitive sourcing of both existing and new sources of supply.

         Western Australia is considering options to introduce greater competition into its energy market. The WA government recently announced the construction of a new cogeneration power plant at Kwinana, which will use natural gas and result in 60 per cent less emissions than a coal fired-power plant. The largest wind farm in Australia has also opened in WA, saving $650,000 in fuel costs, and a large grid connected photovoltaic power plant has been established. South Australia has made some commitment to have 20 per cent of its energy sourced from renewables by the year 2004. Queensland has recently announced a package of programs designed to promote energy efficiency and renewables.

         Over the last few months, the government has been developing a new package of response measures. This has been a difficult and time consuming process which I think indicates the complexity and importance of this particular issue. There has been wide consultation with a group of stakeholders, business groups, other levels of government, the community, conservation groups and the trade union movement. As part of these consultations, industry has indicated a willingness and an ability to take a much stronger role in a greenhouse response program. We intend to work with industry to see that it delivers on that commitment. I think this is important for both the achievement of direct emission reductions and the recognition of the need for greenhouse response to be taken up by all parties, not only by governments.

         We thought carefully about how a greenhouse response program might best be focused. It is expected that energy will account for about 70 per cent of growth in greenhouse emissions from 1990 to 2000. Clearly, this sector needs special attention. The reform of energy markets, which the Commonwealth is supporting, will in itself serve to move towards least cost delivery of energy services. This will have greenhouse benefits. But it is recognised that we will need to ensure that issues such as demand management are adequately handled in market reforms. The Commonwealth is committed to seeing that this occurs.

We also recognise the importance that is highlighted in the national greenhouse gas inventory of addressing issues related to land management. The inventory indicated that approximately one-third of total net emissions in Australia of carbon dioxide is for land clearing, although I think the government must accept that there is some uncertainty in relation to that data. We will continue to work on a comprehensive approach to greenhouse in developing further measures.

         It is fair to say that Australia has made important progress on greenhouse. I accept that more progress needs to be made. It is important to recognise that looking only at the Commonwealth government will always give a pessimistic picture of how greenhouse response is progressing. This is an issue in which government, industry, other stakeholders and the community all have a significant role to play. The Commonwealth is developing a further package of measures and will be considering it before the first conference of the parties later this month. We will take the necessary time to adequately consider our options, given the vital importance of  greenhouse for both environmental and economic reasons. While cabinet will ultimately decide the precise contents of such a package, I believe it will be a credible and effective package that will certainly take Australia further towards its objectives and targets.

         —I am delighted to hear from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) that the government will have a credible package and that it will produce appropriate results in the area of greenhouse. We have been waiting nine months for the minister's package. The government has known for a very long period that the conference in Berlin is to be held at the end of March. Since last year I have asked the government whether it would be prepared to make a statement on this issue—an issue which everybody agrees is extremely important. We have heard from the government that it will be making an announcement at the end of February, early March or late March. Now we are hearing from the government that perhaps in the next few days or in the next week we will get a statement on this issue.

         The reason we need to have a ministerial statement on this issue is that it will provide an opportunity for parliament to state its views, and it will provide a useful vehicle by which other groups in the community can make their views known. Senator Faulkner stressed, as I think Senator Coulter did, the need for a cooperative approach in the area of tackling greenhouse gas emissions. I believe the best way to ensure a cooperative approach is to take the Australian community into your confidence—in other words, make it clear what you intend to do and what your objectives are, build up community support for those objectives, lobby for them in the international arena, then go to Berlin and try to achieve those particular goals.

         I would not have worded this urgency motion in the way that Senator Coulter has done. I understand and have some sympathy for the concerns that he has because it is a matter of urgency that the parliament debate the greenhouse gas issue. That is particularly so because, within a matter of days, a delegation from this country will be going to Berlin and attempting to negotiate, on behalf of us all, an appropriate agreement. This is one of the few occasions in this parliament that we have had the chance to stand up and get a debate going on this issue.

         I do not think that Senator Coulter, in pointing to the development of greenhouse gas emissions in this country, stressed the special circumstances in which Australia finds itself. It is dependent on fossil fuels. We have a very high growth in population compared with other countries. It is a pity that Senator Faulkner, in his remarks, did not look at some of these special circumstances. He should also have looked at the need for an equitable burden sharing between countries when we finally arrive at a protocol to carry us past the year 2000.

         The government has conceded that it will not meet the targets set at the Rio conference. I think Australia could have done better. I am happy to say on the record that I believe Australia has the capacity to set an example in this area. Indeed, as I go around talking to business and conservation groups I see an enormous willingness in the community to take a constructive approach to tackling greenhouse issues. I think the community is increasingly informed and a government that was prepared to take the people into its confidence could have gone to Berlin with a program that enjoyed the support of the vast proportion of our people. That will not happen for the simple reason that, because of the policy vacuum of this government, we are still waiting for details of its approach.

         One of the other problems that I have with the motion is the way in which we tackle the global problem. Both Senator Coulter and Senator Faulkner stressed that this is a global problem. Therefore, Australia must be one of those countries to encourage an appropriate global response. While Senator Coulter pointed out that, per capita, Australia has relatively high greenhouse gas emissions, on the world scale we produce only one to 1.5 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions.

         Australia can make a contribution and should take the lead but, at the end of the day, whether we can tackle this issue depends on the global response. I would liked to have seen in this urgency motion a recognition that this is a global problem. Then we could look at what can be done to encourage countries to take part in any future greenhouse response. As I understand it, some 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from developing countries. It is suggested that this proportion will continue to grow.

I would venture to suggest that—in the light of the questions today to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and in the light of the events in recent weeks on other environmental issues, most particularly forestry policy—the government is in a total policy vacuum when it comes to the environment. It has tried to woo green voters in so many electorates and on so many issues that it has tied itself up in knots. Basically the Labor Party does not know why it should have environmental policies.

         Former Senator Richardson is a classic case in point. He had no understanding of the environment. He did not even have an identity or an affinity with an environmental issue. He was put in the job of environment minister because Prime Minister Hawke at the time decided there was a vote or two in it. He said, `Hey, get out there, cut a couple of trees and walk across a couple of rivers or in the rivers.' Hey-presto, we had a caring, sharing, tree loving Labor Party. Another former environment minister Mrs Kelly was even worse. She concentrated on trips to Rio where she tried, without success, to demonstrate her understanding of greenhouse and other global environmental activities, while here at home she concentrated on sports grants to marginal seats.

         Of course, farmers will also remember Mrs Kelly for her great depth of understanding of agriculture. Her book on the environment given to school children painted farmers as environmental bandits and as major polluters of the environment. The section on greenhouse, in keeping with her anti-farming theme, noted that greenhouse gases are made up of a number of gases. As Senator Kemp has said, carbon dioxide is the main contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for some 49 per cent, with methane accounting for 18 per cent. The only gases that come from the farms are a part of that 18 per cent. So she was up the wrong tree on that one.

The other day, with Senator Loosley and the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, I went to the opening of the new Nemingha public school. That school was identified as a project to embody the most up-to-date principles of environmental design. Significant energy savings are expected for lighting, heating and cooling. Computer simulations of the thermal performance of various wall types and roof forms were evaluated for the climate of the Tamworth area. The unserviced rural site had to have a self-sufficient water supply and sewage disposal systems. The low-tech approach provided solutions within current costs and budget procedures. It has got heating racks, better lighting facilities and those sorts of things. That is a government of the time doing something for the environment. The state government has taken a step in the right direction and put its money where its mouth is on the environment by cutting down on environmental gases.

Also, no regrets does not mean no dollars. There is an abundance of things that can reduce energy with economic payback periods of under three years. The initial capitalisation means that substantial money may have to be committed as loans which will be repaid. But no regrets means that we look at the likely massive costs from doing nothing. The destruction of agriculture and the effects on the global economy of climatic ecological disaster are a huge cost. Reducing that cost may be cost effective even if we have to spend what looks like a lot of money.

         Federal government has been almost useless so far. Its responses are pitiful at best, a sham at worst. Where is the greenhouse response strategy? Where is the ESD policy? They are on paper but they are not real. Climate change is real, and the regrets will be very real if nothing is done. If the federal government is worried about funding, I guess it should look at other countries which are doing better. They are finding out that they spent money, took initiatives and required industry to do better, and they are doing better now because they did that and they took firm action.

         —I am very pleased to enter this debate and to join my colleagues on this side in supporting the thrust of the motion proposed by the Australian Democrats. But I personally find it a fraction difficult to support the actual wording of the motion that Senator Coulter has put forward. That is why I urge all parties in the Senate to support the very constructive amendment moved by my colleague the shadow minister for the environment, Senator Kemp. It is a pleasure to see Senator Kemp in that position. I know he has done a lot of work in the environmental area. He has been up to North Queensland quite a number of times and shown a very real commitment to and interest in this area, particularly in relation to the areas that I am interested in—the barrier reef and the rain forests in North Queensland.

         I think Senator Kemp's amendment properly sets out the way the Senate should go: we should be criticising the government's failure `to state an effective policy on reducing greenhouse gases'. It is fairly obvious from the debate so far that the government has been all over the shop when it comes to greenhouse gases. It is not often that I quote anyone from the green party, but I refer to an article Mr Bob Brown recently wrote in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         . He sets out quite clearly the absolute hypocrisy and stupidity of the Labor Party in the way it has approached the greenhouse gas debate and all matters in relation to the environment. It is fairly clear that the Democrats have brought this motion forward in a hope to claw back some of the support they have lost to the greens. The greens are, quite obviously from the ACT Assembly elections held recently and the polling that the greens are doing everywhere, taking the vote that the Democrats used to get, and the Democrats are fairly obviously aware of that.

         Mr Brown, the greens spokesman, quite clearly sets out just how poor the Labor Party has been in its management of the environment. That is saying what we have always said: the Labor Party talks big on the environment, it makes lots of promises before elections in the hope of snaring the second preferences of green votes and it has been successful in doing so to date. But after a long learning period the people who have a genuine interest in the environment now realise that the Labor Party is simply not worth giving any credence to when it comes to the environment. So I think it is important that the Senate should adopt Senator Kemp's amendment in which the chamber would criticise the Labor Party's failure to have any sort of effective policy whatsoever for reducing greenhouse gases.

         In a cabinet meeting three weeks ago the federal government cut new spending on its greenhouse gas response package from $100 million to $24 million over four years. That was widely reported. Greenpeace has said that the government is paying only lip-service to targets and that it has developed an isolationist policy. The conservation council has criticised the federal government, the Labor Party, for its apathy towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and so it goes on.

         As opposed to that, the coalition's policy that Senator Kemp and Senator Brownhill have mentioned is a sensible policy. It was put out in our discussion paper and calls for an end to broadacre land clearing with compensation to owners to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states for the loss of further earnings, a no regrets approach to greenhouse reduction strategies, and a nationally coordinated reafforestation program. They are sensible ways to deal with the greenhouse problem, and they are suggestions or policy directions that have received wide endorsement from the Worldwide Fund for Nature in Australia. It supported our proposal. The Australian Conservation Foundation said of our policy that the coalition has thrown down the gauntlet to the Labor government. It has also praised many other parts of our policy. But the Labor Party has said that this all costs too much and that it is not interested in that. It is not really interested in addressing the greenhouse problem.

         As Senator Kemp's amendment says, we have to produce initiatives which will encourage developing countries to join any new convention on greenhouse gas emissions. For all we might say about Australia, we must bear in mind that Australia is responsible for between only one per cent and 1.5 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We have to make sure that developing countries do something about their greenhouse gas emissions. That is where Senator Kemp's amendment very clearly picks up the government's failure to produce any initiatives which would address the real problem: the greenhouse gases being emitted by developing countries. I ask the Senate to support Senator Kemp's amendment.

         —This is a very important debate which should not be a partisan debate about condemning the failure of government. Climate change is an issue that we all face. It is difficult to think of a more important global environment issue than climate change. It is an issue which has the capacity to have major impacts on present and future generations. For that reason, I do not think Senator Kemp's amendment is particularly helpful.

         While I do not agree with Senator Coulter that nothing is being done on this issue, I share his conviction as to the gravity of the challenge that we face over greenhouse gases. For far too long human beings have regarded the environment as an infinitely forgiving system. We erroneously believed that whatever toxic garbage we produced could be absorbed by seas that were too deep, skies that were too large and soils that were too resilient to be seriously affected by the toxic garbage we dumped. However, we have learned from scientific work that this is not so. The increased ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth as a result of this damage to the ozone layer threatens to boost skin cancers, to cause sea levels to rise and to disrupt the food chain.

         We need to own up to the fact that climate change is a direct result of our energy dependent and resource wasteful lifestyle. At the present time, one-quarter of the world's population consumes 75 per cent of the world's energy. On average, each rich world resident adds about 3.2 tons of CO(2) to the world's atmosphere each year. This is over four times the amount added by each person in the Third World.

         In the brief time available to me, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the government in my own state of Queensland and the premier in particular for the recently announced initiatives to promote an ecologically sustainable energy sector in Queensland. The Queensland government understands that the energy sector is the single largest contributor and produces about half of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. All state governments across Australia are in an excellent position to do the same. One wonders what the agenda of New South Wales is in terms of its privatisation debate announced this morning.

         The Queensland government's initiative is a major boost to the solar hot water manufacturing industry in particular in that state. The $35 million program will comprise $15.1 million in demand efficiency initiatives, $13.5 million for alternative energy initiatives and $6.4 million for new energy advisory centres and a new office of energy management. These  are extremely important initiatives. While there clearly has to be a coordinated response from all levels of government, it is good to see this initiative in Queensland.

         —The Democrats will reject the amendment for several reasons. Firstly, the lumping together of all developing countries is quite wrong. The small island nations, many of which might disappear under water, want even more stringent controls with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. Then there are larger countries like China, which is extremely keen on developing a coal industry. There is the example of South Korea, which as I indicated in this place just yesterday is doing what Australia should be doing; namely, it is taxing its fossil fuel and using that to fund the front end costs of solar hot water units in South Korea. Those solar units will possibly be manufactured by Solahart if it works out the appropriate policies.

         The motion as it stands is very adequate. It indicates the government's failure. As I said, what is stated in the first part of the motion was actually admitted to by the government today. Senator Reynolds admitted to it a moment ago. The second part of the motion picks up the first part of the opposition's amendment anyway, which is the failure of the government's program to address the greenhouse problem. Therefore, I call on the Senate to reject the opposition's amendment and to support the original motion.

         I would have thought that in any constructive approach to this overall global problem my motion, which seeks to have things done here in Australia, is reasonable. The government is certainly subject to attack for failing to produce an effective policy on greenhouse. It is certainly subject to that sort of attack, as it should be. I have also looked at the international scale. I have tried to be very even-handed in the motion that I have moved, and I would certainly urge the Senate to support my amendment.

        This amendment is similar to an amendment we had to the Auditor-General Bill. It affects the regulation making power, which also affects application of the act, to security and intelligence organisations. We think that this amendment ensures that the regulations must be properly debated before being enacted, and we think that is important. The bill we are debating and the Auditor-General Bill are about accountability of organisations back to parliament. It should be parliament, not security or intelligence organisations—as would happen if we did not do this—that decides in what circumstances and to what extent those reporting functions should be modified. It is inappropriate that it remain in the hands of those other organisations.

I think we are well past the stage where we have allowed security or intelligence organisations to determine what might otherwise be more appropriately determined by the parliament. I acknowledge—and I suppose the mover of the amendment, Senator Kernot, would acknowledge—the importance of intelligence and security organisations and the need for material to be handled sensitively and, in very many cases, secretively. But that is not the point of this particular clause. In the absence of any convincing argument to the contrary, I will vote in favour of the amendment.

It seems to me that, obviously, if we put in the act something that is not the case we would be not acting consistently and that should not go forward. Also, this amendment does not give any time limit. The Acts Interpretation Act applies to disallowable instruments and there is no provision here to refer to that.

         I understand that the issue that has excited opposition here is the intelligence services. Normally, I would expect that the parliament would act when the regulations are made. When the regulations are made, if there is an action that is going on, that action would stop. So this would be a new practice. I have referred to the approval part and the parliamentary disallowance. This amendment, if it were carried, would mean that nothing could happen before parliament had disallowed it and I think that is inappropriate. This bill improves the transparency well beyond what applies now. The effect of this amendment is to take that transparency—which is a positive virtue of the bill over existing practice and the existing act—to an extreme.

         The first question I ask is about the committee structure. Why is it set up the way it is, including, for example, Customs but excluding the Attorney-General? The second question is: is it appropriate for the agency involved to be reviewing its own decisions? I think the ombudsman's office argued that this would create a conflict of interest—particularly, based on its experience, the agency which is most stridently opposed to the payment. Is there not a clear  conflict of interest there in terms of justice for the person who has had this done to them? I think they form one set of questions. I will come back to some others.

         The reason for this is that matters coming from the ombudsman in terms of all of the act of grace matters that the minister has to decide on are very small indeed. Most of the act of grace matters are not generated through or because of the ombudsman; they come directly from agencies. This committee recommends an outcome to the minister, who then will make a decision as he or she sees fit. We believe the composition of the committee as it is now constituted gives a far better overview of all Commonwealth Public Service and will give better quality advice to the minister as a consequence of that.

         In answer to your question about why the Attorney-General is not there, there would be a case, I think, for the Attorney-General there if this was a question of defining the law or working on a legal precedent. This is a question often of some arbitrariness as to what is the appropriate or decent thing to do in a given set of circumstances that does not invite necessarily a long dialogue on the law. We therefore do not see that it is necessary to include the Attorney-General—an eminent person in his own right—but the Attorney-General would not necessarily add to this advisory committee, in our view.

Customs does do that, so it was a toss-up between Customs and Taxation, and the coin came down Customs.

         —There are several reasons for the agency being included there. The manner in which an issue for the consideration of the Minister for Finance might find its way to him or her may not be through the agency. It may; often it is. Often it is with the agency recommending a proposition which this committee then filters and provides advice to the minister on. At least in my understanding, most of the act of grace payments that originate from agencies do so with an agency recommendation, not the other way around.

         Where the agency is involved, the agency is able to provide the committee with a great deal more information that enables the committee to take a view than otherwise might be the case. If the agency head is not there, the committee may need to invite the agency head or a representative of the agency to acquire the advice as to what the procedures and circumstances were, why the judgments were made as they were and the effect on the operations of the agency, et cetera. So having that in the tent is regarded as far better than having it out of the tent, recognising as well that since act of grace payments are always claims to spend money, having revenue raisers there who sweat blood to raise revenue provides a nice balance in the committee of the contending perspectives from which balanced advice arises. So, essentially, that is the reason for the agency head being present.

         I might add by way of footnote that anyone can raise this question. I understand, in fact, an event that occurred just this week has raised, not through the agency but through another minister, and it could easily have been a member of parliament, a question on act of grace for the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). In those circumstances, the agency is a valuable resource tool, an advising tool within the committee in weighing the judgments.

         Whilst this definition related to the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, which in itself does not necessarily deal with government business enterprises, it might be interpreted as relating to a general definition of `agency'.

Obviously the debate is still to come about the powers of the Senate and the powers of the parliament in relation to government business enterprises.

However, there are a number of questions I would like to ask in relation to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, and this is not necessarily the time to ask them.

         Needless to say, my concerns relate to the fact that the package of bills as a whole may, for certain groups of entities which include 19 government business enterprises, contain less accountability than currently exists. Therefore, if we have a definition in this bill of `agency' which does not include the existence of any sort of government business enterprise, it might be argued in the future that standing orders can be interpreted so that the current practices of acquiring the attendance of government business enterprises before either a standing committee dealing with reports or a Senate estimates committee are not necessary because that is not the definition of an agency under part of this package of bills.

I presume it would be easier to deal with it while we are dealing with the bill that it is seeking to amend. If I was to do it at the end of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, then I would need once again to seek the leave of the Senate to recommit to the Financial Management and Accountability Bill. I would be quite happy to do that if there was general agreement that that would be an acceptable way to go.

         —I would like to ask a question which the minister can maybe weave into his answer. One of the things we have to acknowledge in this country is that as we have gone further and further down the path of corporatisation it has meant fewer opportunities for scrutiny of things which are important. Government can argue that the commercialisation that goes with corporatisation is more important than that. I do not necessarily accept that, but it does seem to me that over the last few years the trend of what is off budget and who then cannot be called to be questioned by members of the Senate has increased, and it is not necessarily a good thing.

         However, I would ask the minister for his comment on the effect of this amendment. Does this amendment mean that parliamentary officers and members are excluded from the need to manage funds properly? Is that the effect of the amendment down the track, if we are saying that nothing in this act limits the powers, privileges or immunities of the house of parliament, its members or committees? Does this amendment do what it is said to do?

         This Bill is concerned with the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. Its scope covers the underlying principles that are to govern the activities of persons in organisations that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth—that is, Departments; those Statutory Authorities whose enabling legislation does not give them legal ownership of money or property separately from the Commonwealth; and any body, organisation or group of persons prescribed as an Agency on the basis of its dealing with and managing public money or public property on behalf of the Commonwealth.

        I think that makes it as explicit as we can. Again we come to the question: are we going to clutter the act with needless qualifications guarding against what vaguely someone might do or should we make the act clear as to what it means? If we make the act clear as to what it means, then that clarity will overshine any manipulation anyone wants to in the future try to work. We are dealing with trying to block what devious minds might do. In carrying legislation we should simply say what we want, and what we want is to cover the agencies of the Commonwealth—and that is clear.

Perhaps the minister can say whether he would allow officials from Telstra to attend such a committee if they were asked for. If our concerns are not real, the minister might like to say whether he would allow officials from Telstra to attend a Senate estimates committee, if requested.

         —by leave—I was not here when we voted on the government's first amendment, which was to clause 2. It changed the operative date of the bill by one year. I have just heard the minister say that this has come at the end of a huge process. I agree with him that this has come at the end of a huge process which began with the negotiation of the so-called accountability package what seems like an awfully long time ago but is only a year ago. We can argue that the bill has been the subject of extensive discussions in most departments and most departments are well aware of its existence and of the fact that it has been due to go through the Senate for some time now.

         I cannot see why 2 1/2 months notice of a new bill from now until 1 July this year is not sufficient time. This government, when it is allowed to, does bring on bills just a few days before they are due to take effect, pleading that this has a particular start-up date and that we should take that into account. There is a difference with what the Senate would like to see happen here, which is that we would like to see the bill up and running as a demonstration of the government's good faith in response to the accountability package. I am not questioning Minister Beazley's good faith during this whole process, but I just think that one extra year cannot be justified and I would like to hear, as I missed them before if the minister did give any, the government's reasons for this extension of one year.

         —by leave—As Senator Kernot has said, the first amendment carried today sought to extend by a year the period within which this legislation can commence. The present commencement clause—the clause before we amended it—seemed safe, I might say, having 1 July 1995 as the date, but that was when the legislation was first introduced into the parliament, which was June of last year.

         Given the time that has elapsed to get to the present stage, a 1 July 1995 start date is becoming increasingly less likely or maybe even less practical. That is the initial reason why we have given ourselves headroom or more time for the proclamation of this bill.

         It is also administratively tidier for this legislation to commence at the start of a financial year because of its impact on annual reports, the auditing of those reports and the need for annual appropriation acts to reflect the AMF act's terms. The change does not abandon a 1 July 1995 commencement date—that may still be possible—and it could be proclaimed by that date. However, if the legislation were not passed by the parliament through all stages by the end of the current sittings, that is, by the end of next week, the government believes it is in the public interest and in the interests of good administration as well to have a smooth changeover to the next framework; and the amendment sought to do that.

         If we can handle it within that time, then a proclamation date of 1 July 1995 may be realistic. But, with all the passion I can summon, this has been a long, arduous process. The weight has been carried by others over a long time, and there has been a great deal of work. It seems to us prudent and responsible to allow ourselves a bit of elbow room to enable the smooth take-up of the legislation from the beginning of a financial year. If we blow this financial year—for whatever reason—it ought not mean that the changeover is more complicated. We should be able to change it over by the following financial year.

There is not much political one-upmanship.

I am wondering whether, in the years when there was not an appropriation but there was a dividend, because that did have an effect on the budget, it would be appropriate for the parliament to have some input into that particular business entity's activities which would affect the amount of money that may or may not be paid now or in the future into general revenue.

         Telstra files an annual report. That annual report is open to scrutiny, as I said earlier. That enables people to scrutinise that report in the appropriate way. The important distinction, though, that I would make—given the phrasing of your last question—is that Telstra reports through its board initially to the government and through the government to the parliament. It is for the executive to appoint the board of Telstra, to approve its strategic plan and to decide what level of dividend it will extract—to make those sorts of decisions.

        I believe this amendment will assist at least to spell out the priorities within the bill. The amendment inserts a clause about public interest before clause 21 on page 10. This amendment places an obligation on Commonwealth authorities and their executive officers and wholly owned Commonwealth companies and their directors to act in the public interest. The amendments then make it possible for people affected by the actions of the Commonwealth instrumentalities to take out injunctions restraining them from engaging in those activities.

         The Greens (WA) were appalled to discover that nowhere in these bills were Commonwealth owned instrumentalities obliged to operate in the public interest. Without such a clause as this one, how are the people of Australia to be assured that these organisations do and will operate in the public interest? Because the organisations originate from statutes passed by the parliament, many are given a very privileged position in relation to their obligations under federal, state and local government laws and by-laws. If they are to retain and deserve this special position, which sets them apart from other companies and other organisations, then people should be assured that they are operating in the public interest.

An assertion has been made and, based on an assertion, a detailed amendment has been forthcoming.

         I would argue that the place to put amendments like this, if amendments are desired, is in the bills which enable the particular corporations or government business enterprises to exist. It should be in their own bills rather than in an overall bill which governs or scrutinises, as I have said, the financial integrity of those organisations. I think that is the principal reason why this amendment should fail. It is not because it may be wrongly headed in terms of its intent. It may well be, although I cannot think of a case, that in the minds of some senators it is rightly headed. However, we should then amend the bills of particular statutory authorities that we are referring to.

If we look at the outline of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, we find that basically it is a package designed to replace the Audit Act 1901 and to bring it up to date with modern legislation which deals with financial management accountability and audit of Commonwealth agencies, authorities and companies. It broadly talks about how—and this relates to the minister's comment—the CAC Bill will provide a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities and set out standards of conduct for executive officers. Many of these requirements are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities. The bill will also provide a single set of requirements for ensuring that wholly-owned Commonwealth companies keep ministers and the parliament informed of their activities.

        This report from the Attorney-General's Department on the operation of the War Crimes Act 1945 to June 1994 is a very sorry reminder of what is nothing more than a grossly irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money by the government. Forty years after World War II, we had a government which decided for reasons that escape me to spend millions of dollars on the investigation and prosecution in Australia of alleged World War II criminals. This whole business really offended the commonsense of ordinary Australians, who asked properly why they were being asked to spend millions of their hard-earned dollars on prosecuting people who had allegedly committed crimes on foreign soil 40 years ago.

         The government was told at the time that this would be a futile exercise. The idea of getting proper evidence on this matter and being able to use that evidence to successfully prosecute people who moved to Australia many years ago was really a futile exercise. It was an extravagant waste of taxpayers' money and an irresponsible exercise on the government's part. Millions and millions of dollars were spent on this exercise, and for what? All we had were three prosecutions launched—only three from this extravagant set-up in the Attorney-General's Department—against three old men living in Adelaide.

         This report is for the 1993-94 financial year. Presumably, it is the last report that we will see of this whole sorry exercise. This report shows that the war crimes prosecutions for the financial year from July 1993 to June 1994 cost the taxpayer $1.2 million. As well as that, the taxpayer had to pay for the defence of the three old men who were prosecuted by the war crimes unit. That defence cost $1.1 million. Sure, the lawyers of Adelaide must have loved it. It was a bonanza for them. But it cost the taxpayers $2.3 million in 1993-94 alone.

         This report ironically reveals that the only prosecution remaining at 1 July 1993 was of Heinrich Wagner. His prosecution was stopped by the DPP on 9 December 1993 because it accepted evidence that he was likely to suffer a fatal heart attack if the prosecution proceeded. So we had only a six-month period and we had only one person involved. The prosecution was halted by the DPP, and taxpayers now find out that they have spent $2.3 million in the 1993-94 financial year on this exercise.

         Ordinary Australians are quite properly very angry about how politicians and people in Canberra spend their money or how the government spends their money. After 12 years of this government, this is a classic example of what is wrong with this country. The government on a wing and a prayer decides that it will engage in a feel-good exercise. It says, `Let's go and prosecute World War II criminals.' Between $20 million and $30 million has been spent all up on a totally failed exercise. The government was told at the time that this was a complete waste of money. None of us liked the fact that crimes were committed during World War II. My father and many other people fought to defend Australia in that war. We all share the horror of the crimes that were committed in that war. But let us respect the commonsense of Australians who all understand that trying to prosecute war criminals 50 years after that war was a completely futile exercise. This report shows how futile it was. It is a disgrace that just in the last financial year we have an expenditure by taxpayers of $2.3 million on a completely wasted exercise.

         The way all of that was conducted was entirely satisfactory and highly professional. The two officers who were on board the helicopter looked after me in a superb way. When I got on board and we then lifted up above the 30 feet, at that point we could see only sea because the horizon in all directions was landless. When we got up 1,000 feet above the sea, we were about 30 miles off land and we headed back above Jurien Bay to Moora.

         The first instruction I received from the pilot of the Bell helicopter was, `We have no doors on the helicopter to make it safer if we land in the sea.' Senator Collins will be interested in this comment. He said, `If we do land in the sea, you must hold your breath as we hit. The helicopter will go under the water and then turn upside down so that the rotor is at the bottom.' I was assured that the helicopter would float. I was not to release the safety belt until we came back to the surface again and, at that point, I was to swim clear.

I am yet to be convinced that it is possible for women to serve in that type of ship. This can be explored with regard to the Collins class. In due course, I will very happily accept the suggestion already made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) to go out on a Collins class in some months and stay overnight, as I did on this marvellous trip on the

One of them was labelled `Shultz' and the other was labelled `Kink'. They are the two nicknames for these huge engines that charge the batteries. The diesel engines do not drive the submarine. They only charge batteries, from which power is drawn to not only run the turbine that propels the ship but also the airconditioning system, the lights, air pressure systems and so on.

I slept for eight hours undisturbed all night. I felt thoroughly comfortable. I know that the captain is the only person who has a single room, but it is only about three feet by seven feet by six feet. I greatly admire the patience and teamwork of not only the officers but all the crew as they have to put up with each other.

         It was put to me that the Oberon is really a 1950s piece of machinery. But I see it as still being enormously capable. It has a modern 1980s weapons system, which has enormous capability. I believe that it could take out any ship. Australia should feel very safe that we have these old submarines. They will be replaced by the 1990s Collins class. The comparison that was made to me is that it is like an FJ Holden being replaced by a Holden Caprice with all the electronics that are involved in a modern car.

        That is a legitimate question to ask. The answer to the question is: for the very same reason that Marion Le, President of the Indo-China Refugee Association of the ACT, made the statement in July of last year, reported in the

        That is the answer to the question that Senator Abetz asked in his speech yesterday: why did I make the statement that I made? The reason I made it is that there are people in Asia who are hearing those statements, hearing about those actions in Australia. Whenever we go soft on the issue of boat people, those messages are heard in other parts of the world. Indeed, only last week we had an instance of some people from Afghanistan attempting to get into Australia by boat.

If in my public statements, in my statements in this chamber, in the enunciations I have made in that press release, in the speeches I have made in this place and at public forums, in the comments that I put in letters in response to constituents, and in the mass letters that I send around to constituents, I am wrong and out of touch with my electorate I do not deserve to be here.

         I am bitterly and deeply hurt by the character assassination that went on in this place yesterday. I resent in the most vigorous way possible being called a racist. I experienced racism myself when I worked for a time in England. I know what it is like. I have experienced it and seen it at first-hand operating in Australia with the Aboriginal people and to a lesser extent with some of the minority ethnic groups. I am not going to be part of that. I resent the assertions that were made about me yesterday. I think what I have done tonight in offering my position to the people of Western Australia is the only honourable thing to do.

         —I refer again to a matter that I have raised in the Senate on three previous occasions, that is, the plight of former employees of the Brisbane retailer McDonnell &amp; East, which closed its doors for the last time in 1994. Senators may recall that some 30 unfortunate individuals not only lost their jobs when McDonnell &amp; East folded but also looked like losing most of their superannuation. An actuarial valuation of their funds showed that as at August 1993 the net assets held by the fund amounted to only 35 per cent of members' vested benefits.

         When I raised this matter in the Senate previously I highlighted a number of irregularities with the investments and operation of that superannuation fund and the apparent lack of vigilance on the part of the various parties who were supposed to protect members' interests. A legal opinion obtained by the fund members' representatives indicated that the members had a strong case against the permanent trustee company for the losses suffered. Obviously the trustees thought so too because they then began actively to seek a settlement and made an offer to make up some of the shortfall in the fund. Most of these members have been waiting for more than 18 months and some for more than two years for their superannuation payments.

         Finally, on or about 10 March 1995 these 30 individuals received payments which on average represented 70 per cent of their vested benefits as calculated at the August 1993 date. It should be noted that in present day terms the amount is something less than 70 per cent, given that no interest has been paid for the period of 18 months or more that has elapsed since the August 1993 calculation date or the date that they ceased employment. While 70 per cent is better than 35 per cent, they should have received nothing less than 100 per cent of their superannuation entitlement. Of course they could have knocked back the offer and taken the matter to court. Even if they did have the resources to take such action, it probably would have dragged on for a number of years, causing further stress and hardship to these people. I believe they made the only choice available to them, that is, to accept the meagre offerings of the trustee and fund manager. At least they can now get on with their lives, putting behind them the pain and distress of the past few years.

         This episode has been particularly distressing for the retirees, whose entire retirement plans have been thrown into disarray. After providing a lifetime of service to his employer, one individual who was in his late sixties has now received less than the 70 per cent of his superannuation entitlement and nothing for the trauma suffered at the hands of these seemingly non-caring organisations—somewhat reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge.

         The Democrats have repeatedly emphasised in the Senate the absolute necessity for our superannuation system to be one that is fair to all Australians and not just to those who are already well off. The Democrats believe that there must be protections which are as foolproof as possible to ensure that all people are guaranteed a fair and reasonable income in retirement.

         Although the former employees of McDonnell &amp; East have now been paid, I believe that Permanent Trustee still has a case to answer. Its treatment of these fund members could only be described as appalling. Not only did it try to deny that it was the trustee of the fund when the shortfall was initially reported in the media, but also it made no attempt to explain to members why their superannuation assets had dwindled to just a fraction of their vested benefits and steadfastly denied any responsibility for the shortfall.

         Also, I understand that one of the members should have received an early retirement benefit but was paid a resignation benefit because the trustee and fund manager disputed the date at which the benefit should have been calculated. They stuck with the August 1993 date rather than the date on which the employer's participation in the plan was terminated—some five months later. This means that member has lost a significant proportion of their superannuation entitlement. The trustee and fund manager suggested a solution to this problem—get all the other fund members to give up part of their entitlement to make up the amount for their fellow member. Such a bloody-minded attitude is unbecoming for a trustee who is supposedly looking after the interest of superannuation fund members.

         I also understand that the agreement signed by the beneficiaries and the trustee and fund manager contained a statement to the effect that, if there were any moneys that later became available to the superannuation fund, then the trustee would have first claim over the funds. What about the other 30 per cent still owing to the fund members? Does the trustee feel that it has been so generous that it now has the right to any amounts that are subsequently recovered from other sources? This seems to me to be absolutely outrageous. It was the trustee's job in the first place to ensure that the superannuation funds were secure. As it failed in its fiduciary duty to members it has no right to lay claim against moneys that rightfully belong to those members, and to only those members.

         In light of the events in this case and the behaviour and attitude adopted by Permanent Trustee, I have serious misgivings about whether that organisation should continue to be entrusted with the savings of many thousands of other superannuation members. I therefore urge the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to review Permanent Trustee's licence. With an issue that is as crucial as the security of a person's financial future, the Democrats believe there must be a clear message that superannuation funds must operate in a manner which is totally beyond reproach.

It relates to the parliament, and the Senate in particular, being misled in relation to the legislation which was before us. I am a little disappointed that Senator Sherry has left the chamber because he was the parliamentary secretary on duty during the time of the debate. I concede and recognise, of course, that the matters that he said and the things he spoke about were told to him by officers of the Australian Taxation Office who were sitting next to him at the time.

         For some time the Law Council of Australia urged the Government to amend Section 102AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The topic was the subject of discussions between representatives of the Law Council of Australia and the Child Support Agency at their regular meetings of the Child Support Liaison Group. Subsequently, in July 1993 the Law Council wrote to the Treasurer setting out its views and urging the Government to amend the Legislation. A copy of our letter is enclosed.

         On 7 March 1994 the Assistant Treasurer issued a statement advising that amendments would be made to the Income Tax Assessment Act "which will ensure that the provisions relating to the unearned income of children under 18 operate as originally intended."

For a variety of reasons Senator Harradine withdrew his proposed amendments but only after an indication had been given by Senator Sherry that "the Government will consider retrospectivity . . . "

         The matter was debated in the Senate on Thursday, 8 December 1994. There are a number of references in the daily Hansard (pages 4212, 4215, 4229 and 4267). You will note when you read the Hansard that more than one Senator queried the basis upon which the Government's amendments were being made. The response from the Government's representative in the Senate (Senator Sherry) was that, relying upon advice from ATO advisers, "the amendments restate the existing law" (page 4234), see also at page 4269, where the Senator said that, in effect, the amendments simply reflected a requirement which was "part of the Parliament's original intention".

         You will note that, in the Law Council's submission of 5 December no reference is made to sub-paragraph 8. I am not sure why this oversight occurred. I can only surmise that in the haste of attempting to prepare a submission it was overlooked. No doubt you will agree that its difficult to grasp the overall effect of a section where only parts of the section are sought to be amended. This is particularly so where the whole of the section is not dealt with in the Amendment Bill and where its necessary to cut and paste.

         In any event, sub-section 8 does exist and in our submission it supports the Law Council's view that the amendments in Taxation Amendment Bill (No.4) were not merely confirmatory of the intention of the Parliament in 1979 but indeed create more restrictive rules about what sort of trust is needed to comply with the scheme of S102AG. If you agree, the ATO advice was grievously wrong and the Senate may well have been misled.

         —I want to refer to two matters tonight. I refer first to the response by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, to my question asking why he misled the Senate today, and particularly his further response at the end of question time when he further misled the Senate. He was asked about the rate at which the repayment was being serviced. He had said that $10,000 a month was being paid to the bank to service the debt when in fact it was $10,000 a week. He ultimately corrected that but in correcting it he said that $10,000 a week was being paid off the debt. That is simply false. It is only the interest bill. Nothing is being paid off the debt.

         The rate of interest on the $6 million mortgage at $10,000 a week works out at $520,000 a year or about nine per cent. That is a very favourable rate; I imagine it is the sort of rate one might get if one is a favoured customer. He was simply wrong in his responses to the claim that he had misled the chamber when he said that the debt was only $6 million, not the $10 million which had been claimed in a question by Senator Alston the previous day. I quote what the minister said from the typescript of today's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         . Senator Evans said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What I said yesterday was that the mortgage debt was $6 million. I was not talking about any overdraft facility that might be in existence. I was asked a question about the building debt and I responded in terms of the building debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is simply false. Senator Evans has once again misled this chamber. The question asked by Senator Alston stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is it a fact that the New South Wales branch of the ALP, already more than $10 million in debt, has been served or threatened with a notice of foreclosure by the Commonwealth Bank unless it makes suitable arrangements to service the debt?
       </para>
       <para>
        Every element of the question related to the debt, not to the specific smaller debt that Senator Evans tried to convince this house was all that existed. It was a disgraceful attempt by Senator Evans to diminish the extent of the Labor Party's debt to the Commonwealth Bank. It seems to me a matter of major concern that when Senator Evans is caught out misleading the Senate he then seeks further to mislead the Senate. I stress that the debt is not being repaid under these arrangements. The $10,000 a week simply represents an interest payment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other matter I raise is that of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank has come out today with a very carefully worded statement that deals with a selected few of the matters I have raised relating to the extraordinarily helpful role the bank appears to be playing in providing financial accommodation to the ALP. The great bulk of the matters I have raised are simply not dealt with in the Commonwealth Bank's statement.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to be selective in making its statements, I invite it to be less selective and respond to all the matters that are of genuine concern about the manner in which the Commonwealth Bank has been financing the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party which, as I have already pointed out, not only has assets that are far exceeded by its liabilities but also clearly is having difficulty reducing its indebtedness, as one sees the deals that have attempted to be done to relieve the ALP of its massive indebtedness keep falling apart. The latest fell apart, we saw, at the end of last week. The bank has said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         "The NSW Branch of the ALP has longstanding and current borrowing arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank. The Branch is meeting obligations to the Bank under arrangements that were negotiated in a commercial manner and include a commercial rate of interest.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        What interests me is whether or not it is commercially normal to have one's account with the bank transferred to the group credit control section, which is a section that deals with potential bad debts. Maybe the Commonwealth Bank thinks this is a normal arrangement, but it seems to me to be an interesting situation. I would invite the bank to correct me on this, but I do not know that it would be a normal situation for a client whose account is under the group credit control section to be provided with substantially increased overdraft accommodation for a specific reason; for example, in this case the fighting of an election campaign in which the Labor Party has so much money available that it is massively outspending the Liberal Party. The statement of the Commonwealth Bank then reads:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">

       </para>
       <para>
        I did not make an allegation relating to the government itself. I said `members of the government'—in other words, members of parliament. It could even be former secretaries of the New South Wales branch who happen to be members of this parliament, for example. So the response to me is, in fact, a response to an Aunt Sally and not to the question I asked. The bank further states:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Baume's allegation that the Bank has extended preferential treatment for political reasons is absolutely untrue and a matter of great concern to the Bank, which relies on commercial dealings in good faith with all its customers.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        I am overjoyed to hear that the bank's board clearly takes the view that it was not political reasons that led to the preferential treatment the bank gave the ALP, but I would be interested to know what other reasons there were for giving treatment which is clearly preferential to that doled out to other clients. Maybe there are other clients whose accounts have been transferred to the bank's group credit control section who have been able to get this kind of special treatment. If so, I suppose the bank can say that there is nothing special about this arrangement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The simple facts are that the ALP has received a particularly good deal and there is no apparent, evident capacity on the part of the ALP to repay the enormous debt, which massively exceeds the value of the security relating to this debt, and there is no doubt that the Commonwealth Bank faces a serious problem while these arrangements that the ALP is desperately trying to enter into to rescue itself keep falling apart. It is extraordinary in that situation that it should provide massive further overdraft accommodation to a client that clearly is in technical bankruptcy.
