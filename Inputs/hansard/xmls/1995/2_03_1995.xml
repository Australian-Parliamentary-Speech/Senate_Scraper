         —These three bills, in each case, are bills which were introduced into the House of Representatives last year. They, however, are bills that have come into the Senate in this sitting. This means that they have, in fact, technically breached the cut-off motion, but I make the point that, because of their introduction into the House of Representatives last year, they have now received significant scrutiny from senators.

         These three bills fall into a category, as I am sure senators would be aware, that has been of some concern to the government. There have been discussions with the opposition, the minor parties and the Independent in the Senate in relation to this anomaly, and I believe it is an anomaly. I think it is an unintended consequence, in that sense, of the cut-off motion. We are planning to progress those discussions, and senators would be aware of a notice of motion that has been put down to deal with this issue.

         I do not believe it was the intention of the Senate when the cut-off motion was originally proposed to see bills in this category—those that had been introduced into the House of Representatives—caught up by the cut-off motion in this way. Anyway, that is a matter that obviously the Senate will look at in due course, and I intend to have further discussions with senators about that.

         However, in particular, there has been consultation with all senators and parties in the chamber about these three bills proceeding in this way. Obviously, the government would be pleased to receive the support of the Senate to ensure that they can be dealt with, given the fact that they have now been available for the perusal of senators for some considerable time.

         —The Senate is dealing with the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. Before I refer in principle to that bill, I want first of all to refer to what was said last night in the chamber by Senator Chamarette. I understand that the matters to which she referred are ones which have been around the place for a considerable number of years. I thought the type of material that was advanced by Senator Chamarette in support of the suggestion being made about an NVE category had well and truly been canvassed before. Those who have been promoters of that have been well and truly identified as having an interest in that particular endeavour, if I can call it such.

         It is important for the Senate to know a few facts. I understand and admit that it is not the view of Senator Chamarette, in advancing the proposition that has been advanced principally by the pornography industry itself, the X-rated video industry itself, that there be a NVE classification and that all material currently in the X category go into the NVE category. But that is the view that has been expressed by the X-rated video materials industry. In justification for that, it is indicating three things: firstly, the material in the X category is not violent; secondly, the material is not harmful; and, thirdly, there are eminent persons, such as Dr Paul Wilson, who believe that this material should be classified as NVE.

         Let me deal first of all with the latter proposition in respect of Dr Paul Wilson. Senator Chamarette referred to the newsletter

         </emphasis>
         of December 1987 in support of what she was saying. That issue indicated that there had been a study completed by the institute about this matter. In subsequent examinations of Dr Wilson and the Institute of Criminology, it was found that the study was a search of the literature. It did not conduct any in-depth study at all.

         The article was by Dr Paul Wilson and Mr Stephen Nugent. Dr Paul Wilson, in that article, relied upon, to some extent, arguments against the findings of the Meese Commission. The Meese Commission, the United States commission into prostitution and pornography ordered by US Attorney-General Meese, found that material of a similar character to that which is contained in the X category has harmful effects. Dr Wilson attacked that as being unfounded and used as his support for that attack Messrs Nobile and Nadler. It is all footnoted in the paper
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Institute of Criminology: Trends and Issues No. 9

         The second point goes to the question of harm. The Joint Select Committee on Video Materials discussed this matter quite substantially over a long period. Prior to that, the Senate Select Committee on Video Materials had done so. We received evidence to the effect that the habitual viewing of the type of material that is contained in the X category engenders a callous and manipulative orientation towards women. Quite an amount of evidence was given to us and to subsequent hearings, which is to be found in the archives of the committee. Those who suggested that there was no such effect included Robby Swan, the lobbyist for the X-rated pornography industry. That same person is not beyond some dissembling. He has been saying over a period of time that this material is not directed at the male population and does not objectify women; that it is also aimed at women—that they love it. This has been his approach for some considerable time.

         I was interested to see in what I thought to be a serious journal—which turned out to have been conned—a statement by a Caroline Sweetly. She said that the material has a wide distribution amongst married people and is desired by women. A photograph of this Caroline Sweetly accompanied the article. I thought: I have seen her somewhere before. I asked a question in a meeting of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards, inquiring into the standards relevant to the supply of services utilised in telecommunications technology, on 20 April 1993 of Mr Swan about Caroline Sweetly. He eventually admitted that it was his photograph—he was dressed up as Caroline Sweetly. It was

         I am not suggesting that Senator Margetts would be involved in any of this. Of course she would not. The first matter she raised related to the type of material that is contained in X-rated material being non-violent. It could possibly be physically non-violent. As I have said, I have seen much of this X-rated material. It may be physically non-violent to a certain extent, but one I can remember was on the borderline of being forced sexual intimacy. I outlined yesterday what the joint select committee described this material as. The committee report stated at paragraph 13.46:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The dominant theme of the material is that it objectifies and commodifies women rather than treating women as free and responsible initiators of human activity. The material in this category, although non-violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. Thus sexual intercourse is typically depicted as a mechanical act devoid of love or human consequences—fellatio and cunnilingus are explicitly and voyeuristically portrayed as is masturbation, ejaculation, penetration of the female anus and diverse acts, other acts or fetishes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not go into what it contains. It goes on to say in paragraph 13.49:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires. This is sometimes manifested in themes involving workplace sexual favours. Women are frequently depicted as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for an opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity, which are a feature of much of the material in this category.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important that the Senate understand what we are talking about and understand also that the material is not innocuous. My view is that it is the themes, as much as the explicit depictions, that are of concern. It is the themes that tend to engender a callous and manipulative orientation towards other human beings. That is one of the major problems. It is those themes that are included in much of the R material. A lot of the R material is exactly the same in content, intent, theme and title as the X equivalent. That is a matter that the Senate also needs to be aware of.

         During the estimates committee hearings which dealt with the Attorney-General's Department, I was assured that this bill now before the Senate would prevent child pornography, abuse and gratuitous violence being displayed and created on computers. I sincerely hope that this bill will do all those things once it is enacted by all the states. But I think it raises a fundamental question: if government departments can give out taxpayers' money to fund a pornographic computer display accessible by children, has the horse already bolted with regard to classifying computer material?

After chasing the answers for nearly three months—they were straightforward questions—they finally arrived in my office yesterday afternoon. The answers given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) raise fundamental concerns about the efficacy of the bill we have before us today. The minister did say he was concerned about the display, but if the government does not know when it has funded computer pornography how can we as a society hope to contain the offensive and obscene side of the great communication advances that are already around us?

        The Visions of Australia committee gave $25,000 to a group so that it could come up with a computer display which depicted violent child sexual abuse as part of a public exhibition, which a seven-year-old child was able to not only access but also print out. Every family in Australia would share the minister's concern, I am sure, at such a gross misuse of taxpayers' money. Not only should the whole process of grant assessment be investigated as promised by the minister, but the minister should also investigate in great detail all the activities of the group responsible, the Australian Network for Art and Technology. The group's director, Mr David Halloran, was quoted in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        That may be the case but, nevertheless, it was able to be accessed by a seven-year-old child. I defy any parent in Australia to see the art and accept the justification of a $25,000 government grant in the display provided by this group. The display was named `Artists thinking about science' and the grant made on 18 August 1994 was to assist in touring the exhibition to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The group, as we see from the minister's answer today, has been receiving public funding from the Australia Council since 1986-87. Since 1991, it has itself administered an art research and development fund.

I will also ask the minister in the committee stage to justify taking three months to answer my simple, straightforward question regarding the grant.

         To illustrate this, one of the great classic statements on what is obscene followed a decision made by Mr Hicklin and another in a case back in 1867. Senator Harradine would know that. I do not suggest for one minute, Madam Acting Deputy President, that you would remember that case, but it is a very interesting one.

My proposition is that they perform a very difficult task in carrying out an essential function. If people are going to be appointed to positions where they have to make these decisions, we should, as it were, give them a fair go.

         An illustration of how decision makers can be criticised unfairly appears in an editorial in the

It is all very good to run law and order campaigns, but if those law and order campaigns start reducing our civil rights and the respect we should have for institutions, then I think that is a case for alarm.

         I would suggest that everybody who has had anything to do with Mr Dickie, for example, who is our chief censor, would regard him as having done outstanding work in this area. I notice there is nobody presently in the chamber who would disagree with that—Senator Harradine, Senator O'Chee, Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Herron. Ms Wright has nobly done the task we set her and so has Peter Mackay and so on. I think Senator Harradine no doubt would agree with me that to err is human and that is the condition we are all in.

         Where do we go when we get an X-rated, pornographic government publication that is put out by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) which advocates deviant sexual practices and is not, as she says in the preamble to it, a non-judgmental resource. This so-called safe sex guide is an official government publication, endorsed by the government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the health minister. It is X-rated and pornographic, and any right-minded person—even Mr Dickie, as I know—would classify it as unsuitable for publication, but it is on the bookstands of this country and can be bought by any 13-year-old child. As the Minister for Family Service (Senator Crowley), who represents the Minister for Human Services and Health, said in debate, it is read by 13-year-olds, although it is aimed at those aged 18 years and above. There are nearly five million females aged 13 years and over in this country.

         The Minister for Human Services and Health yesterday misled the House of Representatives: she said that 10 to 15 per cent of women at some stage have anal sex. I do not like talking on these topics, but when a deliberate untruth is told in another chamber I think it must be nailed. I have researched this aspect for over 12 months because I am also a member of the Parliamentary AIDS Liaison Committee. The only research that we on the Parliamentary AIDS Liaison Committee have been able to find which has been carried out in Australia is an Australian Family Planning Association questionnaire. That questionnaire was answered by 1,162 women out of a total of 7,000 women who attended the Australian Family Association clinics in 1993. It was obviously a skewed sample because it is not the average suburban housewife who goes to the Australian Family Planning Association. But, given that, 1,162 women answered this questionnaire.

         The questionnaire was devised to ask, `Have you had anal sex with your most recent steady'—not your spouse but your most recent steady—`or with a non-steady male?' Of these 1,162 women, 66 said that they had; 70 per cent said that no condom had been used; 13 per cent said that they had used a condom; and the rest—surprise—did not know. The point I make is that that is roughly about five per cent of a skewed sample.

         That was the only piece of Australian research that had been done, apart from that in another publication where the AIDS organisation had come out and said that 30 per cent of women had had anal sex. To get on to that piece of research, a person had to reply to an advertisement in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Kings Cross Whisper

         The minister came out yesterday and said it is between 10 and 15 per cent. I put out a public challenge to her to justify those figures.

         But anyone who knows anything about the AIDS epidemic will know that the reason it has been stemmed in Australia is because AIDS did not get into the intravenous drug using community in this country, as it has in every other country in the world—but I repeat: it has not in Australia. Most commentators believe that is due to the needle exchange program. It was a very good act on the part of the government to institute that first in the world. I have examined other countries where drug use is common, and we have led the world in that needle exchange program. That is the reason for the stemming of the AIDS epidemic. It has also been stemmed through behaviour modification of homosexuals who indulge in anal sex.

I have already mentioned to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I have written to the church leaders in this country. I am already getting replies of support. Three bodies shortly are going to come out publicly: the Jewish board of deputies, the Baptist church and the Lutheran church.

         —I share Senator Herron's concerns about the publication in question, and I commend him for the good work he has done. However, I rise to speak on a different issue in relation to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994, and it relates to violence in films, on television and in computer games.

         I know that the bill does not deal with television. However, I have some concerns about equal treatment of material on television compared with material which is in videos, in films or in computer material. It is a shame that my friend on the other side of the chamber, Senator Cooney, is not here at this moment because Senator Cooney and I sat through some hearings last year in relation to the broadcasting of material on television, particularly on news and current affairs programs, and I know Senator Cooney shares my concerns about the sort of material which is broadcast on news programs and on current affairs programs.

         I give two examples of my concern. I think you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would understand what I mean when I say that there needs to be some sort of consistency. Last year—in fact, I think it was the night before a hearing of the Senate legal and constitutional committee in Sydney on this matter—I watched a program on Channel 10 entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Cops
         </emphasis>
         . It was a quite entertaining program. I have seen it on a number of occasions. It involved people with cameras riding around in police cars in the United States filming police officers going about their work.

         As I said, normally this program is quite entertaining. However, on this particular evening in question what was shown was the body of a man who was discovered murdered in New Mexico. There were some fairly detailed close-up pictures of the man's body and of his face. From recollection, the man had been killed by being beaten over the head three times with a concrete block, having a glass bottle broken over his head and then being run over whilst he was lying on the ground. His whole body, including the tyre marks and abrasions about the head, were shown. His face was also shown.

         That was a program from the United States which was broadcast here. I am concerned that that program was broadcast as it was because I do not believe that that was satisfactory viewing, even at that hour of night. But I would have been even more concerned if it had been an Australian program which was broadcast because of course there would have been a greater likelihood of family and friends being offended by the broadcast. No effort was made to block out the man's face or obscure it in any fashion whatsoever.

         There is an interesting end to that story. A week or two after that program went to air, I remember discussing it with Mr George Chapman of Channel 10. I told him that I felt that that program was a little beyond the pale and that maybe some efforts ought to be taken to ensure that that sort of program does not go to air again. I was very pleased to see that the program was removed straightaway from Channel 10's screenings. I do not know whether or not that was due to Mr Chapman's efforts. If it was, I congratulate him because it really was unsatisfactory. As I said, most of the episodes of that program were not terribly offensive but that one quite clearly was.

         On Tuesday night ABC television showed a program in which there was some detailed examination of an assassination which occurred in Mexico some time ago in which a politician was shot at close range. It showed film footage of the assassination taking place. The ABC highlighted the gun being placed to the man's head by a person in the crowd, the gun being fired and the man's brains being blown out the other side of his head. I do not feel that is satisfactory either, particularly as the program was going to air at, I think, about 8:30 at night. That sort of depiction of violence is unsatisfactory.

         The problem is that there is not the same regulatory regime applying to television that applies to film, video and computer games. The answer is not to ease the restrictions on video, film, computer games and publications. I believe, as you do, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there needs to be greater supervision in relation to some of these areas. But we have to have consistent control over what goes on television as well. In the television arena we have split supervision. The ABC answers to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the commercial stations answer to FACTS, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. It is necessary that we have one body that oversees television and that the standards that are applied are consistent to the standards that apply to videos and films, especially as a television program can have a much wider audience than many films, videos or books. So there is need for consistency there to safeguard the public.

         I understand the difficulty in saying, `We're going to require all television programs to go before the film and literature classification body.' The difficulty is that there are four or five channels and regional channels, they are not all showing the same thing, even within a network, and they are each showing 24 hours of programming. So it is very difficult. But it is necessary that there be some supervision and care taken by the people who select programs for screening and by the people who produce programs.

         We have to be extremely careful, because there is increasingly an ability for people to take a television program or a video program and convert it into a computer file. It is very easy to do that by having the right hardware on your computer. You can take a live video signal and convert it in compressed format, in short pieces. We are going to see compression of longer pieces and we are going to see that material go onto computer disk and then circulated in an uncontrolled fashion.

         When material comes on television or on video there is some opportunity for parental control. But once that material gets taken from video or television and gets placed on computer format, it is possible, especially with young children, for those computer discs to be swapped at school and to be passed from one young person to the next young person with no control. Frequently the parents may well think that the children in question are doing their homework on the computer. Instead, the children are playing games or watching material which may have originally come from video, film or television and has been transferred into computer format.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Unless we have strict control of film, video and television they will be the gateway for this unsatisfactory material to be transferred onto computer. At that point it is very difficult for parents to exercise parental control. That is my concern in relation to these matters. I hope the government will recognise that there is a very real need for careful, ongoing supervision to make sure that we can protect community standards and protect those who are not old enough to exercise discretion in these matters themselves.

Some of the debate disturbs me in the sense that I earnestly believe that the debate has been used, as is often the case, not necessarily to debate the precise nature of the legislation before the chamber, but to debate tangential matters related to that legislation. Therefore, the legislation itself does not come under the same type of parliamentary scrutiny; rather the broad field does. It is for me to acknowledge and thank the speakers who have contributed to this debate, which will hopefully then move to the committee stage. One item that has been referred to here in my presence is the publication the Department of Health has put out on sexual practice in Australia.

That was a key element in the government's campaign on AIDS—educating the community about the best way of exercising their own private choices but not advocating those private choices. It is a fine line to draw but it is a very important line in this debate. The honest reporter here can be misrepresented entirely. I believe that has happened on this occasion. However, that is not the issue before the chamber; the issue before the chamber is the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994.

         That is important because the national classification code is one of the three key elements in this legislation. This legislation has arisen, firstly, from the consideration that was given by the Australian Law Reform Commission to censorship procedures. Secondly, it has emerged from agreements that have been reached between the relevant state ministers and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch).

         One of the difficulties that has been identified in respect of this matter is the impotence of the parliament, the highest representative group of the people in the nation, to have any say over the national classification code. You might say that this is a matter for the ministers of the various states. However, I inform honourable senators that I have, at times, asked certain ministers what they have been doing in respect of the classifications, standards and guidelines. The answers that I have got have led me to conclude that a number of them are too busy and preoccupied with other areas of their portfolios that they do not really know what is going on in this particular area. Much of this work is left to the public servants and the officers who meet from time to time to fix up all of these matters.

         The governments of the various states and the Commonwealth government will need to be aware of the fact that the public will not tolerate that any further. The public is getting a bit concerned about it. Where do members of the public go to express their concerns? Members of the public can complain and express concerns to the particular ministers. We need to have a bit of representative democracy about this. The state and federal parliaments need to have a greater say over what might or might not be contained in the classification code. You might say that that is possibly unworkable on two counts. Firstly, you might have a situation whereby the parliament adopts particular codes which are then found to be inadequate. How will they be overturned? Of course, if they can be made they can be overturned.

         That is not without precedent because, under the Broadcasting Services Act, the parliament can reach into the codes of practice that are established for the various programs—television, radio, et cetera—and amend them. It is going to be a very difficult job because you have to get the vote of both houses of parliament. So the government, in that particular case, would have a fairly substantial say over the matter since it commands the majority in the House of Represen tatives.

         The second count on which it may be said that it is unworkable is that this is a federal approach to the problem. If the national parliament were to have its say about the national code, it would require the states to concur with that. That is not an impossible resolution. It happens all the time, does it not?

Under that bill, the amendments to the code and the guidelines would also be registered on the register of legislative instruments and would need to be accompanied by an explanatory statement.

No state as yet has introduced legislation, but it is complementary legislation and they are waiting for the federal legislation to go through. That is as much information as I can give you at this stage, but if there is any further information as to individual states that we can elicit for you, then we will do that as well. I think much of it hangs on this legislation going through and the form in which it goes through.

         One source of advice that the government has received with respect to this, of course, is the advice from the Law Reform Commission in its report on multiculturalism and the law. In essence, what we are talking about here is blasphemy being an old common law offence concerning the Christian religion, with particular reference to the rituals and documents of the Church of England. The advice from the commission was very clearly that because of the inconsistent protection of religion, because it had narrow, inconsistent and discriminatory coverage, we should remove the offence from federal legislation because the protection given to minority religions—let us face it, we have all of them in this country—is not the same as that given to the religion protected.

         The commission also did not favour extending the law of blasphemy to cover faiths other than Christianity as it considered it would be very difficult to devise a satisfactory definition of religion and would have left open-ended legislation. This, of course, also comes with the advice from the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales in its 1992 discussion papers on the same issue. It also favoured the express abolition of the common law offence of blasphemy without specific replacement.

Over time the common law has related to the Christian religion and, in particular, its Anglican adherents. But that is not to say that there could not be a provision adopted in statute law which deals with the matter. The minister referred to what the Law Reform Commission said and did not say. The Law Reform Commission, in report No. 95, referred to this matter in these terms:

         What is needed is confidence in the decisions of the various boards. Senator Cooney was talking about giving them a fair go; he said that people were criticising them. I do not think, from memory, I have personally criticised any members of the Film Censorship Board or the Film Board of Review. I have had plenty of disagreements and discussions with them, but I have not personally denigrated them, nor would I. I think they have a very onerous job, a thankless task, and I appreciate that. I appreciate that each and every one of them would be coming to the job with goodwill and various expertise. That goes for the people within the department as well who also have somewhat of a thankless task.

It must be said that it was not given an R classification by the Film Censorship Board, because the Film Censorship Board refused to classify that film and, therefore, it was not available for public exhibition.

         But I do say this: yes, this is a problem though. Here we have a situation whereby decisions like this on criteria that we are establishing do not properly reflect what the public itself would consider to be a proper application of those criteria.

That is why we have vindicated here these propositions in 2, 5, 6 and 7. They are, I suppose, the community recommendations which we as a committee suggested ought to be part and parcel of this whole package of legislation which includes this bill in the federal sphere and other legislation in the state sphere.

         In essence, what they say is that the government has confidence in the existing system—and I am glad to see that Senator Harradine has expressed that confidence as well in so far as the existing system operates. We believe that it is working well. We believe that a system, for instance, which allows 30 people to be involved in decision making is one that can accommodate wide views. We also believe that with the standards set, for instance, in this particular bill in clauses 48 and 74 as to appointments, we can maintain a system which can, in turn, maintain continuing confidence from the community as to its operation.

        Response: Under the Bill, as is the case with the current Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review, all members of the Classification Board and Classification Review Board hold statutory appointments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Bill the statutory positions of Director and Deputy Director will be subject to the same appointment processes as other Board members i.e. the need to ensure that appointees are broadly representative of the Australian community and the requirement to consult about the appointments with State and Territory Ministers (clause 48 of the Bill).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Further, under the Bill they will be subject to the same tenure provisions (a maximum appointment of 5 years with a total period of appointment of no more than 7 years) as other members of the Boards. This is in contrast with the potentially open-ended reappointment arrangements under the existing legislative provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present the Chief Censor and Deputy Chief Censor also have a senior executive policy and managerial role in relation to the Office of Film and Literature Classification, its personnel and its work. This is in addition to their normal classification functions and responsibilities for managing the work of the Board and for community consultation. These responsibilities will continue under the structure to be established by the Bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It follows from this that in the selection of appointees to fill the position of Director and Deputy Director regard would be had not only to their suitability as representatives of the community in performing classification functions and as representing the public face of the Board but also to their managerial experience.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Government's view the structure provided in the Bill is the most desirable model. The Office of Film and Literature Classification is a small office (there are only 24 public servants employed in the Office) and it is quite appropriate and cost effective for the Chief Censor to also be the Chief Executive Officer of the Office. I note that this structure is consistent with other statutory bodies which have, in recent years, been given greater autonomy, for example, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

        I mention that it has not been the general practice in the past to appoint public servants to the statutory positions referred to.

         Response: The Committee's proposal seeks, in effect, to place a `community committee' between the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board in respect of certain decisions relating to restricted material and between the Classification Review Board and the Attorney-General in respect of certain other decisions also involving restricted material.
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first problem with this proposal is that it is directed solely to material in the restricted classification categories whereas some of the most difficult classification decisions are in relation to the borderline of the `G' and `PG' categories.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, it would be unfortunate if an additional, and potentially cumbersome and costly structure were to put in place merely to safeguard against the possibility that the classification of a contentious film may be unacceptable to some sections of the community. There is ample evidence available to indicate that the Government's intention is that both
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Boards should be representative of the community and, after extensive consultation with the States and Territories, provisions have been added to the Bill to ensure that occurs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In terms of censorship matters it has often been stated that every individual has a view, and that those views may be diverse. Accordingly, it is a significant achievement that the majority of the community appears to support the classification process and to rely upon the decisions that result. (eg, in the 1992 joint ABT/OFLC research project 70% of respondents with dependant children used the classification system; in the 1994 Australian Bureau of Statistics survey commissioned by the OFLC it was found that 90% of households with children 12 years and under were involved in their children's choice of films; it was also found that adults living in families with children 12 years or under were more aware of the classification system than adults in other households.)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not the Attorney-General's role to comment on particular classification decisions made by independent Boards established for this purpose. However, it is appropriate to observe in the context of this recommendation that the particular decision that concerned the Committee in its October 1993 Report on
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues
        </emphasis>
        was made not by the Censorship Board but by the Film and Literature Board of Review as then constituted.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although raised in a different context, the question of greater community involvement in classification decisions has already been addressed by my Department in some detail in an earlier submission to the Committee on the Bill. Nevertheless, the issues are similar and they are repeated here in response to this particular recommendation with some supplementary comments from a Ministerial perspective.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current legislation provides for Censorship Board decisions on the merits and, on appeal, a review on the merits by the Board of Review. Review on questions of law goes to the Federal Court or the High Court. A similar structure is found in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A primary decision on the merits with full merits review on appeal is the standard Commonwealth structure for administrative decisions. As the ALRC in its Report on Censorship Procedure noted, where it differs from other reviews of administrative decisions is that it is not a review of an administrator's decision by an independent body but the reconsideration of a decision of one independent body by another.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This difference means that the current decision making process can potentially involve up to 21 individual decision makers (15 on the Censorship Board and 6 on the Board of Review) who can, in appropriate cases, reach the decision by a majority vote. Under the Bill the potential numbers are 20 on the Classification Board and 10 on the Classification Review Board. This gives the opportunity for a very wide diversity of views to be brought to bear in the decision making process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed community committee would probably add a least a further 10 views to the process if the range of interest groups to be satisfied is taken into account. No doubt the views of this group will be just as divergent as can be the case with the members of the two current Boards and the new Boards. The wide diversity of views that exist within the community are reflected in the results of the on-going public consultation process referred to below.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Quite apart from the undesirability of the Attorney-General having to make classification decisions in the manner proposed in the recommendation, questions relating to whether Board decisions reflect community attitudes, as my Department has previously indicated, are best addressed by ensuring that the Boards:

        The representative nature of the Boards is being addressed by the new process of consultation with State and Territory Ministers and the requirement to look at the representative nature of proposed appointments, both of which are now reflected legislatively in the Bill (cl. 48 and 74). You may be assured that this aspect is treated seriously by myself and my State and Territory colleagues. This is reflected in the recent appointments that have been made to the Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review.

        Further, appointments to the current Censorship Board follow public advertisements, interviews and recommendations on the basis of merit. Of recent times there has also been a State and Territory representative on the interviewing panel. This will continue with the new Classification Board.

        As to keeping abreast of community attitudes, the ALRC's recommendation for an on-going public consultation program has already commenced. This consultation process takes the form of special screenings of classified, but as yet unreleased, films to groups of people assembled by a market research recruitment agency. An independent market research consultant supervises the completion of a questionnaire and leads a discussion aimed at comparing the issues of concern, the range of intensity of concern about those issues, the recommended age, and appropriate consumer advice with those considered by the Censorship Board when making the classification decision. The results are made available to Board members.

        The initial Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on Films, Videos and Computer Games commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) has been completed and copies have been provided to the Committee. Further surveys and research flowing from the results of that survey are planned or underway. These include another joint exercise with the OFLC and the ABA.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the light of the above I do not consider the proposal put forward by the Committee to be justified in the current circumstances. The perceived dissatisfaction with certain classification decisions should be addressed by examining any deficiencies in the current decision making process and taking steps to rectify any problems that are found and not by seeking to impose another potentially unwieldy structure on top of the structure that already exists.

When I was at the Royal College of Surgeons, the lecturer on neurophysiology lectured us on the connections between hearing and vision, the effect that that had and how one superimposed itself on the other. While he was speaking, he put up on the screen a photograph of a young lady in a diaphanous negligee and kept speaking to a room full of people. Dare I say it, that was in 1960 and, out of the 300 who were there, five were females. He then said he wanted us to write down what he had said in the last three minutes. This story is to illustrate that vision overcomes sound in all cases.

I am advised that there will be some minor changes to that prevailing situation in terms of whether the written material has to be submitted. Despite there being no obligation for submission, as to whether this document had been submitted, that is probably a question best asked of the health minister.

         The question that I am asking now is predicated on the fact that, in respect of publications, it is a voluntary scheme. One would have thought that the scheme is designed for the purpose of protecting children from this material. Senator Herron could assist me if he wishes by relaying to the committee what this material is, then the committee can decide whether this material should have gone out in an unrestricted way. What is in this legislation to prevent this material going out to children in an unrestricted way? The minister's response says absolutely nothing. That indicates to me a failing in the legislation that we are dealing with. The minister says that there will be a slight change, presumably in state legislation in relation to publications. What is that slight change going to be and how will it operate?

         The reality is that young people are indulging in sex. No matter how we talk about other things in this place, that is starting point number one. Starting point number two is that they are probably doing it at a younger age and engaging in a wide variety of sexual activities. You cannot get away from that either. The responsibility of the minister and the government in these circumstances is to get a message to kids about safety. In some respects, our campaigns over the years have been world leading. They have been world leading because they have in many ways been at the cutting edge of getting into people's minds and people's psyches. It is not easy to educate young kids about safe sex—it is not easy for parents, it is not easy for the schools and it is not easy for the community.

         Senator Harradine, you asked me, in your final question, about what would be the change in the law. Clause 23 is to the effect that in the Australian Capital Territory—because of constitutional limitation—the censor will be able to look at material that is submittable material under the definition clause of the bill; basically, material that may go into the restrictive category. There will be authority within the censor to be able to call that material and to make an assessment, if it fits that definition of `submittable' and is material that may be in that category of being restricted. That is the minor modification I refer to.

For instance, most people acknowledge that the degree of sexually transmitted diseases amongst young people in this country and elsewhere is at a level that we should not be tolerating. We have to get into their psyches, and that is what has driven this particular project.

When it comes back to the legislation, the very clear point—we will keep coming back to it—is that it has not been submitted and there was no obligation on the minister to so submit. We can keep on going through this at different angles for the next day and a half, but we will come back to that conclusion.

         I wish to raise a couple of other matters. I refer to the section which deals with standing for appeals against decisions of the board. It lists the persons who have standing for the purposes of those appeals. From memory, I think it lists the Attorney-General, the film producer or somebody with an interest, and a person who is aggrieved by the decision. Could you outline to the chamber who would fit into that latter category? Would it exclude a mother who may be concerned that a film is unsuitable for viewing by persons under the age of, say, 18?

         The concept of a person aggrieved is a concept which is found in other legislation, including the customs regulations for an appeal against the decision not to register a film and the ADJR, and it is a subject of judicial authority as to its meaning. It is currently interpreted to cover at least a person who has an interest in the matter but that interest has to be beyond that which he or she may have as an ordinary member of the public. For example, the advice I get from the Attorney-General is that standing would go to, for instance, two priests who may have sought judicial review of the censorship board's decision to register the film

My understanding of the ADJR decisions has been that they would exclude a parent under those circumstances. That is my reading of it. You have incorporated the letter from the Attorney-General to the minister in respect of the recommendations from the committee but that, in a way, wipes off the community involvement.

The two bills are very similar, with identical provisions adjusting the duty on a number of petroleum products, including fuel oil and aviation fuel. The provisions are identical because tariff modifications in customs bills apply only to imports, whereas tariff modifications in excise bills apply to domestically produced goods.

The reductions took effect on 11 May 1994 and were originally announced in the 1994-95 budget. The reductions partially offset the 3c per litre petrol duty increase that followed the 1993-94 budget.

This government never changes: it is always hell-bent on collecting more revenue from the poor consumers in society. There would be a further 1c increase in February and August 1994.

Nabalco, I might point out, is Australia's largest user of fuel oil. It consumes about 45 per cent of all dutiable oil sold in Australia; that is, 1,250 tonnes a day.

         But the increase was still a massive impost on some of our more important export industries. It wiped out the benefits of the final stage of the shipping industry reform package. That was another unintended consequence. The industry and maritime unions had signed an agreement in August 1993 that reduced the average crewing level on Australian ships from 20.5 to 18. The agreement saved $270,000 per ship. The effect of the decision to increase the fuel oil duty by 3c was to add an extra two phantom crew members to each ship—a constant ghostly reminder of the government's failure to consider properly the effects of its policies.

They cannot pass tax rises on to their customers.

         As regards aviation gasoline and kerosene, the bill will increase the air safety regulation duties on avgas and avtur by 1.194c per litre. It would also enact a 7.521c per litre decrease in the component of the avgas excise that is associated with the Civil Aviation Authority's airways services. The duty on avgas would therefore decrease 6.327c per litre in all—that is, a net decrease. Avgas, or aviation gasoline, is the fuel used in piston-driven propeller aircraft.

This bill is the next step in the cost recovery program. The 7.521c per litre decrease in avgas is due to a reduction in the cost of providing services such as air traffic control and flight information. Over the last few years the Civil Aviation Authority has substantially reduced its expenditure on delivering those services. The reduction in duty on avgas passes some of these savings on to the general aviation sector, which largely uses avgas-powered aircraft.

         The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains a number of other amendments. This bill will enact one further alteration to the duty on petroleum products. In 1993 the government legislated to prevent producers and consumers avoiding excise by substituting stabilised crude oil for diesel and condensate for petrol. The legislation inadvertently imposed excise duty on stabilised crude oil and condensate used as a fuel in the recovery, production, transportation and refining of those products. This bill eliminates that anomaly.

         The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 will enact a number of other minor modifications to the customs tariff. Most importantly, it will implement the continued phasing out of developing country preferences. In February 1993 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the government would modify the tariff preference arrangements applying to 42 of the more advanced developing countries. The government accordingly phased out the preferential tariffs applying to a number of products imported from those countries. In Working Nation, the government announced it intended to extend the phase-out even further. Accordingly, the bill proposes to extend it to cover all of those countries' exports to Australia, except cheese, unmanufactured tobacco, sugar and replacement components for passenger motor vehicles.

The coalition does not oppose these bills.

         I also think that a better train service from places such as Sydney and perhaps even Melbourne—but especially Sydney—might mean that more parliamentarians would use a train option rather than an airline option. I think a lot of people would do that. That might create fewer problems for the government in relation to airport noise. I see no real reason for making aviation fuel cheaper. Air travel is not an efficient form of transport in most cases. The greenhouse response strategy, which requires some reflection of damage to be included in price, should at least dictate that air transport does not get any extra advantages.

         Likewise, I understand that the reduction of fuel oil tax which we support in relation to shipping will also be applicable to mining generators, something that also seems counter to energy use and environmental considerations. This is another example of the lack of integration of the supposed objectives of government and one of the reasons greenhouse strategies have little credibility. It seems that whenever there is conflict, the environment and environment policy loses.

         This is not major legislation and I realise that these measures are meant to complete already passed legislation that was in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill last year. In any case, we see the remediation action for shipping to be worth while. So we will not formally oppose the bills but will note that this bill is spoiled by not considering energy use in a bill that will affect it. If I thought an amendment on this bill would have any chance of support, we would have put one to target the benefits to shipping and to exclude air travel and mining.

         As far as Senator Margetts is concerned, it is government policy, and it has been for a long time, in relation to avgas. I would like to see Senator Margetts put the argument to the aviation industry in Australia that it is energy inefficient, et cetera. It would not be something that would be readily received. I accept the fact that the excise rate on avgas is about half the excise rate on petroleum. But, in a country such as Australia, aviation is a most efficient form of travel—the only form of travel for many.

         In excise terms, though it may be getting a cheaper rate, in relation to the overall cost to the community, the impact of having an efficient, effective aviation industry provides wider social benefits as well as economic benefits to the community. I do not think you can ignore that impact. So I do not think you can automatically take a pure environmentalist view about saving fuel consumption, given the broader social impact of not having an efficient aviation industry in Australia. Nevertheless, I am sure that from time to time you will continue to put that viewpoint. I commend the bills to the Senate.

I am pleased to be able to speak on the bill because the provision of services for our veterans and their families has always been an area of great concern to me' going back to the years I spent as the opposition spokesman on veterans' affairs. It is especially appropriate this year, marking 50 years since the end of the Second World War with the Australia Remembers commemoration, although part of this bill deals with matters going back to the end of the First World War. It also deals with more contemporary issues such as service in Cambodia under the auspices of the UN peacekeeping efforts over the last few years.

         This bill amply demonstrates the range of issues we have to consider when legislating on matters affecting the veteran community. It is a reflection of the length of time over which Australian service people have been putting their own lives on the line for this country. It is a reminder of the duty we have to ensure that those people who gave so much for their country are suitably catered for in the period following their active service. The provision of care and services through departments such as Veterans' Affairs is the very least we can do to repay our debt of gratitude to our fellow countrymen.

         I turn my attention first to the Anzac hostel. Under this bill, the legal and beneficial ownership of a property is vested in the Repatriation Commission. The hostel, located in Brighton in Melbourne, has an interesting history. It was established in 1918 through a gift of #25,000 from the Baillieu family to the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Fund. The purpose of the gift was to provide a hostel for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen from the First World War, which was a terrible conflict in terms of the numbers of casualties suffered by our country and by others. It is always a moment for reflection on Anzac Day when the surviving veterans, fewer each year, take their place in Anzac Day marches around the country. The Brighton hostel was one of many Anzac hostels spread across the different states. I understand it is now the only remaining one. It has been described as a showpiece of Anzac hostels. So it is an important part of our heritage, not only for its physical qualities but also as a reminder of the Australian soldiers who have been housed and cared for there.

         The proposed amendment in this bill gives the legal and beneficial ownership of the property to the Repatriation Commission. It removes the trust covering use of the hostel which has restricted the options available to the Repatriation Commission for the provision of aged care facilities for veterans. It gives the commission more room to move over whether to retain or sell the hostel and, if the hostel is sold, how the proceeds of the sale can be applied. The original trust specified the way in which the sale proceeds must be disbursed in accordance with the original intentions of the donors back in 1918.

         This amendment will allow the commission to sell the hostel and do as it deems best with the proceeds. I understand that the intention of the Repatriation Commission is to seek the preservation of the heritage value of the building and to allow the continued use of the site for the provision of care for ex-service men and women. The opposition has no problem with that. Obviously, circumstances have changed since the original gift was made and the donors could not have foreseen the needs of ex-service people further down the track. Indeed, the notion of a second world war two decades later would have been a complete surprise. After all, the war that these First World War soldiers fought was described as `the war to end all wars'.

         It is intended that the Repatriation Commission will consult with ex-service organisations and health groups for the continued use of the Anzac hostel as a care facility. Again, the opposition has no problem with that. The Repatriation Commission must have the ability to manage the hostel in the best way possible and, if this amendment gives the commission that ability, well and good. However, I would add a note of caution. Whatever course of action the commission decides to follow, it must keep the best interests of veterans in mind. This amendment gives the commission the ability to exercise its own judgment on the future of the hostel, and it must do so wisely.

         The bill also makes a number of other amendments to the 1986 act. They include obligations on recipients to provide information or to request the person to appear before a DVA officer. This information can be requested under existing law, but it only provides for criminal penalties if there is a failure to do so.

         The new clause, which will duplicate the existing clause, replaces the previous criminal penalties with an authority to cancel or suspend pensions for failure to comply with an order to supply information. That is a welcome change. It is highly inappropriate for a department such as Veterans' Affairs, given the nature of its constituency, to have the power to resort to criminal sanctions to get information from benefit recipients. Dealing with any government department can be an intimidating experience for those of us unaccustomed to the workings of bureaucracy, and the old and frail are particularly vulnerable. The threat of a criminal penalty only worsens the situation.

         There are amendments also which maintain the `voluntary quotation' status of the tax file number scheme. The amendments change the way in which the provisions affect a person who does not have a tax file number. If a person who applies for a service pension or allowance—which are dependent upon an income test—does not have a tax file number, the secretary to the department will, in future, have the power to request that person to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation to get one. The secretary may not compel the production of a tax file number. However, the reality is that a person who fails to comply with such a request will have their pension or benefits cancelled.

         There is also an amendment which will align the Department of Veterans' Affairs with what happens in Social Security in terms of the use of documents as evidence. The amendments will provide that a signed official departmental document is prima facie evidence of the facts and will allow the Repatriation Commission to prepare a statement of the total benefits paid to a person for any given period. That replaces the previous time consuming process which required that any statement concerning the amount of pension, benefit or allowance paid to a person must contain an itemised list of the payments made each fortnight before it can be accepted.

          Australians have been threatened, and only a few days ago the Khmer Rouge was telling US military advisers to get out of the country or face retribution.

It was a very proud moment for me to see the Australian soldiers operating in Cambodia from their base in Phnom Penh; to visit Battambang and see the large base they had there; to see the role they had taken, in very difficult circumstances; and to realise that most of our soldiers were communications experts who were operating in small groups of one or two spread through the country, in isolated positions with very little security of numbers around them. They took on that job and that ensured that the UN force had effective communications across the country, and made the task of carrying out the UN mandate so much easier.

         —Senator Newman said that she sent netballs. These actions show Australians at their best. I am not talking about my contribution as a politician, but about the contribution of the service people, because what they did is beyond the normal call of duty. I was very proud to be able to visit Cambodia and to see the recognition, by the ordinary people of Cambodia, of Australia's contribution: the role not only of our soldiers but also of our aid agencies who operated in Cambodia under very trying circumstances in the 1980s. The agencies were often under great threat, but they provided humanitarian and developmental aid to the Cambodian people. Although all of us are disappointed that there is still a reluctance and a recalcitrance on the part of the Khmer Rouge to accept the peace outcome and the election result, and although there is killing going on, the situation certainly is better than it was in the 1980s.

         —The Asian Development Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its headquarters in Manila in the Philippines. The bank is actually owned by 37 countries from the Asian region and by 16 countries from outside the Asian region. It is a development finance institution and it has principal responsibility for promoting the economic and social progress of its developing member countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.

         One of its difficulties is that the ADB's geographic boundaries are expanding all the time. For example, membership stretches from tiny Pacific states such as the Marshall Islands, to Micronesia and Indonesia; also to China, India, Afghanistan and Mongolia, to name a select few.

         There have always been tensions in the bank. Its current philosophy is tending to promote development that not only alleviates poverty but also lays the groundwork for market forces to operate within Asian regions. The bank is now developing much more of a social consciousness than it did in the past. It is true to say that there is less agreement today on whether the bank should remain as a big spender in physical terms, or whether the issues of health, environmental resources and human resources will take a more prominent role.

         On the other hand, we must acknowledge that the bank's contribution, in the overall terms of meeting the demand, is a very small one. The fact that Australia does hold 102,370 shares in the Asian Development Bank is important. Although the holding represents only six per cent of the total subscribed capital, it is nevertheless the fourth largest regional shareholder of the Asian Development Bank and it is an important part of Australia's multilateral development program.

         This bill is not a very long one, merely a couple of pages. However, within those pages, it allows the Treasurer—who, incidentally, is a member of the Board of Governors—to make the necessary agreement with the Asian Development Bank for Australia to purchase its further entitlement of 2,047 additional paid-up shares and 100,323 additional callable shares of its capital stock in the market. This purchase will enable the bank to develop programs and to assist in improving the standard of living in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region.

         I wish to name a few of the bank's achievements since 1966. It has had 173 irrigation and rural development projects; 89 fisheries, livestock and forestry projects; 118 projects for industrial crops; and 169 power projects. It has been heavily involved in the production of gas and coal. In the social infrastructure, there have been 82 water supply and sanitation projects which have benefited something like 100 million people. There have been 71 education projects which have rehabilitated people. They are just a few of the very positive things that the bank has done.

         To bring it more up to date, the Asian Development Bank gave a high priority to a highway project which was estimated to cost $US18.6 million, linking Bangkok via Phnom Penh to Vung Tau just north of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Furthermore, the bank initiated the cooperation between Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam in 1993 and coordinated meetings up to the most recent undertaking. The Asian Development Bank's goal is to use existing infrastructure and to upgrade it instead of building new roads. Other upgrade projects earmarked for early implementation include the east-west corridor project from Thailand through Laos to Vietnam, estimated to cost almost $US50 million.

         By purchasing these shares, the benefits will not only be seen in the Asia-Pacific region but also in our country. Australia will benefit from the activities of the Asian Development Bank as major procurements from Australia by the Asian Development Bank cover goods, related services, civil works and consultancy services, which benefit Australian farmers, Australian workers and, most importantly, Australian jobs. The ability to provide a reciprocal benefit to Australia as well as to foreign aid projects is undoubtedly a move in the right direction.

         The bank is governed by a board of governors which only meets once a year. However, its day-to-day activities are actually governed by a board of 12 directors who are full time in that area. The opposition does not oppose the bill but we wish to bring to the government's attention the 102,370 shares that Australia owns in the Asian Development Bank. The amount that has already been paid is $168.8 million and the remaining $1.237 billion is subject to call. As yet, a call on the balance of those funds has not been made due to the bank's prudent financial policies and heavy levels of reserves. Some people have criticised that its lending policy has not been liberal enough given the adequacy of those reserves.

         As a major player in the Asian Development Bank, Australia should take up the opportunity to increase its shareholdings at this stage. However, even though there are good reasons for being involved in the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank has been seen to be using a considerable amount of its funds on administration. Perhaps the greatest benefit that Australia could provide to this bank is to seek the assistance of some of the major Australian banks such as the National Australia Bank or a consortium of Australian banks which have world class expertise in cost minimisation programs through the use of electronic facilities. The cost of administration is a major concern to the coalition and to a number of other member contributors from the west. We believe not enough attention has been focused on getting on top of cost containment. There has been a degree of lavishness in the construction of the headquarters of the Manila bank. In fact, it was reported by the Hyundai company—the major contractor on that headquarters—that at one stage it received on average something like seven major changes to the design plans of that bank each working week which added considerably to the blow-out of the cost and also to the time that it took to construct the new headquarters.

         We do have to acknowledge that during the 1980s in some ways the Asian Development Bank really did lose its way. Its methods and its missions were frequently called into question. So the challenges of the 1990s are really going to be in mediating what I term a balance between public and private sector development and developing more of a social conscience.

         To be fair, and a lot of its critics do not acknowledge this, the bank does have a soft lending sector. The bank, with its headquarters in Manila, is at the centre of the fastest growing region of the world, where both west and east have major strategic and economic and other interests. With this scenario, it is not surprising that amongst the various members there is a bit of a push-pull type of mentality. There is some concern in some quarters about the influence of Japan on the bank's activities, particularly with the previous head who was seen to be surrounding himself too much with Japanese advisers to the exclusion of people from the rest of the region.

         The question also has to be asked as to whether a number of the other—what I might term—economic Asian tigers that have had very high rates of growth in recent times are actually pulling their weight sufficiently in relation to the bank's activities. Some of the critics have said that because of Japan's involvement it has been a major beneficiary, perhaps more so than a number of the other contributing countries, in terms of the consequences or flow-on effects of its particular programs.

         One of the difficulties that is going to be facing many of these countries that are emerging from difficulties—and I refer to Vietnam and Mongolia, and even Afghanistan, India and China—is that the reason for the success of some of the so-called Asian tigers of the past has been that the rest of the world has given these countries fairly open access for their exports. The question remains: are we tending to move to blocs which may tend to restrict access to the goods of some of these newly emerging countries that really do need to export to raise the standard of living of their people? The challenge will really be whether the rest of the world will provide the degree of open access that in the past enabled the success of countries like Taiwan, Korea and Japan.

         A lot of the criticism of the bank has surrounded its lending policies. For many years there was a difficulty in terms of China, India and Vietnam. It does not seem to be any coincidence that the opening up of lending by the bank to those particular countries coincided with or followed very closely behind Japan's policy of lending directly to those particular countries. That initially met some resistance from countries such as the United States of America, but fortunately that has tended to pass in more recent times. Some of the bank's Western donors, particularly the United States, have questioned the value of some of its loans. As I have said, they seemed to benefit principally the Japanese contractors more than the borrowers.

         A further criticism is that the bank is not nearly tough enough in linking loans policy to policy reforms. If one compares the Asian Development Bank with the World Bank, then clearly the Asian Development Bank falls well behind in this regard. It is a sensitive point, but on the other hand we have got to acknowledge that the Asian Development Bank does not have the financial or political clout of some of the bigger lenders like the IMF or the World Bank.

         Further doubts surround the quality of the project management ability of the Asian Development Bank, in terms of its ability to properly evaluate the project loans it makes and to oversee the project management. In recent times, of the 54 projects which the bank's in-house team evaluated in one particular year, only 18 were deemed to be a success. I mentioned earlier the mismanagement of the construction of its own headquarters a number of years ago.

         There has also been argument about the bank's lending policies and whether it should really be attaching conditions to loans, particularly to countries such as China and India. Some of the shareholders of the bank have believed that the bank should have stipulations that the lending should be directed more towards social problems, and that has not always been well received by some of the recipient countries such as India and, in particular, China. But there are other associated problems, because the Chinese wanted access to soft loans which were available from the Asian development fund, which is controlled by the bank. Such a request is also complicated by the fact that when China gets soft loans, India wants the same access.

         It is not an easy area for management, because it is continually beset by problems. There are some notorious failures, and I think it would be remiss of us not to draw attention to those, too. For example, in Nepal there was a paper mill in an area where there was no pulp available. The success rate of projects is perhaps not increasing. In fact, according to a number of observers it might even be going in the other direction.

         I have mentioned the scope of the problem in terms of geographical dimension, but increasingly the bank is venturing into more difficult terrain. Mention has been made of Cambodia or Kurdistan and it is certainly harder to work there than, for example, in relatively developed places like Indonesia and Thailand. But at the same time, the private sector capital flows are increasingly into infrastructure, so the bank's philosophies are tending to change.

         Perhaps, given the limited amount of time available, I should indicate that the bank is supposed to be about developing and about alleviating and overcoming poverty. The question is frequently asked in Australia: is the Asian Development Bank a worthwhile recipient of part of our aid budget? I think we have got to be somewhat careful because currently circulating within the parliament is a letter directed to the IMF and other institutional lenders requesting a greater priority on social issues. We have got to approach such letters with some degree of caution, because while this might be desirable we must not jeopardise the economic wellbeing of such banks. In many areas the bank has been regarded as a soft touch. When we look at their record of bad debts or slow payments, the question of bringing those to account is a further worry. Despite economic factors there is undoubtedly a need for proper projects directed to health, education, environment and enhancing the role of women as part of a development bank.

         The social needs are great but the problem that I am raising is that it is often very hard to make such lending profitable. Whether we should be developing other arms or other institutions to fulfil grand social objectives does need to be asked. What I am saying is this: let us not have an uncritical approach to this lending, particularly at a time of economic stringency in Australia. The Opposition supports the bill.

         —Before I briefly give the Greens' position on the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994, I wish to mention a couple of points that Senator Watson has brought up. He mentioned that we have got to be concerned, if we look at the social values that we apply to our support or otherwise of the Asian Development Bank, not to jeopardise the economic viability of the region. I really do not think there is any evidence at all, from looking at projects which are regionally based or community based, or from looking at the benefits to women in the community, that those kinds of projects are less viable or are going to bring fewer economic benefits to the region than projects which are largely imposed from on high. In fact, there is quite clear evidence that the ability of people to pay back loans is much greater when the proposals are community based than when they are imposed from on high in sometimes unaffordable projects.

         While I recognise that the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill is non-controversial in this place, because it has the support of at least both major parties, I would like it to be noted on record that the Greens (WA) oppose this bill. The reason we oppose this is that the Asian Development Bank, the ADB, operates on the pretext of being foreign development aid. It is included in the foreign aid budget as `multilateral aid'. Yet it is one of the fairly suspect aid agencies that appear to be imposing social and economic policies on other nations in the interest of supposedly improving their economic environment.

         Many of these structural adjustment programs do not work for the people of a nation, but, instead, work to make them poorer, reduce access to education and health, and often open them to international exploitation. If senators do not think that is true, ask some of the people in New Guinea who have had their so-called free education increased 400 per cent and are now required to pay 400 kina. This is a requirement of an international aid agency such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

         In this respect, the Asian Development Bank is very similar to, and works in conjunction with, the World Bank and the IMF. It is not foreign aid. The fact that Australian interests in the ADB are represented by Treasury rather than Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Islander Affairs (Mr Bilney) is indicative of the real agenda of this organisation. We suspect it also means that Australia, through the Treasury, is pushing for just the sort of structural adjustment regimes that are creating the mounting criticisms of these organisations.

         The Asian Development Bank is also strongly involved in several specific projects to which we object. Among the worst is support for major dams, such as the Thuen Hinban Dam, to be built in Laos across the Mekong, the Sekong and their tributaries. Most people who have studied even casually the record of international development will have some understanding of why we are questioning these projects. The record on dam projects has generally been atrocious. Often projects are poorly conceived, having huge technical problems within years. It is no wonder money cannot always be paid back.

         Dams often have huge biological impacts, not only in terms of general ecological considerations but also through things like the spread of schistosomiasis to human populations and other unforeseen health impacts. Then there are the well-documented impacts on communities, on occasions relocated at gunpoint to shanty towns, if they are lucky, or simply abandoned to make their way as landless poor to the slums around big cities. While awareness of these problems has raised them to international prominence, it has not stopped international development banks from supporting them directly and indirectly, with devastating consequences.

         In Laos over a dozen large dams are proposed for the Mekong-Sekong area. Virtually all of them are to provide power for Thailand. The Mekong-Sekong river system is, to freshwater biologists, what the Amazon is for terrestrial biologists. For example, while there are only 27 freshwater fish species in Australia, the Mekong River Basin is estimated to have over 1,000 species. It is an incredibly diverse aquatic and jungle ecology. The rainforest there is a largely pristine habitat for the largest populations of wildlife in Indochina, including tigers, leopards, elephants, guar, bantang, Asiatic black bears, gibbons, and other rare mammal species, as well as tens or hundreds of thousands of plants, insect, bird and reptile species, many of which are rare or endangered.

While the Asian Development Bank is not always directly contributing to all of the dams, neither has it considered the total impact of so many dam projects in such a small area.

         —The purpose of the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994 is to authorise the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to enter into an agreement with the Asian Development Bank for the provision of additional capital to the bank. The agreement will allow Australia to purchase its entitlement of 2,047 additional paid-up shares and 100,323 additional callable shares in the capital stock of the bank. It also empowers the Treasurer, where appropriate, to issue promissory notes to the bank in payment and appropriates the funds necessary.

         The Asian Development Bank was established in 1966 to provide multilateral development finance and to encourage social and economic development in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia played a very important role in the development of the bank, and it is one of the major shareholders. The bank has always been one of those world regional banks with which we have had, as a country, the closest association. The bank has grown over time and it now has 55 member countries, of which 37 are members from the region. Of its members, 33 were classified as developing countries in 1993.

         I support very much the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson in the debate today in saying that the ADB has had a bit of a mixed track record. There have been some projects that have not gone as well as we would have liked. There has been disputation, from time to time, over the prioritisation of its funds, the determination of the projects with which it should be associated, and which of those projects it should fund.

         It seems to me that, in the comments made by Senator Margetts, she was placing a little too much reliance on just one aspect of the bank's project work; in particular, she paid attention to the development of dams. The ADB is, of course, a much more broadly based bank in terms of its activities than that.

         Overall, the ADB has been a success, but there is room for improvement. It can be fairly criticised—as Senator Watson did—in terms of top heaviness in some of its administrative structures, and there is certainly scope for improvement. Australia has a very important role in the bank. We are an important player in the region, and we have a very positive opportunity to play an increasing part there.

         The bank is, of course, in that sense, a major institution in Australia's multilateral development program. We hold six per cent of the bank's capital, which is valued at $US1.4 billion. Of that amount, $US168.8 million has been paid to the bank and the remainder is subject to call. We are the fifth largest shareholder in the bank after the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada, although there may be one other shareholder.

         In May 1994, the ADB Board of Governors approved the resolution to double the general capital of the bank to $US48.8 billion. That is what this bill is about. Under that arrangement Australia will be entitled to another 102,370 shares. Only two per cent of those will be paid up. The remainder are callable, in line with our pre-existing situation. Australia has supported the increased ADB capital proposal. We on the coalition side support that expansion in the capital of the bank. So far as the financial aspects for Australia are concerned, the $US24.69 million required under the paid-up arrangement will be payable over a 10-year period, and it is envisaged that this will occur in six equal instalments beginning this year.

         —I appreciate the comments made by senators in the debate. In 1989 I was a member of the subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade looking at Australia's overseas aid program. We took extensive evidence from Australians who previously worked at the Asian Development Bank, and to say that we received a sorry tale of maladministration would be an understatement. I think our report reflected that at the time when it was tabled. As a member of that subcommittee I was one of those people who expressed strong comments and criticism similar to what other senators have expressed here today.

         There is no doubt that in those days the bank was top-heavy in administration, and though there has been considerable improvement I think it still is. The issue of salaries, conditions and perks paid to the permanent staff is somewhat obscene compared with the issues they are trying to address in helping the very poorest in developing countries get a better deal in the world. I want to point out to senators that the government is aware of this criticism. Recently Australia voted against salary increases for the staff and executive directors of the ADB and the World Bank, and abstained from a recent ADB vote on the administrative budget to demonstrate our displeasure at the salary decisions previously approved.

         The appointment as our representative at the Asian Development Bank of Peter McCawley, the former deputy head of AIDAB—a man with a development background—was a very welcome move indeed. Again, one of the criticisms of our 1988 report was that we had always been appointing people from Treasury. Commendable and as experienced as they were in Treasury matters and matters of international finance, their experience in development matters was much more limited. I support strongly the view of the committee that the ADB is a development organisation and not a banking institution, and our representatives should reflect those skills on the development side. As I understand it, Peter McCawley was the first non-Treasury officer to be appointed as our permanent representative for a term of office, and as such I think his appointment was welcome indeed. As one who knows Peter personally, I suspect he would have taken some pleasure in voting against the salary increases and the perks that go with it at the Asian Development Bank.

         It is interesting to note that from 1989 to 1993 Australian procurement from the ADB exceeded the contribution by Australia to the ADB by $170 million. One of the criticisms that we had in the late 1980s was that Australian organisations were not getting a proportionate share of the contracts compared with our contribution. Most people believe the ratio should basically be one to one. I think we have seen a big improvement since then. Australian organisations are now getting a higher proportion, not because we are rigging the process but because we have actually got the skills in our organisations—the business community, aid agencies and so on—to know how to put forward the best proposals to meet the changing needs for aid in the developing world.

         I have always—and I think others have too—had a view that the organisations of the Asian Development Bank can be easily criticised. I have made it clear that the government has accepted that. It is reflected by some of the things we have done recently. However, the Asian Development Bank is a multilateral aid agency where governments are represented. It is the best we have got going in the region in conjunction with the World Bank and it is therefore supported. We have always taken up every demand on a call since 1966 and that means we are now the sixth biggest shareholder. We have always accepted that responsibility. Though, at times, there have been criticisms that the money could have been better spent elsewhere in the aid budget, we have stuck with the Asian Development Bank. We have called consistently for reform and improvement and will continue to do so.

         We note that the Asian Development Bank is slowly moving, probably not as fast as some of us would like, towards programs of social benefit for communities. That is very necessary. I have always felt that the bank should get closer to programs such as the success, for example, of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. It is a bank that is aimed at providing small loans to very poor women in villages in particular. It gives them access to very small amounts of money, maybe no more than $200 or $300, to start a small business. The bank has had an extraordinary success rate at that sort of level of contribution. I think the repayment rate has been over 90 per cent. It has empowered women in the very poorest of circumstances to break through the poverty barrier. Those are the sorts of programs I think the Asian Development Bank has got to support. It must provide the funds for such national institutions as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.

On behalf of the government, I can assure the senators present that we will continue to keep the pressure up on the performance of this bank, particularly on its management terms, its conditions, the salaries that are paid to its staff and also the evaluation of its projects to make sure there is proper transparency. Every year we have a chance to debate annual reports in estimates committee hearings and so on and I am sure the interest of senators will continue in those forums. I commend the bill to the Senate.

In light of the higher revisions to earlier months deficits and the new market forecast, does the minister support the need for the government to review its recent forecast? Does the minister concur with the sentiments of the chief economist of Schroders, Mr Brett Allender, that `If we're not worried about that'—that is, a 6 per cent of GDP deficit in the balance of payments—`I'm sure international investors will start worrying about it as the year goes on'?

That much was said yesterday by Treasurer Willis and I am certainly comfortable in confirming that today. The improving international economic outlook—there is no question that it is improving—is expected to increase demand for our exports which, combined with higher commodity prices and, of course, the breaking of the drought, will help offset the impact of a rising net income deficit on the current account deficit in the year ahead.

         These days, Australia is increasingly recognised as producing goods and services which are invariably better than foreign imports. As a nation we are competitive on cost, on the quality of the products that we produce and on the design input that we insert into those products, and we are better, too, in services and backup. While that is a trend that many Australians recognise—and increasingly that is the case; I think some 73 per cent recognise that buying Australian is buying quality—there are, nonetheless, some who still think that buying foreign is good.

The campaign, according to a recent consumer survey, means that 73 per cent of customers in this country consider that locally made products are generally better quality than comparable imported products, and the 2,600 licensees who use the `Australian Made' logo employ over half a million Australians and generate $4 billion in sales annually. The research commissioned by the government indicates that an additional $185 million to $350 million per year in sales is generated as a consequence. I commend the buy Australian campaign to the Senate and to Australia.

I refer to Minister Crean's announcement yesterday of ongoing funding for 500 extra higher education places in Queensland. Whilst of course welcoming that announcement, we note that it has taken Labor 12 years to address the problem and that Queensland is still well behind all other states. How does the government intend to fund this expansion when the Department of Finance in its leaked budget document has called for a cut in operating grants to all Australian universities amounting to $131 million, a proposal which is supported by the Treasury and the Prime Minister's department? Will the government be paying for this decision by ripping places out of South Australia and Victoria, as earlier foreshadowed, or by increasing HECS, or by a further overall reduction in the quality of education?

         Since its inception in 1989, Clean Up Australia Day has grown enormously. From a clean-up of Sydney Harbour which involved 40,000 people, Clean Up Australia Day 1994 was an event with half a million people participating from 700 towns and cities across Australia. In the past six years, more than two million Australians have dedicated the first Sunday in March to retrieving rubbish from the country's streets, roadsides and waterways. This is evidence that individuals can make a huge contribution towards protecting the environment, starting with their own immediate environment, their own local area.

         Protection of the environment is now a very important long-term issue on our nation's agenda, and I believe it is becoming a more important priority for Australians every day. There are a large number of Australians who recognise that the state of our environment directly impacts on our quality of life as well as on the quality of life of future generations. Clean Up Australia Day is one of those occasions that really does offer Australians an opportunity to demonstrate the commitment to the environment that is broadly held in the community, and hopefully many others will join in.

         There is no disputing that the Federal Court accepted the public understanding of the term `Made in Australia' as meaning that the product had its essential quality of character made in Australia. That comes out in Justice Davies' decision. Justice Davies went on to find that the koalas in question actually acquired their essential characteristic here, whereas the contention was that they acquired that characteristic overseas. So the definition is not rejected, and our understanding is not rejected; it is just an interpretation of the facts in respect of that legal  definition. I suppose that in this sort of area we are used to a degree of a campaign of misinformation, particularly by those on the other side.

Changing shadow ministers and positions are reasons for this. The shifting sands of the other side cannot really give us a solid position to basically respond to.

         —The Australian government very warmly welcomes the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission findings on the 12 January killings in Liquica in East Timor. The full report of the commission has not yet been released, but it announced its basic findings yesterday. In short, the commission found that the six had been shot unlawfully, torture had been used and that they were unarmed civilians. It did not find conclusive evidence that the six were Fretilin supporters, as had been claimed.

         This is a very important recognition from inside Indonesia that the human rights situation in East Timor remains far from satisfactory. It lends support to the view that the overall situation there has deteriorated since late last year. The Liquica killings are also the subject of an investigation by a military investigative team, which has reportedly concluded that, while soldiers had violated procedures, two of those killed were Fretilin members and the other four were members of a network supporting Fretilin. A recently appointed Military Honour Council, as the terminology goes, is yet to consider the military team's findings. It is not known when it will announce its decisions.

         More generally, the human rights commission role in relation to the Liquica killings is also welcome evidence that there is now greater scope within Indonesia for public expression of alternative views on sensitive issues. It has independently found common ground with some of the concerns that the Australian government has been expressing publicly and privately about the deteriorating situation in East Timor. It may take time for more liberal attitudes to prevail. But, as I have constantly said, Indonesia is a society in transition. We should acknowledge those positive trends as well as be quick to react to the less positive ones.

         Might I say again more generally that we hope these findings will encourage the Indonesian government to reconsider its whole approach in East Timor. As I said just a few days ago in Jakarta in my talks with Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, a process of reconciliation in East Timor is more necessary now than ever. That needs to involve a massive reduction in the military presence there, as has already been promised by the Indonesian government; recognition of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity; some sensitive economic development which has regard to the distinctive character of the place; and, hopefully, some greater degree of political autonomy as well. A `security approach' will not solve the problems in East Timor. The application of that kind of approach to date has quite an unenviable track record of human rights abuse.

         The human rights situation in East Timor is currently under scrutiny at the annual session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, which does afford an opportunity to highlight the continuing international concern about the situation there.

         I repeat that the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission findings are encouraging. I think they ought to be given due recognition and acknowledgment by those people who are so quick to criticise everything that happens in the country. I think there is a current, a mood, of concern there. This is one very overt expression of that, and we ought to welcome it. I do.

They had come together to form a joint company called Building Employment and Training Australia, or BETA, to look at ways of improving training opportunities for young people joining the construction industry.

         The objective of the joint company is to have 1,000 new traineeships by the end of 1995. As a result of its proposal, the government was able to provide by NETTFORCE $100,000 to fund the joint venture company. The government was very pleased to see this example of an industry which, despite the fact that only a few years ago it was bedevilled by confrontation and antagonism, can now have both employers and employees working together for the good of the industry itself and which, above all else, is creating employment opportunities for young people in Australia. This also reflects the general improvement in the construction industry in Australia in recent years and, in particular, the success of the reform strategy which this industry has entered into with the Australian government.

         Since 1991, with the formation of the Construction Industry Development Agency, known as CIDA, and the operation of the Construction Industry Development Council, we have seen many improvements in the way this industry has been organised and run. There has been major commitment to reform and, as a result, industrial disputes have been substantially reduced—in many cases to almost negligible proportions. We have seen innovation, new techniques of management, new techniques of building itself—all to make our construction industry a much more competitive industry.

         Let me say in respect of him and anyone else who may be Australian citizens in prisons overseas, the government has been working on—not on its own, but with state governments—and has achieved, through a cooperative arrangement with state governments, a transfer of prisoners scheme.

Indeed, we did hold initial discussions on some of these coupes on Tuesday evening and agreed to delay a decision on a further release of coupes to allow groups more time to provide comment. The process that has been undertaken is the most feasible available, given the government's desire, which we articulated some time ago, to release some coupes quickly to maintain continuity for the industry where that is environmentally possible.

         This is the second round of consultations in fact in relation to the particular coupes in question—the second round with the conservation, industry and union groups. While short response times have been provided for, useful comments have been received from all groups, and they have been incorporated into the advice that has been before cabinet and will be coming forward to us again. It is the case that Minister Faulkner and Minister Collins—in the case of Bob Collins, in WA today—are also undertaking personal discussions with interested parties. So I am not going to be any more specific than that in my response to Senator Bell's question.

         There is further consultation. The lead times are sufficiently long, we believe, to enable a proper consultative process to take place. Of course, we are talking about a much more extended process over full eight-week periods in relation to the whole number of coupes that are in issue in this particular debate. We will again be engaging in proper process of the kind that has already been outlined by the Prime Minister in relation to those as well.

It marks, together with the report on manufacturing exports, which was released recently, a picture of the long-term change in the structure of the profile of our exports and of our economy. It is a slow process to change the structure of an economy, particularly one with such a strong and successful emphasis on commodities, as we have had over the last century or so of our economy and to which we have added recently, as this report shows, a successful tourism sector.

         What the two reports do reflect is that the structure of the Australian economy, and more particularly our export profile, is moving more towards the rapidly growing areas of world trade—that is, manufactures and services—and our reliance upon our traditional strengths in commodities is being reduced. It is not that we want to reduce our participation in that area, but we are trying to add this new element so that we can get closer to the areas of rapidly growing export. As our profile moves into that area we can take advantage of being, in geographic terms, in proximity to the fastest growing areas in world trade and also our economy will be participating in the fastest growing areas of economic activity. That is where the long-term solution to our serious balance of payments situation lies.

         None of these events will turn it around overnight. But the opening up of Australia's economy to international competition in the early 1980s has had, over the succeeding period, dramatic impact upon our services sector, and services exports have been expanding at a greater rate than services imports. We have been improving our balance situation there and at a greater rate than global services exports—that is, our international market share in this areas has been improving.

         In fact, for the first time in our history we had a trade surplus for services in the March quarter of 1992 and we are now still reflecting the fundamental change in the structure of our economy. We have dramatically reduced the deficit. It is down to $1.4 billion over the year 1993-94, as reflected in this report, which is down to less than half the size of the deficit of a decade earlier. More importantly, if the trends continue, and the expectation is that they will at this stage, the balance of the international services account will have shifted to surplus by 1995-96, contributing to a long-term solution to our balance of payments situation.

         We need to move the goods and services element of our trade substantially into surplus because of the problem of significant net income deficit. Merely balancing our goods and services account will not be sufficient over the medium-term. That is why the emphasis is being shifted to these important areas of manufactures and services, so that when prices improve in our commodities—and, as Senator Evans indicated earlier, the expectations are that they will—we will have improving strengths in our traditional areas of economic activity but also capacity to add to them in elaborately transformed manufactures and services.

         The improvement in services is widespread. The greatest strength comes from tourism, but there are some other significant areas to note which are important for jobs in Australia and for quality jobs in Australia—the boom in our education exports from virtually zero to $1.4 billion by 1992. The information technology and telecommunications sector, which has increased tenfold over the last decade in its exports, has set itself an ambitious target of improving fourfold again, to $10 billion by the year 2000. So this report is an important signpost along the road to restructuring the Australian economy and shows significant positive elements.

The government found the decision quite confusing and therefore joined in an appeal against it. The government found that the way the decision was written was inconsistent, in its view, with the Industrial Relations Act. Therefore, it supported an appeal against that process. I have not personally had an opportunity to study the decision the commission handed down yesterday nor do I have a brief from the minister with regard to the analysis of it.

        The government's continual condoning of the illegal and improper activities of the Prime Minister's piggery group while Mr Keating was a half owner seems to go on and on. I detailed the latest example in a notice of motion I gave this morning. There has not been one word of apology or admonition from the Prime Minister or his ministers about these repeated breaches of the law while the Prime Minister was a half owner of this piggery. There has not been any criticism by the Prime Minister of his former company's involvement in this latest conspiracy with a Danish multi-national. This has allowed the Prime Minister to escape the humiliation of his half owned piggery, at the time, being found guilty of polluting the upper reaches of the Scone water supply. The Prime Minister has already misled the parliament over his piggery's polluting practices which were admitted by the company during the New South Wales government's commission of inquiry into its expansion plans about 15 months ago.

         Is it too much to ask the Prime Minister to stop his hypocrisy and come out and condemn what this piggery has repeatedly done? Otherwise, Mr Keating's professed concerns about the environment will be exposed as simply dishonest. He will not allow pollution unless he is the polluter. That is the simple consequence of what has been happening now.

         There is no doubt about the facts of this latest example of how the Prime Minister's former company has got around the law. There are plenty of instances where his companies did not get around the law. They were hit with penalties by the Australian Securities Commission for failure to meet the reporting requirements of the ASC. The fact that there were 13 penalties involved seemed to get very little attention in the media. I find that extraordinary.

He is not prepared to dissociate himself from those activities beyond saying, `Oh, I wasn't in charge of the running of it.' He was a half owner. He has condoned by his silence the dishonest and improper behaviour of this polluting piggery. There is no doubt about the facts.

The sad thing is that the federal government, by sending the Lake Pedder issue to an inquiry, has in fact countenanced, in the true sense of the word, the draining. I hope that the government will decide in the end not to, but by sending it to an inquiry and not ruling it out it has in fact given comfort to those who would drain the lake. It should have ruled it out straightaway, instead of which it has put the member for Fraser, Mr Langmore, in charge of an inquiry, which is a bit like putting a child in charge of a lolly shop on an issue like this. His views on Lake Pedder have been put on the public record prior to the hearing and I would have thought this would have given him a conflict of interest.

In the document are letters from people such as David Suzuki. He stated that he believes Pedder 2000 is ushering in a remarkable new era where we seek to actually restore and heal systems that have been damaged by human activity. Milo Dunphy says that draining Lake Pedder is the best possible start to preventing a Welcome Reef Dam, the raising of the Warragamba Dam, the ecological disaster of the Tully Millstream project in Queensland and a dam in New Zealand. They are saying that after a five-year occupation of the Seve de la Fare Dam site on the upper Loire in France, they have managed to have two big dams, out of four originally planned, totally or partially abandoned.

After two years, they eventually get the world heritage agency to come to the Lake Eyre region. The people there live in a very sparsely populated area. They get to the stage where they are going to meet these people and, at the very last minute and without any prior knowledge, the agency cancels the meeting, thus causing tremendous expense to the people involved.

         The people in the area naturally wondered why, at the last minute, these consultations would not take place. The reason given was that it was considered inappropriate to visit the area at present in the light of recent violence between opposing Aboriginal groups in Marree and the lodgment of a native title claim for Lake Eyre Basin. That is the reason given as to why, after the proposed world heritage listing, the world heritage agency would not even consult with the people in the Lake Eyre catchment area. The people involved have said that, having put this much time and effort into trying to talk to people from Canberra and trying to talk to the agency, if this is the best that the agency—part of Senator Faulkner's department—can do, what is the point of their going to the expense that they have gone to to try to have the consultations over the three-day period? What is the point of trying to go on if things are going to be cancelled at this very late stage?

         Senator Faulkner's answer today to Senator Newman and this other example of Lake Eyre serve to show that the minister's portfolio is a shambles and that he presides daily over issues which he is no longer in control of and in which he has no idea what is happening. I do not know what it will be next week, but I am quite sure that Senator Faulkner has reached the stage where the portfolio that he is in charge of is now in charge of him. Unless we get some sensible answers, there is not going to be any cooperation from or consultation with these people. They are so far removed from Canberra and they are having their lives disrupted by agreements and arrangements which, at the very last minute, are put aside by people who show no cause and no care for people who otherwise have no opportunity to have any influence over what is happening in their area.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison this day, relating to the detention of Mr Eric Robert Bowra in the United Arab Emirates.

       <para>
        I remind the Senate that I asked a question of Senator Evans on 7 December last year. At that stage, Senator Evans assured the Senate that the government was doing all it could to assist Mr Bowra. I must say that there was a letter written by Senator Evans, which I acknowledge and appreciate, on behalf of the government, seeking to assist Mr Robert Bowra. Of course, things have changed now. The court has upheld Mr Robert Bowra's appeal. His sentence has been reduced from 12 months to six months. That decision was given on 5 February this year. That date marked the period of exactly six months from the date that Mr Bowra had been arrested, so he had served six months straight and was due for release on that day.

         It is now over three weeks later, and Mr Bowra still remains in prison. Even if we apply the United Arab Emirates law, which we should really do in these situations—we cannot apply Australian law because it is not applicable—Mr Bowra should have been released three weeks ago. It remains totally unsatisfactory that this man, who has a wife and children in Australia and a business, all of which have suffered tremendously as a result of this, remains in prison. Three weeks might not seem long, but it is an extremely long time to be in a foreign prison without seeing those close to you and without being able to run your business, which I believe in this case has all but totally collapsed.

         I therefore impress upon the government the need to do everything it can. I cannot understand why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot make a quick representation when he passes through Dubai on Monday. Communication could be made at the highest level. It is a golden opportunity. Why not pull out all stops to help this man and his family? It is not just a matter of concern for his family; it is a matter of concern for all Australians. We have an Australian national in a foreign gaol who should have been released over three weeks ago.

         I appreciate Senator Gareth Evans's concern about this matter. As I say, I acknowledge the action he has taken previously. But the ante has now been upped. This man is in prison, despite a court ruling in his favour. It seems that what has been done to date is just not good enough. If the ambassador has to sit at the prison door to secure this man's release, he should do so. I therefore call upon the government to increase its efforts to help release Robert Bowra.

        Mr President, I rise to make a statement on behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport about shipping in and around our unique national treasure, the Great Barrier Reef.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Presently ships use two routes to traverse the Reef.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What is known as the inner route travels from the Torres Strait in the north, to Gladstone in the south.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The alternative route—the outer route, commences in the Prince of Wales Channel, leaves the Torres Strait at Bligh Entrance, and continues southwards through the Coral Sea to Sandy Cape, just south of Gladstone.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All ships entering and leaving the inner and outer routes have to cross the Torres Strait.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present, pilotage is compulsory in the inner route between Cairns and the Torres Strait for all oil and chemical tankers and liquid natural gas carriers regardless of size and all other ships over 70 metres in length.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The most hazardous parts of the reef to navigate are in the Torres Strait, and in the northern section of the inner passage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Narrow channels, strong tides and the presence of fishing boats all enhance the risk of a grounding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore in the case of the outer route the process of skirting the reef, and the largely uncharted waters pose a similar risk of grounding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With some 87 million tonnes of international trade—mostly Australian exports—shipped through the region annually, this ever present danger is a matter of great concern.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Altogether there are some 2100 local and international vessel movements annually, including 1700 through the inner route, 600 of which do not call at any Queensland port inside the reef. This leaves some 400 vessels using the outer route.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whilst pilotage in the inner route is, as I said, mandatory for all oil and chemical tankers, liquid natural gas carriers and other ships over 70 metres in length, it is not compulsory in the international waters of the Torres Strait.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Each year 30 loaded oil tankers enter the Torres Strait and transit the inner route, while a similar number travel north along the inner route under ballast. Twenty tankers transit the outer route southward. The Government considers that there is no compelling reason for those 30 tankers to not join the 20 tankers using the outer route southward.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Few Australians would think of the Great Barrier Reef as a shipping lane. It is seen by most as a precious natural asset—and indeed it is. That is certainly the view of the Government, and that is why we are determined to take all reasonable steps to minimise the potential for shipping disaster. But in doing so we must strike a balance between protecting the natural environment, and maintaining viable shipping lanes.
       </para>

        Already the Government has taken a number of significant steps to safeguard the Reef and to improve safety in shipping.

        Last September I announced new administrative procedures for issuing single voyage permits to foreign vessels.

        In addition, shippers applying for permits involving bulk carriers and all types of tankers must now certify vital information on the condition of the ship, as well as the qualifications of its crew.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        As part of the Government's response to the House of Representative's "Ships of Shame" Report targeted inspections have doubled and now more than one in two foreign flagged vessels are subject to inspection when they call in Australian ports. This rigorous inspection regime has unquestionably deterred substandard shippers from calling in Australia. Today we can boast the toughest inspection regime in the world. One in which monthly ship detention reports are published to bring sub-standard shipping to worldwide attention.

        In terms of the Reef itself, by introducing a regime of compulsory pilotage for the inner route in October 1991, Australia made this transit route one of the world's few recognised compulsory pilotage areas.

        More recently in October 1993 the Government announced a detailed review of shipping in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait. We did so to ensure that the management of shipping operations maximises environmental protection, and minimises the risk of accidents and pollution.

        In order to improve the charting of the outer reef the Government can today announce that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will provide funding for the production of these charts.

        This task will involve surveying that begins at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres Strait, and goes down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser island, a total distance of some 2000 kilometres.

       <para font-size="-=2">

        Simultaneously with this charting, AMSA will proceed with the introduction of a mandatory ship reporting regime for the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait.

        The Government can assure the Senate that the Queensland Government has been cooperating with the Commonwealth in moving toward the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover both the North East Channel and the Torres Strait.

        One of the first stages of this cooperative approach will be the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover the Torres Strait, the Great North East Channel route near Cape York, and the inner route.

        Extended coverage of this radar traffic system will provide accurate real time information and reduce the prospect of ship collisions and groundings. This will be a vast improvement on the present situation where authorities rely on positions radioed in from vessels.

         —Unfortunately, I and the shadow minister, Mr Sharp, were unable to get a copy of this statement until quite late in the piece before the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) made the statement. We have not had a chance to look at it in detail. It seems that Mr Brereton has today announced some good initiatives for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef from shipping. In his statement, the minister has announced some initiatives that involve minimising shipping pressure in the inner route, additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route, improving navigational safety in the Torres Strait and improving the safety and reliability of the outer reef.

         The minister's statement contains a lot of very interesting statistics on the shipping use of both the inner and outer routes of the Great Barrier Reef. The minister has today made some announcements in relation to shipping in the reef. I and Senator Ferguson, amongst others, were on a Senate committee investigating major disasters in Australia that reported towards the middle of last year. That committee also highlighted problems with shipping incidents in the Great Barrier Reef area and made some recommendations, which the minister has dealt with in his statement today. Those recommendations of the committee dealt generally with better signage and better navigational aids in the reef area and generally looked at Australia's preparedness for any incident along the reef.

         The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth government work internationally towards the acceptance of compulsory pilotage in sensitive areas while establishing a register of such areas around Australia's coast with a view to their promotion for this service. Today Mr Brereton announced that he will be pursuing along those lines the question of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait area. The Torres Strait is an international waterway and does require some international acceptance. I am pleased to see that the government is pursuing that.

         The minister announced in his statement today that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will provide funding for the production of the charts. As I said, they are the charts which the Senate standing committee was calling for. That task will involve surveying that begins at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres Strait and goes down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser Island, a total distance of some 2,000 kilometres. Simultaneously with the charting AMSA will proceed with the introduction of a mandatory ship reporting regime in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait areas.

         One of the first stages of the cooperative approach to these initiatives will be the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover the Torres Strait, the great north-east channel route near Cape York and the inner route. Extension of compulsory pilotage in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef to cover the Torres Strait area would further reduce the risk of groundings and collisions. As Mr Brereton points out, human error is the greatest risk to safe shipping.

         We in the coalition are supportive of anything that is done to protect the Great Barrier Reef. We are pleased to see the government at last concentrating on these real problems and providing some money to address them. It is a bit sad to see that the government often gets itself tied up in the peripheral issues. We had the great furore over the Oyster Point proposal, one of the purposes of which, according to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), was to protect the Great Barrier Reef. That development at Oyster Point posed no threat to the Great Barrier Reef. It is just a pity that some of the energy and enthusiasm that Senator Faulkner's department puts into those sorts of issues is not transferred into these real issues of concern to the Great Barrier Reef.

         As I have lived in the area of the Great Barrier Reef for most of my life, I can assure the government that it is a part of Australia that all of those people living along the coastline feel very strongly about. They are very attached to it and have a very protective attitude towards that reef. It does provide recreation. It does provide by way of fishing a big economy to the North Queensland area. North Queenslanders would generally welcome any measures that go towards protection of that reef. We have been lucky that there have been no major disasters in the Great Barrier Reef area for many years. These new initiatives that the government has announced will hopefully make it even safer and put off further the prospect of any major disaster in that area.

         The major recommendation of the report is highly dangerous; that is, that traffic prefer an eastern passage in the open ocean, rather than coming up the inner passageway between the Barrier Reef and the Australian coastline. The second major recommendation—that pilotage be compulsory in the Torres Strait area—is at best a pious hope and is at worst, again, a deception because you simply cannot enforce compulsory pilotage in an international waterway, which the Torres Strait is.

         The provision of better navigation aids, principally the use of a differential GPS system, is well worth supporting but that is something for the future; it is something that will not come in straightaway. But the most glaring omission in this whole report is the protection of the achilles heel of AMSA; that is, the lowering of pilotage standards in the Barrier Reef waterway, which is a consequence of the AMSA administration. There is not a word in here about the professional standards of pilots.

         Just looking at those points very briefly, the argument is superficially attractive. To say that it is a safer area east when you are going north or south around the Barrier Reef is really quite false because you are in the open ocean. You are beyond the continental shelf. If there is any problem with the ship at all, if there is any fault with the propulsion system or the steering system, the ship simply cannot anchor. It is in an open sea state.

         We all remember some years ago when the bow fell off an oil tanker by the name of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Kirki
         </emphasis>
         off the Western Australian coast. I think 30,000 tonnes of oil were adrift on the ocean as a consequence of the bow falling off. That is not likely to occur within sheltered waters if the inner passageway is used. If a ship is disabled east of the Barrier Reef, the certainty of it is that it will become a total loss when it is blown on to the reef itself, because in those waterways for at least 10 months of the year there is a 25-knot south-east or north-east trade wind blowing and any disabled ship must be washed up on the reef and become a total loss.

         Conversely, if it is using the inner passageway between the Barrier Reef and the coastline, first of all, it will have a mandatory pilot service on board. Secondly, it can anchor anywhere if it is disabled and it may even be able to get into quite a safe anchorage. Thirdly, it is unlikely to be blown up on the shore. Fourthly, if the ship does break up, which again is unlikely because it is a sheltered waterway, the oil will go onto the beach and, tragic though that would be for places like Mission Beach and the many other excellent beaches in North Queensland, I think most people would agree it is better to have oil on a beach and on a coastline than on the reef structure itself.

         Finally, all the oil containment and oil dispersion systems that we have—and it ought to be noted that those are really quite limited in extent and most of them are based in Brisbane, not where the Barrier Reef is—will only operate in the sheltered waters inside the reef. Once you get into the outer reef there is no way any of the oil pollution or containment systems will work in any way at all in the open ocean. So the strong and repeated exhortations in this statement, that the outer reef be preferred to the inner reef as a route, is based on a total misunderstanding of the marine conditions that apply in that area.

         So far as the Great Barrier Reef is concerned, again I am forced into a position of agreeing with Senator MacGibbon—that is twice in one morning. Options were put to the Government to take ships outside the reef because it was asserted that this would be safer. In fact, it would be horrendously more dangerous to the reef to do so. As Senator MacGibbon has said, it is not only true that the weather conditions are atrocious outside the reef, but also the area outside the reef is largely uncharted and is therefore considerably more dangerous to shipping. The result, as Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, of a major accident outside the reef would be as disastrous to the reef as if it happened inside the reef because of prevailing winds and tides.

        Now I come to the business of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait area. It would be highly desirable that every ship that transits that waterway have a pilot on board. But the fact of life is that the Torres Strait area is an international waterway and while, in time, the International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, which is the governing body internationally in this area, can make a recommendation that pilots be carried by all ships transiting the Torres Strait, and most ships would, the point is the people we want to catch—the people who present a risk to the integrity of the reef—are the fly-by-night operators, the people with low capitalisation of their shipping lines and with old equipment. They are the very last people who will conform to any voluntary standard. So, while it is desirable that we negotiate towards compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait area, it simply will not happen.

         I want to come to the major concern that I have with the reef at the present time, and that relates to the professional standards of the pilots who serve in the area. Once upon a time, the pilot service was provided by a company known, if my memory is correct, as the Queensland Coastal and Torres Strait Pilot Service. There was a popular misconception that this was a monopoly that charged high monopolistic fees. In actual fact, anyone could qualify for a licence from the Queensland Harbours and Marine Authority—which was the licensing authority at the time—so long as they met the standards. Those standards were a masters ticket, experience in command plus an intimate knowledge of the reef. The pilot licence was open to anyone who met those qualifications.

         The difficulty in a practical sense was that you just cannot set up to be a pilot. You have to have a shore station, an office to accept the bookings, a communications and radio network to talk to ships that might be approaching, and launches and helicopters to get pilots on and off ships. In effect, it came down to only the Queensland Coastal and Torres Strait Pilot Service providing the service.

         There was a lot of controversy about the charges. The charges were never set by the pilots themselves. The pilotage fees were always set by the Queensland government. When the legislation was changed to make pilotage compulsory from somewhere near Booby Island or Prince of Wales Island at the northern end in Torres Strait to a position about 100 nautical miles north of Cairns—that could be made compulsory because it was within Australian territorial waters—the Queensland government gave up its licensing of the pilots and it passed to AMSA.

         The economic rationalists in the Labor Party believe that competition is good. They thought that, if they set-up a competitive system for the Torres Strait pilot service, fees would come down. The pilotage fee, from memory, would be about $6,000. Given the fact that, in the sum total of things, it probably costs close to $200,000 just to put a ship alongside at one of the major Queensland ports, a pilotage fee of $6,000 is really chickenfeed.

         Anyway, they went ahead with the competition, and a competitive organisation was set up to compete with the old established pilot service. The competitive service could not get off the ground because no-one was ready to join it, apart from maybe five pilots who had fallen out with the old pilot company. The answer that AMSA adopted was to lower the professional standards. It reduced the requirements. We then had a price war erupting on the Queensland coast, and the pilotage fees fell to probably half what they were before.

         It is true that the former pilots earned a good income. I do not know how much it was, but from the service they provided it was probably about $100,000 a year. They had an impeccable record of safety. They were really good professionals. The fact that over a period of about 100 years we did not have any ships lost in service with a pilot is testimony to their professional skills.

         When competition came along, their salaries were cut by somewhere between 25 and 50 per cent and the standard of recruit dropped right off. The pilot service today, about 18 months into this competitive situation, faces the situation where it cannot attract pilots with the experience needed to provide a safe service. This is really at the heart of my concern about the minister's statement today.

         The Auditor-General's report No. 9, which looked at the reef, made the statement that statistically there was a 37 per cent risk, over any five-year period, of a major oil spill as a consequence of a collision or grounding in the Barrier Reef waterways. Mr Deputy President, I can tell you that no minister, Liberal or Labor, has the courage to have a ship go up on the reef at any point and dump 10,000, 50,000 or 100,000 tonnes of oil into the Queensland coastal waters. It is a risk that we cannot accept.

         The way to minimise that risk is to re-establish adequate standards within the pilot ranks, because they are at the heart of the problem. Without adequate professional pilots with proper professional standards, all the navaids in the world and all the talk of going east-about means nothing at all. The great majority of shipping will continue to use the inner waterway between the Great Barrier Reef and the coast. That is the most glaring deficiency in this report that is before us today from the minister. The deficiency is there because we have a policy that was set in place by AMSA—and it just will not admit that it made a major mistake in that area.

         The situation is this: Ambassador Weemas, who is based in Riyadh, has sought a call on the President of the Diwan in the presidential court on 7 March. It is to be hoped that he will be able to make that call and make the representations accordingly. The reason for that date is essentially that that is the end of the Ramadan period and the subsequent Eid holiday. It has been the general understanding that, whatever the fairness or otherwise of this, it has been wholly unlikely that there would be any action on this case until the end of the Ramadan and Eid periods.

         As to the possible intervention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this, I advise the Senate that the Prime Minister will be making a transit stop only in Dubai on 6 March between 1.40 p.m. and 3.10 p.m.—in other words, just an hour and a half. Not only has this got a bit of a problem with the holiday period and the obvious shortness of time, but it also ought to be noted that the stop is in Dubai rather than Abu Dhabi, where the actual problem is. The United Arab Emirates is very much a federal, perhaps even a confederal, system where there are different systems of justice applicable in each emirate. So it is wholly unlikely, I think, that any representation the Prime Minister could possibly make in Dubai would be of utility in Abu Dhabi. I will check that point further, however, to make sure that that is so.

But I must make the point that this statement overlooks the most important threat to the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef—which surprisingly would not be through something dramatic like a ship running aground and spilling oil, which would be a catastrophe. The greatest threat to the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef, which is particularly fragile, lies in the discharge of ballast water.

         Ballast water can contain exotic species which could poison fish, introduce molluscs and maybe even destroy the reef itself because the reef is a very fragile ribbon of living organisms. If that reef is contaminated—for example, by exotic molluscs or by algae which are toxic to fish or toxic to the coral—what we will have is an ecological disaster which cannot be remedied. So, whilst I welcome some of the initiatives contained in this statement—I will get on to them later—it shocks me that this report is so half-hearted as to miss the importance of providing adequate protection for the Great Barrier Reef to prevent ballast water discharge damaging the ecology.

         The important point is this: the Great Barrier Reef contains most of the ports in Queensland. Certainly, it contains some of the most busy ports in Queensland because it contains ports such as Gladstone, Hay Point, Abbot Point, Townsville, South Johnston, Mourilyan and places like that where bulk carriers come in every day to take away coal, to take away alumina and to take away sugar. In every case, those bulk carriers come in under ballast.

         It is interesting to note that the government tabled a report earlier this week pursuant to return to order which stated that something in the vicinity of 121 million tonnes of ballast water was discharged in Australia from over 6,000 vessels in the 1991-92 period. That ballast water content has in fact increased in the two or three years since then, but nothing is being done. The government's own report—as I said, it was tabled earlier this week—is shocking in the admission of how little is being done to deal with the problem, for that report says:

        However, Australia, as a Port State, could impose conditions specifying how ships are to de-ballast when in Australian ports, particularly if the ships had taken on ballast water in certain overseas ports whose water contained an organism known to be harmful. The Government has not taken any such measures at this point in time because its policy on solving international shipping problems is to adopt a multilateral approach, by working through relevant organisations such as the IMO, and to avoid taking unilateral measures.

         I sit here wondering why it is that a country like Singapore can prescribe very strict requirements on the de-ballasting of ships which come into its harbour—and Singapore's environment is nowhere near as fragile as ours—yet here we have ports on the eastern seaboard of Australia, ports in very close proximity to the Great Barrier Reef, which are visited daily by ships coming in under ballast and the government refuses to do anything about it because it wants to have a multilateral solution.

         How many years do we have to wait until we get a multilateral solution? How many ships under ballast will visit the Great Barrier Reef and the reef ports while we wait? The government's ministerial statement today is interesting. It says that there are some 1,700 movements through the inner route of the reef, 600 of which do not call at any Queensland port inside the reef. So I assume there are 1,100 movements through the reef where ships do visit Queensland ports—1,100 ships, the overwhelming majority of them coming in under ballast. That means that there are 1,100 opportunities a year for the contamination of the Great Barrier Reef and nothing is done because the government wants to have a multilateral solution. If the government is fair dinkum about protecting the reef, then the government will impose a few unilateral conditions on de-ballasting and, if necessary, work with the states to ensure that provisions are made so that ships can de-ballast into tanks where the water can be treated before being discharged. That is the only way to protect against this problem.

         I now move to the other matters contained in the statement, and they are the four initiatives outlined by the government. These include minimising shipping pressure on the inner route, additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route, improving navigational safety in the Torres Strait, and improving the safety and reliability of the outer reef. There is a lot to commend most of those initiatives. I share Senator MacGibbon's concerns, however, about blindly assuming that running ships down the outer channel or outside the reef will necessarily solve the problem. It is correct that if a ship comes into difficulties outside the reef it cannot anchor, because the continental shelf drops straight off. That is why we have a barrier reef—the geology underneath the water is such that the continental shelf drops straight off. A ship in deep water can be blown back onto the reef because of the currents and wind. That is something we have to concern ourselves with. So the blind assumption that you run ships down outside the barrier reef is, in and of itself, not a solution.

         There are parts of this statement that are good. It is appropriate that work be done to improve navigational safety in the Torres Strait and to improve the safety of ships using the inner route. That is important because any time you have ships moving in shallow waters you always have the risk of a ship running aground. Accidents can happen. We also need to pay attention to modelling the currents on the reef. The currents on the reef are of particular importance to minimise the potential impact of any spill that may occur on the reef and also, where there are minor spills onto the reef, to track down the culprit ship.

         Obviously if a tanker runs aground, it is holed and we see millions of gallons of oil spilled onto the reef, we know who is at fault, because the ship is on the reef. But it is entirely possible that a ship could spill oil into the water, still be perfectly seaworthy and blithely sail right out in the hope that nobody knows. So if we could improve the modelling of the currents on the Great Barrier Reef, then we could track down ships which have improperly allowed oil to spill out and therefore hold the masters and the owners of those ships responsible for the environmental damage which they have done.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But there is another consequence from properly modelling the currents on the reef. In the event of a spill, we will have a very good idea where that oil is going to end up. It is a very complex task. We have an inordinately long coastline, we have a myriad of reefs, we have changing currents from month to month and we have different wind conditions and so on.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is a very difficult task, but it is something we have to do because, if we are to be prepared for a spill—and we have to assume that a spill is going to happen—we must know where the oil is going to move. In that fashion you can get the equipment to the right place to ensure that you protect the reef from the oil spill. There is no use having all of the equipment in, say, Mackay, if the oil spill is not going to be on that section of the reef, if it is going to be 100 kilometres to the north. It takes time to move and deploy these things. The couple of hours in question may be the couple of hours in which the oil comes ashore or hits a reef and the damage is done. So that aspect, which is relegated to the very last page of the government's statement, should be taken more seriously. It is insufficient to say that it is just one of the things we have to look at. It has to be a very high priority. In terms of the issues addressed it should be one of the highest priorities. Unless we do that, we will be caught unprepared if an accident happens.

         —The Greens (WA) welcome the initiatives by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). As a number of speakers have already mentioned, they are certainly not sufficient as yet. It is pleasing to see that the government has acknowledged the importance of protecting Australia's coastlines. I trust that the shipping industry will also support these initiatives. Compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait as well as on the inside route through the Great Barrier Reef is long overdue. The extent of reefs and islands and the narrow passage of the Torres Strait, combined with the strong tides and currents, create a climate that is just waiting for a major accident to happen. Hopefully, pilotage could substantially reduce that risk.

         The proposals to improve the quality of navigation charts in the region, together with the increased use of global positioning system technology on land and on ships, will also go some way to reducing the risk in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait shipping routes. In addition, the establishment of a radar traffic system is essential. I trust that the timetable for its implementation will be expedited. In the statement there was some mention of the standard of shipping but the mention indicates that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is involved with more inspections. Yes it is, but as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, including on AMSA's annual reports, that does not mean there are more people to do those inspections; it is probably related to the fact that we have more single voyage permits every year and the standard of shipping internationally and around Australia's waters has not necessarily improved. So more inspections do not necessarily reflect a higher standard of shipping; they reflect the fact that we are in a very vulnerable position with Australia's very large area of coastline, added to the fact that there are more ships which should be inspected. So if there are more inspections and fewer staff it means that each inspection cannot necessarily be as effective as it might be.

         There was some mention from Senator O'Chee with regard to ballast and I agree that there is a huge problem with ballast. The response the government has given so far in relation to its lack of desire for unilateral action reflects also its lack of desire to take unilateral actions with regard to a liability regime. That has been mentioned by me on previous occasions. The United States, for a start, has a liability regime which tries to make sure that, if there is a major accident, somebody is responsible for it. There is not much point in trying to get the money back from a fairly limited liability company, I suppose, if we are accepting more and more single voyage permits or flag of convenience carriers. But there needs to be some line of accountability. There is no point in Australia waiting, whether it is in relation to ballast water agreements or liability regimes, for everybody else in the world to agree; it is our country that is at risk, our environment and our very precious coastal ecosystems.

I have noted the government's comments in relation to this issue in a report that was provided to this parliament as a result of a Senate resolution late last year. I feel it is important that Australia pursue this issue in the international community, particularly given our isolation and consequent reliance on shipping, but it is not enough, as I said, that we pursue this as simply a multilateral action. If the international community will not act because of a desire to protect corporate profits, through lower costs of shipping and lower standards of shipping, then it is not good enough.

         Finally, I make a plea to the government on behalf of the environmental movement, the fishing industry and the tourism industry to establish some similar protection measures on the north-west coast. There is already an extensive oil industry in the North West Shelf area and it is in close proximity to the ecologically important Ningaloo Reef and the fishing grounds and tourist areas at Exmouth and Broome.

         There is a possibility that the risk in these areas could increase as a result of the measures taken to protect the Great Barrier Reef. It may actually mean that some ships will take that other route as a means of getting an easier passage. Many vessels have the option of travelling across the north of Australia to get to Sydney or Melbourne or of travelling the Western Australian coast and around the Great Australian Bight. If the cost of travel is, justifiably, increased due to the requirement for compulsory pilotage, some shipping companies will take the cheaper option and travel through these important areas of Western Australia. I trust that the government will give serious consideration to addressing these issues in Western Australia.

          The ever present danger of an oil spill on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia
         </emphasis>
         . At that launch I was involved with the director of the local tourist association who raised many of the same fears that were expressed by the environment centre. I will read from the report that was launched at that time because it provides a useful comment on what the government has done. I think the Environment Centre will be pleased with the start the government has made in meeting some of the concerns it has raised. It is interesting to note that the report stated:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The International Maritime Organisations resolution A710(17) States: IMO recommends that ships of 70 metres and over and all tankers carrying oil, chemicals and liquefied gas to use the Australian Commonwealth licensed pilotage service when navigating the Torres Strait and the Great North East Channel between Booby Island and Bramble Cay. However 10% of all vehicles travelling through these two areas chose to ignore IMO's recommendations posing a huge risk to this sensitive area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I notice in the government's statement that there is a slight difference in terms of the percentages, but I do not know that that really matters. I support the call of the environment centre in its report where it states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We call for mandatory pilotage of all ships of 70 metres in length or more travelling through Torres Strait and the Great North East Channel.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note what Senator MacGibbon said about the difficulty of doing this. I believe we as Australians, and certainly the Australian government, need to put all the pressure we possibly can on those ships that are not observing the resolution of the International Maritime Organisation to adhere to that recommendation. It is critical. Another recommendation in the Environment Centre's report stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We call for the Australian Government and AMSA to encourage other countries to establish tanker surveillance programmes. The Australian Government and AMSA must establish a programme whereby tanker standard and competence of crew on vessels are checked before entering Australian waters. Improper lashing of containers on vessels is currently a major concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another recommendation which fits in very well with the government's statement, and one that I support, is the one that states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We call for a designated surveyed separation lane via the Coral Sea for all transit shipping. There must be a buffer zone between the separation lane and the reef.
       </para>

        It appears that the government's recommendation goes some of the way to satisfying that. Finally, the environmental report, endorsed by the tourist association in Cairns, reads:

         I agree to a certain extent with Senator O'Chee, whom I do not always agree with, that one of the problems is not just an oil spill but the dumping of bilge water. I looked at one problem at a place called Richters Creek near Yorkey's Knob where, before Christmas, 400,000 litres of liquid containing at least 25 per cent of highly polluting oil was dumped within 200 metres of the ocean; in other words, within 200 metres of the possibility of polluting the reef. So, it is not simply what ships might do; it is also the fact that liquid—it was mostly bilge water and other liquids from ships dumped on the shore—also has the potential to greatly damage the reef. Another concern which was drawn to our attention when we were in Cairns was the dumping of dredge material close to Trinity Outlet, again allowing very dangerous and polluting substances to leach into Trinity Bay and, therefore, to affect the reef.

        The point I make with respect to this is that, while we might improve the security of ships by pilotage, by ensuring we do not have rust buckets going up and down the coast or by perhaps putting more ships outside the reef, although I am not convinced in relation to this; nonetheless, all the evidence is that sooner or later we will have a major oil spill on the Barrier Reef and that very considerable damage will be done.

         I am pleased that Senator Ray is here in the chamber because he will know that on numerous previous occasions I have pointed to the value to Australia of buying the Canadair CL215 aircraft, which is an amphibious aircraft well capable of going to remote oil spills on the Barrier Reef and dealing with the spill either by way of dispersant or by way of landing on the water and putting out booms, something which cannot be done at the moment. We are still in the situation in which a major oil spill has to be tackled essentially from either end of that 1,000 kilometres of reef extending between Cairns and the Torres Strait. We do not have an ability to intervene quickly should a spill occur somewhere perhaps halfway along that stretch of reef.

         This aircraft would be useful not only in that capacity but also in a whole range of other activities. It has particularly been developed for firefighting, picking up six tonnes of water in 10 seconds. It could be used for offshore surveillance, northern surveillance and a whole range of other things. I think it is a great pity that we have not bought a fleet of these aircraft and multi-tasked them so they could take on this whole range of activities, which would actually reduce the cost for each particular activity. It is quite true, as has often been said against these aircraft, that they are expensive at $25 million each. To keep them purely for northern surveillance or to keep them purely for firefighting individually would be too expensive. However, by multi-tasking them I think it would be an extremely reasonable purchase.

        In the last annual report to Parliament on the aid program, which my colleague the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs tabled at the end of 1993, the Government's approach to poverty alleviation through its aid program was set out. That report emphasised the importance of sustainable economic growth and social development proceeding in tandem.

        The report being tabled today highlights significant new directions in Australia's aid program in the social sector and in the area of humanitarian relief.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Despite the need for continued budgetary restraint in order to consolidate the economic recovery in Australia, the Government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program by 3.6 per cent in real terms. This meant that we were one of only four of the 21 OECD donors who increased their aid programs in the last year. As a result, Australia continues to remain above the average for donors in terms of aid to GNP ratio.

        Aid volume apart, there have been significant changes in our region, not least in Indochina and the South Pacific. Further afield, the transition to democracy in South Africa will change the nature of economic relationships throughout Southern Africa.

        Mr President, I will now draw attention to significant developments in Australia's relationship with the South Pacific. During the run-up to the South Pacific Forum, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs gave a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association highlighting the need for policy reforms in the region. The overriding theme of his address was the need for the region's governments to develop improved national policies to encourage sustainable social and economic growth. I am pleased to say that this theme was taken on board by regional leaders and, as a result, the Forum generated an unprecedented level of commitment to improve economic and environmental policies, particularly in forestry. Just recently, a code of conduct on logging was signed by Forum Island Countries, and only last week a meeting of the region's Finance Ministers took place at which crucial policy issues were discussed, including fiscal, forestry and civil aviation matters, which have been identified as priorities by island leaders.

        In Papua New Guinea we have agreed on a radical transformation of the program. By the end of the decade, the program will have completely moved from budget support to jointly-programmed project activities.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In Indochina—one of the poorest regions of the world, where annual incomes are less than $400 per head—our aid program is expanding rapidly. In May 1994, we announced a four-year, $350 million package, targeted at the high-priority areas of health, infrastructure, education, human rights and the strengthening of legal institutions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the most visible examples of the effectiveness of our development assistance is the Mekong River Friendship Bridge. It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield substantial economic benefits to both countries. Moreover, as one of the highest-profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years—and, incidentally, a project completed ahead of schedule and under budget—the bridge is an invaluable showcase for Australian capabilities in major infrastructure design and technology transfer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I wish to draw members' attention to the Government's response to the tragedy of Rwanda. The Government has so far contributed $35 million to support the relief effort there, a contribution matched by an extraordinary public response of over $30 million. Australia's response was one of the earliest and, from my observations, one of the most effectively targeted of all donors. At the same time, and despite our limited resources, we have begun an increased program to support the peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa providing assistance of $30 million over three years. This program has been designed to meet the objectives of the Government of National Unity's Reconstruction and Development Program, including through building up capacity in areas such as planning, economic policy and the media.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There have also been important developments in the sectoral focus of Australia's aid program. In particular, we have continued to expand environmental assistance, and in this financial year we will spend around $120 million on these activities. Amongst other things, this funding will cover the establishment of what we are calling `Green DIFF', part of the highly successful Development Import Finance Facility which has been the catalyst for many Australian companies to become involved in the region. Green DIFF will help to finance environmental projects in areas such as pollution control and energy efficiency, gaining wider exposure for Australia's environmental expertise. The last budget also heralded an Australian contribution of nearly $43 million to replenish the Global Environment Facility, as well as an increase in support for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A vibrant private sector is an essential part of the development process. Initiatives such as the Private Sector Linkages Program, which has seen its budget double to $10 million, are targeted at this sector. In addition, the informal sector is now recognised as a fundamental resource for social and economic development. Australia's aid program is reflecting this with an increased allocation of funds to micro-enterprise development with a two-year, $1.3 million package for development in the South Pacific and South East Asia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The change in the role of the private sector in development is just one example of the way that the aid program has adapted to remain relevant and effective. Another excellent example is provided by this year's launch of the policy document
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Towards a Sustainable Future: Ecologically Sustainable Development through Australia's Development Cooperation Program
        </emphasis>
        . Australia's policy in this area fully takes into account the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio by defining the importance of integrating the economic, social and ecological dimensions of development.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The past year has also seen the Government continue to pursue policies on human rights and good governance through the aid program. On human rights, Australia's policy is to maintain a consistent and principled stand against abuses, while stressing the importance of continued engagement through dialogue and institution-building. On good governance, Australia's policy encourages the effective management of social and economic resources in developing countries in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable, and equitable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you can see, over the past year we have continued a process of review and adaptation which will ensure that Australia's aid program continues to be of the highest quality, responsive to the needs of developing countries and appropriate to Australia's place in the world.

        I would like now to turn to new developments in our overseas assistance in the social sector. The Government's policy framework for poverty reduction has three components:

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The social sector provides a crucial contribution to sustainable social and economic development. Recent World Bank reports have highlighted the major role that government commitment to social sector development, particularly in education, has played in the rapid growth of many Asian economies. Reflecting this importance, the past two budgets have seen a significant upgrading of the already high priority given to the social sector in the aid program through the introduction of major population and health initiatives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the 1993-94 budget, we trebled expenditure on the population sector with a four-year $130 million initiative. To ensure the effectiveness of this initiative, the Government commissioned an independent inquiry into the links between population and development. This was one of the most comprehensive surveys of population and development issues ever undertaken, and its conclusions have been vital in highlighting the complex links between population and development.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The results of this inquiry have helped AIDAB to develop a range of principles which now guide the aid program's population activities. Amongst the most important of these principles is that access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right; and that women should have access to a wide range of reproductive health services and should participate fully in defining the services they need. Above all—and I emphasise this most emphatically—coercion has no place in Australian aid program's family planning activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The priority which the aid program affords population issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in September 1994. Helped by our efforts, the Conference adopted a ground-breaking program of action for the empowerment of women, and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid budget with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas—malaria, polio, neonatal tetanus, and HIV/AIDS. The initiative involves additional funding of $110 million over four years nearly doubling Australia's current spending on health under the aid program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As with assistance for population activities, AIDAB has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding. These principles state that improvements in health are best achieved through an integrated approach which tackles the causes of poverty and improves the status and well being of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Changes are also afoot in Australia's program of assistance to education and training.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Assistance to the education sector has always been a large part of the aid program. At present, the sector receives an allocation of around 20% of the total budget. The majority of this funding goes towards assistance at the tertiary level. We are now reviewing our assistance in the sector, with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic, technical and vocational education.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no doubt of the social, economic, health and population gains that are derived from basic education. At the same time, the primary responsibility for the provision of basic education lies with the recipient government—aid should not substitute for that responsibility. That means that our assistance to the education sector must be carefully targeted to assist and strengthen, rather than replace or duplicate, the efforts of national governments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, Mr President, I would like to talk about developments in the humanitarian relief program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the most tragic features of the past few years has been the continued increase in the frequency and impact of international emergencies. In the past five years over 300 million people have been affected by natural disasters and civil strife. Over the past 20 years, the numbers of refugees rose from an estimated 3 million to 23 million, half of whom are children and most of whom are from developing countries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is a huge cost in human terms. It is also a huge financial cost. Just to give you an example; the annual expenditure of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has risen from US$450 million in the mid eighties to US$1.1 billion in 1993 and the cost of UN peace keeping operations has risen from under $1 billion in 1991 to over US$4 billion in 1993. This trend shows no sign of slowing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The forces driving this situation are highly complex, demanding an equally complex international response. Factors such as the link between poverty and vulnerability, the increase in political volatility since the end of the Cold War, and the proliferation of humanitarian relief agencies, have to be taken into account in providing a coordinated response.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was against this backdrop of increasing complexity and growing demand for assistance that, early last year, AIDAB undertook an extensive review of its refugee and relief program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The results of this review are helping the Government to update Australia's response to international humanitarian emergencies. The review found that Australia's spending on humanitarian relief had not followed the rapid increase of other donors.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This relative decline in funding for humanitarian emergencies is in stark contrast to the clear wishes of the Australian public, which has repeatedly demonstrated that it wants its Government to respond generously to such humanitarian tragedies as those witnessed in Rwanda.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AIDAB is already responding to the recommendations of the review and is also exploring opportunities for increasing funds for humanitarian relief.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As Australia improves its aid response to international humanitarian emergencies, we also share a responsibility with the international community to do more to prevent disasters and complex emergencies from happening in the first place. This is a priority that requires a range of strategies addressing the underlying causes of dispute and conflict. We require improvements in prevention and response strategy through arrangements which minimise threats to security, promote confidence and trust, and create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation. We must also develop peace-building activities to ensure that conflict does not arise in the first place, or if it does, to ensure that it does not recur. That involves strategies which encourage economic and social development, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. Australia will be doing as much as possible through the aid program to support these activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the years ahead, I am confident that Australia will continue to deliver a compassionate and effective aid program that has a real impact on the lives of millions of people throughout the developing world. Australia's future, and the Australian people, demand nothing less.

         —This statement about new directions in Australia's overseas aid program is an important one. It is apparently made about once a year by the minister who is responsible for Australia's development assistance. It is a rather brief statement, and it appeals to values that are well accepted on both sides of the chamber and, indeed, by the Australian public. There is one reference to humanitarian relief which indicates that the Australian government is self-critical for not giving humanitarian assistance to the extent that it appears the Australian public would want the Australian government to give it. I welcome the candour that the government has shown in this matter.

         I think the government is right. When the Australian public is touched by children dying in Rwanda and the chaos arising from a tragic civil war, they give to non-government organisations—even though that giving is to an extent subsidised by tax deductibility offered by the Australian government—and this compassion of the Australian public leads to large subscriptions of money and throws into a shadow the assistance that the Australian government is directly giving, despite it being some $35 million for Rwanda so far.

         I accept that we in this parliament do need to encourage the Australian government to respond to those expressions of compassion and of justice, and to ensure that children in the world, refugees and others displaced by war and natural calamities, are given resources to meet their urgent human needs. That is especially so having regard to an affluent country like Australia, where we have more than a handful of suits to wear, swimming pools, backyards, too many cars on the roads and every manner of convenience. I think that development assistance is an area that, from time to time, grabs the full attention of the Australian public, and it ought to grab more of the attention of the Australian government.

         There is a reference at the beginning of the statement that is rather self-congratulatory which says that Australia has increased its aid program over the last 12 months by 3.6 per cent in real terms. It says that this is a greater degree of increase than for most of the OECD donor countries, and it remains above average for donor countries from the OECD in terms of it being a proportion of GNP. They are minor badges of merit that the Australian government gives itself and gives all Australia. Frankly, it is way below the UN standard, which is the objective that the Labor Party has accepted as appropriate and that the coalition has accepted as appropriate. It is only half of that amount. I do not believe that any of us can congratulate ourselves for giving an appropriate proportion of our gross national product to overseas aid.

         Section 1 talks in rather glowing terms about the  achievement of the government of a real increase in the size of Australia's overseas aid effort by 3.6 per cent. What we have to realise is that it has not kept pace with GDP. The document does acknowledge that. It says, `Oh well, it hasn't kept pace; Australia was one of only four OECD donors to achieve an increase in aid volume in 1993.' It then talks about its current aid standing at 0.33 per cent of GNP, which is substantially better than the 0.30 per cent of OECD donors combined. So what! We are responsible for seeing that the amount is not only increased but increased more effectively.

         I will not go into great detail as Senator Margetts may well want to say something briefly. I would have liked to address the question of Africa. As I have said in the estimates committee time and time again, I believe we have not played our role in the development assistance area in Africa as well as we should have. We are going to have to do something more than that which has already been done. After the South African elections, the government did increase the level of assistance, but it is $30 million over three years. That is the first time we have increased the level. Previously there were problems with doing that.

         Egg production is associated in the minds of many people with the terrible image of hens crammed into battery cages. The practice of caging hens for egg production developed due to the belief that this enabled maximum productivity and economic efficiency. Whilst I am not saying that economic considerations are not important, they should not be the only factor used in assessing the suitability of our food production processes.

         There is no good reason why, once an animal is identified as being suitable for the purposes of producing food for humans, all considerations for the welfare of that animal should disappear. Putting any bird or animal in a cage so small it cannot turn around would be quite rightly seen as inexcusable by most people if it were in a zoo or kept as a pet. The Democrats believe the same standard should apply when the animal is being used to produce food for us to consume.

         This general principle is one that is of great importance, as serious consideration is being given at the moment to greatly expanding the commercial use of native wildlife in Australia for food production and other commercial uses. But if the use of kangaroos, emus, possums, bandicoots, crocodiles and other Australian wildlife becomes common place, it is likely that the same disregard for their welfare will occur. This is something the Democrats would strongly oppose.

         After a lot of work from many people concerned about the problem of battery cages, there have been some moves to more easily enable the sale of eggs which are clearly labelled as being free range. Whilst this sort of consumer driven demand for reform is vital in the food industry, I believe the industry must also consider basic ethical standards and work harder to improve the situation.

         Recently, minimum cage sizes were agreed to by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ, which is made up of primary industry ministers from all states and territories and chaired by the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins. The report containing this decision was also tabled in the Senate earlier this week.

         Whilst it is good that minimum cage sizes will become regulatory and enforceable across Australia from the start of 1996, it is unfortunate that it was accompanied by a reversal of a 1992 code of practice which gave hens more space. The actual size allowed and the slowness of moves away from caging birds are matters of great concern to the Australian Democrats. The minimum floor space allowable for each bird is 450 square centimetres, which is less than the size of an A4 page. I find it hard to see how anyone can justify keeping a bird in a space this size for its entire life.

         This report states that animal welfare was a high research priority for the council in 1993-94. While most of the welfare issues would not arise if the birds were not kept in such unnatural and confined situations, it is still pleasing to see that the issues are being considered. Among the areas being looked into are beak trimming, cage design and sizes, osteoporosis and bone fractures in hens.

         According to the report, some of the research suggests that one hen housed in a 1,500 square centimetre cage may be chronically stressed when compared to two hens housed in the same area. This, in effect, is simply implying either that a hen prefers to have a smaller space or that it prefers to have company in its cage. I would think that any research that alleges that a hen is happier in a smaller cage—

         —The Wheat Board report for 1993-94 has been around for quite some time, and I am sure it has been read by almost every senator in this place. However, this gives me an opportunity to address something else concerning the Wheat Board, the Grains Council of Australia and the allied industry generally. I refer to the report of the strategic planning unit commissioned by the Grains Council of Australia and paid for, in the order of $2 million, by the Grains Research and Development Corporation of Australia—commonly known as the SPU report. That $2 million enabled the report to go virtually from seed and fertiliser right through to the bread on the table, but it was long on narration and very short on recommendations. I believe that the report, to a certain extent, simply provides the Wheat Board with a self-fulfilling prophecy rather than spelling out the situation facing the Wheat Board and what sort of marketing—say, single desk marketing—we will have in the future.

         Basically, it came about that in 1989, with the Wheat Marketing Act, virtually two per cent of all wheat sales was to go into a fund to provide a guaranteed underwriting for when the government underwriting will disappear from that act in about 1999. At the present moment the fund has $200 million—and, incidentally, nearly half of that comes from Western Australia.

         But we have no definition of direction. That is why I am looking for an inquiry to be undertaken into what that fund has been used for. When Booz, Allen and Associates brought out that report—actually, there were three reports—one of the consultants, Sam Hill, on delivering his findings in Western Australia, picked up the point of the wheat industry fund. Very little mention had been made of it in the written report. However, when he was delivering his findings, he was rather vicious in his attack on the way the wheat industry fund might be used.

         Sam Hill identified that the wheat industry fund had three facets: firstly, as providing a guarantee for borrowings, and that is what we passed legislation on; secondly, as a strategic investment fund actively working to lift returns to growers; and, thirdly, as a retirement fund for grain growers who believe that they will get their money back. He went on to say that the fund cannot cover all three of these functions.

The Wheat Board and the Grains Council of Australia in their wisdom think they can use this fund, gathered from growers, for purposes they think fit, but which may not necessarily be in the interests of wheat growers in Australia, and the wheat growers of Western Australia in particular. I will certainly be pushing much harder to come to get this inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         In the World Trade Organisation debate last year, we heard that the citrus industry and other industries would have to restructure. It was clear that this meant the end of small and medium business and the consolidation of farms and orchards. That is what the small growers saw, and that is what the big growers saw. The way things are going, small producers are doomed. Big producers can survive because by owning large acreage and employing people on a minimal outlay on an as needed basis they can get by, whereas family farms working on a smaller holding have a hard time because they have to support themselves continually. That is what we are told. In light of that, I cannot understand why any surprise is expressed, as it has been here, at the difficulties of attracting young people into the industry.

         It is easy to plug into the jargon. On page 21 we see talk of inappropriate labour and characteristics of the situation as being partly inappropriate and/or inadequate on-the-job training and partly a problem of developing attractive career paths, especially for young people. Attractive career paths? We have to be kidding! Employers are under stress to pay workers less to compete internationally with nations like Brazil and the banana republics. So we have some people who might, if they cannot find a real job, lob in and pick fruit for a few weeks on marginal wages or, if they are lucky, pick for a few months. Usually they can camp out in tents or sleep in their cars so that they can minimise their costs and low wages are not so important. Besides, that is liable to be more fun than hanging around without work or money.

         So there will be a labour force, but it is stupid to talk about career paths. It is a young person's job when they cannot find anything else to do, and it is a job for the sort of people who find themselves going mad when shut up inside. It is short-term, both in job security and in relation to the period of one's life when they follow such a path.

         I said there is no vision here. Following the path of international competitiveness will not fix anything. If the government is really serious about small and medium business in rural communities, it will have to broaden its vision. It cannot largely concentrate on jobs in monoculture, agriculture, forestry and mining. What amazes me is that I see nothing here—not a subject heading, not a statistic—that indicates there is a tourism or hospitality sector, agricultural value added industries, or services in rural communities. Yet the most vital small rural towns have a high level of these activities as well as businesses that work in well, such as cultural businesses, furniture making, artisan work and art businesses—places like Maleny which have other sophisticated industries. Under growing rural enterprises we again get the song and dance about international export. There is life inside the global economy.

         In terms of agriculture, monoculture is a problem—not a solution. Sales and markets, even international sales and markets, could be addressed through things like producers' cooperatives that would allow smaller farms to compete. There is no mention of training for this. It would also allow farms to move more in the direction of diversification. That would be an advantage both in terms of markets where prices are unreliable and in terms of a nation where weather is unreliable. We see government elsewhere talking about the need for restructuring agriculture to deal with drought and climate change. Surely diversification is one way, yet nothing is said about how to make diversification work. Perhaps some training in this and in setting up growers' co-ops, which are a fine old agricultural tradition, would be appropriate.

         There is also the whole issue of looking at establishing and working in local and regional markets, instead of global ones, and managing farms in a more integrated way. We have  community after community—certainly in Western Australia—where the primary activity is agri-pastoral activity, and yet food is imported from Perth, other capital cities or even overseas. What about employment schemes and small business assistance in providing local food markets? These can be as simple as providing a parking lot or school verandah once a week where farmers can bring produce. I have a great deal more to say on this issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       We have seen over the last few weeks an absolute debacle in communications policy. We have a minister who has failed an extremely simple test of ministerial competence. We have recently seen the West Indies series of cricket tests, which many Australians love to watch, absolutely destroyed by the debacle caused by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Quite simply what has happened is that the minister has created a list of programs that should be on free-to-air TV. That means, of course, that it cannot be siphoned off—to use the expressions used—to the pay TV networks.

        During a period of about eight months we have had ample opportunity to put this new system in place. But what we have seen happen in the last few weeks is the minister flip-flopping from side to side, being totally indecisive over how this matter should be resolved. We are now seven days away from the cricket series. Fans in Australia are about to miss out and the West Indies cricket board is about to lose an enormous amount of money because of the way this has been handled by this minister.

        This is not a rare and isolated event; this is part of a long series of policy gaffs by the minister for communications. What this minister is all about is show. What we saw yesterday was the release of the report on the information superhighway and multimedia services from the Broadband Services Expert Group. We have had a look at this report. It is an absolutely excellent report, top rate—but it is a little late. What we have seen over the last few years is the various media operators in this very dynamic communications industry work out how to position themselves well to take advantage of the booming communications industry. What the government has decided to do, after a lot of these operations are getting well under way, is to call for a report on what it should do in terms of a legislative framework to control these matters.

        The horse has bolted. The system is operating out there. The very dynamic communications market is off and running. Billions of dollars have been involved in rolling out the information superhighway. Tens of millions of dollars are involved in developing various products and all of this is happening within a communications vacuum. We have the situation—with converging technologies of television, computers and telephones—of a great need, as I have said before in this place, for a uniform system where we have one converging technology legislative framework that takes into account the operation of people on television, telephones and computers as these industries merge and as the products move between those different types of mediums.

One fears for the future of the communications industry, the nature of which I have just described, if this minister cannot get this very simple situation right. Let me describe the nature of the task to show how simple the task initially was and how much of a muddle he has got it into. All he had to do was come up with an anti-siphoning list. These were products, programs, that people frequently watch—like the West Indies test cricket series. He had to put these things on a list. He produced a list but, like a lot of what this minister has done, the problem has arisen because what he did was far too late. He did not anticipate what was going to happen in a dynamic market.

        What was happening out in the dynamic market was that Australis, one of the main pay TV operators that operates Galaxy, had shot off with no regulatory regime in place—so there was nothing saying it could not do this—and decided it would buy the rights to this West Indies cricket series. It has done that; it has bought the rights. And then the minister comes out with a list, which more or less says you cannot buy the rights. He brought this list out months ago. Fairly obviously, the decision had to go one way or the other. Either he stuck by his list or he did not.

Then he decided that maybe 12 hours would be better. This is a classic case of policy on the run, of a minister again caught totally flat-footed in a dynamic, changing market.

        What is going to be the outcome of all this? The outcome is, if Galaxy gets its way, that probably a few hundred people will watch the West Indies cricket series. Galaxy has on its books at the moment under 2,000 people for subscription television. That is in total. It is not 2,000 cricket fans—it is 2,000 viewers. They want to watch it live. There is one little brake on it. First of all, you have to be prepared to sit up between midnight and dawn to watch. That will cut a few of them out. The other thing is that the 2,000 are not all cricket fans. My guess is that probably about 200 or 300 people might watch this. Isn't that a disgrace? We have a nation of cricket lovers here and because of the government's incompetence in handling this fairly simple matter, we have to come to a point where a few hundred people might watch the game.

        The Australian television consumer is outraged by this outcome of ALP government incompetence. What the government must do as we count down to day 7, day 6 and day 5 is come up with a situation where this test actually gets to the majority of viewers. In other words, the government must come up with a situation where it sticks by its rules in the anti-siphoning legislation. That is the initial position the minister took. Now he has done a backflip and gone over to the pay TV operator side. If you make a set of rules you should stick by them. As I said earlier, I fear for not only the future of the pay television and television industry in this country but also the future of the whole communications industry in this country if they are guided by a totally inadequate legislative framework and a totally incompetent minister.

        We have a situation where Senator Tierney has indicated his extraordinary and amazing ignorance of this area of government policy. What we clearly have is a case where there has been a gross misrepresentation of the facts to the Senate. We have a clear case where one company, a pay TV company, purchased the rights to broadcast a test in the West Indies before the siphoning list was declared by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). The facts are that it purchased the rights to this test before the government acted.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         According to the opposition's line of argument, the government is somehow or other supposed to retrospectively change the rules and say that the list that was declared on 31 May 1994 should be backdated to when the company bought the rights on 27 May. These are clearly matters that are subject to action before the Australian Broadcasting Authority. We as a parliament are presumably, if we follow the logic of the opposition's line of argument, supposed to say, `Blow all that. You must broadcast this test despite the fact that the laws did not come into effect, according to submissions put to the ABA, until three days after the purchase of these rights.'

        It may be that Senator Tierney has information that I do not have. It may be the case that, in fact, the ABA has been misled. It may be that the minister has been misled. It may be that, in fact, the rights were purchased after the declaration of that anti-siphoning list. If that is the case, we have different circumstances altogether. But that is clearly not what the companies are saying at the moment.

        The ABA has written to Australis Media asking it to put its case. Those opposite will recall, of course, that it was Australis Media that claimed to have the ownership of the rights. It was not pointed out to the ABA until 22 December 1994 that there had been the purchase of these rights by a junior company of Australis Media. When this matter came before the Senate select committee and the principals of Galaxy were asked about this, they explained, `Look, we are a very small company. We didn't really have all the infrastructure necessary to get our paperwork clear and right. What we had was our chief executive running around the world buying up shows wherever he could get them.'

        We now discover that the ABA is looking at the facts to establish whether or not these rights were purchased when the company claims they were purchased. We have then a motion before the Senate which, essentially, is based on that fundamental failing in logic. A proposition is being put to the Senate that somehow or other the minister has been involved in some sort of debacle, that he has had eight months to get this right.

       He says it could be of detriment to the pay TV industry if we have an anti-siphoning regime. He said that it would be a travesty if the list was so far reaching that it undermined the viability of the fledgling pay TV industry. That is really at the nub of all of this, isn't it?

        What we have here is a case where the opposition wants the government to interfere in the commercial negotiations between the pay TV company and Channel 9. What you are expecting us to do is to say, `We'll pick the winner in terms of the arrangements that you enter into about the broadcast of the test series.' The government makes it very clear that it wants to see this test broadcast. It makes it very clear that Australis and the Nine Network have to reach an agreement and a sensible accommodation which would permit the free to air broadcast.

        Also, the government has to recognise that the attitude of Channel 9, as expressed by David Leckie on the ABC and before the Senate select committee, was a disappointment. What he said was difficult to understand. `After all,' he said, `Channel 9 had met all the financial demands made upon it by Australis.' He said that the whole issue was a question of whether or not there be simultaneous broadcasting. What I find particularly odd is that Australis is able to reach agreements with the SBS over simultaneous broadcasting of the English FA Cup, with the ABC over simultaneous broadcasting of the netball world championship and, I understand, also with Nine over the US Masters golf.

        I suppose there might be some debate about what simultaneous means in those circumstances. It was suggested by Channel 9 that simultaneous could, in fact, mean a delay of one minute. All of these things strike me as particularly odd. If there were a bit more goodwill around these issues, I do not see why there could not be an agreement reached in the case of the cricket. What strikes me as particularly interesting is the history of this matter in regard, for instance, to the New Zealand cricket test—where again we saw all this fracas. Of course, just before crunch time we saw a settlement. What we have here is two companies engaged in commercial negotiations: a free to air service company with a very large audience and a pay TV company with, I think, 3,000 subscribers. These companies are currently negotiating. Those opposite want the government of this country presumably to interfere in those negotiations and determine a result.

        Those opposite do not say how that should be done. They say that, somehow or other, the government must come up with a situation whereby the test is made available to the majority of viewers. Quite clearly, that is the government's policy. But what those opposite have to do if they are to make those sorts of demands is explain their policy. How would they do it, if they are so clever? They want to interfere in negotiations; they should explain their position. We have seen their position.

        The anti-siphoning list, which I am sure senators are familiar with, is very extensive. It says that certain sports which have been traditionally seen by Australians should remain free to air. They should not be available to be siphoned off for commercial advantage, for smaller audiences which have the capacity to pay. It also says that if they fail to do that there are mechanisms to reduce the size of that list. So it is an incentive for them as Channel 9 or the free to air service broadcaster, whoever it might be, to somehow make sure they make an agreement. It is my belief that an agreement will be reached.

        There are negotiations under way.

That list includes such things as the Melbourne Cup, the AFL, rugby league, rugby union, Australian Cricket Board activities, soccer, tennis, netball, basketball, golf and motor sports.

        The opposition has stepped in now with a timely motion which seeks to lay the blame entirely at the feet of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), and there is no doubt that the minister must take a large slice of the responsibility for what has gone wrong. We warned him last year that there were problems which needed to be rectified, but very little has been done to address those. It is quite clear that the licence conditions in the act invite the sort of manipulation which the Nine Network now appears to be indulging in. I have to ask whether the Australian Broadcasting Authority has dealt with this dispute in an even-handed manner. It seems to us that the early signals sent to Nine encouraged it to play hard ball on this. The government has now changed its position, which has created an impression of indecision all around.

        The minister is not the only culprit. The Nine Network has taken a very boots-and-all approach, which makes one wonder who its public relations advisers are. Prime International and Australis Media have done their bit by giving out conflicting information about exactly who acquired the rights and when they acquired them. Having considered the evidence given to last Thursday's committee hearing on this issue, we have come to the view that the solution to this problem lies in the hands of the Nine Network. We can see no justification for Nine's insistence on an exclusive live broadcast. It was never envisaged that the free to air broadcasters would use the act to degrade coverage on pay television, but that is what has happened in this case, or potentially is about to happen.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The available evidence is that Nine actually knocked back the rights in May of last year, having been offered them by Trans World International acting for the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The board appears to have been insisting on more money than it got from Nine in 1991 to avoid making a large loss on the tour, as happened in that year. Nine, according to Trans World International, said no. Australis then stepped in and said yes.

        There appears to have been prior discussion between TWI and Australis, and this may well have influenced the asking price which Nine knocked back. Nine then sought to use its anti-siphoning privileges to obtain the free to air rights at a lower price than the price knocked back originally. Going by some press reports, the price that has been offered may be lower than it paid in 1991. Given that it did knock back the rights that first time, you have to ask yourself how serious Nine was about screening the tour in the first place. Did it decide that it was not a priority at that price given the lack of interest in the 1991 tour, even though it could have cut its costs by on-selling those rights to pay TV? Did it only change its mind when it found it would be screened on pay television? They are interesting questions.

        Leaving them aside, we now have a situation where Nine could buy the rights at a reasonable price and show the series now. It has so far refused to do so unless it gets exclusive rights to the entire series on the ground. We do not believe that that is reasonable. Live broadcasts on pay television should not be a threat to Nine's revenue base or anyone else's. If they were to make a small but significant impact in the longer run, the price of free to air rights would adjust to reflect that.

        Nine has argued that to allow live broadcasts on pay TV is like asking it to accept simultaneous broadcasts on Channel 7. That completely ignores the fact that Australis, unlike Seven, is not a free service. Nine has a strong cost advantage. It has no basis for demanding exclusive live coverage. That is where the minister has only belatedly got it right. He should have come to this position much earlier. It should have been the message last year, not this year.

        What has happened to the other networks? Why have they not bought rights to the series?

        He could have unravelled this mess much earlier. Had he accepted our suggestion late last year to allow pay TV licensees to buy pay rights to listed events, Nine would have had no way of enforcing a demand for exclusive live rights overall. It would have had to play with a straight bat. That is no longer an option because time is running out. But the Broadcasting Services Act must be amended to prevent this from happening again. A change to the licence conditions to allow the independent purchase of pay TV rights would certainly help. But there needs to be safeguards against the risk that Prime or Australis, for example, would then refuse to on-sell free to air rights to listed events at a realistic price.

Unless this is resolved, they will not have a chance to see it, because pay TV will not be reaching Tasmania for some time.

        The reason that we have reached such an impasse is not that the market has failed; it is that the minister has failed. The minister has failed to provide Australians with the opportunity. Anti-siphoning is the minister's idea. It is the minister's own creation. The fact that these events were not on the list—the list came out too late—is not the fault of anybody else but the government and the minister. If that list was in place at the right time, we would not find ourselves in the current impasse where it appears as though nobody will be able to get live coverage of that test tour in the West Indies.

        It is not a fact that the market has got things wrong. It is a fact that the government has got things wrong due to its own mismanagement.

We understand the difficulties facing the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. A letter and a submission to a committee here last Friday from the West Indies Cricket Board of Control is a pretty unusual measure. You do not very often see somebody from outside Australia putting in a submission to a committee which is having a public hearing on legislation.

        The board stated quite clearly that if this area of the world, which is not very wealthy and which relies heavily on this sporting event to provide it with income by way of television rights, does not get these television rights and the dollars that it expects to come from it, it will find it very difficult to survive through this tour. It runs at a loss of about half a million dollars with every tour because of the economic conditions within those areas. It is only television rights—whether they be from Australia or the United Kingdom—that make these visits to the West Indies by touring teams profitable events. That money helps those young people who are less privileged than those in Australia to be able to start out in sporting careers. Without it they would not be able to survive.

        What about the low income earners in Australia? Now that we know that Senator Carr is a champion of free enterprise, it looks as though we are the only ones that will try to make sure that something happens for the low income earners who rely entirely on free to air television to be able to provide them with the sporting coverage that they are entitled to get and which was promised to them by this government. If we reach the situation that currently exists where only some 2,000-odd people will be hooked up to pay TV and able to watch it through Galaxy—I guess if it is going to be on from midnight till seven in the morning you will probably be lucky if 200 of those 2,000 will watch the cricket all through the night—it is a very small percentage of Australians who will have any opportunity to watch this unless something is done very quickly.

        I heard senators opposite say, `Yes, but we're acting as though the event has already started.' All we are doing is alerting you to the fact that, unless something is done very quickly, people will not be able to see it. It is a very short time before the first match is due to be telecast. It is a great pity that we have got to this stage where, in the week prior to this major event starting, we still do not know whether the events will be telecast. On current indications they will not be. A couple of weeks ago the minister supported the Nine Network's position that only it should have live television coverage. Now the minister is on the other side of the fence. He is adopting the position of the pay operator, Australis, which wants live coverage.

I think Senator Tierney, Senator Ferguson and Senator Crane should be congratulated for wanting to get the Australia and West Indies cricket series televised out here. Indeed, that is no doubt what everybody would want. But the interesting thing about the motion is that those opposite condemn the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for not doing something about it. If we look at item (d) in Senator Tierney's motion, it says that it:

       I suppose we on this side must make something of this motion. I think the only thing that can come from this motion is this: that three very senior members of the coalition have brought this motion forward, and they blame the government and the minister for not making available the cricket from the West Indies when it is played. The only thing we can deduce from that is that it must be the policy of those opposite that the government must ensure that this happens.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I suppose we on this side would not make the same deduction because, as is clearly apparent from this, we will not, as it were, force Channel 9 or pay TV stations to take certain action. But it would seem that the only way we could get the cricket to be shown out here is to force these stations to broadcast it.

        I suppose what comes from that is—I should imagine there would be some sympathy for this around the country—that, if the coalition were in government, it would pass laws forcing Channel 9 to program the cricket.

        It would seem to me that the only way the government could ensure the cricket was made available would be for it to take over—commandeer and nationalise—the pay TV stations and make sure it gets the cricket out to Australia. I am sure Senator Sherry would agree with me that in the motion it is not the station that the opposition says should be condemned; it says that the government must do these things. The whole thrust behind this motion is that government is responsible for getting cricket here. The only way it would seem open for that to happen is if the government were to take over the station—I suppose only for the duration of the test cricket and for the duration of the games being played.

        If you believe that that approach of taking over a particular station—Channel 9 in this case, or a pay TV station, depending on which one you want to broadcast on—is reasonable, then you can say that the minister is passing the buck by putting it on to the station. If I understand the thrust of this motion, the opposition is saying that the minister should ensure that the station does what the opposition says it should be doing. It thinks the minister should march in there and tell Channel 9, Channel 7 or Channel 10 what to do about things.

        We on this side of the chamber say that ownership should be respected; that there should be freedom of expression; that television owners should have the right to be able to program their particular day in the way they choose, subject, of course, to the laws that protect people against pornography and things like that. But this suggestion made by Senator Tierney—a very responsible person, as we all know—that it is not a matter of banning things but a matter of, in a positive way, making stations show particular programs is an interesting extension of the sort of philosophy that has been put in the past.

        The select committee into pay television, of which I believe he is a member, seems to be a very interesting committee. It is interesting to note the initiatives that have been taken apparently by the committee and by Senator Tierney, who I think heads that committee. I might be wrong about that, but I believe that is the case. He certainly shows a lot of interest in it if he is not. Whether he is head of the committee or not, it is interesting to note his initiative of suggesting that government take over private stations. If the television stations cannot do it, perhaps you ought to take over a radio station, Senator Tierney. Perhaps you can explain that when you give your answer in this debate.

        I think I can speak on behalf of the government—as I said, I am not a member of the government; I am a member of the government party—and say that the government will not be taking over television stations and the companies that own them and forcing them to show particular programs.

        If that is the opposition's position, I can understand why it uses the terms it does in this particular motion—why it condemns the government; why it says that there has been monumental buck passing; why it says that the government is wholly responsible and that the television networks are in no way responsible; and why it says that this is a coverage fiasco and that the minister is incompetent. But if, on the other hand, those opposite took the minister's approach—I simply ask them to put themselves in that position for a minute for the purposes of this exercise—and said that he is not and should not be obliged to take over television stations, they would perhaps see that their motion is a little harsh on him. Minister Lee is a person who respects the rights of property, and he respects the right of media people to run their own ship.

        —in reply—I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate. I want to make a number of comments about some of the things that have been said this afternoon in relation to this matter. My speech was followed by Senator Carr, who I found made a very surprising analysis of the whole situation. I was highly amused that a member of the socialist left—indeed, one of the doyens of the socialist left in Victoria—would be such a fierce advocate of private enterprise. We do not support Senator Carr's totally laissez-faire approach to this. We believe governments do have some role, unlike Senator Carr, it seems, in this matter.

        —I thank Senator Schacht very much for his contribution. Senator Carr went on to make a number of rather silly points relating to this matter. He kept saying, and a number of government members have repeated these refrains, that `this will be solved', `we can still fix it' and `I have confidence that it still can be fixed.' I believe Senator Bourne of the Australians Democrats has a similar view. I call on particularly Senator Bourne to consider the fact that there are seven more days to this test.

        We have obvious evidence from both Australis, which operates Galaxy, and Channel 9 that they are digging in on their position. We have a very even-handed minister handling all this. He first supported Channel 9. He did that for about eight or nine days. Then he decided he would support Galaxy. So that is being very even-handed. Then he had a shot at supporting the free to air networks, and then he had a shot at supporting the pay TV people.

        What we wish the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) would do is support the cricket fans of Australia. He can support the cricket fans of Australia by allowing cricket games to be seen on free to air television. It should not be too hard for the minister to do that because that is the government policy. All we are asking the minister to do is resolve this in the way in which it was intended to be resolved: people with low incomes having the opportunity to see important games—games that have wide coverage, games that are watched—without having to pay for that right.

        In summary, we support the government's policy on anti-siphoning. We think it is a great policy. We believe a lot of the important sporting events in Australia should be left on free to air television. We are just calling on the minister to implement his own policy. I have great fears for the communications industry in this country—it is one of the great growth sectors of the future—because this is the tip of the iceberg that shows that this minister cannot run the very complex communications department if he cannot get the cricket scores right.

          —I hope this report is worth while, considering I have waded through an hour and a half of cricket to get to here. I find this report on the visit to Thailand and Laos a bit hard to believe. There are a lot of issues which are touched on that I could expand on. What is appalling is that they are not treated in any depth in the report. I know some of the background, so when the report says on page 21, paragraph 117, that Thailand is larger than Laos and Laos would like to retain its identity, I understand some of what that means. But I wonder how many other people could get much insight from that statement. The same paragraph says, `The two countries will remain close, but there are extensive plans for a number of dams on rivers in the north of Laos to generate hydro-electricity for sale, principally to Thailand.'

          I spent a few minutes at lunch to mention some of these projects in relation to the Asian Development Bank, and their more horrible implications. Nothing is mentioned here, except on page 18, where it is mentioned that in Thailand these concerns were raised at the Thailand Institute of Public Policy. These issues were obviously raised. They are of concern not only in Laos, but in Thailand, and indeed in the international development community.

          I will take this opportunity to say that the Thai non-government organisation community is very active, and heavily involved in opposition to such projects. This is not a Thai-bashing exercise. The Thai communities, including extensive grassroots organisations such as the Buddhist development networks, are also threatened by the intrusion of transnational influence, and the astronomically growing power of economic elites in their own nation.

          Relocation of villages at gunpoint is also known in Thailand and, in spite of laws and principles on deforestation, Thailand's active environment movement fights clearing of so-called degraded forest for use as blue-gum plantation feeding the Japanese pulp industry, and clearing even of areas like the last indigenous pine forests near Chang Mai, having three unique Thai species. This was heavily protested by environmentalists, and the local Karen and Lanna-Thai population.

          On page 14 we see a mention of a visit to the Mae Moh lignite mine, a project supported by AIDAB and feeding directly into the neighbouring power station. A few references give clues to the cognoscenti who know that the Mae Moh power plant has been a running environmental disaster, polluting the air and water to an extent where the communities that were worse affected raised the issue through extremely militant civil action. I leave to your imagination what is referred to with the phrase, `water supply and environmental problems and their solutions', and the implications of the phrase, `relocation of villages'. Is this an example of our `clean coal' technology?

          What is most distressing is that, while the dams in Laos are briefly mentioned, more attention being given to the state of the Chancery building, the sentence in paragraph 131 on page 23 seems to imply that the delegation not only was not willing to report on some of the social or environmental implications of the dams, but instead seemed to be presenting the dams as an opportunity for Australian business. Indeed, they are, and several Australian businesses are already involved. One wonders how that fits into a code of conduct for businesses in South-East Asia.

          I also note that the concern of the Thais over the remarks made on the possible sale of Steyr rifles to the Khmer Rouge was raised on several pages, and several times. It appears to be one of the dominant issues that came out of the Thai visit. The main point about the proposal to sell Steyr rifles to the Thais is that, currently, while the Thai side is not willing to proceed with the sale, the Australian defence industries and the Australian government seem to be more than willing to participate.

           Women, elections and parliament

          with regard to the progress that is being made in identifying and encouraging women to stand for parliament. I noted with interest what I suppose is an official response in this month's committee bulletin which referred to the `SNAP decision', the decision made by the SNAPs, the sensitive new age politicians on the hill. It says:

         In so far as the committee recommended that the minister authorises the committee to monitor developments in the area of participation by women in the electoral process and to report on this matter from time to time, I do not regard that as a quick moving response. The coalition would perhaps have liked a more positive report. In looking at the numbers of women in politics the first thing to be said is that, if we are serious about the goal of getting more women in parliament, we will need to work a great deal harder than we do at present. The number of women in parliament has been increasing but it would be hard to call the response brilliant. At present I think we are in a holding pattern, and that probably goes for all parties.

          A number of factors work against greater numbers of women entering politics. In part, the low number of female politicians is linked with women's lower economic standing and over-representation in lower socio-economic groups generally. There are logistical constraints associated with women's family responsibilities and the demands of a parliamentary career, particularly in federal politics. It is very hard to balance the rearing of small children with the long hours and frequent travel associated with a career in politics. Some women would see the confrontational style and atmosphere of male dominated parliaments and unsympathetic treatment of female parliamentarians by the media as a disincentive to run for parliament, but probably some males find this a disincentive also.

          Given these constraints, what strategies are in place or could be utilised to entice more women into the political arena? Should we change the system and make it more appealing to women, such as lessening the sitting hours, providing more travel allowance, and providing creches and tutors for the children of parliamentarians? Should we implement a quota system, as the ALP has done, and force parties to preselect a certain number of women in a given time frame? Should we try educating young women at school to be more aggressive and assertive so that the confrontationist style of federal parliament, or indeed state parliament, would not appear threatening? Should we encourage more women to stand for preselection and be more supportive of those who do, so that in time there will be so many to choose from that no-one could ever say, `But there were simply not enough women of substance to choose from'?

          I would like to comment on the quota system implemented by the Labor Party. Labor's quota system, with an aim of 35 per cent female representation by the year 2002, has so far failed to jump the intransigent hurdle of factional dealings. Many seats that should have been given to women, had the party machinery been serious about selecting more women, turned into factional warfare with principles of gender equity lost in battle.

          Ironically, the woman who is the main push behind this fund idea is Joan Kirner. She resigned to allow more women to follow her in Victorian state politics, but her seat of Williamstown was won by a man. Perhaps Ms Kirner would have done more good for the women's movement if she had stayed in her seat. In contrast, I would like to outline some of the ground breaking work the Liberal Party has already done in supporting women, both in the community and in parliament.

          By definition, political life will never appeal to everyone. I was interested to read a comment by Steve Vizard—a television personality in Melbourne—who, the media reported, was also approached to stand for the Victorian federal seat of Kooyong. He was somewhat stunned that he was approached to stand for that seat. He said he was interested in issue-driven politics and he was interested in party politics. He told the media and the people who suggested he enter politics that he was looking forward to leaving his family, his home, his beach house, his farm, his business and his life so he could go to Canberra—that international city of fun—and have journalists write demeaning articles about him.

         However, with very short notice we did get rather substantial submissions from a number of organisations. Those organisations are listed in an appendix on page 28 of the report. I think there was only one letter which actually supported the legislation. The submissions overwhelmingly opposed the legislation. The legislation which is the subject of this report is the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). The legislation has two operative sections. On page 1 of the majority report it states:

         This legislation, if enacted, would tarnish Australia's international reputation as a leading defender of human rights; would legislatively restrict Australia's obligations under the refugee convention in a manner likely to be injurious to the principle of non-refoulement, which is not handing back refugees to their persecutors; would be a confused and completely unnecessary response to a decision of the refugee tribunal as held by the Federal Court; and, most importantly, would send a message to the PRC government which it would interpret as condoning its fertility control policies involving forced abortions, coerced sterilisations, crippling fines, anti-worker penalties and other punishments.

         A lot of fear has been engendered about the refugee situation. There is a lot of confusion that this is the same sort of bill as the No. 2 bill, which dealt with the Sino-Vietnamese situation. Let me make it perfectly clear that, in order to achieve refugee status, an asylum seeker must overcome two hurdles. The refugee convention requires that they must establish a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to their country. That fear must be on the ground of a convention—race, religion, nationality, political opinion or social group. If you cannot jump both hurdles, you are not accepted. Even if you can prove persecution, you are still not accepted unless that persecution is on the ground the convention grants.

         Are the fertility control policies of the PRC on the grounds of race? No. Colour? No. Race or religion? No. Nationality? No. Political opinion? No. They are against a particular social group, and that particular social group is defined by a consideration of how it is perceived by the rulers. That is the essence of the judgment of the independent Refugee Review Tribunal and the judgment of the Federal Court.

         So you could have a situation where asylum seekers in Australia could have a real fear, a well-established and reasonable fear, that they are to face coerced abortion or sterilisation. They will not be able to jump that second hurdle if the government continues with the legislation and instructs the courts and the refugee tribunal to disregard the policies of the People's Republic of China in this matter. I appeal to senators to read this particular report thoroughly before they come to their conclusion, and I particularly ask the government senators to do just that.

         This particular bill was referred to the committee, I believe, on the Tuesday when we first sat—I think it was 31 January. The committee met on the Friday, 3 February—a matter of a few days. It was not possible for me to beat up a bandwagon back in my own state of Western Australia in order to get submissions to the committee, but I am sure I could have matched the numbers that came in who were in opposition to the legislation, with perhaps a hundredfold of those constituents of my state who are exceptionally concerned about this problem.

I will give him the benefit of the doubt because from time to time the media in Australia does not get things right. As a matter of fact, at the National Immigration and Population Outlook Conference held by the Bureau of Immigration Research in Adelaide of last week, his comments were reported by two newspapers and the two reports conflicted.

         I was very surprised when I received my copy of the report last evening to note that the dissenting report was signed by Senators Abetz, Ellison and O'Chee. I was amazed to find that Senator Short had not signed it. Senator Short is the opposition spokesperson on immigration. I fully expected him, as one of the leaders in his political party and indeed in the coalition, to attach his signature to the dissenting report. It is not as if Senator Short had not seen the dissenting report. On Tuesday evening during the legal and constitutional committee hearing on the Racial Hatred Bill, I sat beside Senator Short as he proofread and corrected the draft of the dissenting report.

Last year the Senate rejected that bill. The opposition, after opposing the bill last year, has done a huge backflip by supporting it on Tuesday of this week in the House of Representatives. Is Senator Short seeking to avoid embarrassment? I believe that, when Mr Howard's attention is drawn to this bill, when he understands the full repercussions and ramifications, he will—

         There have been numerous cases in various parts of the world. Fortunately, only those that have changed the laws to advantage of refugees are quoted. But I am assured by learned colleagues and those with many more dealings with the law than I have that there have been cases in other parts of the world that have sought to keep the definition where it is, to not expand it in the way that perhaps the Canada case has.

         The Canada case is quoted in the report. I cannot remember the quotation, but it is referenced in the report. Unfortunately, there are many other countries in which actions have been taken to seek a similar form of expansion on the basis of the fertility control policies of one or another country. I am certainly hopeful that when the bill comes forward for debate in this chamber next week or in the weeks to come the coalition parties will take a responsible attitude and support the government.

         The minister also said in his press release today that he had already discussed with me amendments `which may clarify and give certainty to the legislation'. I raise two points about that. First of all, that was wrong. The fact is that, during the Senate committee hearings, there was general agreement not only by non-governmental witnesses but by the minister's own department that amendments would be required. Three hours after the minister made his statement, some amendments were faxed through. But at the time of making his statement, there had been no amendments. The minister had had no discussion at all with me about amendments, other than a passing conversation which I initiated with one of his advisers yesterday, saying, `Where on earth are the amendments that you know full well you need?'

         The minister has been absolutely misleading, for whatever reason—and Senator McKiernan picked that up today and followed the same line, regrettably—in his interpretation of the whole situation. All I can say to the Senate is that this bill has many serious difficulties. It is not necessarily irretrievable but it does need some major amendments. We will be considering our final position with respect to the bill in the next few days, following the normal due processes. I find the assertions and allegations that have been made, both by the minister today and regrettably by Senator McKiernan, who is in the chamber, regrettable because they are so totally inaccurate.

         —The first thing that needs to be understood is that the evidence before the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was overwhelmingly opposed to the legislation as it is currently drafted. For the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), Senator McKiernan and others to assert otherwise would be incorrect. The shadow minister, Senator Short, has indicated a number of organisations that oppose the legislation. It would be very helpful if we also heard from Sir Ronald Wilson, a former judge of the High Court of Australia and President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This is what he said:

        Coerced sterilisation or abortion is a flagrant disregard of a fundamental human right.

        Indeed, the committee heard evidence in camera from witnesses from China as to some of the barbaric procedures that are implemented in pursuit of the so-called fertility control policies. Some people, unfortunately, refer to them as one-child policies, but in certain areas of the People's Republic of China, if you do not have a licence to have a child, you are not allowed to have one. That is then enforced by compulsion in certain areas.

         If the government wants to go on public record as a fighter for human rights and give credence to that sort of behaviour by the People's Republic of China, let it do so, but let it do so openly, honestly and without the sort of obfuscation that the minister tried to engaged in during the debate today. His scandalous press release was clearly incorrect. He asserted that he spoke to the shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, which he clearly has not done. Clearly, the government is realising that it is in a very difficult position; it cannot get out, so what does it do? The best form of defence is to attack, so it sought to attack Senator Jim Short in a press release and also in this parliament just a few moments ago.

         I would like to emphasise the considerable importance this Government places on the nursing home validation program. The validation program is an accountability program which helps protect frail elderly nursing home residents by checking that funds allocated to nursing homes to care for their residents is actually spent on residents' care.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The reference was initially made to the Committee by the Senate on 30 September 1993. In December 1993 the Committee sought comments on the Terms of reference from all nursing homes. There were public hearings in June 1994, and the Committee tabled its report on 16 November 1994.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am pleased to note that after such a comprehensive canvassing of all nursing homes, the Committee's report did not find major systemic problems with the validation program. The report usefully identified some areas where we can improve our administration of the program, and I welcome those recommendations which focus on the need for more timely processes (recommendation 1), more training (recommendations 2 and 3), clearer and simpler information, and consultation and training for nursing home proprietors and staff (recommendations 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am pleased to be able to report that considerable work is being undertaken in each of these areas, for example:

         It is on this basis that the Government cannot agree to recommendation 6 of the majority report.

I should make clear however that following Professor Gregory's second report, the Government is considering more relevant changes to nursing home funding arrangements. I note that a Dissenting Report by four of the eight Committee members disagrees with the majority report recommendation number 6 while supporting all of the other recommendations.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The key component in completing outstanding validations will be the successful adoption of a risk management approach to scheduling and conducting validations. This initiative is part of the recently introduced quality assurance strategy in the nursing home program. A risk management approach to validation started in October 1994. This approach still means that all nursing homes are subject to validation, but it means homes most at risk of not spending care funds on residents' care will be visited earlier and more frequently, and that all financial records may not be validated.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The resulting schedule is a rolling program of validation visits based on homes' performance against a range of factors.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Department is unable to give a detailed schedule of the program for completing outstanding validations as the validation program will now be constructed to deal progressively with homes which indicate the highest level of risk against a range of indicators. As one of these indicators is length of time since last validated then homes not validated for earlier years are likely to be visited first.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         At the beginning of 1994-95, there were 5000 outstanding validations. The Department proposes a risk management strategy based on validation of 75% of outstanding home-years on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, some 3500 of the outstanding years are likely to be validated. The department will have a capacity to perform at least 1500 validations a year which would see the program brought up to date, within existing legislative parameters, by the end of 1996/97. This enables validation responsibilities to be met under the new benefit payment scheme, effective from 1 July 1993, which requires a fee to be set within three years of the end of the year of funding.

          —I welcome the government's response to the report of the Senate's Community Affairs References Committee on the validation of CAM and SAM funding to nursing homes. Validation has been a problem for a long time. The validation process, particularly the delays on the part of the Department of Human Services and Health, have been criticised by all sectors of the nursing home industry—proprietors and their industry representatives.

          The coalition has raised concerns about this issue on numerous occasions. I have spoken about it many times in this chamber. The Auditor-General has tabled a damning report on validations, highlighting some of the systematic problems in this validation process. When it was obvious that the situation was reaching crisis point and the government was doing nothing to rectify the situation, the coalition moved a motion to have the validation of CAM and SAM funding of nursing homes referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. That was on 30 September 1993. The report of that committee was tabled on 16 November 1994. Today we are discussing the government's response to that report.

          Throughout all this period, the Department of Human Services and Health continued to be criticised for delays in the validation process. Even after the department realised in 1990 that there was an urgent need to speed up the validation process, it took another four years for all the 1986-87 data to be processed.

          In her response, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) emphasises the importance of validation as an accountability program which helps protect frail elderly nursing home residents by checking the funds allocated to nursing homes to care for residents and to make sure that they are actually spent on the care of those residents. This view is supported by the Auditor-General and is a view with which the coalition concurs.

          Before I deal with the government's response to each recommendation, I would like to say that the minister misrepresents the situation when she says in her covering letter to the report that `all of the 1986-87 validations are completed'. I believe that that statement is not correct. When the Auditor-General brought out his report, it indicated that a number of the validations for that period had not been completed. In addition, in estimates committees only a few weeks ago, we asked the department again. We did not get an absolutely clear answer.

          It would appear that the validations have been done—that is, the validators have been there—but I am not absolutely sure whether all the exit interviews have been done and all the nursing homes have been told whether they owe money as a result of that validation process. I am sure that Senator Woods will speak about a number of cases which he has been alerted to where that process has not been completed. I would like the minister to be more clear when she addresses this issue. If she wants to say that the 1986-87 validations have been completed in the sense that the validators have been into the nursing homes, that is fine; let her say that. But if she means that they have been completed in the sense that all the nursing homes know exactly where they stand in terms of the amount of money they owe for that period, there is some doubt about that. I would really like to see it clarified.

          The committee recommended that the Department of Human Services and Health provide a detailed schedule to the committee outlining its proposed program for completing outstanding validations. The government has admitted that it is unacceptable that there should be such delays in the validation process and that to complete the outstanding validations—there were 5,000 of them at the beginning of 1994-95—it will adopt a risk management approach to scheduling and conducting validations.

          This is not before time. One can only ask why it has taken a Senate committee report for the government to accept responsibility for the debacle of this area of administration and to take some action to rectify it. It is just ridiculous to expect that a business should have to wait for years before it knows whether it owes money to the department. It impinges on how it engages in financial planning. Another problem with validations is that nursing homes could be repeating the same mistake, some of them unwittingly and some, albeit few of them, wittingly. Some of them were repeating the error. If they were not validated, they could continue to do that for ensuing years.

          Another two recommendations of the committee are that the Department of Human Services and Health improve its training program for validators to ensure an optimum level of consistency in the validation process and that the validators should have formal accountancy qualifications or other appropriate training. The government's response is that it agrees in principle that the validators should have training. In 1992-93, only 50 per cent of the validators had appropriate formal training. In 1994-95, 60 per cent of people have formal qualifications. It is obvious to me and some of my colleagues on this side of the chamber that there are problems in the area of training and the qualifications of validators. It has taken endless criticism, a Senate inquiry and a critical Auditor-General report before the government would even listen, let alone take any action.

          Another recommendation made was that the Department of Human Services and Health publish a document, expunged of confidential internal departmental information, that would provide guidance to nursing homes on the validation process, that this should be widely distributed and should form the basis of validations for that year. So the document is issued and then you would refer to the validations for that year in the relevant document.

          What was happening was that the goalposts kept changing. There were guidelines and the nursing homes carried out their business on the basis of those guidelines. Then, when the department got a bit more experience with the system, it changed the guidelines and validated the back years on the basis of the new guidelines.

          You cannot actually do that. That is unfair. The guidelines were not clear. I believe that many of the nursing homes were not fully informed. It may have been an error on their part, but the department could have been more pro-active in ensuring that the nursing homes were very clear about what constituted CAM activities and what constituted SAM activities. There were enormous complaints about that. Hopefully, there will be very clear directions and those problems will be overcome as a result of the government responding to that recommendation.

          Another recommendation was that the Department of Human Services and Health improve its consultative mechanisms within the industry in general, and in particular consult widely with the industry and industry organisations in the formulation of departmental circulars. This recommendation lies at the very heart of so many of the criticisms of the validation process. I am glad that the government has come to recognise this, even though it is very late in the day. A constant criticism on the part of proprietors and industry bodies has been the failure of the department to consult, the plethora of circulars and the lack of appropriate communication.

          Recommendation 9 was that the Department of Human Services and Health ensure that the NH20 form or documentation on the structure and format of the form is made available to nursing homes at least one month prior to the beginning of each financial year. Nursing homes were gathering data, then getting the form and having to try to make their data fit the form. There seemed to be no good reason given to us on the committee why that form could not be given out as the year began. The government has agreed to that. One of the other areas of recommendation was that there be more adequate training for nursing home staff.

The government is very concerned that this balance be maintained. It is imperative that the scales not fall to one side.

          Professor Gregory's first report on the structure of nursing home funding noted that option 2 would minimise flexibility and profitability for nursing homes. It should be made clear to this chamber that, in response to Professor Gregory's second report, changes will be considered. But I can assure you that any changes that are mooted will not be at the expense of care as supported by the majority report. The reason the status quo should remain is that the current standards monitoring system would fail as a tool under option 2 to adequately ensure the same quality of care that now exists.

          It is very sad because this is recommended by the government's own report, the Gregory report, where there is a recognition of the structural difficulties that the CAM-SAM system imposes upon directors of nursing, staff and proprietors in the nursing home industry. It is an arbitrary definition which leads to excess bureaucracy, which leads to time wasting, which leads to red tape and essentially diverts resources and funds which can be better used for the care of patients in determining whether in fact a particular task falls on one side or other of the arbitrary CAM-SAM boundary.

On our side, we believe that the issue of care would be enhanced by removing the waste of resources utilised in adapting to a CAM-SAM boundary which changes whenever the government bureaucrats decide it should be changed. The goal posts are changed regularly, and that is entirely inappropriate and makes life very difficult for providers of care in the nursing home industry.

          Gregory's option would have created flexibility which would have meant that there would be a more efficient use of resources not only generally but in particular in terms of those small nursing homes where multiskilling is vitally important. It is crazy that an employee who takes food from the kitchen through to a patient somewhere along that journey changes from being a CAM funded employee to being a SAM funded employee. This is a particular problem for small nursing homes. The Gregory option which we supported would have increased efficiency, reduced bureaucracy and red tape, and would have led to a better caring environment for those residents.

The SAM funding should be reviewed, as is recommended in the Gregory report, but the government has no initiative, no purpose in terms of improving the quality of care offered to residents in nursing homes.

         —Tonight, I wish to raise the matter of Eastlink, which is a proposed high voltage powerline between the Gatton region west of Brisbane and the Armidale area in northern New South Wales. The powerline will be around 400 kilometres in length and is intended to be part of a national electricity grid connecting the power systems of the two states. The imminent construction of an enormous electric powerline, with the inherent consequence of enabling increased electricity consumption, is extremely relevant, given the current agonising of the federal government over how it is going to live up to its commitment to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Senators will probably be aware that I have placed on the

         As a Democrat senator for Queensland, I have received many expressions of great concern about various aspects of Eastlink. Australian Democrat members at the community level in these areas have also had many people approach them to voice their disquiet. These concerns have come from people all throughout the regions surrounding the corridor of the powerline in Queensland, from Gatton and Laidley to Allora, Warwick and Stanthorpe. Similar concerns have been expressed to me by residents over the border in places such as Armidale and many other small rural communities in the Eastlink path. As an example, one submission from residents of Boonah and the surrounding towns of Kalbar and Aratula detailed a wide variety of concerns about Eastlink. It contains over 1,200 signatures from people objecting to the powerline.

         The Senate this week received petitions from over 2,000 people from areas such as those I have mentioned, all asking for a Senate inquiry. For the benefit of the Senate, I will outline some of the concerns expressed by those who have signed the petition. The petitioners point out that Eastlink is contrary to a recommendation of a 1992 report of the Senate's industry, science and technology committee. After the changes made by the Senate last year, this committee no longer exists and the area has been taken up by the Economics References Committee, which is why I proposed that the matter be considered by that committee.

Mr Scott spoke on Eastlink in the other chamber earlier this week, as did Mr Taylor, and I understand that other coalition senators, Senator Boswell and Senator Herron, have been approached by concerned residents. My hope is that all senators from all parties will recognise the need for an inquiry at least. Concern from residents has been sufficient for the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Borbidge, who is from the National Party, to state that under a coalition government there will be no Eastlink, and that any land acquired by the state government would be given back to the people at no cost to those people.

         It is arguable that, given the right circumstances, sharing power, as in the Eastlink proposal, can reduce the need to duplicate power generation infrastructure. This can provide major savings in infrastructure costs and in reducing consumption rates of fossil fuels and levels of atmospheric pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. It is, however, far from clear that Eastlink fits the bill in this regard, or that other possible alternatives to constructing the powerline have been fully explored.

         While still imbued with this unusual, but politically convenient, spirit of integrity, the Prime Minister might also repudiate the dishonest and devious device used to protect his then half owned piggery company from prosecution for polluting the upper reaches of the Scone water supply in August 1993, as I outlined earlier today.

         It is astonishing that Mr Keating has not, at any stage, apologised for, expressed any regret over or expressed any condemnation or mild criticism of the actions of his piggery group while he was its half owner.

         The actions of this company, while he half owned it, ranged from multiple breaches of the Australian Securities Commission's recommendations relating to its reporting rules to continual breaches of anti-pollution laws. I now ask Mr Keating—I know it is a waste of time, but I nonetheless do it—whether or not he supports the dishonest conspiracy his piggery group entered into with the Danish multinational company that has enabled him to escape the ignominy of his half owned company being found guilty of a pollution offence.

         Dr Shepherd from the EPA said that part of the reason legal action was commenced was to ensure that the environmental performance of the existing piggery was upgraded, particularly with regard to waste water treatment and effluent irrigation. No wonder it needed to be upgraded because the piggery itself had admitted in front of the  commission of inquiry that there were frequent breaches of the pollution laws as the arrangements were inadequate.

         I understand that the pigs in this piggery are housed in 15 sheds. Their effluent is collected underneath the sheds in trenches where it is discharged to the waste water treatment system. The solid and liquid pig waste is flushed into two separate but identical systems that screen solids and then direct liquids to primary treating ponds, and thence by gravity to irrigation ponds, whence it is irrigated onto other areas of the property.

But I have been informed by the New South Wales government that the piggery is not controlled by any pollution control, licence or approval. It has been able to get away with this because the piggery commenced operation years before these requirements were introduced; in other words, there were prior use arrangements.

         One incident occurred on 10 August 1993 when excessive irrigation had led to effluent of fairly high BOD and nutrient levels escaping the property. The detailed facts are that the office of the EPA received a phone call from the Scone-Parkville environmental watch group—which, as I say, I commend strongly for the way it has consistently pointed out the continuing pollution from Mr Keating's then half owned company—that reported that red effluent was coming down a gully leading from an irrigation paddock at Parkville piggery and running into a property owned by a Mr Dick Smith.

         By the way, the effluent flow on analysis showed BOD of 120 mg/l, ammonia of 130 mg/l and Ph—phosphorus, I suppose—of 7.9. The effluent flow was then followed upstream to a hinge joint fence line on the western boundary of a paddock that the piggery uses to dispose of effluent by spray irrigation. Effluent was coming out of a pool of effluent at the southern end of a rough bank system running along the fence line. The pools of effluent and the soggy ground led to an irrigation spray jet located in the general nor'-nor'-east direction. The irrigation spray was not in operation at that time, but the extent of the spray impact circle around the spray jet could clearly be seen. Further investigation determined that there were no other possible sources of pollution.

         Another incident occurred during an unplanned visit to the piggery and again revealed poor management of the waste water treatment system and high nutrient run-off. This was on 19 October 1993 when Commissioner Cleland had requested that the EPA take a water sample. They saw that the northern gully was running with mid-brown coloured water and the middle and southern gullies were running with clear water. Clear details of continuing environmental problems.

         The offences must be considered in light of the history of the piggery. They are aggravated having regard to the history and the difficulties of getting the piggery to apply proper management practices. Despite numerous visits, it has proven difficult to get management to do anything. To some extent, this situation has not been helped by the commission of inquiry which has tended to put active measures on hold. However, the piggery is still operating and still causing problems and will continue to do so, whether or not the joint venture with Danpork goes ahead.

         —My contribution to the adjournment debate tonight is to discuss the decision of the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to overturn the decision of Commissioner Hodder of December 1994. Commissioner Hodder's decision ordered that the small non-union company Asahi Diamond Industrial Australia Pty Ltd `shall negotiate in good faith' with the Automotive, Food, Metal and Engineering Union. That order was made despite the fact that, firstly, not a single one of Asahi's employees belonged to a union, nor did they want to belong; secondly, the employees were not interested in negotiating an agreement because they were satisfied with their present arrangements; and, thirdly, not a single employee wanted the union to be representing their interests.

         It was an outrageous decision of Commissioner Hodder. It was made more outrageous by the fact that the decision flowed from an outrageous law. Overnight, the Hodder decision had the potential to destabilise all those highly successful and productive non-unionised companies right around Australia.

         For both the unions and the employees, this test case had important principles at stake. On the one hand, employers, particularly those with non-union workplaces, bitterly opposed an enterprise bargaining system that forced them to negotiate with unions. On the other hand, the unions feared a system in which they might be locked out of the non-union sector. Indeed, the ACTU assistant secretary, Tim Pallas, has stated that the non-union sector is `a system that is tantamount to industrial apartheid'. He also said:

        The full bench decision is really a very big slap in the face to the union movement. The company at the heart of the dispute, Asahi, is a small engineering works that employs about 42 workers under the metal industry award. It is now well known that the employees and the employers of Asahi had come to a union-free agreement on how they wanted to work in order to achieve their mutual interests of improved productivity and higher wages. The enterprise bargaining arrangement which was sealed at Asahi saw employees and employers happy. It was an effective arrangement—that is, until the militant AFMEU foisted itself onto the Asahi company against the explicit wishes of every single employee who worked there.

         The confusion that subsequently emerged baffled workers, puzzled the employer and perplexed most Australians who followed the case each evening on TV and in the newspapers the following morning. So much publicity was generated about this one small company that Asahi placed large advertisements thanking the many thousands of Australians who lent their support to the company.

         It is interesting to note that the Asahi decision comes on top of plans announced earlier this week by Mr Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU, to expand union membership by 200,000 by the year 1997. It was widely reported at the end of last year that Australian workers were leaving unions in droves because they were failing to meet their members' needs. Indeed, former Labor Senator Jim McClelland is now on record as saying that he believes there is no longer a useful role for trade unions.

         Indeed, it appears that workers all around the country agree with that. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in December, combined with the ACTU's own figures, display the real extent of the defections from the trade union movement. The ABS labour force figures indicate that since 1988 there has been an overall decline in union membership of approximately seven per cent. That is of course despite a growing population.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The ACTU executive meeting in Melbourne in early December backed up these figures. The meeting in fact was warned that union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen over the last year by 400,000, leaving a total of 2.4 million members. Later that same week the New South Wales Labor secretary, Peter Sams, admitted the picture was more grim, with membership closer to two million; that is, union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen by 800,000 in a relatively short period.

         It is interesting to note that Mr Kelty, in his membership drive, is targeting only a quarter of the membership lost over the past year. The decline in membership really says a lot about the way in which unions are representing Australian workers today. To have the unions complain bitterly that the loss in membership will reduce their power to lobby governments stretches the imagination as to what role the union movement actually plays for its membership.

         I am sure most union members would be horrified to think that the only thing unions are concerned about is their grab for power and allowing Bill Kelty to sit around the cabinet table in Canberra. The fact is that unions have been playing the tune for the Australian Labor Party and have been forgetting the workers that they are supposed to represent.

         Clearly, the workers are finding that out themselves, and that is why they are leaving, not only in their thousands or tens of thousands but in their hundreds of thousands. Clearly, the desire to conscript new members at Asahi was a significant motive behind the union's actions. It is therefore very rewarding to see that that proposed action by the union failed.

         Many unions have consistently failed to meet the needs of employees who are looking for service providers to help them be part of the workplace culture. Trade unions have enjoyed enormous institutional, legal and political privilege within the Australian industrial relations system. Despite that privilege, their membership has been declining.

         Since many unions have had a guaranteed role in the system, and automatic membership thanks to compulsory unionism, the incentive to meet employees' needs was of course greatly diminished.

          Bill Neidji is an Aboriginal Man. By this, I mean, he carries the authority formed by a culture indigenous to the very land that your feet walk on today. His authority has been created and shaped by many decades of obligation, of ceremony and learning from the Old People of many, many generations. His authority has been created by personal actions and deeds and by strength and by teaching, kindness and most of all, by immense dignity. He has written books and spoken many times and been filmed in documentaries, seeking always to educate all others about Aboriginal culture, land and responsibility.

The objective is to put in place a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. The Statement acknowledges that some areas of old-growth forest which are not required for the reserve system, will be harvested for some years to come to meet timber needs of the Australian community.

       As the Prime Minister announced on 2 February 1995, the Commonwealth has put in place a process for assessing the conservation values of the 509 coupes identified as requiring further consideration before logging proceeds. Consistent with this process I have identified 57 coupes which satisfy the criteria for logging to continue. The Government is also considering the release of additional coupes which will be required to avoid stand-downs of forest workers. Coupes to be released are those where forest conservation values do not exist or where those values are well represented in conservation reserves.

        Remaining coupes will be assessed in accordance with the 8 week assessment process outlined in the Prime Minister's Statement.

        (2) Approval for the export of woodchips derived from timber harvested within native forests has followed detailed consideration of the applications to ensure protection of environmental values and included consideration of advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. In approving licences for 1994, the then Minister for Resources, on the advice of the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, did not approve export of woodchips from some areas proposed for logging and these were subsequently withdrawn.

The advice of the Australian Heritage Commission is an integral part of the decision making process. Where there is no feasible and prudent alternative to carrying-out a proposed export woodchip operation that may have an adverse impact on the national estate, the Commonwealth relies upon the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission and State forest management agencies for ways to minimise those adverse impacts.

        (5) The Government's objective on the export of woodchips was announced by the Prime Minister on 22 December 1994. By the year 2000 the Government will ban the export of woodchips from those areas of Australia's native forests which are not covered by Regional Forest Agreements incorporating a reserve system that comprehensively represents all forest types. The amount of woodchips exported from native forests where there has not been significant progress towards a Regional Forest Agreement will be reduced by about 20 per cent per year to nil by the year 2000.
