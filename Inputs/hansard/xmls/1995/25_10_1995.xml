        The government has no difficulty in informing the parliament of the outcome of the review process. In so far as the notice of motion assumes that there will be one report, it may be making the wrong assumption. The government's intention in conducting the review is to identify discrete areas of decision making and to remedy any problems. This process may not necessarily lead to the preparation of a report. I make the point again that, after all the processes of the Senate, there is a very clear majority in support of this motion, even though the government's position on it is very clear. It is for those reasons that the government does not intend to refuse formality, even though our position is very clear in relation to our implacable opposition to the proposition.

        There are 15 bills listed in the motion. The Australian Democrats believe that two of these bills are, in fact, urgent and the rest of them have start-up dates way beyond what would make them urgent for the next three weeks of sitting. We do not believe that we will even get up to a lot of these bills on the program, because there are so many bills on the program. We believe it is just totally useless to put most of these bills through as urgent; they are not urgent bills. It is really very silly to add most of these to a program that is already so long that we will not get through what we have on it now. We will be voting against this motion.

As a general principle, the Greens (WA) have expressed the view that at this late stage, with 16 days of the program left to go, to suddenly introduce more and more bills to be exempt from the cut-off means that there is no real prioritising and addressing of the problem but simply the creation of further problems by an ad hoc way of relating to bills.

        So the proposal has been put that a meeting be held of all the groups involved in this chamber to set a consensus program which prioritises bills and actually puts a timetable in place for the remaining 16 days which is achievable, rather than add on to a list which makes addressing any of those bills of extreme urgency less and less achievable.

I might remind the Senate that the cut-off is to enable orderly planning and for the Senate to have reasonable time to consider the detail of legislation in order to do its job properly. The effect of the cut-off is that the government, basically, undertook to introduce bills in the session before that in which they wished to have the bills debated in the Senate. It was a very sensible and reasonable reform.

        However, on today's order of business some 36 pieces of legislation are listed. The minister has come in here today and, in effect, asked us to agree to a further 14 pieces of legislation to be added to that list for debate in the next little over two weeks.

        Of course, I was very much involved in discussions on the resolution relating to the cut-off motion. The reason for that is that, whilst the opposition might justifiably complain about the lack of opportunity they have had for examining bills and preparing their positions on the bills and discussing them, at least they have people who are able to deal with specific areas, and it makes it much easier for them; whereas it is more difficult for those of us who have to look at each and every piece of legislation that comes before this chamber and decide what we are able to assess as the merits of the proposals. So that is one of the reasons that I feel the government should make out a very strong case as to why certain pieces of legislation should be exempted.

         The family is the basic unit of society. Most people obtain their comfort, support and succour from their family. It is consistently ranked as the most important aspect of people's lives and as the institution that recognises their individual worth and to which they can retreat for support. It is therefore not surprising that when a family unit breaks down there is severe hurt, emotional trauma and bitterness associated with the demise of the family unit. I look forward to the day when we, in this place, devote as much time to bolstering our families and assisting them with government initiatives as we do to dealing with consequences of breakdown.

         This bill provides for further changes to the Family Law Act. In providing a legislative framework for mediation and counselling to assist in the resolution of conflict rather than having recourse to the courts, the bill is enunciating an appropriate principle. This aspect of the legislation should not be seen as an attack on my legal colleagues who practise in the area of family law. As a practitioner myself, I have experienced the difficulties of trying to resolve matrimonial discord.

         The vast majority of lawyers in this country act honourably and within the best interests of their clients. However, given the emotion charged atmosphere of matrimonial breakdown, it is often expedient to blame a lawyer or, even better, a judge for an unpalatable outcome. The one discipline in the law where clients are most likely to switch lawyers is the family law area. The reasons are manifold but I suspect emotion, anger, vindictiveness and other thought processes in this trying time are often the cause.

         As an aside, I regret the increasing number of negligence claims against family lawyers which mainly arise from the one practitioner being engaged by both parties to tie up the loose ends and then one party crying foul after a settlement has been achieved. That adds to the costs and now makes it most unlikely that lawyers are prepared to sit down with both sides to achieve a fair, speedy and relatively cheap outcome because the threat of future negligence claims hang over their heads.

         Clearly mediation and counselling will be a more edifying and dignifying approach to dispute resolution in an area of life where dignity is usually lost in the hurt and anger. However, mediation and counselling only work when both parties are willing to compromise and there is some reservoir, no matter how small, of goodwill. Even without these provisions these people would normally settle without the need for a formal court hearing. Where there is no goodwill, resort to the courts will still be necessary.

         As a Tasmanian legal practitioner, I can boast that we in Tasmania have the highest rate of settlements in Australia in the family law area. It is undoubtedly indicative of the professional and commonsense approach adopted by my colleagues in Tasmania. Counselling and mediation are categorised in the legislation as primary dispute resolution mechanisms. Obligations are imposed on practitioners and the courts to consider the efficacy of these mechanisms and accordingly advise the parties to the dispute. For the mechanisms to be effective, the same immunity needs to be afforded to the counsellors and mediators as is currently enjoyed by court based personnel.

         In general terms, this legislative scheme is welcome. What is not welcome in this bill is the draconian provision to allow for the imprisonment of registrars. As a practitioner, I sometimes fleetingly dreamt about the possibility of imprisoning a registrar or a judge when they made a wrong decision or asked me a question that I could not answer. But to seriously dwell on such a proposition would be absurd. To commit it to writing, and even worse into legislation, really does deserve the gold medal for absurdity.

         Unfortunately, it seems to me to be another example of a bureaucracy steamrolling the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and recommending a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But what is the nut? In this case, the penalty is directed at the wrongful disclosure of information provided under a location order by a registrar. The penalty is two years imprisonment. A tariff of two years is clearly out of kilter with the tariffs applied to other offences. Usually periods of imprisonment are legislated to act as a disincentive to act in a particular way. If a registrar did disclose improperly the location of a child then I am sure the loss of job that would undoubtedly flow from that would be a sufficient penalty in itself.

         In recent times, I find I have little to agree with the Chief Justice of the Family Court, but on this issue I am at one with him. He said in his submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee when talking about this proposed penalty:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This penalty is both unnecessary and objectionable, the Court objects strongly to it and points out that such a sanction is found nowhere else in the Family Law Act. The capacity in which Registrars will often deal with this type of information is in the exercise of delegated judicial power and it is particularly inappropriate that those with such power be liable to a criminal sanction arising out of its exercise. Under the Court's staff structure Registry Managers and not Registrars have line responsibility for registry staff and so for the recording and storage of Court records. The Registrar to whom the sanction would apply consequently has no capacity to direct the secure receipt, storage and handling of the information. Given the sensitive nature of the Court's records it is illogical that there be a criminal sanction in respect of the treatment of one type of information alone.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, I know of no basis on which such provision is justified. Court staff, except in the exercise of delegated judicial functions, are subject to the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. There is no indication that this type of information has been treated recklessly by Court staff or that the normal disciplinary provisions under that Act would be inadequate in the event that this did occur.

         Those of us who deal in the area of family law know that grandparents are often the backstop in marriage breakdown. It is very good for the children involved to have some stable relationship with a relative. Grandparents often baby-sit, undertake child minding and offer very real assistance in part of the lives of their grandchildren. Regrettably, when a marriage breaks up the in-laws quickly become the out-laws and access is denied to the grandparents. Whereas previously it was seen as beneficial for the children to have regular contact with their grandparents whilst the marriage was on foot, after a breakdown contact suddenly becomes impossible or too difficult, or the grandparents allegedly become too old or frail to look after the children properly.

I applaud that statement, but I have been waiting, frankly, for years to see any evidence of that assertion. I do not in any way reflect on the minister or on the intentions of the minister, but as things stand, the family is under attack.

         I have stood in this place time and time again to show that the average family, particularly those on one income, is far worse off now than it was in 1982. I know that there are figures now being bandied about by certain people who suggest that that is not the case. They tend to use NATSEM figures, which the authors of those reports and that research admit are incomplete. To give you one example, they take into account the effect of direct taxation; they do not take into account the effects that certain substantial increases in indirect taxation and in user charges are having on the family. Nor do they take into account the effects of payments that are made by the family for compulsory superannuation at a time of their lives when many of them can ill afford such payments.

         —These family law bills are the latest pieces of legislation introduced into the parliament in the context of the Family Law Act. They certainly will not be the last, because this is an area—as those who have spoken before me have made so clear—where you can never get it right because of the problems that come about when a couple divorces or separates. As has been said by both previous speakers this morning, Senator Abetz and Senator Harradine, this is an area where tragedy looms large, where there must be compassion for people going through the dreadful traumas that are no doubt related to the break up of a family.

         I agree with Senator Harradine that more should be done to see if a marriage can be preserved and, even before that, that the marriage sets out in a way that makes it last. I think what has to be changed is the culture of marriage. There is, I think, an understanding when people marry now that if things go a little harshly at times, then there is nothing much wrong with separating. I think that is a culture that has to change. Whether the government or we as legislators can do much about that, I do not know.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is quite clear that this is a very difficult area and we tend in those circumstances to blame particular individuals. I noticed this morning that Senator Harradine referred to the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alastair Nicholson. Senator McKiernan, whom I greatly admire, took him to task yesterday. May I say that I have known the Chief Justice for many years now and watched him, both on the Supreme Court of Victoria and on the Family Court of Australia. Given the difficulties that we have spoken about, it is my opinion that he has performed outstanding service on that court and that indeed he has performed outstanding service outside it. From that statement, I go on to say that other judges in the Family Court, both men and women, have done us proud as a nation in the way they have gone about the very difficult task that they have had to perform.

         In this context of giving praise, in the circumstances of the present legislation, another group that I think often gets criticised, and criticised unfairly, are the people from the Attorney-General's Department who actually have to get what we legislators think about and talk about into a form of legislation that comes before us. Oftentimes they are criticised for that, but I would have thought that the efforts by Mr Richard Morgan and Amanda Davies in this particular bill deserve commendation. They have had to go through a long and difficult period to get the legislation we presently have before us. I see Peter Trahair and others here this morning. He was more than gracious in giving me some help before I got to my feet to speak.

         Can I say about judges generally, because they are coming in for some criticism around the place, that they do perform great service to this country and in different areas. I was speaking this morning to my son Justin, who is an associate to the Deputy President of the Industrial Relations Court, Simon Williams. Again, he is a person who is in a very difficult area. With due respect to people who work in the industrial area, which I used to do myself, so I include myself in this, they do not have the difficulty that I think people who deal with the break-up of marriages do, but nevertheless, they have a most fundamental job to perform in this society, and they do it well. Certainly Deputy President Williams is one of those.

         One of the good bits of news in this legislation that everybody has commented on is the fact that we give special recognition to grandparents. May I commend Senator Harradine on being a grandparent. It is something that I unfortunately have been denied to this point of time. Certainly, in respect of my own mother-in-law, Lalla Gill, the one remaining grandparent of my children, inasmuch as they are good citizens of this country and decent people, it has much to do with her. In respect of two of them, who were born when my mother, Corrie Cooney, was alive, it had much to do with her as well.

         So I do mark the great importance of the role played by grandparents. In this culture of cohesion that we should try to develop to keep families together, grandparents and, indeed, the wider family play a very big role. We have to start concentrating on that idea of the wider family—people who are related getting together—and perhaps not be quite so nuclear as families seem to be these days.

         There has been a lot of deep, good thinking about this, much of which has been carried out by the people on the legal and constitutional committee—and Senator Abetz has played a great role in that. So has Senator Spindler who has put forward some amendments to this bill. I must confess that anything that Senator Spindler puts forward is a matter that I take most seriously.

         However, one matter that concerns me is the way Senator Spindler wants to go around the registering of parenting plans—and this has been dealt with in the debate so far. The idea is that if husband and wife are to break apart and they want to register a parenting plan as to how the children should be looked after, then they should be able to do so in the court.

         It is suggested in the amendments put forward by Senator Spindler that, if they are to do that, both parties have to get independent legal advice as to the meaning and effect of the agreement before entering into the agreement, the plan itself has to be certified by the legal practitioners who gave that advice, and the court has to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the party's child or children.

         That is a very good idea indeed, the thrust of which is that children should be protected—and nobody could doubt that. I would have thought that children should be protected whether or not their parents break up. I would have thought that children should be protected whether or not the parents register a parenting plan.

         It seems there is nothing peculiar in the act of registering a parenting plan which makes the children the subject of that parenting plan any more or less in need of help than any other child in the community, excepting perhaps that they are the people who are affected by the splitting up. But the very act of registration does not seem to have anything peculiar about it that should visit upon the process an examination by the court of that arrangement.

         As Mr Trahair told me as I came in, 95 per cent of the cases in the Family Court are settled. That would be consistent with what happens in courts generally—most disputes are settled. So the court deals with that small percentage, five per cent or less, of all disputes that come before it. I should have thought it was those disputes that ought to attract the court's attention because it is disputes that courts are about.

         In the end, the Family Court is a court. That means it has to resolve disputes between the parties. It is not there as a reservoir of social workers; it is not there as a reservoir of clergymen and women; it is not there as a reservoir of psychologists or psychiatrists; it is not there as a reservoir of people who want to do the right thing socially. The court is there to decide disputes between citizens—a task that has been going on since Australia was founded and in England, from which we get our legal system, for many centuries before that.

         It is my own view that, if you are going to have a legal system run by courts, the courts ought to act as courts and not in these other characters that I have spoken about.

         —I acknowledge with thanks Senator Abetz's interjection. If there is a dispute about the agreement, if there is a dispute whether an agreement should be entered into the first place or not and the matter should be disposed of by other means, then, of course, the courts should come into it. But I am concerned that taking away the great function and character of the court—which is, as it were, to stand above the parties; to let them put their case; and to have that case disposed of with parties introducing evidence and bringing their legal problems forward to be resolved by the court—is very dangerous not only for the Family Court but also for the whole legal system that has served us, in my view in any event, very well over the years.

         From a practical point of view, it seems to me to be taking us down a path that will be very expensive—in terms of the number of judges we would have to have as well as the buildings to house them and their staff—if we are going to require the court to be satisfied that the arrangements are likely to promote the best interests of the parties' child or children, as required by the Democrats' amendment. Indeed, it would seem to me there is little point in having an agreement if the court has to be satisfied that it is one that is likely to promote the best interests of the parties' child or children, because the court would have to have a full-scale hearing to satisfy itself that that was the situation.

         That leads us into two problems. Firstly, there is the overwhelming amount of resources that would be needed in terms of judges, buildings and things like that.

If the court has to call evidence to decide that, why not just hear the matter and make the decision itself?

         It could be argued, of course, that it is best for parties to agree and then for the court to look at that agreement to see whether it is proper. I go along with the point that it is best for parties to agree. Most people that split up—not all, but most—split up with sadness, no doubt, in their hearts but with sense in their heads and come to a proper arrangement. They ought to be able to pursue those arrangements that best suit them. If they do not, if there is a dispute, then the court ought to move in. But there ought to be a dispute before the court does so.

         If I can leave the bill with those few remarks, then I am well satisfied. It is a big issue and, as I said before, it is an issue that will be pursued hereafter. I think the present legislation is a right step, a proper step and a good step along the road. Unfortunately, with marriage breakups, I think it is very hard to make straight again the line that is bent. There is just so much difficulty in trying to get back to how things were before such a fundamental step as marriage—I see it as the most fundamental step—was, as it were, stopped from operating. That must leave tragedy in the heart. Unfortunately, marriage breakups must leave resentment at times, which sometimes even bubbles over to hatred. Those are emotions which do not make it easy for the Family Law Act to operate as people want—and it never will. But, given those parameters, I think the act does operate well.

         The emphasis on primary dispute resolution by non-litigation methods in the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 is very welcome. We support a consensual approach to dispute resolution in all areas of law. This is so in family law matters, where the parties often need to establish terms for ongoing cooperation, particularly if children are involved. Many parties continue to negotiate their own resolution, and it is to be hoped that the amendments to regulations, which have yet to be finalised, will facilitate self-help in filing for consent orders.

         I was reminded on many occasions during the discussion about the bill that some 95 per cent of divorce cases do not go to the court. That is a most encouraging situation. But we have to acknowledge that there remain many matters which will require professional help, and it is to be hoped that the primary dispute resolution methods which are a focus of the legislation will add to the structures available to people who are facing up to a marriage breakdown.

         The use of the term `primary dispute resolution' rather than `alternative dispute resolution' gives these services the priority they deserve. Similarly, we see the provisions for funding of counselling organisations and mediation organisations as worthy of support in principle, since they give a welcome emphasis to accessible, community-based dispute resolution services and reduce the focus on the institutions of the state with their tendency towards expense and complexity.

         We believe, therefore, that the whole bill should be evaluated in terms of what it achieves for access to justice. Despite the government's recent initiatives on access to justice, the practical difficulties for a substantial part of the population remain. In total, under present funding arrangements, despite the 1995-96 increases, primary dispute resolution services are inadequate to meet the need in terms of location, waiting periods and cost.

         There needs to be a large low cost network of primary dispute resolution providers so that everyone, irrespective of means or location of residence, is able to access them.

         The bill leaves the way open for individuals to provide mediation services in private practice. This is a welcome position subject to suitable funding being made available as per my comments earlier. However, using a mix of mediators, counsellors and arbitrators within court, community and private categories has implications for issues of immunity and accountability.

         Withholding immunity from private mediators and counsellors, as per the amendment foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats, would not be an issue if such people were accredited by the Family Court on the basis of skills and training. This would not prevent non-accredited persons mediating or counselling, and we accept that these non-accredited private mediators and counsellors should not have immunity conferred by this law. The government has advised that the regulations will set out appropriate guidelines within which private mediators must work and that their immunity will be limited to the extent to which they adhere to the regulations. While we would definitely prefer an accreditation structure, we are prepared to support the government's stance on this.

         With respect to the proposed part VII of the bill, the principles in section 60B(2) are ones which most parents today will support and work towards in their negotiations following separation. A minority will not. The question is, how should the law treat such situations? During discussion of the bill in the community there has rightly been an emphasis on ensuring that application of the principles does not compel a parent or a child to suffer abuse and violence after separation. There has been some recognition by the courts that in some circumstances the drastic step of depriving a parent of access is necessary for the protection of the child. This bill presents an opportunity to reinforce the protection given to those—whether children or parents—who may be subject to violence or abuse.

         In the bill there is recognition that not all matters are suitable for mediation.

Therefore, the Greens will be supporting a number of the Democrat amendments in this regard.

         However, we should recognise that the victims of violence are sometimes left without the means to go through litigation because of expense and a lack of legal aid funds. They are doubly victimised. I urge the government to consider a special allocation of funds for legal aid applicable to circumstances where the primary dispute resolution means are inappropriate and litigation is the only means of resolving issues.

Legal aid funding for this purpose has yet to catch up with the courts' recent decisions.

Cultural connections as provided by the government's amendment should be taken into consideration equally with a number of other factors with respect to the best interests of the child.

        We will also be putting amendments which would allow the court to assess the effectiveness of a parent's access when the likelihood exists that the parent providing accommodation to the child will move interstate or to faraway places. The fact is that some parents do decide to limit or prevent regular access by moving. Ulterior motives are difficult to prove but on occasions it seems that the right of the child is overridden by the selfish motivation of a parent. I do not refer here to situations where a parent flees in fear of spousal violence or in situations where they are concerned about the wellbeing of the child. I am referring to actions motivated by malice towards a former spouse. The child's best interests should not be overruled in instances of this kind.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In Western Australia, we are acutely aware that a move interstate or even from the south to the north of the state, let alone overseas, can make access prohibitively expensive. The practice has been to seek injunctions preventing this where the interests of the child, supported by expert evidence of, for example, counselling reports, suggest the child's need to retain regular contact with both parents.

Once again the members of this chamber have demonstrated their bipartisan approach to the resolution of the very difficult issues associated with family law.

         The family law legislation gives effect to a large part of the government's very positive response to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, in light of the further advice of the Family Law Council on the operation of UK's Children Act 1989. It is hoped that a bill to implement the second part of the government's response will be introduced later in the sittings.

         The point that was made by a number of speakers was the need for the government to monitor the effectiveness of the changed approach to issues affecting children. Everybody recognises that the old connotation of children being property needs to go. The government's approach takes that line. Large sections of the community currently deal with their children using the very principles that this bill is now enshrining. Unfortunately, there are members of the community who are not so enlightened and who continue to adhere to the notions of children as property.

         The government expects that community change for that segment which needs to change will take time. The government has contracted with the Australian Institute of Family Studies to undertake in the next few weeks a survey of community attitudes to the way in which we think about and treat children. That survey will form a benchmark for gauging community attitudes to the changes in a longitudinal study to be undertaken at a number of points over the next five years.

         Comment was also made of the need to regulate the qualifications and training of counsellors and mediators. Where the government is funding community counselling and mediation organisations, the government has had for some time criteria for approval of those organisations, including qualifications and professional development of individual counsellors and mediators. The Family Services Council will be providing advice on the appropriateness of these criteria as part of a review as a consequence of the increased reliance upon the primary dispute resolution emphasis in this bill.

         In relation to mediators there is not an agreed qualification or training which provides professional qualifications as a mediator. The government will be laying down broad guidelines for the delivery of mediation services and providing accountability for that delivery through consumer protection mechanisms. The Attorney-General's Department has currently distributed for comment to over 400 relevant professional, community and interested groups a discussion paper outlining the draft proposals in this regard.

         Senator Spindler's comments focused on his proposed amendments and in particular a prescriptive regime to deal with cases involving family violence and abuse. The government takes the view that this is the wrong approach and that the issues of whether or not particular primary dispute techniques should be utilised in a particular case is a matter for the professional judgment of the deliverer of the services. The government's approach is shared by the Family Law Council, which is a multidisciplinary body which considered the suggestion for the prescriptive regime made by the National Women's Justice Coalition which are embodied in the Democrats' amendments. In advising the Attorney-General in respect of the NWJC suggestion, the Family Law Council stated:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is the council's view that it is not appropriate for judges, registrars, legal practitioners and others to be making such mediation intake decisions. The proposal of the NWJC would impose a barrier pre-intake. Council considers that it would be most inappropriate for, say legal practitioners, to be saying to clients that mediation would not be appropriate in their case. Mediators are specially trained to properly address such questions and the matter should be left in their hands at the time of intake.

       <para>
        The government is pleased that a number of speakers expressed approval of the change in terminology adopted in this legislation to get away from the concepts of custody and access. I note that the Democrats intend to move amendments based on a suggestion of the NWJC to reinstate the existing system under another name. This system has been rightly criticised by most of the speakers in the debate because of the negative effect and the entrenchment of treating children as a possession.

         Some speakers in the debate have taken the view that the government's approach of allowing parents to work out their own solutions and arrangements in respect of children following the break-up of a relationship without the input of lawyers is an attack on the legal profession. Nothing could be further from the government's view in this matter. Parents should be able to obtain assistance from whoever they feel is appropriate in reaching decisions and developing their parenting plans. This may be lawyers, counsellors, mediators or other professionals. Parents should be able to expect that the decisions they arrive at will be respected within the community.

         Just as in intact families, governments and bureaucracies leave decision making about children to parents without any interference and/or intrusion unless the child comes to attention as needing protection of the state, so separated parents ought to be afforded the opportunity to decide arrangements for their children without intrusion from the law, the court, the legal profession or the government.

         The shadow Attorney-General's concern about registration of parenting plans is not shared by government. So long as the parties voluntarily comply with the plan, there is no intrusion. However, if one party does not comply or wishes to change the plan without the other's agreement, the court will then consider whether the arrangements are, at that later time, in the best interests of the child.

         Deputy President Reid correctly saw the need for parents to be given this flexibility to make agreements and not to have the court examine them to see whether it would agree to those arrangements. Experience shows that once parties are involved in the court system their flexibility in reaching solutions is reduced. The adversarial nature of litigation may lead to consideration of issues or the taking of positions more suited to an adjudicated position rather than a solution which they can consider to be their own.

         Finally, the debate has raised clause 67P of the bill, which makes provision for penalty to be imposed on court officials who intentionally or recklessly disclose information about the location of a person where that information has been located under a location order. The person seeking a location order needs to convince the court that there is a proper reason for the issuing of such an order. In many cases the need to locate has arisen because the parent with the child has gone into hiding to avoid family violence or abuse. The providing of information to the abuser in those circumstances reduces the protection that that parent has sought. The government is concerned to ensure that protection from family violence is not diminished by the actions of court processes or improper disclosure of information. Clause 67P as it stands will achieve that purpose. I commend the bill to the Senate.

        These amendments set out the relevant factors that are to be taken into account by the court and by other persons, for instance, legal practitioners and counsellors, when they are considering what primary dispute resolution mechanisms, if any, may be suitable for the parties. The Democrats felt that it was important to have the factors that are to be taken into account transparent in the bill, on the face of it, bearing in mind that what is in the bill very often sets the climate and influences the understanding of people who are in court or who are dealing with a dispute, are seeking to make a decision and are seeking to be advised as to whether a primary dispute resolution mechanism is suitable for them or whether they should proceed to court.

         The factors that the Democrats believe should be taken into account are, first of all, the degree of equality or otherwise in the bargaining power of the parties, the risk of child abuse, the risk of family violence, the emotional and psychological state of the parties, whether one of the parties may be seeking to use a primary dispute resolution method possibly to gain delay or to achieve some other advantage, and any other relevant matter.

         This is also the view of many women's organisations which have contacted us. No doubt they have contacted other people as well, including the Attorney-General's department. They are concerned that in many situations it is the woman who could be at a disadvantage in these proceedings. They have suggested very strongly that it is necessary to set the tone in the bill and to warn all the parties in this process that these matters should be taken into account. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

         We see the move by the Democrats as an unnecessary encumbrance to the process. In essence, we have amendments which seek to insert into the act sections relevant to primary dispute resolution methods. The factors are currently contained in order 25A, rule 5. This rule applies to court mediators and specifies the factors that a mediator must consider when determining whether a dispute is appropriate for mediation.

         The amendments would require the court to give detailed consideration to these factors. In essence, that would mean that the primary dispute resolution methods which might be available would not be available, if these amendments were passed, until an advanced stage of the proceedings. It is important for us that the primary dispute resolution methods be considered early in the process. We see that the move by Senator Spindler could mean in many instances that would not be the case.

         We do anticipate problems in terms of people being denied those primary dispute resolution methods at an early stage. This would have an important impact on the process. We recognise it is important to tread warily in this area. The Attorney-General's Department has prepared a discussion paper on the proposed regulatory requirements to apply to mediators. The paper proposes that before conducting a mediation the mediator should consider the factors that Senator Spindler seeks to have inserted. The paper also gives a higher priority to safety and violence issues than the amendments do. We think that the factors should be taken into account earlier. As a consequence, we oppose Senator Spindler's move at this stage.

With respect to your first point that sometimes legal practitioners would have the screening role, it would probably put them sometimes in an invidious position to determine whether or not to provide information and whether or not to invoke those primary dispute resolution mechanisms. It would, I am sure, create problems, particularly for those who might be self-represented. So there are those sorts of mechanical problems with your amendment.

I take the opportunity of asking the minister, because this is the appropriate time, what the government's view is on looking at the sessional payment of private mediators and counsellors and at the fact that there is inadequate funding available. So there are two matters. One is any provisions the government might have in mind for increasing the level of funding in the light of the changes that are being made, which are very welcome. We believe it is desirable that people should have greater access to primary dispute resolution processes. So the first question relates to funds and the absolute necessity to address that funding need. If we are going to bring new measures within the reach of people then we ought to allow them the capacity to take them up.

In respect to payments, my understanding is that people do pay on an income basis and that money goes to counselling organisations. The justice statement, you might remember, also allocated extra resources for counselling in this area.

         —While you are seeking to answer that question, I might spell out a little more detail for the ease of the people providing the answer. Basically, the Greens see the need to permit sessional payment of private mediators and counsellors. Family Court counselling services, we think, should not only be a direct provider of services and should not be the only point for services but a point of contact at which primary dispute resolution, if the client is suitable, is guaranteed irrespective of means, and I understand that the minister is looking at the means.

         I think the way in which that funding is given is also of concern. If the court itself, or an approved counselling or mediation organisation is unavailable, then the client should be able to be referred to a private mediator or counsellor. But, for the system to work, maybe this bill should be amended to provide, firstly, a system of accreditation and, secondly, to provide for payment on a sessional basis, albeit with partial cost recovery or means testing of the client. I know that has not been proposed, but I seek the minister's advice on it because I believe that mediation services would then be much more widely available. This is of particular importance to country residents who may have to travel considerable distances to attend the Family Court or a community mediation service but who may have an accredited mediator—whether, for example, a lawyer or a social worker—in the vicinity.

         I think the family law is a discrete area in which it would be relatively simple to establish an accreditation system administered by the Family Court. The Supreme Court of Western Australia has a panel of accredited mediators for civil disputes, so there is no reason why the Family Court should not do likewise. I think the restrictions of this bill, which place restrictions on funding counselling and mediation organisations—that is, that the whole or substantial part of the organisation's activities be family counselling or mediation respectively—will thus be overcome, and funds could be distributed to any accredited primary dispute resolution provider in accordance with the amount of family law mediation provided. That would expand the network of services quite greatly.

         So, in putting that to the minister, I point out that I would like to see those matters responded to by the government. The Greens are not putting up amendments to that effect; we see the amendments put up by the Democrats as addressing similar concerns but not exactly tackling them in that way, so we would like a government response to these suggested improvements. No doubt the government has been lobbied in this area and may already have a view, but it would be good to have this added to this committee consideration.

What I can say, as is reflected in this legislation, is that the government has recognised the three different tiers of counselling provision—court, community based and private. With respect to the justice statement which I mentioned earlier, an extra $12 million over four years has been provided for court and community-based counselling services. The private ones are not being assisted in that way, and that is obviously your concern. It is one that we cannot accommodate at this particular time.

         Accreditation in the absence of a national body, as you will realise, is difficult. What we are doing with this particular legislation is approaching the need for standards and performance benchmarks by having regulations in place and, further on during the course of some of the amendments, I think we will be discussing the way that regulations cover, for instance, private counselling services. That is the way the government thought best to achieve the best balance of providing and encouraging the interplay of the three levels of counselling.

        This amendment will delete a government proposal to extend immunity from suit presently enjoyed by approved mediators and arbitrators to those private mediators and arbitrators who do not enjoy any form of accreditation, in other words, private mediators. With the bill's greater promotion of primary dispute resolution, the number of mediators in private practice will obviously increase, leading to a real risk of an increase in inadequately trained and unsupervised mediators.

         In this bill the government is proposing to provide total immunity to these private mediators despite there being no comprehensive system of regulation or accreditation in place. It seems to the Australian Democrats that we are rather premature in doing that unless and until we have a proper system of accreditation in place. I would have hoped that the government would support this amendment and realise that it was trying to rush into matters a little too quickly. It seems to me that to extend total immunity to private mediators is not the way to go at the moment.

I find the intent of the amendment, that we give the capacity to those fronting up to mediation to be able to sue their mediators, somewhat incongruous. As I said in the second reading debate, in the past family lawyers have in fact been pretty immune from negligence claims, whereas now unfortunately they are starting to come in. Most of them are based on those situations where, in smaller towns or practices, a husband and wife have come in together seeking the assistance of the one lawyer to tie up the loose ends, to get a quick response. They want it fair, they want it cheap. But then, after the fullness of time, bitterness takes over and one of them cries foul.

         As a result, the cost of these agreements is now becoming a lot more expensive because no lawyer will ever again, I would assume, act for both sides in a dispute because they do not have that protection from being sued.

         To say that a private mediator ought be submitted to that sort of possible legal challenge really pulls the rug out from underneath any private mediation service playing a useful role at this stage. I should have thought that, with the increase in mediation that we want to see, we ought be encouraging private mediators. If we want to encourage mediators, we do need to provide them with a protection so that they can go about their job without fear or favour, or the concern that they may be sued at a later stage when they have acted within the best interests of everybody but one of the parties does not consider it to have been within his or her best interests.

It is different to the atmosphere one gets in litigation where you have advocates contesting each other. In the sphere of mediation you have an environment where things are said in a candid and forthright fashion in an effort to try to sort things out and different rules apply. When you are at that stage, it is on a without prejudice basis, so that what either party says to the other cannot be held against the other party.

         Here, we are talking about the question of removing the immunity from suit for private mediators. Senator Abetz asked for me to give an account of how the law will operate. I will do that. I think it is worth putting on record that section 19M of the Family Law Act does provide that any approved mediator has the same protection and immunity as a judge of the Family Court. This means that the mediator, in performing the functions of a mediator, is protected from civil suits such as defamation, negligence and related matters such as breach of confidence. Under the bill, it is proposed to extend the immunity to all categories of mediators—to court mediators, to community mediators and to private mediators.

         The proposed amendments of Senator Spindler's to section 19M would discriminate against private mediators by removing the immunity from this category of mediators. I must say in passing that if there is anything that would act against encouraging private mediators in this area, it would be this set of amendments together with the next set that Senator Spindler is to move. It is important that the immunity protection be extended to all categories of mediators, to facilitate the greater use of mediation to resolve family law disputes. It is a major plank of the bill, a plank to which Senator Vanstone, Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison have referred.

         If immunity is not extended to private mediators, they may decline to take on family law mediation. This could lead to problems in accessing mediation for family law disputes. It could mean the shift to greater use of dispute resolution mechanisms is not able to be achieved. One of the fundamental objectives of the bill could be undermined.

         Private mediation, we should keep in mind, would be subject to regulations. These regulations would provide for consumer protection requirements to be met. If met, the mediator would then be able to rely on confidentiality provisions in the bill, such as proposed section 19N. It provides that anything said during a mediation which is conducted in accordance with the regulations cannot be used in evidence in later proceedings, subject to an exception for domestic violence matters and for serious criminal offences. So the Democrats have moved an amendment with respect to this, and we will be getting to that aspect later.

         Senator Ellison, I think it was, raised the question of monitoring how this part of the bill would operate. It is something the government is keen to do. We will ask the Family Services Council and the proposed ADR advisory council to examine the operation of the regulations to see, for instance, whether further consumer protection provisions such as the imposition of penalties or any other matters are necessary. We recognise that it is important to keep an eye on this area but, reflecting what others have said earlier, if this amendment is carried one of the major objectives of the bill could be undermined. I hope, Senator Abetz, I have placed on record the information you requested.

We are not trying to remove immunity for court mediators or community mediators—in other words, mediators that are offered to the public by voluntary organisations as well as by the courts. The minister really confirmed what I said before and that is that, under these provisions, anybody can put out a shingle and say, `I'm a mediator.' The government is prepared to extend total immunity to those people.

         The minister is saying that there will be other provisions under consumer protection legislation. That is fine and I welcome those. If those provisions were on the table maybe that would change our view. It is possible that they would offer adequate protection. However, they are not on the table for us to consider. The government has not offered us any protections. They are certainly not in this bill or in the main bill.

         What the government proposes to do is let loose on the community people who are not qualified. Certainly their qualifications will not be checked. Anybody can do this and you are prepared to extend total immunity to them. I really fail to see the logic of that argument. I do not believe that the Senate should pass legislation which places the risks associated with this procedure entirely on the consumers who are going through a very traumatic stage in their lives.

I think the government has sufficiently outlined the safeguards for the community in ensuring that these mediation organisations will be appropriate and will be qualified. They have to be approved by the minister.

         The new section 13C states that certain standards must be met by any such organisation. The minister has said that, prior to the enactment of the bill, these regulations dealing with the whole process of accreditation will be in place. We are not unleashing unqualified people on the community. We are not unleashing on the community any social experiment which could perhaps go drastically wrong and cause great social damage. I do not believe that it is in that context at all.

         I believe the government has indicated in the first instance sufficient safeguards in relation to this whole question of mediation, both to the mediators themselves and to the community at large, that are quite balanced. Therefore, I think that any argument that this might be some sort of social experiment—that we look at it and see how it goes—is unfounded. I think there are adequate safeguards here for the community. I take on board the minister's comments, and welcome them, that this aspect of mediation will be monitored by the government, and monitored continuously.

         —The government essentially opposes this amendment for much the same reasons as the ones that have already been discussed in relation to the earlier amendment. At this stage I will answer the point that Senator Harradine's raised earlier. He linked the issue of the confidentiality of discussions between husbands and wives before counsellors with the issue of admissibility in evidence of other discussions or communications between husbands and wives. Whether discussions between husbands and wives would be admissible in evidence will depend on the application of the rules of evidence in proceedings before the Family Court. They are set out in the Evidence Act. There has been some discussion of them in deliberations on this bill.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A related issue is whether a husband or wife can compel his or her spouse to give evidence of a communication made between them during their marriage. Section 100 of the Family Law Act provides that parties to a marriage are competent and compellable to disclose such communication. There is here a fundamental difference between the confidentiality provisions in the act relating to discussions before counsellors and the compellability of spouses to disclose marital communications in family law proceedings.

         In respect of the former, the confidentiality provisions encourage candour and frankness during the conciliation stages of court proceedings. Without such provisions, subsequent court proceedings would be able to traverse matters discussed and statements made during conciliation conferences. One can very readily understand the impact of this. The compellability of spouses prevents, once conciliation efforts have not secured the settlement of Family Court proceedings, one spouse being able to frustrate the presentation of the case of the other by refusing to give evidence of statements made to each other during the marriage.

         It is worth placing on notice for the Senate that this compellability aspect of evidence law has been Commonwealth policy for over 30 years. It is reflected in section 100 of the Family Law Act, and it reflects the pre-existing provisions of subsection 97(3) of the now repealed Matrimonial Causes Act 1959. So for a long time this compellability question has been reflected in that legislation. The confidentiality of provisions in respect of proceedings before counsellors is quite different from that. Having said that, the government feels that the Democrats amendments would, in essence, frustrate the private counselling and mediation service in a way that we do not accept.

        These amendments are similar to amendments that I have moved earlier in this chamber and relate to the requirement to take account of the degree of equality or otherwise in the bargaining power of parties, the risk of child abuse, the risk of family violence and so on when arrangements are under consideration for interviews and for other meetings that are to be arranged by legal practitioners, mediators and counsellors.

The first is that when any parenting plan is going to be registered by the court it will be signed by the parties; a copy of the plan will be submitted for registration and accompanied by a statement in relation to each party to the effect that the party has been provided with independent legal advice as to the meaning and effect of the plan; it will be signed by the legal practitioner who provided that advice; and, lastly, the court is to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child.

         —The importance of both parties receiving advice is this: it is well understood by anyone with an interest in family law matters that it is frequently the case that one party comes to any negotiations in a much weaker position than others, and I know that even the minister would not disagree with that. We are certainly of the view that if parties, husband and wife who are now separating and divorcing, want to come to their own arrangements and do not want to have any association with the Family Court, fine, they can come to their own arrangements and make whatever plans they want with respect to their parenting. But, once they come and want the imprimatur in any way of the court, and there are any consequences that flow from registration, then it is important that each of those parties have independent advice as to the consequences of what they are doing.

         It is important that each party gets independent advice. The party who comes to the negotiations in a weaker position may well, for a whole variety of reasons, agree to a plan that subsequently they want to undo with all the consequent difficulties. I understand the argument that says, `Look, when parents are agreeing we should let them agree and not have the bureaucracy or the court interfering'—and that is right. But it is not the court that is stretching its arm out here and saying, `If you come to some agreement you must come and register it with us'; it is people who want to avail themselves of the court and register their plan. On that basis I think it is fair enough to say, `Look, each party should have separate advice; one is definitely going to be stronger than the other, and it is important that both parties at the time of agreeing to that plan understand the consequences of what they are doing'.

         The analogy has been drawn by a number of people between parenting plans being registered and consent orders. Amendment 63D(1)(c) combined with 63D(1) and (2), as I am advised, will put the registration of these plans and the court's consideration thereof in the same category as consent orders. There is some difficulty in saying that a Family Court which obviously has the interests of the children at heart will simply register a plan without even having the slightest interest in the contents thereof, that a plan could be registered by two weirdos, or one weirdo and a weaker party who was an absolute disaster, and the court would in any event just register it. The court has to have some interest in this matter, otherwise why is its name being lent to the plan by virtue of its registration?

         —Like Senator Vanstone, I am not quite sure why we are dealing with this amendment out of order, because I was dealing with amendments 11 and 12 and we have jumped to Democrat amendment No. 25. However, be that as it may, the amendment moved by Senator Vanstone is identical to the first part of the Democrats' amendment in that it requires that a parenting plan should be signed by the parties; the copy of the plan should be accompanied by a statement certifying that each of them has had independent legal advice; and the court should be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child.

         I am grateful to Senator Vanstone for putting such an eloquent and erudite argument in favour of these provisions, because it is quite clear that this is a very basic, major issue. Should we treat children as chattels? Should we allow parents to make arrangements without the court or anyone else really assessing whether the prime purpose of the Family Law Act—namely, that it should operate to preserve and promote the best interests of the child as a priority—has been taken care of in that particular aarrangement or agreement?

         This is why the Democrats put forward that amendment. In discussing it with Senator Vanstone, as she said, she basically agreed with that, but is suggesting an additional subsection which says that the court may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsection 68F(2). That is a slight softening of the provision; it does not lock the court into a lengthy proceeding and I am certainly prepared to accept that—I think it is useful.

         Finally, subsection (3), the other section that Senator Vanstone is adding, says that the rules of the court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court. That also is useful. There has been quite a lot of discussion about how the court can best handle this. Suggestions were made of devising checklists which perhaps the registrar can deal with at first instance, and only when the registrar is unhappy after a fairly automatic check of a checklist is it brought to the attention of the court as a whole.

         That provision too, as a machinery provision, promotes the acceptance of the basic principle that the court has a responsibility to ensure that the interests of the child are at all times given priority and are safeguarded by the court. We should not allow the court or the government to say, `We will not take account of that responsibility. We will allow people to make whatever arrangements they wish and we are prepared to stamp it with a court's approval, as it were, by registering it.'

         I know that people say that the court will become involved if one of the parties comes back to the court and says, `The other party is not performing. We want to enforce it.' But the reality is that most people will not do that. They take the view that an agreement has been made, the court has stamped it, it is a semi-official document and, `We will not disturb it', unless the circumstances are very extreme indeed. It seems to us that that precaution should be taken not when there is a complete breakdown of the agreement, but when the court is asked to rubber stamp it and to say, `This is an enforceable agreement.'

Looming in that is possible unlawful behaviour and even criminal activities.

         The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee now has a specific reference on Bond University for early examination and report. The immediate concern of that reference is the proposed major shift in the way in which higher education is offered in Australia. That issue cannot be allowed to go by default. Any move to allow public universities to operate or in any way become involved in private universities must be a compromise of the traditional charter of free, secular and public education which has existed in Australia for decades.

         I note reports that the university has tendered $109 million for the land and buildings of the Bond University project and has taken the Delfin Property Group to develop the land which is surplus to university requirements. The University of Queensland is reported as regarding its projected investment in Bond University and its operation of Bond University as being outside the public purview. It needs to be said that there is simply no money, nor are there any assets, under the control of the University of Queensland which do not belong to the public register. It is simply nonsense to say, as has been reported in the media, that public funds are not involved.

         The reports suggest that the university will still have to find about $80 million for the campus segment. At current market rates such a borrowing would mean an annual interest bill of over $8 million. Since start-up in 1989, Bond University's recurrent accounts show a series of heavy losses, even though the university paid nothing towards its establishment nor any annual charge in respect of the land and buildings it occupies. The short-term gain from the cost cutting in which Bond has recently engaged may be at the expense of long-term viability and therefore merely costs deferred. Bond is massively in debt—some $94 million—though this debt has been subordinated and is no immediate burden.

         Bond's 1994 company returns, having this somewhat unreal basis, show an operating `profit' of some $6.4 million. But allowance needs to be made for the recurrent costs—rates and the like—on the land and buildings now met by the Japanese companies in receivership. These may be as much as $3 million per annum. This would mean only $3.4 million per annum towards interest charges of over $8 million. This makes no allowance for the impact of additional costs for additional infrastructure, nor does it make any allowance for diminution in student numbers which might follow a change in the character of the university.

That, of course, is something the government has said emphatically it will not accept. However, if one turns to the wider context, it is not difficult to sense how this financial backdrop has come about, how Bond University has come to this difficult juncture.

         Bond University is a surprising creation—a singular and atypical flowering out of the entrepreneurial excesses and misdeeds of the 1980s. Its unlikely genesis was as a land development catalyst created by two notable corporate high-fliers of that time, Mr Alan Bond and Mr Harunori Takahashi. Mr Bond became bankrupt and served time in prison; Mr Takahashi did not face any bankruptcy process but is now embroiled in criminal indictment in Tokyo for breach of trust and fraud.

         By January 1991, the game was up for the Australian Bond Corporation. It also appeared to be up for Japan's EIE International—Mr Takahashi's vehicle. The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, as EIE's leading creditor, had moved in its own officers and taken charge of EIE's small headquarters in Tokyo and thence its huge operations elsewhere. Curiously, the bank seems to have left Mr Takahashi to go about freely—his lifestyle not much disrupted. Mr Bond's creditors were less kind.

         The true relationship of Mr Takahashi and his EIE corporation with the Long Term Credit Bank is a matter of some conjecture. Certainly it is a curious relationship for a bank, given Mr Takahashi's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his incredible appetite for borrowings for grandiose risky investments. Mr Takahashi is rumoured to have some family connections with senior officials of the bank. Whatever of that, such were his powers of persuasion with the Long Term Credit Bank that his Australian subsidiary, EIE Australia, alone accumulated debts to the bank of around $1 billion.

         I find it astounding that, despite the publicised bankrupt state of EIE International and the known fact of the Japanese bank's officers controlling its operations, our Foreign Investment Review Board gave approval for EIE Australia to purchase the Australian half-share of the Bond project partnership. This is the more remarkable since at that time, December 1991, an Australian group—and I understand one of the recent contenders for Bond University—was actively seeking to buy these assets. This was known to the bank's officers. The administration of Bond Corporation had wished to sell to the Australian group but the Japanese partner, by then the Long Term Credit Bank, withheld agreement. It is to be noted here that EIE and Mr Takahashi had come under regulatory scrutiny by the Tokyo stock exchange and the Japanese ministry of finance as far back as 1989.

         The parliament and the Australian community deserve to be told why the Foreign Investment Review Board gave such an approval and on what representations and documentation. The Long Term Credit Bank action which followed is even more bizarre. The agents of the bank, for it was the bank calling the shots, acted in a brutal fashion to force out of office the independent members of the Bond University governance, on the university company and the council, and to replace them with the bank's nominees. Whether all requirements of the Queensland act and the memorandum and articles were met in this case is another question. I think it outrageous that a private Australian university, operating independently under an act of the Queensland parliament, could have been thus treated by a large and reputable Japanese bank—one of Japan's most prestigious.

         Having busied itself with the new governance of Bond over the next 18 months, the bank suddenly changed tack. In Japan at that point, the bank reportedly walked away from EIE International—though, curiously, EIE is still trading. It has been alleged that the bank has continued to be involved and to support the company through the back door. The latest Australian Securities Commission return for EIE Australia—for 1994, but signed in Tokyo by Mr Takahashi in May this year—shows known bank people as directors: Mr Ogawa and Mr Yaginuma. The unfortunate young Mr Yaginuma suicided in January 1994 in ominous circumstances.

         What we can say with certainty is that in August 1993 the bank put into receivership the EIE Australia subsidiaries Limgold, Nista and Jadekent, which held the land and buildings of the Bond University project. The bank did not put EIE Australia into receivership even though that company was massively in its debt. Nor did the bank attempt to put the Bond University company into receivership. It seems that the bank was inhibited by a subordination deed drawn in May 1990 between Limgold and the university company. The terms of that deed made virtually worthless the bank's security of the university debt of nearly $100 million. Spice is added here by the fact that the Japanese subsidiary Limgold and the university company—the authors of the deed—had, and continued to have, certain common directors, including Mr Takahashi.

After receivers were appointed to the Japanese subsidiaries in August 1993, the nature and active personnel of the governance of Bond University appear to have changed. According to a Queensland Supreme Court writ lodged on 28 September 1995 by the Bond University company, its board members ceased after August to be agents of the Japanese defendant, the EIE subsidiary, Limgold.

         The 1994 company returns for Bond University Ltd mention Japanese directors—Mr Oba; Mr Lievre, as alternate for Mr Oba; and the inevitable Mr Takahashi—as directors when the 1994 returns were lodged; namely, on 22 September 1995. These are the directors of Bond University Ltd, along with Messrs Wran and Turnbull, and Professors Messel and Farrar. This is the company which is negotiating with the University of Queensland for the takeover of Bond University. Excepting Professor Farrar, all these were directors at the time of the changeover in August 1993, as was a further Japanese director—the unfortunate Mr Yaginuma. Mr Takahashi, as it happened, did not attend any board meetings in 1994. He had his own problems in Tokyo.

         —I do say, however, that the process of the sale of the Bond project land and buildings has not diminished the bizarre quality of the whole saga. To mention just one aspect of the sale, there is a bid from the present governance of the Bond University company—whatever be the standing of that governance. It is a bid to buy the assets from the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan when the Bond University company is massively in debt to the bank, when the bank's nominees are seemingly on the board of the university company, and when that company has directors in common with the companies in receivership. In this whole matter there is a smell—a smell wafting all the way from the Gold Coast to Tokyo. In Australia's interests, the air needs to be cleared. It can be cleared by a thorough inquiry and prompt, resolute government action. There is certainly a case for Australian regulatory authorities to be called to account.

         I conclude by observing that the federal Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) only last week sounded an ominous note. Speaking on the Gold Coast he said that since 1991 the Japanese government has been trying to crack down on the Yakuza crime gangs. Mr Kerr is reported as citing intelligence reports to say that at least 28 Yakuza and associates from seven major gangs travelled to this country on at least 65 occasions between 1989 and 1993. How many have visited Australia during 1994 and 1995?.

         My main purpose in speaking is to make a plea to the media in Australia. That plea is for them to become more aware of the customs, traditions and general way of life of our Asian neighbours. The plea, however, goes further. Having become aware of our neighbours' customs, let us all—and my plea is principally to Australia's media—respect the way of life in those countries and not act in a way which is likely to offend. This should be a normal courtesy, but there is an overriding national concern: if we are to be accepted by Asian countries as a nation worthy of their respect, we must extend our respect to them. We should acknowledge that we have customs which are different from those which prevail in other countries and that many of our customs may be regarded as strange by our Asian neighbours. Just as we would hope that our way of life is respected so, too, do our neighbours expect that we will show respect to them.

         Many honourable senators would be aware of my interest in the welfare of Australian citizens who are held in overseas prisons. My interest was aroused when I was approached by two Queensland constituents whose daughter was imprisoned in Thailand. Before I visited this lady in prison, I must admit that I was thinking of her welfare alone. Within minutes of entering the prison, I realised that the issue was far wider than I had thought. There were, at that time, four Australian women in that prison and I later became aware of Australian men who were imprisoned in the same city, two of whom I visited in two separate prisons. I have since had contact with other parents and friends whose loved ones are imprisoned in the same country and other countries.

         Because Australia has not established a transfer scheme for international prisoners, the only way prisoners in Thailand can return to Australia is to complete their sentence or receive a royal pardon. Such a pardon is not royal in name only. It is very much a pardon which is granted by His Majesty the King of Thailand.

         Towards the end of last year, negotiations in relation to Mary Smith were at a crucial and delicate stage. I was dismayed when an officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told me that an offensive cartoon had appeared in the

The King is held in great esteem in Thailand and any insult to the King is a very serious offence. I could understand the Thais' displeasure and I believe an officer from the Australian embassy in Bangkok was officially informed of this displeasure. I knew immediately that the publication of this cartoon would make the negotiations for Miss Smith's release more difficult.

        The Principal Private Secretary raised his concern over a newspaper report about a recent Royal Pardon granted to an Australian prisoner jailed on drug trafficking charges.

Senator Colston indicated that he, too, had been embarrassed by the press coverage and had considered writing to the newspaper concerned. He had rejected this idea, however, fearing that such a letter could lead to an escalation of the matter. Senator Colston stated that the Australia press is not subject to direction by the government. He expressed his confidence that the Smiths would not provide any comment to the media, should Ms Smith be granted a Royal Pardon. ML Thawisan said that he would advise His Majesty the King accordingly.

         It is obvious that some sections of our media need to devote more time to understand the way of life of our geographic neighbours. If they do that and, having understood, I would hope that they do not act as cultural philistines but, rather, respect our neighbours to the north. The Australian media has a powerful influence within our country. However, its influence extends beyond our shores and, properly used, it can cement good relations with other nations. If, in the future, any media representatives are tempted to show how clever they are by lampooning some aspect of another nation's culture, I would hope that they would think of the possible consequences and extend the same courtesy as we would expect from others.

         Let me run through for honourable senators the arguments which have been proposed by those who support a republic in these shores. The arguments can basically be boiled down to three. The first is that they believe that Australia should have an Australian head of state. The second reason they espouse is that we should become a republic to become more like our neighbours in Asia. The third reason which is advanced is that we should somehow become a republic because the current constitutional arrangements are irrelevant to a nation of increasingly ethnic diverse population.

         Let me deal with each of those three points in order. The fact is that we do have an Australian head of state—an Australian head of state both in title and in effect. The constitution of this nation says very clearly that the Queen is the head of state as Queen of Australia. In fact, it is interesting that that title, the style of that title, was conferred on the Queen by an act of parliament under a Labor government. It was not under a coalition government but under a Labor government—in fact, under the Labor government of the Hon. Gough Whitlam.

Those who say that our current constitutional arrangements show that we are not a truly sovereign and independent nation do an injustice to this parliament. They do an injustice to the institution of the Senate and to the institution of the House of Representatives, because it is here, within these walls, that the future of our nation is decided by Australians and for Australians, and no amount of saying otherwise will change that simple fact.

         It is spurious indeed that those who propose a republic say that we have to have a republic to become a sovereign and independent nation. In fact, a leading republican proponent, Mr Barry Jones, said, in the House of Representatives in 1987 after the passage of the Australia Act, that, with the passage of the Australia Act, Australia was finally a sovereign and independent nation. This is a matter of fact; it is a matter of record. Yet, Mr Barry Jones and other republicans now seek to change their views on this issue. Of course, the fact is that Australia is independent under our current constitutional arrangements and will always remain so.

         The titular head of Australia, the Governor-General, is an Australian by virtue of the constitution. People who have recently criticised the Governor-General for his trip to Turkey had to concede the fact that the Governor-General went to Turkey, to Gallipoli, as head of state—as the effective Australian head of state—and he is recognised as such around the world. For those same people to say that, for some reason, we are considered overseas to be something less than independent is to be less than honest with the facts. The facts are these: Australia is seen around the world as a nation beholden to nobody. It is the cringe of the republican movement which does damage to this nation's sovereignty and independence, not our current constitutional arrangements.

         The republicans then trot out their next argument. They say that we have to be a republic so that we can be part of South-East Asia or part of Asia. This is a very interesting argument because it is not an argument that you hear republicans and the government espousing when they go to Japan and meet with the emperor. It is not an argument that you find republicans espousing when they go to Thailand and meet with the king. It is not an argument that you find republicans espousing in Malaysia or Brunei. In fact, earlier this year, I shared a very pleasant evening: a dinner with Senator Gareth Evans and the sister of the Sultan of Brunei. It would have been spurious for Senator Gareth Evans to say that Australia wanted to become a republic to be more like the people in Brunei, and I think he recognised this.

         So when republicans espouse their third great argument for a republic—that this nation is increasingly more ethnically diverse—they miss the point as to why people choose to come to this country after all.

         There are two problems that republicans have to answer: how will the republic work; and, secondly, how can it make this democratic nation any more democratic than it is at the moment?

What a wonderful suggestion. It is wonderful until one remembers the fact that the House of Representatives and the Senate cannot even agree on mutual times for lunch, let alone who would be the head of state. What an absurd situation. At best, two-thirds of parliament would be in agreement between whoever happened to be Prime Minister and whoever happened to be the Leader of the Opposition.

We want you to vote in a referendum to achieve that change. But, having achieved that change, we don't trust you to choose who will be the president.' That is the delicious irony.

         Even if you could get two-thirds of both houses to elect a president, there are enormous problems that flow from the power of that parliament to sack a president. If a parliament can make, a parliament can unmake. Let us not forget that the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, is the protector, not of the opposition from the government, but of the people from the parliament.

         Suppose a situation arose in which both sides of parliament decided they were going to gag the media because they did not like the media running stories about politicians expenses, the bill duly passed parliament, it went to the president and the president refused to sign. What happens then? The same two-thirds that got together and voted the bill through parliament could get together and vote to sack the president to have their way. The president, of course, could always dissolve parliament. What happens? Who determines who has priority? Is it the president's writ of dissolution, or is it the vote of the same two-thirds of the parliament that appointed the president and want to close down the criticism by the media of the politicians? Which is it?

         Republicanism, in this fashion, offers only one thing, and that is the constant threat of constitutional crisis. This is the grave failing of the republican case. They cannot make this system any more democratic than it is because, in truth, the only great power held by the Governor-General is the power, in the event of crisis, to dissolve the parliament and return the parliamentarians to answer to the people. Nothing could be more democratic than that. Anything else means that, at a time of crisis, the ultimate decision does not lie with the people but lies with some self-elected or self-appointed elite. In truth, the great challenge for our constitution in the future is to make the constitution more democratic, not to erode the fundamental strengths that make this nation a great democracy.

         So I say to those in the republican movement that their contribution to discussion is welcome but they must, to have the support of the Australian people, offer an alternative which is truly democratic, and not merely an excuse to entrench the power of a self-elected oligopoly. This nation is one of the greatest nations in the world and we tamper with those freedoms at our risk.

         —I wish to speak today on the subject of Western Australian industrial relations legislation, in particular what is referred to as the first wave of industrial legislation introduced by the Court Liberal government. In doing so, I want to continue some remarks I commenced last night in the adjournment debate, which go to the detailing of workers' experiences in Western Australia under that legislation. I do so because I think the relevance is obvious. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, is on the record as indicating his support for that legislation and saying that the policy applied in Western Australia would form the basis of federal policy. On 28 July 1995, Mr Howard said:

        I would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition government has implemented in Western Australia.

        I make it clear here that Mr Howard was referring to the first wave of IR legislation, and that is also the subject of my discussion today. Last night, I detailed a comparison of the workplace agreement put in place at TAFE colleges in Western Australia for cleaners employed by Linfoot Cleaning Services, comparing that to their old award. For the subject of today's contribution, I will refer to that as workplace agreement A. I want to provide for the Senate today details of comparisons of further workplace agreements and the relevant award. I have sought leave of the opposition whip to incorporate these documents entitled `Workplace agreements B, C, D and E'. I seek leave to incorporate those documents.

         I have not at this stage tabled the actual workplace agreement because there are extreme secrecy provisions in the Western Australian legislation surrounding the disclosure of workplace agreements. There are also penalties involved with disclosing details of workplace agreements. The matter that most concerns me is that the individual workers who have provided those documents to the persons who have then forwarded them to me need to be protected. I will, at a later stage, seek leave to table those particular workplace agreements but I first have to make sure that there is no way of identifying the particular workers involved.

         The workplace agreements that I have just incorporated highlight a number of things. The first is that, under the regime of industrial relations established by the Court Liberal government in Western Australia, workers have been forced into casual employment contracts. This has been done because the legislation provides that a worker employed on a casual contract is not protected by the minimum conditions of employment legislation. So no minimums apply to a worker employed on a contract that is defined as casual contract. To be defined as a casual contract all that is required is for a worker not to be entitled to paid annual leave.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It used to be the case when I was an industrial relations practitioner that casual employment was defined by the short-term nature of the employment. A casual was someone employed for less than a week or less than a month under a particular award. But, under the Western Australian industrial relations legislation, thousands of workers have been reclassified from being permanent full-time or permanent part-time to being casuals. Therefore, under the Western Australian industrial relations legislation, they are only entitled to protection for the payment of a minimum wage and for an entitlement to bereavement leave. They are not entitled to paid annual leave. They are not entitled to paid sick leave and they are not entitled to any of the other normal conditions that have been built up in awards in this country over the last hundred years.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These things mean that a worker, having served 10 or 15 years as an employee of a firm, and because they continue to be defined as casual, can be entitled to long service leave but not entitled to annual leave. They have no protection. The Liberal Party rhetoric about protecting people's minimums and protecting their conditions is a hollow claim. These agreements detail how workers are being classified as casual and therefore exposed to an individual contract with their employer that provides no minimums other than the minimum wage and an entitlement to bereavement leave.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The second aspect of these contracts, and the further ones that I shall introduce into the chamber in coming weeks, is that of wage rates. On first glance, the wage rates contained in the workplace agreements appear to be comparable with those in the award. They are designed, in my view, so as to look competitive in order to attract labour. They are also designed in this way, on the recommendation of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to give some credibility to workplace agreements.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But what one must understand, and what these comparisons highlight, is that most of these workplace agreements do not provide for penalty payments or for overtime. Some of them provide that ordinary hours are up to 70 hours per week, without payment of any penalties. If a worker is taken sick, there is no entitlement for sick leave and there is no paid annual leave. The contracts provide that if a worker wants to take annual leave they need the permission of the employer and it has to be unpaid annual leave. This could be a worker who has been working for five, 10 or 15 years for that one employer.

         In my view, in a lot of these industries, Third World employment conditions are being introduced into Australia, conditions that we legislated to prevent in the early part of this century, when we set up the conciliation and arbitration commissions and the award system in Australia. The total package that these workers are receiving is significantly less than the package they would have received under the award. Workers are significantly worse off not just in monetary terms at the end of the week by virtue of their pay packet but also in terms of their lack of entitlement to sick leave, annual leave and those other conditions that we, as Australian workers, have accepted as being basic minima, as basic to the standard of living and the social cohesion in this country.

         Workers in WA receive no protection from the minimum conditions of employment act because, by merely defining a worker as casual, even if they are working 38 or 40 hours per week, working 52 weeks of the year and have been employed for five, 10 or 15 years, they have no protection as to minimum conditions, as I say, other than the minimum wage and an entitlement to bereavement leave. Clearly, the workers are worse off.

         Another problem is that employers who employ under individual workplace agreements are at a comparative advantage to other employers. We are seeing the erosion of the award system and the safety net provided. For instance, a contract cleaner is paying under the award and a competitor is paying under an individual workplace agreement. The individual workplace agreement provides for significantly lower return to the worker and, therefore, significantly lower total cost to the employer, hence he has a comparative advantage. The competitor can gain the contract—for instance, a cleaning contract—because he can keep his costs lower. He would be rewarding and paying his employees considerably less, therefore, he can tender at a lower contract price. The award system is being eroded by these workplace agreements.

         It is a nonsense to claim that the award system is a safety net, because the award system will eventually be totally eroded by the ability of employers to pay what they like. That is, effectively, the situation in Western Australia because there is no protection from the minimum conditions of employment act. There is no disadvantage test. There is no safety net in practice.

         There is a third issue that I want to refer to, and this becomes clear from the examples that I have incorporated. Effectively, a worker has no choice in Western Australia about signing a workplace agreement. The union claim of sign or resign, or sign or refuse the job, has been proved by the experience in the last two years in Western Australia. Ian Viner QC provided a legal opinion to the Trades and Labour Council when the legislation was being debated in the WA parliament, which made it clear that, in his view, the legislation provided no protection for workers and no protection from the superior bargaining power of employers. His legal opinion has been vindicated by the experience of Western Australian workers. There is no choice and no protection. There is no choice when you are employed. For instance, recently, in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          West Australian
         </emphasis>
         newspaper, an industrial commissioner, a former employers' industrial advocate, advertised for an associate to work with him in his position as an industrial commissioner with the WA industrial relations commission. He offered a workplace agreement. If people want a job working with the industrial commissioner, they have to sign a workplace agreement. If you were the best person for the job, there was no choice about whether you were going to be able to choose the award or the workplace agreement. You had to sign the workplace agreement.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Equally, the examples I have incorporated prove that workers are being dismissed if they refuse to sign workplace agreements. Workers are under enormous pressure to sign. They know it is a matter of sign or resign. We have instances of workers having been sacked for their refusal to sign or for their attempt to involve the protection of the award or the protection of their union. The only thing that is protecting some workers currently in Western Australia is the fact that their unions are seeking federal award coverage as protection from these workplace agreements.

         The fourth issue arising from these examples that I want to address today is the role that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is now playing in Western Australian industrial relations practice. We are aware that the minister has given himself the power to set the minimum wage, independent of any recommendation of the industrial relations commissioner. He has given himself the power to remove awards and to remove the right of unions to represent workers.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The minister has also given the Chamber of Commerce and Industry enormous powers. What is occurring is that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is advising its members of the ability to employ people as casuals and therefore avoid the minimum conditions under the employment acts. They are advising and encouraging members to take out workplace agreements, to employ members as casuals and to set their own wage rates and conditions. Because there is no protection from the legislation, the chamber is able to advise employers what rates and conditions should apply. Employers can ignore that advice but most of them seem to be pursuing the chamber's advice and are using standard contracts drawn up by the chamber where all they have to do is write in the employer's name, the employee's name and a couple of other details.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As a result, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is driving wage rates and conditions down to minimums that they consider to be appropriate to be paid. They have completely eroded the role of the industrial commission as the independent arbitrator of wages and conditions in Western Australia. Because individual contracts provide no protection for workers, the employer, with the advice of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, sets the wages and conditions.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other thing that has occurred is that they even have the gall, as shown in workplace agreement E, to nominate the Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the arbitrator of any dispute between the worker and the employer. Not only does the chamber advise and help draw up the contract that sets the wages and conditions but, if the worker is brave or stupid enough to dispute it, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry will appoint an independent arbitrator, not the industrial commissioner. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that not only will it set wages and conditions but, if people have any concern about that, they will nominate the arbiter to arbitrate any disputes under the workplace agreement.

         Clearly, what the government has done is privatise the industrial commission's role and, in effect, has given it to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia. It is another step in their privatisation process. It is clear that the rhetoric of the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the rhetoric of John Howard in the parliament do not match the reality of people's working lives in Western Australia and do not match the reality of what is occurring to people working under workplace agreements in Western Australia.

The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the parliament of the Northern Territory, quite incidentally had its 21st anniversary last Thursday, 19 October 1995. Also, incidentally, that day was the 21st anniversary of my entry to a parliament.

I again commend to the Senate the tabling statement in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 22 June 1995 by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Steve Hatton, who is also chairman of the Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development of the Northern Territory.

         The Committee recognises there will be no major constitutional development in the Northern Territory without the support and recognition of the basic rights of Aboriginal people. However, there is a concern in Aboriginal society, which values its various indigenous cultural circumstances, particularly land rights, sacred sites and customary law, the concern being that these rights should be constitutionally protected, otherwise they could be at risk after statehood.

          Another of Mr Snowdon's colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Mr Kim Beazley, stepped up Labor's anti-statehood campaign when he visited Darwin in August. He warned that the Northern Territory could suffer financially as a result of statehood. I disagree with him. But in comments reminiscent of Labor's scare tactics in the early 1970s—the pre-self government days—Mr Beazley said:

That convention will review the Australian constitution and consider new issues such as territory statehood.

         The underlying inflation rate gives a better indication of inflationary pressures in the economy than the headline inflation rate. However, it is still influenced by one-off factors.

         —I am pleased to advise the Senate that the government has accepted a recommendation from Wool International that it conduct a limited two-year program to develop and evaluate the forward marketing of wool. The proposed program builds on Wool International's efforts to stimulate the development of a broader range of risk management options for the sale of wool as required under its act. The wool industry has only limited commercial risk management options presently available to it, and of course the losers in that regard are the growers.

         The recent volatility in the market demonstrates the need to utilise such instruments to better manage risk. The program does not presuppose any privatisation of Wool International. As I have said before, that will depend on the decisions taken by individual growers as to whether they wish to take equity in any privatisation of Wool International or, indeed, take cash.

         I want to stress that this forward marketing operation will be completely independent of the stockpile sales, which will continue according to the fixed schedule. The program will be conducted through Wool International's subsidiary, Wool International Holdings. It will be conducted separately from the ongoing activities of Wool International whose prime responsibility is to manage the stockpile disposal and to discharge the industry debt.

Wool International Holdings will also have separate and transparent accounting. I have also asked the board of Wool International to provide me with quarterly progress reports on the program.

         Current circumstances in the wool market highlight the need for better risk management tools for the industry. Wool International has been developing this proposal for some time in direct consultation with an industry contact group. It considered that the development of improved risk management techniques for the benefit of growers was running at a snail's [ace and it needed some impetus. We agreed. After considering the matter, and with the support, I might add, of the executive of the Wool Council, I have agreed to Wool International conducting a limited forward trading operation. I intend to introduce legislation into the current session of the parliament to give effect to this decision.

         Senator Murphy asked the reasons for this decision. They do go directly to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. In July this year, for instance, the UNHCR launched an international appeal for countries to provide an extra 5,000 resettlement or temporary protection places. On 14 October, in response to new developments in the region gravely affecting a new group of refugees, the UNHCR had to revise its figures and appealed for a further 20,000 places in 1995 and another 25,000 places in 1996.

All up, those who have come to Australia this financial year will join 14,000 people who arrived from the former Yugoslavia region as humanitarian entrants since 1992.

He will recall that in March 1995, during a debate on schools funding, he agreed there was a question about the legality of state schools charging voluntary fees, levies or, more accurately, taxes. The

These fees are administered inconsistently, with variation between subjects, schools and regions. Parents groups in other states tell me that their situation is also unfair. What has the minister done to clarify the legality of this situation? What is the government's position on this matter?

         —I recollect that debate. First of all, decisions about levels of school fees for government schools are matters for state and territory governments. The key issue is not whether parents are prepared to pay such fees—recent press reports indicate that most appear to be prepared to do so—but whether the imposition of such fees creates hardship for disadvantaged students. There is also the question of what effect these fees might have on student decisions about choosing subjects and continuing on to year 12.

         These issues have been raised recently by both Senator Bell and  parent and student groups to Minister Crean and Minister Free. As the question of school fees has been a matter for the states, the Commonwealth has no detailed information about their application by schools. The Commonwealth ministers are seeking, and have sought, advice from the state and territory government ministers of education about these issues. When that information is available, they will make it available to Senator Bell and the Senate.

         —I thank Senator Carr for his question on what has been a complex issue of some controversy over the last year or so in this industry. First of all I should explain that a multi-site franchise, sometimes called a retail area franchise, is essentially a franchise where one dealer operates a number of sites. I am advised that the Mobil company has about five in what it would consider a multi-site and the Shell company has around 20.

         In relation to the argument in the industry on this issue, you have the views of the petrol retailers and franchisees, particularly the Shell National Action Group, which is made up of retailers, and which argues that such moves to multi-site franchising arrangements will have a range of outcomes which they believe will be negative. They argue that a multi-site franchise is anti-competitive in that it allows a single dealer to effectively determine a retail price in that market area. They also claim that in many cases the multi-site franchise operator is financed by the franchisor and that the latter has a de facto control over the market.

         The oil companies' view is quite different. The oil companies argue that moves towards MSF are a necessary part of restructuring in the industry which will lead to greater efficiencies, higher levels of training and service and greater profitability. The Trade Practices Commission has announced that they are currently investigating this issue and are likely to form a view in the near future. My view is that it is essential that the key players in this dispute in the industry have an opportunity to argue their case openly in the public interest. Accordingly, I have referred this matter to the House of Representatives industry committee for consideration and advice. I will meet with the chairman, Mr Griffiths, to arrange the terms of reference for such an inquiry. That will give both sides a chance to argue their case and the public can judge the merits of the issue.

         I have also called on today the companies to have a moratorium on the further development of multi-site franchising at least until the Trade Practices Commission comes down with a considered view. The introduction of MSF at the moment has affected the completion of an agreement on a voluntary oil code between the franchisees and the petrol companies. That petrol code, substantially agreed upon, would be of major benefit to both sides of the industry and would enhance the building of trust within the industry, but unfortunately a number of the retailers' interests believe that MSF at the same time means that they are not quite certain exactly what is going to be the outcome of such a code. Therefore, I believe it would be in the interests of the industry overall if there were a moratorium, at least until the Trades Practices Commission comes down with its view. In the meantime I believe it is important that both sides of the industry, where there is considerable controversy on this issue, have a chance to put their views publicly, which they will be able to do before the House of Representatives industry committee.

Minister, on Monday you said that you were amongst those Cabinet ministers who believed it was appropriate to encourage the market to work efficiently when it comes to the investment of superannuation funds. Yesterday Mr Willis maintained his position that the government would not force or mandate superannuation funds for trustees to invest in particular areas. But today we learn that Mr Keating believes that because the Labor government has given $6 billion in tax concessions to the superannuation industry it has, to use his words, `heaps of prerogative over how the industry is run'. In fact, Mr Keating said: `Where are the greater prerogatives in this than in the hands of the Prime Minister' and further adds, `or in the hands of the trade unions?' What is the government's policy on mandating the development of superannuation funds and what form of intimidation will your encouragement take? Is Mr Keating making policy on the run again and, if so, do you support his new position on this vital issue?

         For those who are listening to this broadcast, and there are probably very few of them, I might just say there is a very clear distinction between encouraging by doing things such as the government did just recently in requiring the funds to publish a five-year rolling average of their investment outcomes rather than having a short-term approach of only doing it on a one-year basis. I take that as an encouragement in regulatory legislation to look beyond the horizon of one year to the medium-term future. That is an encouragement device, as opposed to directing. You have confused both of those, and blurred the distinction quite unconscionably, I might say.

There is no way what occurred in a Senate report years and years ago can be relevant to this particular question, as asked in this form today, Mr President.

I have just re-read Senator Boswell's question and the words `zero risk' do not appear in the question. So, quite clearly, in your own judgment, Mr President, this answer has to be totally and utterly irrelevant, as is the minister. I would put it to you that he should be directed to answer the substantive question, which is about what he has done to the resources of AQIS and why he has allowed plant quarantine officers to take redundancy. It is about his mismanagement—not about something that happened when I was in secondary school.

Under our GP rural incentive scheme, 67 women have been relocated from the city to the country compared with 163 men. So already the program is clearly successful in encouraging general practitioners into rural Australia. That is so very important in terms of our rural health program. The Labor government is implementing this strategy to meet the health needs in non-metropolitan areas.

You would like to have it again and make the same kind of sensible other points that you were making in the same speech. But you lost the plot on that quote. Women are going into country practice; so are men. That is one of the most important things. It has been a regular complaint. There have been questions asked by some of our National Party colleagues in the Senate. We are addressing it under our national rural health strategy. There are more doctors now returning to general practice in rural Australia, and that is the intention of our program. It is the request from rural communities. This government is absolutely committed to seeing that it happens.

If the opposition maintains they are relevant, then they are relevant in Senator Cook's answer. If the opposition maintains that the measures are not relevant to Senator Cook's answer, these tax plans are as irrelevant as the opposition. You cannot answer this question without acknowledging that there are some tax plans on the table from the other side—state based consumption and state based income tax. It is quite appropriate for Senator Cook to canvass them in terms of what taxes—

         At this stage I do not expect the issue of trade and labour standards to be on the agenda for Osaka. You referred to social clauses, Senator Spindler. This is an idea that arose from a misapprehension. We have something which you could call social clauses—it is not a title I would give it—in NAFTA. There is debate about one in the WTO.

         Nevertheless, your other point, with regard to the subcommittee, is important because it raises issues to do with labour standards and environment being considered in APEC. Yes, they are being considered but not by one separate compartmentalised committee. There are a number of committees looking at issues to do with human resources and strategies to improve workers' conditions, training, education of workers, et cetera, in the various APEC working groups, particularly the human resources development working group.

         There are also APEC bodies, such as the energy working group and the tourism working group both of which I am advised are looking at environmental aspects of APEC. Of course, the APEC environment ministers meet regularly to discuss environment issues within the region. I do not think we should compartmentalise it off into one separate committee that only looks at those issues. But they are matters that are being considered by some of the existing working groups, and I imagine that will continue to be the case.

In her question Senator Chamarette asked if it was true that my predecessor, Mrs Kelly, had written to Pasminco informing it that no future extensions of the licence would occur. In a supplementary question Senator Chamarette asked me to table all correspondence between Minister Kelly and Pasminco regarding the dumping licence.

         I believe that the letter that Senator Chamarette was referring to is Mrs Kelly's letter advising Pasminco of the granting of a sea-dumping permit for the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 October 1995. I table that letter. This letter makes it quite clear that the government was seeking to end sea dumping as soon as possible. The letter also expresses Mrs Kelly's wish to set an agreed date for the cessation of sea dumping. It does not state that no further licences would be issued, as I think was suggested by Senator Chamarette in her question.

         The government has closely followed Pasminco's efforts to develop an alternative to sea dumping. As I said last week, I am convinced that the extra time is necessary for the implementation of the co-treatment process and that this process will provide the best long-term results for the environment. I hope that tabling this letter will satisfy Senator Chamarette's request and that it will not be necessary to look back at all the other correspondence over the period when Mrs Kelly was minister.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane this day, relating to industrial relations in Western Australia.

        In that question I addressed four fundamental points. The first point was the deceitful advertising that has occurred in Western Australia, particularly relevant being the comments in the adverts that `the Court Liberal government has set the minimum weekly wage at $317.10 a week. A family can't live on that!' I addressed my question to Senator Crowley because I thought that, with that situation in that ad, and the reference to families she would be in a position to answer it, but she couldn't.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second point of my question relates to the situation which existed with Carmen Lawrence and the position then. The third point I wanted her to address was the fact that, under the current metal trades industry award—clause 9 of the award, if you want to know—the current unskilled minimum weekly wage rate is $238.10, which is $79 less than the WA minimum. It is well worth mentioning the fact that under Queensland law they have a minimum rate of $250 a week, which is some $67 less than the situation which exists in Western Australia.

         This, as I have said before, is one of the most deceitful efforts ever by this government in misleading the Australian public as to what a situation is. In putting these ads together, they have obviously not even bothered to look at the history of just Western Australia. If we look at Western Australia, we find very clearly that since 1987, when Brian Burke was Premier of Western Australia, the minimum wage has been coming down consistently.

         In fact, if we go back to 4 January 1980, when Sir Charles Court was Premier, we find that that particular minimum wage was at its highest then. It was not until the Liberal Court government was elected in Western Australia on 20 August 1994 that we saw the minimum wage in Western Australia start to reverse in terms of its position. And we had the increase last week of $16 per week placed on that, which is double what the Accord will deliver next March, some five months before that particular situation.

         I want to put on the public record the situation which exists in the metal trades industry. An amount of $238.10 per week is the Labor Party's benchmark award in terms of minimum standards. Senator Murphy knows that very well. I have already discovered in Western Australia 16 other minimum rates between $238.10 and $280 operating under federal awards. The article of 17 October says that the ALP is to support honest political advertising laws. It mentions ALP national secretary Gary Gray. He says that the ALP could also outlaw controversial campaign tactics.

         What we have seen perpetrated following the blockade in WA is this action on advertising. We had industrial civil war declared on Western Australia by the trade union movement. I believe that it was supported by this Labor government. When you start examining the facts, you find that the Labor Party's performance in terms of minimum standards has been very poor when it is compared with what exists in Western Australia. Compare it with the present state government or the government prior to Richard Court getting into power.

         The Labor Party's federal performance is also very poor. Even the state Labor government in Western Australia did better than this federal Labor government has in terms of that situation. Mr Gary Gray is trying to mislead the Australian public with regard to truth in advertising. I find absolutely disgraceful and unacceptable what they are doing now. Firstly, you have been exposed for what you are. Secondly, if you are going to uphold this principle, those ads in Western Australia should be withdrawn immediately and you should apologise to Western Australians.

         —I am not going to claim that I can get it totally right. But I think you have it totally wrong. I recently checked the award. According to my information, the minimum adult rate of pay under the metal trades industry award is $341.40. Let me explain what that is made up of. It is made up of a base component of $284.80, a supplementary payment of $40.60 and a safety net adjustment of $16. That is a lot more than $317.10. The lowest adult rate of pay is $341.40.

         More importantly, look at the history of the wage increases during the life of this government and those who have actually got up to $341.40. All of the wage increases, bar one, have been opposed by the opposition. What is so fundamentally important is that if there were a coalition government tomorrow, with its current industrial relations policy, the people on $341.40 would automatically be $40.60 worse off.

         There is an indication that you may have some safety net. Senator Abetz says that that is wrong. Let me put it to you that, in Victoria, Jeff Kennett made application to the state industrial relations commission for a minimum hourly rate of around $8.23. If you were in power now, those people would lose their supplementary payment of $40.60. That would take them back to less than $300 per week. It would then be in line with what Senator Crane is talking about.

         What is even more important is what the social wage is now in terms of family supplements, et cetera and how it decreased under you people. I would like to outline a few facts with regard to the social wage. The social wage, as I said before for the information of those opposite, includes expenditure on health, education, housing and child care. Under Mr Howard the social wage went backwards to the tune of nearly 18 per cent. That is what is important to the people in this country today. They do not know what you are going to do with respect to the social wage because you will not tell anybody.

         I will tell you what has happened to the social wage under Labor. The social wage under Labor has increased by 73.1 per cent. That is a massive increase. It decreased under you. If you people on that side of the chamber think this is all lies and myths and schemes and plots, then there is a simple solution for you: come out and spell out clearly what your policies are, where you stand on the social wage and on the industrial relations system with regard to hourly rates of pay. You have given only four commitments: a minimum wage, four weeks annual leave and 10 days non-cumulative sick leave—a very poor position—and we do not even know whether we will get long service leave under you lot. The workers have a right to know. I am sure that at some time—I do not know when, but I do not think it will be until after the election—we will see the introduction of the type of position that exists in Western Australia, because that is Mr Howard's model.

         We saw that with the Labor Party trade union orchestrated blockade of Western Australia. They had Jennie George over; flew her all the way from Melbourne for this mass rally. It attracted all of 200 people. We have already had answers given in this place that the 200 people who came to hear this new messiah for the trade union movement came from Senator Cook's office, from Dr Lawrence's office, chances are from Labor headquarters, from the Trades and Labor Council in Western Australia and all the other MPs in Western Australia. Chances are that would have made up the 200. Chances are there was not a single true rank and file worker at that rally. That indicates the lack of support that the Labor Party has in the area of industrial relations. So what are they doing? As Senator Crane put in his question, they are embarking upon a deliberate scare campaign around this country to try to win back votes.

        Senator Crowley made the very point that I made the other day when she said that the number of female doctors is half the number of male doctors who have been relocated by the rural incentive program.

The other thing, Senator Crowley, that you are not aware of, because you were not able to produce the figures, is that the rural incentive program is replacing one or two GPs a week after three years, when your own department says that there is a shortage of 400 to 500 in rural and remote areas. You are replacing one to two a week, but six a week are leaving. So you tell me how that rural incentive program is working.

         where it says there is `a country crisis'. There is a crisis, Senator Crowley, in obstetrics and in anaesthesia. As you know from the speech I gave last week, I have just toured western Queensland. Senator Crowley, when did you yourself last drive through those rural areas? When have you done 4,000 kilometres, as I did, through western Queensland?

         I have the figures in front of me. There is a shortage of between 400 or 500 doctors; there is a country crisis in obstetrics, and there is a growing shortage of rural obstetricians, both specialists and GPs. This week's Wodonga paper says that there is a desperate crisis in western New South Wales. It says, `Medical service a major worry. As it is with many small centres, the lack of adequate medical facilities is a major concern.' You are telling me this rural incentive program is working but, Senator Crowley, it is not working. It has not worked; there need to be a lot more incentives. An article in the Victorian AMA's rural newsletter states that there need to be further incentives in relation to the rural incentive program. You are just not giving enough incentives.

         You come in here and try to pick on me for giving a truthful answer. Your own figures show that, of those needing to be replaced, there is only half the number going out there. You will come back at me, I suppose, and say, `Well, it is only in recent years that the number of females in medical schools has increased.' But the reality is, if you went around these areas, if you spent more time there, you would be a bit more knowledgeable about it, Senator Crowley. Coming in and picking on that very narrow feminist point I think speaks more of your answer than of anything that I have said. When I gave you another 11 reasons, you picked on that one narrow, feminist point.

         Secondly, the fact that 67 women and 123 men are going into rural Australia is no indication of your case at all; in fact, it is very strong evidence that, although the number of women coming through universities in medical schools now is about 50 per cent, that is a very recent phenomenon. Indeed, it has been happening at a period of time when general practitioners have been asking for a different emphasis in their training to prepare them to have the confidence and the assurance that, if they practice in rural Australia remote from hospitals, they will have the appropriate backup.

         The point you mentioned of obstetric indemnity is a matter of real concern, particularly in my own state of South Australia. It is fascinating that any time there is any problem of this sort, people no longer even think of turning to state governments. They have to turn to the Commonwealth because state governments—particularly in South Australia which now has a Liberal government—are not the place to go while they are taking money out of the health system to assist them in rural Australia.

Senator Herron, that is not your usual line, it is not your usual point. It is a mistake in what you usually argue, which is much more reasonable than that—to take the words out of your own mouth, `Women get married.' One way I could refute this argument would be to find a woman doctor who is not yet married. That would probably give lie to that claim by Senator Herron.

         The first problem is adequate training and adequate supports to assist doctors to have the confidence to actually feel that they can cope.

         We have very considerable financial incentives to get doctors into rural practice. Apparently, that is not a sufficient reason for many of them to go into rural practice. Another reason that is not strictly related to doctors only is the question of education, particularly secondary education for children of families of professionals in rural areas. It applies just as much to school teachers, police persons, bankers and anybody else.

        I welcome the statement by Senator Collins that for two years Wool International has been investigating and implementing a system of risk management. As a sideline to that, at least there will be a direct link between the woolgrower and wool processor. Also, importantly, on the risk management side, at certain times of the year when growers do not have the wool from the sheep, they can make arrangements to take advantage of certain market conditions.

         Equally, I welcome the statement that it will be stand alone and be self-funding—that funding will not come out of the general assets of the stockpile. Furthermore, I welcome the statement—and I hope it never changes—that when Wool International is privatised in 1998, or whenever, there will be a choice for growers to take shares or equity.

         —Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that Australia's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, increased by 1.2 per cent in the three months of the September quarter alone to a level 5.1 per cent above that of a year ago. That is a dangerous increase which will set red lights flashing across all business, consumer and wage earner groups in Australia. It is the sixth consecutive quarter in which our annual inflation rate has risen.

         Inflation in Australia is at a rate that puts us firmly in second place—second only to Italy—amongst the high inflation nations of the Western world. In Australia, inflation is measured in more than one way. The consumer price index is the most common, but the government also likes to use what it calls the `underlying inflation rate'. It likes this form of measurement because the figure is generally below the consumer price index figure. It excludes such things as meat, fruit and vegetables, clothing, housing interest rates, petrol, fuel and power, local government charges, tobacco and alcohol, health services, pharmaceuticals, education, child care and several other very important items. In other words, it fiddles the inflation that people actually experience, basically to suit its own political ends, although I do accept that there are valid reasons for some of the exclusions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But even this heavily adjusted fiddled inflation figure shows the same dangerously increasing trend as does the consumer price index. In the September quarter, this so-called underlying rate was 3.1 per cent higher than a year earlier. On the government's own reckoning—no-one else's—this is a dangerously high figure, because the Reserve Bank of Australia says that the range of acceptable underlying inflation in Australia is two to three per cent; that is, three per cent is the upper level of acceptability. Anything above that is unacceptable and requires policy action to bring the inflation rate back down to within an acceptable range. That policy action involves a range of things. It certainly involves monetary policy and it involves budgetary policy. Monetary policy, of course, means one thing; that is, higher interest rates.

         So what today's inflation figures mean, if they continue in the months ahead—and there are no grounds for thinking that they will not—is that interest rates will be on the rise again before too long. They are already amongst the highest in the Western world. It is a figure that is often glossed over by the government in its attempts to conceal the real level of interest rates in this country, but when you look at the real level of interest rates in Australia, they are at all levels, short-term and long-term, amongst the highest in the world. That, of course, increases the competitive difficulties that we face on an international basis.

         The government, of course, will be doing everything in its power to keep rates from rising before the forthcoming election. They will cajole Reserve Bank Governor, Bernie Fraser, and his team—and bear in mind that Mr Fraser has already warned the government about rising wage pressures and higher than acceptable inflation; and the implications for interest rates and other economic policy measures that that brings out.

         This government will do anything to avoid a rate increase before the election. But they cannot deny one inescapable fact; that is, that under this Keating government's policies, rates will soon be on the rise again. That inflation figure that we had today is like a time bomb. It is like the foreign debt time bomb we have: tick, tick, tick; away it goes and sooner or later that bomb will explode and interest rates will go up—and the government knows that full well.

         The Prime Minister has long had a quite unreal view of his government's success in producing a long-term, low inflation, sustainable growth economy. He must shudder today—if he was not so thick-skinned he would—to read and recall some of the things he has said in recent times about the inflation rate in Australia.

         The real facts are that the Labor Party has been unable after 12 1/2 years in government to make the necessary reforms to enable Australia, on any sustainable basis, to grow at a rate that absorbs the additions to the available work force and reduces the massive and horrendous pool of unemployment that Labor's policies have produced.

         Senator Short said that the underlying rate of inflation is a fiddled figure. He also said that it is produced for political ends. Neither of those comments are true. For a long time Treasury has produced a figure showing what the underlying rate of inflation is. The underlying rate removes items which are particularly volatile, seasonal or subject to government charges in the CPI in order to make that rate a truer measure of inflation. To accuse anyone of fiddling the books or to say that this is a politically produced figure is to call into question the authority and impartiality of the Treasury in the political process, something that Senator Short is not game to do to its face.

         Today's debate has been sparked by the September quarter CPI figures released by the Statistician at 11.30 this morning. These figures show that the underlying rate of inflation in Australia for the year is 3.1 per cent. I believe it is important to put those figures in context. That is exactly what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) did today. In a press release he stated:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        While today's result indicates that through the year underlying inflation rate has risen above 3 per cent for the first time since December 1991, this outcome is not inconsistent with the commitment of the government and the Reserve Bank of Australia to keep underlying inflation between 2 to 3 per cent on average over the course of the economic cycle.
       </para>
       <para>
        To put this figure in context, the Treasurer stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Treasury underlying measure of inflation attempts to measure generalised inflationary pressures by removing items that are particularly volatile, seasonal or subject to government influence, it can still be affected by one-off changes. For example, the September quarter increase in the underlying rate has been influenced by the increase in third party insurance premiums and by the changes to the wholesale sales tax rate (WST).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        -New motor vehicle prices, reflecting increases in WST, and motor vehicle insurance contributed 0.36 percentage points to the quarterly increase in the underlying rate. In the absence of these increases the underlying rate would have risen by around 0.8 per cent in the quarter, and 2.7 per cent through the year.

        That is why we are working within the parameters. That is why the scaremongering motion ought not be entertained for one minute. It is fair to say that we are operating within the parameters set out by the budget. The economy is not in panic mode as the opposition would like it to be. The economy has a strong level of growth which is underpinned by some inflationary pressures which are in a manageable area and within the scope of what we believe is manageable. They are within the budget settings, as I have said.

         The significant thing about inflation, and one cannot leave a debate on the subject of inflation without making this point, is that we have an accord with the union movement of Australia. One of the areas through which inflation can be pushed quickest is excessive wage settlements. Under that accord, we have entered into an agreement which ensures that wage settlements will not push the underlying rate of inflation beyond the two per cent to three per cent area. That is what the Reserve Bank of Australia says is the manageable area. That is what the accord says. We do expect that that will be delivered.

         The opposition has an industrial relations track record which makes it impossible to have any agreement with the trade union movement of Australia. We are able to reach a situation by having an agreement with them in which there is wage moderation for tax trade-offs and improvements in the social wage so the living standards rise—that is, all those things affected by the level of income in wages, the level of tax paid out of those wages and the social wage delivered by the government to the individual household. We have a situation where we can trade that off because of a cooperative relationship with the union movement in order to ensure living standards rise, profits remain high and investment can occur in the Australian economy.

         I do not think anyone can leave this debate without referring to taxation. We had a little encounter, one might say, during question time on the subject of taxation. I think this motion, which gets it lamentably wrong but politically wrong on purpose in order to make a case that does not exist, a fictional case against the government, was moved by the opposition in order to hide the fact that the opposition has not declared to the Australian people its own economic policies. It is criticised in the media by economic commentators for not doing so. The coalition intends to ambush the Australian electorate on the eve of an election with a mass of detail that the electorate will not be able to consume. In doing so, the coalition will confuse the public as to the intent of that policy.

For example, women are disadvantaged under enforced individual contracts. That matter was debated very vociferously in Western Australia last week.

         Today we had the announcement of Australia's annual headline inflation rate and we find that it has climbed to 5.1 per cent. That absolutely snuffs out any chance of a fall in interest rates, other than those that are politically motivated. The fear is that interest rates will now rise.

         Last month we had the announcement that Australia's foreign debt is at a record level. One would have to say that the government's whole economic strategy is on the verge of collapse.

        The inflation rate that the Prime Minister was talking about was the headline rate. That rate is five per cent, not two to three. Today's inflation announcement does more to undermine the credibility of the government than any other single economic statistic or trend that we have had of late. That is why the government has placed great store in holding down the inflation rate. It has underpinned the government's whole fragile and shonky economic strategy. The government has tried every deceptive policy available to show that it has broken the inflation stick.

         We have had false budget surpluses, artificially high interest rates, superficial wages Accords and even slick salesmanship from the Prime Minister in an attempt to convince the marketplace of the government's anti-inflation policies. Today we have arrived at a point where the bond yields are on the rise again, as they were in 1994, in expectation of entrenched inflation in the future. As this effect cascades through the economy and high inflation takes hold and interest rates remain high, the losers will be the people battling to pay off their mortgage home loans with no expected relief; the people battling to stay afloat in small business with no expected relief; and the worst affected will be the unemployed. The cost to business to further employ has gone up. We have the threat and fear of a wages spiral.

         Even worse news today was the increase in the underlying rate of inflation. This was a figure that was trumped up by the government and the Reserve Bank as being something that was far more important than the headline inflation rate. It is supposed to be the rate at which the Reserve Bank and the government will set policy. The Australian public would rather look at a rise in the cost of living. The Reserve Bank's annual report defined the underlying rate as the consumer price index less fruit and vegetables, fuel, mortgage interest charges, consumer credit charges, public dwelling rent, local government rates and charges, household fuel and light, postal and telephone services, motoring charges, health services, pharmaceuticals, education, child care et cetera et cetera.

         There will be fewer workers, or they will be paid less, and they will work harder for the same money. This will give us higher living standards. We are told that the profits companies make will be reinvested to create more jobs. If these jobs continue to be low paid, how will people be better off and have higher standards of living? You want higher house prices because this increases the value of the family investment, but you want prices, interest rates and wages to stay down. Every time that house prices go up, not only do those who sell houses make money but those who buy will need to borrow more money. If that is the case, either they will be worse off or they will be pushing for higher wages so that they can afford a house. The more people borrow to spend on a house, the fewer savings there are, the less money is available for productive investment and the more pressure there is to raise interest rates. Do not you see some contradictions here?

They include the lack of distribution of employment. If we established a more equitable sharing of jobs, we would get effective full employment. We should also address the central issue of the maldistribution of profits, which reinforces the maldistribution of wealth and power.

         On a number of occasions in this place in recent times we have mentioned the fact that, in the end, if we want to see distributive equity in Australia and small business able to survive, we have to start thinking radically. We have to start thinking about regional and local based economies. We have to start thinking about the amazingly radical concept of paying people more per hour to work less, and distributing the work available. It might seem, in the short term, that you are increasing your costs. But, in reality, if you are only using labour as a cost of production, you are missing the point in terms of standards of living and the ability of our economy to survive. Basically, the standard of living depends on people's ability to enjoy their life, leisure and families and to be able to participate—

        This is an interesting document because it touches on part of the services in the building that are used by all senators, which is the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Research Service. Some of us use the Library to lesser or greater degrees. I am currently reading a book which the Library was kind enough to borrow on my behalf from the National Library of Australia. It is a great privilege that we have, and we should always be grateful for it. At other times, I use, as honourable senators would, the Parliamentary Research Service and the Parliamentary Library Information Service. They are also very important. So we have to pay attention to what happens in the Library and how the resources are used to maximise its efficiency.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have always said that the Library is probably more important for the opposition than it is for the government. I will explain why. In government, one has all the resources of a department to provide information to ministers. Whichever group of parties is in government has easier access to material from those departments. That is not a complaint; it is just a fact of life.

         To balance it up and for the benefit of a good democratic system, there has to be a mechanism by which those who are in opposition, or those who are in the minor parties—heaven knows, sometimes I think some of the minor parties need all the help they can get—can get access to information. That, of course, for us often means the Parliamentary Library and the research service there, in particular, in producing research and discussion papers.

Ten per cent of senators and members, which on my reckoning is about 25 people, made 30.6 per cent of the requests; and a quarter of senators and members made 52.6 per cent of requests.

I might be wrong but it sounds very much like most of the requests came from the shadow ministry or the shadow cabinet, and that is not a bad thing. I know that when Senator Walsh was in the place, he made enormous use of the library, as well as other resources, when he was no longer in the ministry. He was stunningly effective in what he did as a result of the flow of information. But it stresses the importance of the library to those of us who are in opposition at the moment and it stresses the importance of the library to those who may be in opposition after the next election. I think everybody has a vested interest in making sure that the system works well.

         It is interesting to note that a couple of years ago when the Parliamentary Library came within the purview of Estimates Committee A—and you will remember it, Madam Acting Deputy President—there was enormous consternation over the mismanagement of the library. The matters no longer come before an estimates committee on which I take an active interest; but it was decided at that point in time that some temporary measures be taken to rectify the parlous situation into which the library had fallen. As a consequence of that, you will well recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that it was decided that Mr John Templeton should take over as acting librarian, although he was not a librarian himself. That was done for administrative reasons to try to rectify some of the problems.

         That is several years ago and Mr Templeton seems to have done a fairly reasonable job. But it is interesting to note that nowhere in the document is there mention of the future of the library under a librarian. Mr Templeton signs the report as `Acting Parliamentary Librarian'. If matters that caused the concern in the first place have been resolved, then maybe it is time that we have a parliamentary librarian, a person who is skilled in librarianship, to deal with the library and also the flow of information.

         Obviously, it is a difficult matter because the Parliamentary Library is not like any other library in this country. It is as much a research service as a library. But, certainly, there are issues there that have to be dealt with and, certainly, we are talking about multimedia and so on. The principles of good librarianship are as applicable to CD-ROMs as they are applicable to books. So there is no reason why it should not happen now if the problems have been resolved.

         It is interesting to see on page 17 the table of requests completed and the time taken to complete those requests. There is quite a degree of variation which is attributable in part to the sitting periods. It seems like there are more requests for information when parliament sits than when parliament is not sitting. In the accounts at the end of the report, it is made very clear that it is very difficult to predict the flow of work, the amount of time required and the resources needed because it varies according to external factors over which the library has no control. But I think Senator Kemp would agree it is a good thing that nobody can ration our access to the library. That would be an horrendous situation.

        The purpose of this package of bills is to rationalise into a single framework the 59 separate levies and charges acts currently imposing levies on primary industry products. It complements the significant rationalisation of the levies and charges collection legislation that took place in 1991 and is consistent with Blewett report that sought to reduce the parliamentary legislative program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is designed to overcome past problems caused by the volume of Primary Industries and Energy portfolio legislation and the logjam the levies and charges legislation created by requiring constant amendment in the parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have analysed the problem, consulted extensively with industry and concluded that amalgamating all the levies and charges into two framework acts will make more effective use of parliamentary time dealing with levy legislation. It will also assist industry to have changes to levies put in place more rapidly than on some occasions in the past.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The levies and charges in question are not unilaterally imposed by the government, but rather are sought by representative industry bodies, on behalf of the industry. Their purpose is to fund activities such as marketing and research and development that would be beyond the scope of individual farmers on their own. I would expect that more levies will be requested by industry in the future, particularly in new and emerging industries and most probably for R&amp;D.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The levies bill and the charges bill set up a framework for imposing levies on primary industry products by regulation. They will allow new industries or new products to be included quickly on the request of the industry concerned, while, at the same time, protecting parliament's powers to decide on these matters.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to recognise that this streamlining process will not change the practical impact of the current legislation but only the way levies are established or amended. There will be no discernible difference from the industry point of view in the way that the levies and charges processes operate other than that any changes they wish to make to maximum levy or charge rates will be able to be completed in a much shorter time frame.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Previously maximum rates for levies and charges were included in each individual levy or charge act to give parliament control over any arbitrary imposition of taxation. Because of the wide variety of bases for the calculation of the levy and charge rates it was not possible to find a suitable formula covering all industries to include in the framework legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bills therefore require the maximum rates of each levy or charge to be set out in special regulations. Normal regulations come into effect on gazettal before they are tabled in parliament. These special regulations will not come into effect until after the parliamentary disallowance period is completed. This still gives the parliament the ultimate role in determining maximum rates.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Impositions of levy or changes to levy matters such as maximum and operative rates can only be made on the recommendation of the designated body and after the required consultation with the relevant industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bills also require any increases in maximum rates to be published in a daily newspaper in the states and territories to ensure that individuals in an industry are aware of them. Initially, the maximum rates to be included in the special regulations are likely to be the same as those currently applying in each industry, unless the industry has specifically sought a different rate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bills allow the minister to declare a designated body or bodies for each industry to make recommendations regarding the setting of levy or charge rates. Where there is more than one designated body for a particular industry these bodies will be required to agree on any recommendations they make to the minister.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Designated bodies are also required to consult with other representative bodies. For example, if the designated body for a particular industry is a peak grower body, it is required by reference to section 22 of the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 to consult with any other eligible industry bodies set out in the relevant statutory marketing authority act before making recommendations to the minister.

This continues the consultative approach we have adopted with industry through the development of this streamlined levy package.

        The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1995 will provide legislative authority for measures that will assist in giving effect to the Government's decision to restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will also provide for the abolition of related legislation, namely the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The restructuring, or corporatisation, of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was announced in the 1995-96 Budget. It is designed to provide the Corporation with greater freedom to operate on a strict commercial basis and, as such, to put it on a more comparable footing vis-a-vis its competitors.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The decision to follow this approach reflects the same considerations that had earlier influenced the Government to attempt to sell the Corporation, namely that the prevailing conditions in the mortgage insurance and finance industries now differ considerably compared with when the Corporation was set up.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority thirty years ago to meet a structural deficiency in the highly-regulated financial environment which existed at that time. Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance; financial institutions tended to allocate their then scarce housing funds on a least-risk basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since those days, a competitive private sector mortgage insurance industry has emerged in Australia. Together with the finance industry reforms introduced by this Government, this has removed the old structural deficiency in the housing finance market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With these improvements in access to housing finance, the objective of the Government has been to maintain and enhance these achievements by ensuring that there is an efficient, diverse and competitive mortgage insurance market. The decision a number of years ago to attempt to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation reflected the view that the continued involvement of a statutory authority in the industry was not consistent with this objective.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, efforts to sell the Corporation have not proceeded since it has become clear that the sale was not going to produce a satisfactory result.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a consequence, the Government has considered alternative approaches. It commissioned the Task Force on Asset Sales' financial advisers, Baring Bros Burrows and Co Limited, to undertake a complete review of the sale process and the Corporation's position in the market. They concluded, among other things, that the Corporation enjoyed a number of advantages over its private sector competitors arising from its statutory authority status, including the guarantee of its liabilities, and from the fact that it is not subject to the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As these benefits, which put the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation on a different basis to its competitors, would not be available to any potential purchasers, it was difficult for them to establish the nature and size of the business that would exist post-sale and, so, to put a value on the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The corporatisation arrangements that the Government now proposes represent a significant move in addressing these concerns. A new company will be established under the Corporations Law which will be subject to the regulatory requirements of ISC, as well as those of the States and Territories. The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The existing Commonwealth guarantee will be removed as far as borrowings by the Corporation is concerned. However, the Commonwealth guarantee for non-borrowing liabilities has been retained, at least for the moment, to minimise any uncertainty in the mortgage insurance industry that might arise as a consequence of the restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, given its prominent position in the market. Furthermore, to enable the company to attain the minimum credit rating required for mortgage insurers by state legislation without retaining that guarantee, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to commit significant additional capital resources to the Corporation, over and above what is already proposed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, in setting a target rate of return for the company, account will be taken of any advantage the retention of the guarantee may accord it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With the removal of the guarantee on borrowing, there is no longer a need for a specific legislative provision as the Treasurer has the powers under the Constitution to guarantee liabilities of a non-borrowing nature.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will cease writing business on the day before the new company comes into operation. The insurance policies of the Corporation entered into prior to and including that date, which we might refer to as the `old book', will become the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth. In exchange for accepting these liabilities, the Commonwealth will receive the balance of the Corporation's capital and reserves. On the Budget estimates, the level of funds likely to be transferred to consolidated revenue is expected to be in excess of $100 million.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will be contracted by the Commonwealth to administer the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations contained in the `old book'. Funds will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account to be established by this new company and will be replenished as and when necessary to meet claims against these insurance contracts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The transfer of the `old book' to the Commonwealth along these lines is consistent with the arrangements that would have been put in place had the sale of the Corporation proceeded in 1991. Separation of the `old book' will, in particular, enable the new company's performance to be judged independently of the Corporation's previous operations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill currently before the Senate is designed to assist in giving effect to the arrangements that I have just outlined. It includes the following:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        provision to the Treasurer of the necessary powers to direct the transfer of assets and liabilities in whatever way is considered appropriate to give effect to the abovementioned objectives;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        authority for the Treasurer to enter into an agreement with the new Company which would cover the terms under which existing insurance contracts would be managed, as well as the means by which payments for claims arising from these contracts could be made. The latter includes a standing appropriation for the required funding;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        the transfer of staff of the Corporation to the new company, as well as the transfer of all current rights enjoyed by those staff with respect to such matters as long service leave, superannuation, maternity leave and Comcare. It is not intended that the interests of the staff should in any way be adversely affected by this corporatisation exercise;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        provision to exempt from taxation transactions involving such matters as the transfer of assets that would not have arisen apart from the corporatisation exercise; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        finally, the winding up of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the repeal of all relevant legislation relating to the Corporation. As part of the winding up exercise, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of cessation of the Corporation's activities will be prepared by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. After being audited by the Audit office, they will be tabled in the Parliament in due course.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I conclude by pointing out to the Senate that the restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation that is proposed is seen by the Government as an important step in its efforts to maintain an efficient and competitive mortgage insurance market.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill would make machinery changes consequential to the implementation of changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to CES notification requirements and allow the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) to obtain goods and services by using a credit card.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill would provide for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate job search allowance and newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In particular, the bill would allow for inclusion in determinations made under the act provisions relating to resetting unemployment registration to zero of particular clients who decline to continue to participate in the case management system. This is in line with announcements made in the 1995-96 Budget and already implemented. The new arrangements were introduced for part-time and seasonal workers because they have substantial and recent workforce experience and may not require, or in some instances want, the level of assistance provided under case management. The bill would seek to make consequential amendments to that part of the act that defines Job Compact eligibility for the purposes of a Case Management Activity Agreement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill would streamline requirements on the CES to notify and interview a person after they become a participant in the case management system. The existing provisions of the  Employment Services Act 1994 require two separate contacts to be made; the first being when a person becomes a participant in the case management system and the second when the person is to be referred to a case manager. The bill would require the CES to make a single contact with the jobseeker for the purpose of notifying participant status and for requesting the jobseeker to attend or take part in an interview. Under the bill notification that a person is a participant in the case management system will be made when the CES calls the jobseeker in for an interview and considers that a referral can be made to a case manager within 24 days of a referral interview taking place.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present, ESRA is unable to use Government credit card facilities because the act does not provide for it to borrow money. To overcome the administrative inconvenience this causes, the bill would provide for ESRA to obtain goods and services on credit by the use of a credit card.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consequential amendments are also required to the act following changes to the Social Security Act 1991 to allow for the amalgamation of Jobsearch and Newstart Allowance with effect from 20 September 1996. The bill would provide for these consequential amendments.

         —In relation to this amendment, I think it is worth while to refer back to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee dated March 1995. Recommendation 3 of that report stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommends that the Family Court of Australia monitor parenting plans when filed in the Registry. The Court should make rules specifying the information required in the plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely what this amendment seeks to do. As I recall it, in the course of the hearings in relation to this bill, the Law Council of Australia put to the committee the assertion that in property matters the court inquires into deeds of agreement reached between the parties to see that they are just and equitable. When you come to children, I think it was Senator Spindler who said that they should not be treated just like chattels. When you look at the requirements made of the Family Court in relation to real property and personal property, I would say that the requirements should be more onerous when looking at the welfare of children. Mr Watt, who is Deputy Chairman of the family law section of the Law Council of Australia, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are talking about people being able to enter into parenting plans or obtain consent orders simply by filing with the courts an agreement that has been signed around the kitchen table . . . That is exactly what is happening under this proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . When parties separate, or even just upon disagreement arising within the marriage before they separate, they can say this is what is going to happen to the children and, under the bill as it presently stands, they can write it down on a piece of paper and, provided they sign it, one of the parties can then take that off to the court and register it as a parenting plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Watt went on to say, and this was echoed by Senator Vanstone earlier, that this then has effect as if it were an order of the court. Of course, other consequential matters flow from that. The scrap of paper is no longer a scrap of paper. It has the full effect and force of a Family Court order.

         I would submit to the Senate that what we have is a situation where, if the plan is to have that effect, then the court should have the ability to inquire into the best interests of the children. When one looks at the amendment moved by Senator Vanstone, proposed section 63D firstly provides for independent legal advice, which I think is a very good idea. Senator Vanstone has more than adequately set out as to how one party may be in a more subordinate role to the other and therefore in need of separate advice, particularly in a relationship where one party exercises some degree of emotional control over the other. That is important to start with.

         Secondly, the court has to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child. That is imperative. Subsection (2) goes on to say that, in looking at what is likely to promote the best interests of the child, the court may have regard to the matters set out in subsection 68F(2). It sets out a whole raft of criteria that deal with what the court might hold to be in the best interests of the child. The age of the child, the health of the child and other aspects are dealt with there. If needs be, the court can inquire into the plan that has been put before it and, in doing so, can have regard to this whole range of criteria set out in 68F(2). That gives the court some important flexibility.

         I am not saying that every parenting plan that is presented to the court will require this. It won't. It may be that in 10 per cent or even in five per cent of cases the court will have to inquire further and address these issues. Even if it is in a minority of cases of the order I mentioned—such low percentages as five or 10—it is still important that the court have that ability to inquire further. That is absolutely essential when one looks at this.

         We have that requirement for property. The court has to make sure that any deed of agreement in relation to property is fair and equitable. Since the inception of the Family Law Act the court is placed in a position where it inquires behind the agreement that is placed before it. In a situation dealing with children, the matter becomes even more important. The best interests of the children must be taken into consideration and the court, in some cases, has to undertake an affirmative role in this regard.

        That is self-evident. Therefore, I submit that this amendment moved by Senator Vanstone incorporates the concerns mentioned by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Democrats in relation to the best interests of the children. It is an important aspect. That concern was raised before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee and is one which certainly had the strong support of the family law section of the Australian Law Council. For the variety of grounds I have put to the chamber, I commend this amendment and implore the government to once again assess its position in relation to this matter.

         When we are talking about children it is a little different to when we are talking about property. Property is disposed of once and for all. You say, `You have the house, you have the car, you have the farm,' and so on. The property is distributed among the two parties, and that is the end of it. To compare children to property is the wrong concept. To say we have to deal with the property in the correct way and, therefore, we have to deal with the children in an even more correct way misses the point, because children are not property.

The registrar or a judge could read through the plan and see whether it is right on the face of it and lets it go. To require this process to be gone through seems to be pretty  complicated.

I would like to add to something that Senator Spindler raised earlier when we were debating this matter prior the matters of public interest discussion. The point he raised was that the government might be happy with this arrangement for parenting plans and to have no scrutiny at all, not even the monitoring at a very low level that I think Senator Cooney is suggesting—and I will come to whether I agree with that or not. But the government would say, `Well, when one party fails to stick to the agreement, that is when the problem arises and that is when the court needs to come in.' Senator Cooney you were, in fact, emphasising that point yourself. You did not respond to a number of matters that were raised earlier in the debate—and I do not think you were here at that point, Senator Cooney; you were probably in your room listening—namely, if you have two parties of unequal strength and there are any consequences at all that hang on the agreement, then surely you want to ensure that the weaker party has some advice before entering into that agreement.

         There is nobody who is of the view that parties are always equal in matrimonial proceedings. It is pretty well a 100 per cent view that one party is weaker than the other; and if there are consequences that hang on the agreement being registered, then those parties should be independently advised. I do not assume that you would, generally speaking, disagree with that. If parties are going to register something in a court and consequences flow from it, they should have advice prior to doing that.

         Senator Cooney says, as I say, that when the problem arises the court will concern itself with what is in the best interests of the child. There are two points to make. Firstly, it is not only the interests of the child that are being looked at here. While they are paramount, it is the interests of the weaker party as well. We need to ensure that they are protected in terms of their access to the child. There are a whole range of things they might want some advice on. It is better to do that than have them realise, having signed an agreement, that they would have been better to have the advice on it.

         Secondly, let us not just focus on whether, if one party breaks the agreement, you are then going to the court to try to get enforcement proceedings—and we are satisfying ourselves that at least the court will then look at what is in the best interests of the child. Let us look at where the parties decide they want to easily change the agreement and they do not agree as to how it ought to be changed. That is the only time at which you say the court can come into it.

She might have got a job full time as opposed to part time; his income might have changed; he might want to move interstate—or whatever. A whole range of matters—I am sure you can list hundreds of them, Senator Cooney—can happen that mean the parties want to change the agreement, and one party may want to change it in a different way from that in which the other party wants to change it.

         Senator Cooney, I would be interested in hearing how easily you think that is done once this is registered as an order of the court. Let us assume for the sake of the argument that it is the weaker party—because that is always the one the law would be looking to protect—who wants to change the agreement because of changed circumstances and the stronger party does not. It may well be that that is at much more expense to the weaker party—and I understand the point you made about the expense of getting legal advice. And, if I say so myself, Senator Cooney, I thought you came very close to making some slightly disparaging remarks about the legal profession. I certainly hope I did not hear a glimmer of insult towards the profession in your remarks. You were certainly very limited in your praise as to what benefit might be available to parties if they did seek legal advice at an earlier stage.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the situation that I am raising, some circumstances have changed, the weaker party may want to change the agreement and the stronger party does not agree. I do not think you can assure us, Senator Cooney, that the weaker party would not in those circumstances have benefited from legal advice in the first place. The weaker party will be up for much greater costs than the initial advice in getting the agreement changed.

         I suppose it is similar to why I would advise someone to get legal advice before they make a will, instead of trotting down to their local stationery shop and filling in predetermined paragraph headings. The reason would be that it is only with some skill in a particular area that you can look to the future. Plenty of people make the mistake of making a will and listing such assets that they have now and not putting appropriate remarks in to cover other assets that they acquire and what will happen with the rest of them. They do not adequately cater for what will happen if one of the parties to whom they were leaving something dies before they do. I am sure you understand what I am saying, Senator Cooney. Someone trained in an area understands how circumstances might change. They have seen it day after day, with client after client.

         Therefore, I would say that they are in a far better position to advise someone at the commencement of making an agreement: `what are you going to do if you want the kids to change school or he wants to move interstate?' They need to try to sort some of these things out at the beginning. The consequences of not doing that are that, when you want to change the agreement, the stronger party is going to use all the force that he or she can, and the weaker party is going to have much greater expense in trying to get that agreement changed.

         So I just put it to you that the only reason for wanting advice is not the paramount interests of the child. They are paramount, but it is also the interests of the weaker party, because there are consequences for both parties of registering. If you say, Senator Cooney, `Well, no, there is not. There is really nothing to it; it is just a pretty stamp that is put on it by the court,' then why are we bothering to make the change? I do not think you were suggesting that it is nothing more than a stamp. It has the imprimatur of a federal court on the agreement. It becomes a court order. Rights and duties and obligations are affected.

         I would have thought, Senator Cooney, that in all those circumstances you would have agreed that the parties should be independently advised. I thought you would have agreed to that because you know, as just about everyone else does, that there is always a weaker party in these types of negotiations. So I would be interested if Senator Cooney or the minister might like to advise as to what the anticipated costs and procedures would be for changing an agreement when one party does not want to change it. That may cast some light on the whole discussion.

That, to me, seems appropriate. If you somehow believe that that is not correct, that we have been ill advised, I am sure we would be happy to listen. Senator Spindler has shifted his position a bit, and I have shifted mine a bit in order to come to some agreement here, partly through different understandings of what it was that we each wanted to achieve. If you are so convinced, then perhaps you could either offer an alternative or explain why the combination of those two does not end up the same as consent orders.

         That seems to me to be the appropriate arrangement. Do not try to implement a system where everybody who separates and divorces somehow comes to the conclusion that they must register their parenting plan. Why should they? If they do not have a problem with it, if they are happy that as time goes by they can resolve the disagreements they may have about changed circumstances, let them remain unregistered. We are talking about a different category—a category of people who have come, presumably, with some difficulty to this plan and want some confidence that the other party is going to stick to it. It can otherwise be described as wanting some consequences hanging on the agreement—that means rights and duties are affected. That means, Senator Cooney, you ought to be interested in the rights, duties and obligations of the weaker party.

But there is, I think, a genuine concern here about the power imbalance that could obtain where people are influenced unduly by the other party; where they are overshadowed by the knowledge of the personality of the other party; or where they have not got requisite knowledge, expertise and facility in negotiation. Even where they do have these things, I think it is important that the court does not renege on its obligation to give priority to the welfare of the child.

         There are two other options or changes that I will float at this stage to see whether they find any favour with other people in the chamber—with Senator Vanstone or with the government. The first is in (b) where the amendment currently asks for `independent legal advice'. I wonder whether we could consider `independent advice by a court counsellor' as an alternative to `independent advice by the legal practitioner'. That would certainly address the cost question to a large extent. One would imagine that if a court counsellor is prepared to append her or his signature to the statement, they would have carefully considered the position that is being adopted by the party in becoming a signatory to the agreement. That may be one alteration that goes some way towards minimising the cost factor.

         The second amendment that I would like to suggest is in (3) which currently reads, `The Rules of Court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court.'. I wonder whether we can change that to, `The plan may be assessed by the court.' That means that the court could have the option of not going to a full hearing, but making a rule that the registrar of the court peruses the agreement on a range of however many checkpoints you want to establish to test it.

         So that option would be open to the court. It does not exclude the court's capacity to have the case before it. I guess the rules could provide that if the registrar is unhappy or uncomfortable, the parenting agreement could be referred to the court for a full hearing. I would imagine that would be necessary in only very few cases. Just to formalise what I am saying, I propose an amendment to (b) to the effect that `legal' in line three be removed so that it reads, `with independent advice as to the meaning and effect of the plan and that is signed by the legal practitioner or court counsellor who provided that advice.'

         I believe there is one fundamental principle; that is, anybody ought to have access to the justice system should they wish, without engaging a solicitor. I say that as a solicitor, and I would say to the people who do so that they are foolish and stupid, but they ought to have that fundamental right. Those of us who have been engaged in Family Court trials where people are self-represented know how very tedious it can become. Nevertheless, that ought be a fundamental right. I stand by that.

         It is a question, I suppose, as to how much the government and legislation are to spoon-feed people.

It is very foolish to make a will that way; and, at a later time, I have had to try to fix some of those wills in my office. But I would not be in favour of making those forms illegal and saying that you can only ever have a will if it is prepared for you by a legal practitioner. There is a fairly fundamental point in that and it is, I suppose, the basis on which I make my comments.

The reality is that the vast majority of parents do not use the facilities of the Family Court to determine issues of custody and other matters. They sort those things out for themselves.

         If it can be shown that an order was made under duress then there are the provisions in the Family Law Act to undo that at a later stage. The plan that is being proposed in this bill is basically a plan on the basis of agreement between the parties. If agreement can be achieved, I would have thought that a clause, in a standard plan which says that there was no fraud or duress applied, might be an appropriate way of dealing with that. The rules of court may possibly determine the particular form that the registration ought to have.

         I am quite attracted to Senator Spindler's suggestion. Before any matter comes before the Family Court these days, the parties have to have a counselling session before the first mention date of the matter in the court. Therefore, a counsellor is already involved. It should not be beyond the wit of an independent counsellor to determine whether or not there is some power imbalance between the parties and whether somebody has been bulldozed into signing the parenting plan. As a result, Senator Spindler's amendment does have some merit. I would accept that as a compromise.

         My starting point would still be that, if mum and dad while they are together can come to an agreement on how their children ought to be looked after, if they separate and can still come to such an agreement why on earth would we not allow them to simply register that with a court?

         I understand the argument of the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone), that we are asking for the imprimatur of the court and, therefore, it would be appropriate for the court to satisfy itself that it is an appropriate plan. But, having said that, I would hope and wish that the court would not involve itself in any detailed analysis. The logical flowthrough would be that, if, just because they are separated, you are going to check up on parents who voluntarily come to the court with an agreement, why on earth do we not involve the courts when the parents are together? Why don't we worry about the weaker party within the family unit while it is still together?

         That argument, if you work it backwards, has some very concerning aspects to it in relation to the family unit. As bad as families may be, I believe that they usually are the best place to bring up kids. Much as counsellors, lawyers, et cetera, may be well meaning, mum and dad usually know best. At the end of the day, if mum and dad can agree about the way the kids ought to be brought up, I would say that 99.9 per cent of the time that is the best way for it to go, especially for the children. If the kids know that mum and dad worked out this agreement together, and mum and dad are both happy with it, then I am sure their lives will be so much easier when they have contact with the parent with whom they do not reside on a full-time basis.

         I turn to the suggestion made by Senator Spindler for proposed section 63D.(3): `The Rules of Court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court.' I think you have suggested the deletion of the word `registered' and to replace it with `assessed.' I wonder whether, possibly, we ought to have both, because the rules of the court possibly ought to deal with the way that it is registered. I agree that, possibly, the rules of court ought to determine the way that it is assessed as well.

I hope then that the rules of the court would not make it too difficult for the way the court may register a plan. That is the only contribution that I wish to make on that. I trust that we may be able to get some agreement on that. I see that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and the shadow Attorney-General are in deep discussion. I hope that some compromise on a bipartisan basis can be achieved. I have run out of wind, but I do not know if we have actually reached an agreement which might satisfy most people in the chamber.

         —In answer to what Senator Abetz said, I think the difference should be very obvious. When a family is intact and not going through the traumatic stage of separation, of course there is no reason to intervene or get the court to take any interest in it unless, of course, the children are, for instance, abused. That difference is accepted. We should not forget that there are well in excess of 20,000 cases of child abuse that have occurred in any one year within a family setting; but that is another story.

         What we are dealing with is not an intact family. It is a family that has split up, where the partners have separated and the future wellbeing of the children is very much more at risk because they are now unlikely to have both parents caring for them continuously. I know that these amendments, in total, seek to maintain an involvement of both parties; the Democrats welcome that. Nevertheless, it is a traumatic period. Another situation is where the adults involved are concerned with setting themselves up and looking after their own interests in the post-separation period. We need to make sure that whatever arrangements they make in an effort to set themselves up do not disadvantage the children.

That really burdens the process enormously. Unless someone has a point of view that that is not what you are doing and unless someone can tell me that the words `assessed by a court' do not mean assessed by a court then I think you ought to delete the second part of the amendment.

         —I am happy to set the minister's mind at ease. Subsection (c) says that the court must be satisfied that the arrangements set out are likely to promote the best interests of the child. Subsection (c) addresses the mechanics by saying that the rules of the court may deal with how the plan may be assessed. I interpret that as meaning that the court, through its rules, may determine the manner of satisfying subsection 63D(1)(c). That is certainly the intention.

         —We still have a problem that you are imparting a process of assessment by the court as opposed to a process of registration by the court. That is the problem that we have with 63D(1)(c). In the spirit of compromise, what I am suggesting is that you stick with the advice at the time of registration, which is what has been pushed by those on the other side, and not encumber the process with a further assessment process by the court in each individual case. That will impose a burden not only on the process but also on the people involved who will have to go through the court process with each individual case. I think Senator Abetz is picking up on this point and I hope others are as well.

         —With the word `registered' does the minister envisage the court making rules as to the format of the parenting plan and the information that would be required to be included in the plan in order for the plan to be registered, much like the section 86 maintenance agreement where you simply went to the counter and filed the agreement? In the preamble to those agreements certain things have to be set out such as the date of the marriage, the age of the parties and the age of the children. Basically, the history of the matter is set out in the preamble. The agreement goes on to say, `Having this in mind, the parties have now come to this agreement.' Therefore, the court is able to make an assessment of the document itself. Is that what you are envisaging by the term `registered'?

         Subsection (3) simply deals with giving the court the capacity to make rules as to how the plan should be assessed and registered. It simply means that if the court wishes to ask the registrar to use a checklist as a first step it may do so. We are not tying the hands of the court. If the court should decide that at a certain point these lists may be referred to it by the registrar it could do so through the rules of court.

         In relation to the first matter, Senator Spindler is now saying that it does not have to be independent legal advice and that it can be independent advice. As I understand it, he is saying that it could be a legal practitioner that offers that advice or it could be a court counsellor. He is suggesting that amendment because he is persuaded by Senator Cooney's argument—do not be so humble Senator Cooney and shake your head—that the cost to legal aid might be so phenomenal that we should not insist that lawyers come in at this stage and that a court counsellor has some experience in these matters, et cetera.

You are happy for the rights, duties and obligations of the weaker party to be registered as a court order without that weaker party having independent legal advice. The consequence of saying yes to that is that you are happy to set up court counsellors as paralegals that can take over advising in custody and access law unless there is going to be a dog fight, or until there is a dog fight, and then the lawyers come and clean it up—and I realise that some people would say that the lawyers made it worse in the beginning.

         But the consequence of what you are doing is to say that in custody and access matters people need to get some advice and you frankly do not care if it is from a court counsellor, who might have training in social work or psychology—I am not sure what training they do have—but who, as I understand it, is not required to be a family law practitioner. You are happy for them to have that independent advice from someone on the basis of cost, which I understand.

But I do want to isolate the fact that you are actually saying that you will allow non-legally trained people to give what is in essence legal advice. You do not make it non-legal advice because you scratch that word out here. That is what they need: advice as to their rights, duties and obligations if they sign an agreement and as to whether they could get a better deal for themselves if they held out further.

         You are saying that it is satisfactory for court counsellors to give that advice. You are setting up a sort of paralegal profession for advice on custody and access matters provided the parties in the end agree and a family law practitioner might say that what they really mean is `provided the parties don't know any better'. Once they do know better, because they think they have been done over and could have got a better deal in the beginning, or once the circumstances change, then they will require legal advice.

         When a person makes an application to a court in relation to custody, before the first turn date there is a requirement that they have to attend a court counsellor in any event. Here, Senator Spindler's amendment is saying that, if that is the case, and if the person wants to have the parenting plan approved by the court, why not have independent advice from a court counsellor? The person still has the choice of course as to whether they have legal advice or not. But that perhaps gives some aspect of choice. It reflects a situation which is in existence to some extent at the present time. Also, I think it could perhaps alleviate any potential burden placed on the legal aid resources, which are currently taxed to the limit.

         To that extent, I can see merit in it. I cannot agree with the deletion of section 63D(1)(c) which the minister mentioned. It states that the court must be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child. I think it is important that that be kept in there and that it remain a guide—more than a guide: a beacon, as it were—to the court in how it exercises its powers under this section.

         I know that there is an overarching requirement that the best interests of the child should be looked at, but it does not hurt to state the obvious. I know that we will come to this argument when we get to the Greens' amendments in relation to inserting the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In any event, this is an area where the court is exercising its powers directly in relation to how children are looked after and how parents who have separated deal with how the children should be looked after. I think the inclusion of paragraph (c) is important.

         With respect to the second part of Senator Spindler's amendment dealing with the registration and assessment of a plan and how the rules might cater for it: I am satisfied by the minister's answer that in the registration of a plan the rules of the court could provide for the provision of adequate information by which the court can be satisfied. That is self-regulating. In its own rules the court can state what it feels is necessary to provide for that aspect. By way of preamble it can say what the parties need to put in their plan.

         It does not prescribe what sort of agreement they come to. It prescribes as a prerequisite for registration what information the parties bring to the court. That is essential. That is in the registration aspect. I think that that could well provide an adequate safeguard in relation to the court exercising its powers in this regard. On that basis, I would be quite happy with just the word `registered' remaining as is and the aspect of assessment not being included, but on the proviso that these rules will provide for that.

        We have those two legs. I have maintained the leg of the mediator, which I know Senator Spindler is not inclined to support at this stage. In his subsection (3) Senator Spindler asks that the court be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interest of the child. Senator Vanstone has put to me—and I think this is Senator Spindler's view as well—that we are not talking about a full-blown hearing in respect to each one; we are talking about a process where a form 12A can be asserted.

         I am suggesting that, instead of Senator Spindler's words, we pick up the empowering words in the current legislation which provide for the form 12A process so that we have consistency in that respect as well. We can pick up the court's interaction and intervention by a similar process to the form 12A. It is going to take a little time to work that out and it might be best if we defer this particular aspect until tomorrow morning.

         —I am a bit uncomfortable with narrowing the process simply to a form 12A process. It seems to me that the formulation that we have—the rules of the court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court—gives the court the possibility to use the form 12A process at one stage, but it does not exclude the court saying, `If the form 12A discloses a problem we want to have it looked at by the court.' In other words, it is a little more flexible. I would be uncomfortable with simply limiting it to that process and setting it in concrete.

         I would like to ask a question. I would like the question to be confirmed by the officers. It is the question that was asked by Senator Ellison. In the formulation that we had before, where the rules of court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court, it enables the court to make rules as to the manner in which the parenting plan is to be assessed. In other words, does it give the court the possibility to have a rule which says in the first instance that a form—call it 12A—will be assessed by the registrar, and then subsequently the court may say that it needs to come before the court if the registrar reports that the plan is not satisfactory? I would just like to clarify whether the wording `registered in a court' enables the court to make a rule that provides several options.

         In respect to your point, Senator Ellison, all I can say is that we are talking about two different concepts here. You are talking about imparting something in the process at the start; we have been resisting that in terms of external legal advice and all that. We what we have in the legislation as an alternative is subsection 63E(5), which states that the court must not enforce the child welfare provisions if it considers that to do so would be contrary to the best interests of a child. That has been our response so far, and we are obviously moving away from that in the discussions we have had in the last half hour or so.

         Can I also say that we will finish up with an inconsistency here, because in the legislation, for instance, agreements for maintenance can be lodged without all this prerequisite of advice and whatever. Just recognise that we will be setting up a two-tier system: one in respect of child planning arrangements and another in respect of maintenance arrangements—both of which would encompass maintenance arrangements or could potentially do so. Anyway, that is the path the chamber wants to go down and we will try to facilitate the wording and, hopefully, come up with it by the morning. I do not know if there is much more we can discuss on this, Senator. If there isn't, we can flick it off and move on to the next of Senator Spindler's amendments.

         —My understanding both from Senator Neal and also the advisers is that that particular provision refers to the capacity of the parents to register, not the obligation of the court to either register or not. The `may' confers power capacity on parents to do so, if they so choose—remembering, of course, that in a huge range of cases parents choose not to so register.

         One of the problems I have got with the proposal being put up this afternoon is that, in my mind, it will force a lot of people not to go through this extra process and they will not register the agreements with the court. Senator Spindler does not seem to be concerned about this. He is more concerned about providing jobs for lawyers.

         —Can I just pursue that further. Minister, are you saying that the law is that, even if the parenting plan is of such a shonky nature that the court or registrar is concerned about it, they would still have to sanction it? Surely there is an inherent—and that was the second limit in the question—jurisdiction within the court to make a determination.

I would have thought there would be an inherent jurisdiction in the court in any event to check these matters out. But I would just like to have that clarified.

         —I think I can do that as well. You have to look at this in the context of the totality of the picture—that is, some people choose to register; some don't. In terms of registration, the process that has been anticipated here is one that would allow for formal lodgment, for instance. It would only be when a person—parent or otherwise—had problems with the actual parenting plan being enforced that there would be capacity for the court to knock a plan out.

         Proposed section 63(5) states that the court must not enforce the child welfare provision if it considers that to do so would be contrary to the best interests of the child. What Senator Abetz is saying in one sense is right. It is an automatic system of registration. Enforcement is the part where the court has a role to play when people are not happy with the enforcement capacity.

         But this is not in isolation. We are talking about other aspects of this act, which have been in force for quite a long time, where the process allows for the automatic registration of forms of arrangements. It is only when they come a cropper that people then go back to court and seek to revisit them or not have some aspects of them enforced. For instance, the maintenance arrangements fall in that category. Remember that, when it comes to children—I would be hazarding a guess—a huge number of arrangements made in respect of them are not lodged in any formal way with the courts. It is a bigger picture. What the committee tried to do in its deliberations in putting this aspect up was to focus on the court having the capacity to intervene when people are not happy with what they may have committed themselves to.

         The minister is now telling us that a parenting plan can be sanctioned by the court and that it does not have to have regard to the best interests of the child. That only arises if there is a punch-up between the parents. If that is the case, I would be greatly concerned about that. I wonder whether overnight the government cannot look at it and see whether we can put in a provision which states that the court have regard to the best interests of the child at all times in the registration of such a parenting plan. That would reflect proposed subsection C, which was originally in Senator Vanstone's proposed amendment.

         Another point is that we are talking about a voluntary system. People do not have to register planning arrangements for children. You have to be careful that, in imposing a process which could be expensive and cumbersome, you may be driving a lot more people out of this net that you would want to be in it. There is some value not just for the people involved in their being able to have their agreements registered. For instance, some schools would like to have evidence of which parent they should contact so that children can be picked up. The planning registration system allows for that to act as a basis for notification.

But if that is not going to occur, then the argument for 63D(1)(b)(i) and (ii) become very strong indeed.

        I had the pleasure of making a visit to this area earlier this year and was extensively briefed on the management and the challenges facing the wet tropics area by Mr Peter Hitchcock, the executive director. Andrew McKenzie, the manager of community relations, was able to spend some time with me showing me some areas which were of particular interest and I certainly appreciated the consideration that he showed. Also, among others, Dr Vicki Patmore, who is a program coordinator, was also able to brief me on a variety of aspects of the management of the wet tropics.

         The report, I believe, is certainly one which many people who are interested in the heritage areas will be interested to read. There are some points in the report. I have not had a chance to read the report in full; but it is interesting to look at the interest that the wet tropics area is creating in this country.

         On page 29, the report looks at the number of visitors to the wet tropics area. For example, in 1993, a baseline visitor use survey estimated there were some 4.7 million visits to the wet tropics world heritage area and, of this, some 1.5 million visits, or 32 per cent, were by people on commercial tours and some 3.2 million were independent visitors; and 48 per cent of visits were made by local residents.

         I found my visit to the area most worthwhile. I commend the work done in the wet tropics area. I know that there are many challenges up there and it is a very large area to manage. I hope that more and more Australians have the chance to visit this quite unique part of our country.

        This report attempts to paint a rather positive picture of the state of the Department of Social Security. But, unfortunately for them, it is a picture with a large number of cracks. On a closer inspection of the report—it is a rather large report that we only received today along with about 70 other reports, as my colleague said—we find a lot of waste, and goals or aims which have not been met.

         This annual report comes hot on the heels of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit that was tabled last Tuesday, which exposed massive inefficiency and the potential to save millions upon millions of dollars. In fact, it said that in the range of $30 million to $80 million could be saved just through efficiency improvements within regional offices—the offices out there in the local communities. The audit report also revealed that if those efficiencies were taken on board and achieved, there would also be efficiencies in client services. So not only would there be savings in money but also the clients would not have to stand in queues, go from one queue to the other or fill out innumerable forms. There are a number of ways in which those savings could be made, and I talked about those when the Auditor-General's report was released.

         I turn to the report of the Department of Social Security where it refers to performance standards for 1994-95. We see, for example, that the national standard for teleservice centres is one minute from initial response to be referred to an action officer. In 1994-95, a target was set that 85 per cent of cases would at least get to an action officer in one minute. In 1993-94, the actual achievement was 57 per cent; this year, it was 38 per cent—they have gone down. Anybody who has tried to ring the Department of Social Security would know that you are just put on hold. The other day when I tried to ring up to make an inquiry—they did not know I was a senator—I was told, `You're in a queue and there's an 18-minute wait at least with 35 calls ahead of you.' So much for the one-minute response time! We have seen that in 1994-95 the achievement rate with the standard has gone down on the year before.

         The standard of reply time for ministerial correspondence has also gone down. The 1994-95 target for answering parliamentary questions was 100 of them. In 1993-94 it achieved 83 and this year it was 70. The target for meeting the standard for financial recovery prosecutions was 70. In 1993-94 it achieved 58 and this year it was 47. This is a department that received a two per cent pay increase in anticipation of productivity gains. What were they going to do? They were going to be more efficient and they were going to have fewer sick leave days.

         I tried to find out about absenteeism in the report. If I go to the index at the back, do I find absenteeism? No, I do not find anything about absenteeism. When I search through I find absenteeism on page 310. We were told in estimates that absenteeism was on average something like 10 days a year before that productivity payment of two per cent. The departmental representatives said, `We'll get back to eight per cent, Senator. That'll give us a $6 million saving. The productivity payment cost $12 million. So we'll get half of it from getting our absenteeism back by two days.'

         But what did Social Security do? It went up to something like 12 days on average. For that productivity payment we got two more days of sick leave on average. We see in the report that the department says it is concerned about the increasing levels of absenteeism. It looks as though the department really has not got very far with absenteeism either.

         It is not a very happy report. I suppose the only area where I have seen some improvement is with the number of overpayments which were waived `due to administrative error and were in good faith'. Last year, the overpayments waived were $10.1 million and this year, $5.4 million—we have still had $15 million worth of errors in two years. The only place where I can see any gain in Social Security is in overpayments. The people handling that area ought to have credit where credit is due, but the rest of it leaves a lot to be desired. It says that, after 13 years, this Labor government has yet to bring in efficiencies that would make the Department of Social Security an efficient organisation.

        I want to draw attention to the question of consultants employed by departments. In this case, there has been a considerable decrease in the consultant numbers and costs compared with the Defence annual report for the previous year. The total paid for consultants in the latest financial year to 30 June 1995 was $12.5 million. Unfortunately, the report does not detail the comparable figure for the previous year, but it does state:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The significant decrease in the consultant numbers and costs compared to the Defence Annual Report 1993-94 is due to the following:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . the definitions for Consultants and Professional Service Providers (Contractors), were more clearly defined during the FY 1994-95 and approved by the Attorney-General's Department. This redefinition was to better reflect the reporting requirements and remove the confusion that previously existed in separating contractors and consultants.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say in passing that it seems to me extraordinary that there would be no strict comparison using the same criteria with the previous year so that the Senate can take a view of whether there has been either a genuine increase or a genuine decrease. I think it is grossly improper of the department to fail to do so. The next matter in justification for the significant decrease is as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . the Defence Financial Management Information System, which records all Defence payments—
       </para>
       <para>
        has simply lumped together, in terms of numbers, the total contract value of consultants because—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . In previous annual reports, the total contract number value was reported, thus showing possible amounts payable over future years.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, rather than individual years. As I say, it would be nice if we had a strict comparison. This leads me to the general question as to why on earth there is no list of consultants. This report says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The total number of consultants engaged has been reported, as opposed to individual consultancies reported in previous years . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        This appears to follow the decision by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that there be changes made in the way organisations report various matters in their annual reports. One of these is to take consultancy services out of the annual report and make it material available on request.

         The committee of which I am a member—the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee—expressed concern about this tactic. It is a tactic which clearly is aimed at not having these matters so up front as they have been in the past. Sure, they are available on request, but it seems to me that this is information that should be very publicly available either in the annual report or in an attachment to the annual report. In the estimates report of our committee last year—when this matter came up before us—we said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some of the information that may be held separately instead of included in annual reports consists of basic orientating and cross referencing information, which would add only a few pages to most annual reports such as relevant legislation and information on statutory authorities, non-statutory bodies and government companies in the portfolio. The committee considers that to omit this information from annual reports is a retrograde step. For example, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has several times commented on the difficulty of knowing what government controlled companies exist. The new rule in practice is likely to make it harder.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt about that. This new rule is offensive. There is a failure to provide details of consultancy services in annual reports. The departments are taking this prime ministerial departmental edict that they need not report as an instruction not to report. That is an improper interpretation.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I ask the departments to include this vital information in their reports in future or the Senate might be asked to take action to require departments to provide material, if not in their annual reports at least in attachments to their annual reports when they are tabled in the Senate. Naturally, I will be making that recommendation through our party room, in the hope that the Procedure Committee will require departments to come clean. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

I believe that the account in relation to the east coast tuna and billfish fishery which is contained in this report has been written in such a way as to gloss over the fact that AFMA has refused to act on one of the recommendations of the East Coast Tuna Management Advisory Committee.

         A number of major management issues were unresolved in the ECT&amp;BF and this led to a delay in the finalisation of a draft Management Plan for the fishery. Part of the difficulty in finalising future management arrangements was the sudden growth in the pelagic longline sector, in terms of new vessels entering the fishery through activation of latent effort and an expansion of commercial effort in the Coral Sea fishery.

        This is deliberately misleading, because ECTUNAMAC made a number of recommendations to AFMA in June of this year. I think the press release came out on about 21 June.

         One of those recommendations related to the taking of billfish by commercial tuna operators. That recommendation was very clear. The recommendation was that commercial tuna operators should be prohibited from taking billfish anywhere, either inside any of the management zones or outside any of the management zones—for example, inside or outside area E—if they were operating as commercial tuna fishermen; the reason being that we have seen a spate of cases where people have come into port with marlin in the boat and have said, `We caught the marlin outside area E.'

        This document is always awaited in this chamber just to see how many more consultants this government can stack on the staffs of ministers. It is an interesting issue—when a person is a consultant and why he is not employed as a usual member of staff; and some of those consultants have been on a minister's staff or the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for three or four years. Of course, Don Watson is one of those. This document does not list the salaries that these people are paid—that would be of considerable use—but I dare say that they can be obtained during the estimates process.

         My memory is that the Fraser government employed some three consultants in its final year. This document lists for the period 1994-95 and beyond some 49 consultants—a huge addition to the ministerial staff. When we go through these consultants—and I do not want to spend too much time of the Senate—we see, for example, that Senator Gareth Evans has employed a consultant, a Mr Kenneth Berry. I know nothing about Mr Kenneth Berry, but I notice that he is providing policy advice on a range of issues. From 22 February he has been completing a book for publication by the Commonwealth, examining the Australian peace initiative in Cambodia.

         Senator Evans has ceaselessly employed consultants to produce books and, presumably, this will be signed by Senator Evans and will be used as part of the old CV to big-note himself around the globe, and that will be an area which I will be asking questions on during the estimates process. Yes, Senator Collins, there have been quite a number of books produced by Senator Evans, at great expense to the taxpayer. If this government wants to produce papers, the consultants should be employed to produce white papers on government policy, not to produce CVs for Senator Evans to get another job with the United Nations.

         It is not to say that Australia II is in the same category with those; she is a remarkable yacht which achieved a remarkable sporting feat. For Australia, she is the only yacht that has been able to win the America's Cup in the United States. She broke the longest running hold on an international sporting trophy in the history of mankind. So Australia II is special. But I believe the great benefit of having Australia II move around from port to port is that so many more people will be able to appreciate the beauty and history of the boat and, very importantly, will gain the inspiration that Australia II can provide.

         Even though parochial Western Australians such as me like to claim the America's Cup win as a Western Australia victory, it is simply not accurate. There were many great Western Australians who contributed to the victory. If it was not for the vision of Alan Bond and his dedication to the pursuit of the holy grail of yachting over so many decades of his life, it would not have been possible. If it had not been for the dedication of other Western Australians such as the boat builder, Steve Ward; John Longley or Chink as he is known to his sailing mates and who was involved in all of the challenges; Skippy Lissiman; Ken Judge and Scotty McAllister—and I have probably forgotten some of my Western Australian sailing friends—we would not have won the cup off Newport on that famous and memorable morning in 1983.

         Of course, there were contributions made by great Australians from other parts of the country. We would not have won the cup if it had not been for the Victorian John Bertrand who was the exceptional skipper of that boat. We would not have won without the incredible commitment to the pursuit of that trophy by Sir James Hardy—from Senator Bolkus's state—over all his life. There were Sydneysiders such as Ben Lexcen—I have already mentioned him—a brilliant and great Australian, Hugh Treharne, the tactician and sail maker and another great Australian; and Phil Smidmore. I have probably forgotten lots, but I make the point that it was an Australian effort.

         I well remember those ads that Westpac ran with the great silver spanner that it designed to unbolt the cup. It would not have been possible without the national sponsorship of organisations such as Westpac. It was a national effort and I believe that rather than having a fight between Sydney and Perth about where Australia II should rest, we should look very closely at the idea of establishing this foundation so that Australia II can become a live exhibit, rather than gathering dust.

         I envisage that Australia II could be used for sail training purposes and to inspire younger Australians to increase sports participation. Also, programs could be developed to ensure that disadvantaged young Australians could have access to Australia II and share the inspiration that win gave us back in 1983. There are many young Australians who will not remember those bleary nights and early mornings ten years ago when we watched the images of Australia II crossing the finish line in the fog to win that great trophy.

         The other great advantage—and I will conclude on this because my time in the debate is about to expire—is that Australia II being mobile could be taken to strategic points in Australia where other great events may be on and where Australia II could add to Australia's international reputation. One of the most significant of those will clearly be the Olympics in the year 2000 in Sydney. I think it is only sensible that she be there for that time. I commend this idea to the Senate and hope that the National Maritime Museum, all political parties, the federal government, the governments of Western Australia and New South Wales, and the private sector will give this idea very strong consideration. I think it could be good for our nation.

         —I want to continue some remarks that I commenced on an earlier occasion regarding the Western Australian Court government's first wave industrial relations legislation. In particular, I want to examine the principles that underline it and the experience of workers in my state under those policies. I do this because of the endorsement expressed by Mr Howard, the coalition leader, in the parliament recently of those principles, and the expectation that federal Liberal policy will mirror the Western Australian example.

         Tonight, I would like to give an example of an experience in a private child-care centre in Western Australia, which I will refer to as example F. Workers were previously employed under the Children's Services (Private) Award 1990, but have been subject to offers of workplace agreements throughout this year. They have been spreading throughout private child-care centres—mainly to untrained workers because, in fact, trained workers are in high demand and enjoy considerable bargaining powers as a result. These workplace agreements have been used to target young, untrained women who are readily available in the current employment market.

         While the workplace agreements offered reflect different wage rates, many see the offer as a move to free up workers' terms and conditions as private centres look to expand their opening hours to include Saturdays and Sundays, and evenings. One of the major problems in this industry is that under the legislation employers are allowed to employ persons as casuals for periods of 10, 15, or 20 years. There is no limit on the time a person can be employed as a casual.

         As a result of that, employees are not entitled to sick leave, annual leave or any of the other normal conditions of employment that we have come to expect as part of the normal minimum entitlements of workers in Australia. In addition, the agreements seek to downgrade other conditions or eliminate them in the workplace agreement as compared with the award. These are having a major impact on the income that workers can earn under this arrangement.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The ordinary hours of work under the award are 38 hours per week between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Shifts are up to a maximum of eight hours. Work in excess of those hours is paid as overtime. Under the workplace agreement, ordinary hours are increased to 40 hours per week, to be worked at any time, Monday to Friday inclusive. There is no time limit on the length of the shift. Under the award, overtime rates are paid where more than eight hours are worked in a day, or where more than an average of 38 hours are worked in a week. Rates start at time and a half for the first two hours followed by double time. The workplace agreement provides for time off in lieu where more than 40 hours are worked in a week, but there is no overtime rate or, in fact, any wage rate for overtime hours. So, if you work more hours, there is no overtime provision at all. The only option under this agreement is that you may get time off in lieu.

         I will give an example of a woman, say, called Paula who is an untrained child-care worker. She signed a workplace agreement because that is what was offered at her workplace. It seemed that it was not going to make too much difference because the hourly rates were fairly similar. However, two weeks later her shifts were changed from eight hours from Monday to Friday to 10 hours on any four days of the week, Monday to Friday. The award provided that for working these shifts she would have received $432.60 per week, including the overtime rate. Under the workplace agreement, Paula earned only $391.50, representing nearly a 10 per cent loss in her income as a result of her signing the workplace agreement.

         In terms of public holidays, penalty rates are double time and half under the award, but public holidays are not included in the workplace agreement. The workplace agreement is for a period of five years with annual wage reviews, but the basis of the review is not detailed. The 17 1/2 per cent loading on annual leave—which is contained in the award—is not contained in the workplace agreement, which pays annual leave only at the ordinary rate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In terms of sick leave, while both the award and the agreement provide for 10 days paid sick leave per year, leave not taken accumulates under the award, but it is forfeited each year under the workplace agreement. Generally, the award does not require medical certificates for an absence of two days or less. Medical certificates must be provided under the workplace agreement for any absence, including part of a day. One of the largest sections in the workplace agreement relates to the conditions that apply to unpaid annual leave. What it recognises is that a large majority or a large number of these workers will be classified as casuals and will not be entitled to annual leave, no matter how long they work for one employer. The document goes to great lengths to set out the conditions under which people will be allowed access to the only leave they will be able to get, which is unpaid annual leave. That is another example of what is occurring to workers in Western Australia.

         As I said, these workers are mainly young women without any particular training. They are at the mercy of an employer saying, `You either sign this workplace agreement and accept these conditions or there is no job here for you.' There is no choice for them to go onto an award. In fact, as I highlighted earlier, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia is sending out to employers wage rates which contain information of how to pay under the award. But in a big box at the top of the wages schedule, it says, `You can replace this award with a workplace agreement.' Therefore they are making sure that employers understand that they do not have to pay the award in Western Australia; they do not have to be bound by these minimum wage rates; they can just replace them with workplace agreements. The schedule, of course, makes no mention of minimum employment conditions; it just advises them that if they do not like the award they can get out of it.

         In the short time available to me, I want to address some of the Liberal Party paranoia about the ALP television advertisement, launched in Western Australia recently, about the Liberals' policy on industrial relations. The coalition has continued to assert that it is Labor's lies, but I have here the transcript of what the ad actually says. It makes a number of assertions, but there are two major ones. Firstly, it states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Court Liberal government has set the minimum weekly wage at $317.10. A family can't live on that!
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I do not think anyone would dispute that. The Western Australian minister had a minimum wage recommended to him by the Industrial Relations Commission and by an independent expert. He cut the recommended rate—reduced it and set it at $317.10, despite the recommendation from his own expert and from the independent umpire of the Industrial Relations Commission. So I do not see why people would be upset by that assertion. The second major assertion is:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Penalty rates. Sick leave. Unfair dismissal protection. And Superannuation . . . could all go—with no compensation.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are under a heading `Under a John Howard Liberal Government'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am happy to debate that assertion in this chamber at any time with those opposite. The exhibits that I table today of workplace agreements that are actually in force in Western Australia prove that penalty rates, sick leave and any entitlements to overtime and shift penalties have all been eroded under the Western Australian Liberal government's industrial relations system. I have set out in chapter and verse where those workers have had those entitlements to penalty rates, annual leave and sick leave removed from them. They have been made to sign workplace agreements; they have been told to sign or resign or told, `Sign or you don't get the job.' They no longer have paid annual leave, penalty rates or paid sick leave. That is a fact.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Despite the secrecy surrounding the Court Liberal government's workplace agreements—it is very hard to get copies of these things because they have very strict secrecy provisions—it is on the record in this parliament of what has occurred to workers in Western Australia. For the Liberal Party to take genuine offence at the ad, they have to establish that it is not true. Clearly, it is true: registered workplace agreements take away workers' penalty rates and sick leave and reduce their unfair dismissal protection. In terms of superannuation, I am not sure what the Liberal Party is saying. But certainly the second wave industrial legislation introduced into the state parliament attacks the worker's right to choose. It gives the employer a veto over the choice of superannuation funds by employees, particularly over any collective choice that they currently enjoy.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The last assertion in the ALP advertisement is:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Working people simply can't afford to go backwards with the Liberals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Quite frankly, that is established by the record. John Howard has endorsed the WA principles and the WA industrial relations approach. It has been proven that people are suffering, that their incomes are being reduced and that the things that we took for granted in this country, such as paid sick leave and paid annual leave, are not being granted to workers, some of whom have worked five or 10 years with the same employer. They have lost those rights under the Liberals' IR policy.

         —I wish to speak about the Affirmative Action Agency annual report for 1995 which was tabled in the parliament yesterday. In that report it was claimed by the Affirmative Action Agency that the RSPCA, of which I am the patron, had not complied with section 19 of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act because it did not provide adequate information in its progress report. In fact, the RSPCA did provide the information in consultation with an adviser, R.B. Bailey of Employee Relations Pty Ltd, who advised that the information provided would be adequate. But the Affirmative Action Agency appeared not to be happy with that.

         Section 3(4) of the act states that employees are not required to take any action which is incompatible with the principle that employment matters should be dealt with on merit. I think everyone would agree that in this case—I will elaborate on it in a minute—people have been dealt with on merit within the RSPCA and that there are more affirmative action programs going there than just about anywhere else. The RSPCA has consulted with the Affirmative Action Agency all through this process and it can only be assumed that even the best results are not good enough for the agency.

         The Affirmative Action Agency was established in the main to `improve career opportunities for women in business'. On any scenario the RSPCA provides more career opportunities than any business or charity. Why is the RSPCA being singled out when, clearly, it is a good affirmative action organisation? Far from being praised for its efforts, it is being labelled as a non-complying organisation.

The RSPCA employs more women at all levels of management than does anyone else. For example, it has a board of nine people of whom five are women. The chair of the board is a woman. By the way, the executive director of the RSPCA is a male but the deputy director is a female.

         What concerns me in this debate on the forest industry and the use of native forests, be they old-growth or any age, is the fact that a particular group of conservatives or green groups have chosen to try and employ and maybe cajole certain people within the church to lend support to their argument.

        That defies the principle I spoke about before because it was in the early days that we used much more than we use today in terms of a per capita operation. They go on to say:

        Again I remind them of the fact that many human beings in the early days relied very heavily on the use of timber for their homes. I do not think it is a sin to provide your family and yourself with a home whether it be built from timber or some other material. It goes on to say:

        I raise with those people—and not the churches generally because they have generally distanced themselves from this particular letter and the claims in it—that if it is morally wrong, when they go to the church in which they conduct their sermons they should have a look around them and study the furniture and fittings within the church. They are very beautiful and in a majority of cases would have been made from timber—timber that has come from old-growth or native forests.

         The signatories to the letter also said that they were speaking as individuals and were not giving an official view of the church. That is good because it would be very concerning if it was an official position of a church, as Archbishop D'Arcy said, to take the position of putting an end to a person's employment.

         As I said, it is a sad state of affairs that at least some members or clergy of the church have become entwined in this national debate with regard to what we do in terms of the preservation of our forests on the one hand and the utilisation of them on the other. I do not think those people would have necessarily signed the letter had they been fully versed and fully aware of all the circumstances and all the parts of the debate.

         Also, we are endeavouring to deliver to the people working and the companies operating in the forest industry an industry that is both sustainable and can actually be developed into a bigger and better industry. We need to do that because we know that there is an ever increasing demand for timber product and, I stress, an ever decreasing capacity to meet that demand.

         The government, as senators will know, is considering the issue of woodchip licences. The people of Australia generally do not like to export woodchips because of the perception that has been created by a very successful public campaign. Nevertheless, it is an integral part of an overall forest operation that ensures that we can utilise to the nth degree the wood we take from the forest. We have the capacity to much improve the way in which we utilise the wood we take from our forests and also much increase the value that is placed upon those trees that we take from the forests.

         When the government finally makes its decision with regard to how we issue the new woodchip licences for 1996, it is imperative that that fact is fully taken account of and we issue those licences in a way that will maximise the social and economic benefit not only to this country but also to each state as each state has different forest industry applications. I would just like to say in closing that I hope the people who signed the letter will reconsider their position in light of the concern that has been expressed by the churches themselves and by other leaders within the church.

         —Very briefly, I want to say that I am very concerned about the fact that the new reporting requirements imposed by the Department of Finance on various Commonwealth departments, such as the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, mean that the list of Australian organisations and people receiving grants is no longer published. For example, the sports rorts would not be publicly presented to this parliament under the new rules that apply.

         I have already mentioned consultancy services being hidden under the new rules but now we have the situation where, for example, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories has a page in its annual report headed `Material available on request' and underneath is the word `grants'. They have decided not to print, for example, the $1,700,000 provided to 61 national state and regional conservation organisations this year. All we get is the fact that these grants are being made. The report states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Details are available from the Department on request.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, one should not have to ask and wait to find out from the department what these sorts of grants are. As a general reporting principle it is grossly inadequate simply to say what the grants are for this year because one wants to see the comparison with the previous year. In this annual report that comparison is not given. For example, the department states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Details of consultants engaged . . . are available from the Department on request. The total number of consultancies engaged was 349 at a total cost of $8 609 628.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no comparison and, as I said, no list of who they were. This is of particular importance because I noticed last Sunday's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sun-Herald

        stated in an article:

        New reporting rules are helping Canberra bureaucrats hide the number of consultants hired—despite a report showing they cost a staggering $342 million last year with their numbers rising by almost 500 per cent in the past decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt this is the year of the consultant. It has also been the decade of grants, particularly grants to people who are `friendly' to the Labor Party. We have seen continual grants which effectively bind votes, and they are not to be revealed in the future.
