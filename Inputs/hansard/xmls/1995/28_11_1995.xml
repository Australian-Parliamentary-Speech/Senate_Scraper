         During the hearings for the unemployment report there were cases presented of programs successfully running at a community level that were to have their funding stopped because they did not fit neatly into department categories. The government prefers to see people taken off the long-term unemployment lists and placed in subsidised job projects. This serves the purpose of making the unemployment figures appear rosier but unfortunately does little for the unemployed worker in the long term.

         One of the programs specifically targeted to indigenous people is the community development employment project scheme, CDEP. The evidence put to the Senate long-term unemployment inquiry suggested that opinion in the Aboriginal community is far from supportive of the scheme. Said one indigenous witness of CDEP:

         The following estimates of various employment programs show the incidence of unemployment around three months after programs assistance had ended. For instance, in Aboriginal employment schemes, 57.3 per cent were still unemployed; in the program known as jobtrain, 63.4 per cent; in jobclubs, 59.4 per cent; in jobskills, 60.3 per cent; and in LEAP, 60.7 per cent. Even the most successful of the government's employment programs had an unemployment rate of 37.6 per cent three months after completion.

         If we look at the numbers in continuing program assistance, that is, people in another training program three months after finishing one, the figures are even more damning. They are 48.2 per cent in OLMA; 31 per cent in jobtrain; 27.4 per cent in Aboriginal employment; 29.8 per cent in jobclubs; and 19.1 per cent in LEAP. A more cynical person than I would suggest that this plethora of training programs was being used to remove people from unemployment lists in the lead-up to the election. Unfortunately, even these are not entirely successful, as the unemployment figure has increased over the past few months from a general level of 8.2 per cent in June to 8.7 last month.

         This government has nothing to be proud of as regards Australia's unemployment problem. The government has even stopped producing youth unemployment figures because it claims they are too volatile. What are they trying to hide? We know what they are trying to hide: very high youth unemployment figures in many urban and many rural and regional centres throughout Australia. This government likes to talk about the $2.2 billion it has spent on Working Nation but, when all the rhetoric is laid aside, the government cannot escape the fact that there are still 787,600 people classified as unemployed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and one-third of that total are classified as long-term unemployed. This government has failed to adequately address the massive unemployment problem still faced by this country.

         It is a very important day for many pensioners because it is the end, once this legislation becomes effective next year, of unrealised capital growth treated as income for pension purposes. When the whole concept of unrealised capital gains came before us in 1992, only the Democrats said that it was unworkable, that it was unfair, and we pointed out a whole range of other problems, including the fact that you are actually dissuading people from investing in Australian companies. Having listened to Senator Troeth's speech and the notes that she has made regarding unemployment, one would have thought that the government would actually be encouraging people to invest in Australian companies, but not so.

         We continued the pressure on the government to change its mind and to remove those provisions. It was not until the community began to feel the effects of this treatment of shares, and particularly the effect on their pensions, that momentum built up and eventually, towards the end of 1993, the government agreed to some changes. It agreed to take out retrospectivity so that pensioners and part pensioners who had bought shares prior to August 1992 were no longer subjected to unrealised capital growth test, and this helped more than 100,000 retired Australians.

         But we did not stop there. What we wanted to see, and what we are finally seeing, is that measure removed altogether. The inequity and the incredible bureaucratic problems with this, the continuing assessment of what the share gains were month after month, highlighted for many pensioners real difficulties in the possibility of them maintaining their investment in shares. Unfortunately, we will see that many have decided that it simply is not worth the hassle any longer and have decided to sell their shares and move their investments elsewhere.

         But we continued to press for a review of the income and assets test for age pensions and, eventually when the government agreed to this, we were very pleased to see that it was conducted by Ageing Agendas in a fashion that enabled huge numbers of people to have their voices heard, to put in submissions. It was the findings of that review plus, I suspect, the growing opposition from pensioner groups across Australia that has seen the last of unrealised capital growth. We already heard in this year's May budget that the minister would be introducing extended deeming rates on all financial investments from 1 July next year.

         The extended deeming will apply to pensioners' financial investments, including bank accounts, term deposits, shares, friendly society bonds and other managed investments such as equity trusts. It effectively means that capital growth or unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments will not be treated as income. Therefore, for this reason and for its simplicity, the Democrats are supporting this extended deeming. We see it as a fairer, more equitable assessment method of financial investments for those who wish to qualify to receive an age pension.

         Extended deeming has also won, after considerable debate and discussion, the support from pensioner and welfare groups, such as the Council on the Ageing, Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation and the Australian Council of Social Service. What opposition there has been to this legislation has come mainly from the Australian Friendly Societies Association, whose members feel they will be disadvantaged because the two-tiered deeming rates do not recognise those investments, like friendly society saved bonds that pre-pay tax.

         The Democrats have been concerned and still are concerned about those pensioners and part-pensioners with friendly society bonds. It is obvious that, on present rates of return, these investments—because, as I said, they pre-pay tax at 33 per cent—cannot return their investors anywhere near the proposed extended deeming rates of five per cent and seven per cent. As a result, the Australian Friendly Societies Association, on behalf of its members, has sought an amendment which would introduce a modified deeming rate for pre-taxed investments. The proposal is for a modified rate that is less than the 33 per cent for pre-paid tax investments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problem that the Democrats have with such an amendment is that it fundamentally changes the idea behind extended deeming. It ceases to offer equity. Instead it introduces a product based deeming rate. This could lead to demands that other investment products receive the same treatment. It jeopardises one of the main advantages of extended deeming: its simplicity and emphasis on higher yielding investments. It is encouragement for pensioners to actually go out and do the best possible thing they can with their money than to simply have a flat deeming rate, whatever it is they are able to earn.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am also concerned that any broader amendment to protect friendly society bonds could attract pensioners to an investment which, for the vast majority of them, is not an attractive proposition. As pointed out by the Australian Pensioners Superannuants Federation, two-thirds of pensioners do not pay tax, so paying 33 per cent on friendly society bonds makes them a very unattractive investment in the first place. Even a recent survey by the Australian Friendly Societies Association found that almost 42 per cent of its members paid no tax and 29 per cent are in the marginal 20 per cent tax group.

         To agree to a special product based deeming rate for friendly society bonds would encourage, I think, pensioners to maintain these investments and not to move on to take full advantage of the benefits of extended deeming. That does not mean we should not be concerned for those pensioners left holding friendly society bonds and, in particular, those with the smaller friendly societies.

         We understand that larger friendly societies have the scope to offer their members a range of other products that could mean returns either matching, if not bettering, the proposed deeming rates. It is the smaller societies, most of them based in Victoria, who are very much limited as to the products they can offer their members. We must also remember that many pensioners and part-pensioners do not want to be forced by this government to re-invest their savings. They have chosen their retirement investment portfolio for its security. They do not want to be forced to change now. It is these pensioners' concerns the Australian Democrats are most concerned about. We really do need to address them.

         Friendly societies naturally are concerned about a run on investment once deeming is introduced. That is a real concern. Most friendly societies have been assuring members they can meet any call on funds by their investors. Indeed if there was such a run, particularly a run on the smaller friendly societies, from pensioners wishing to sell their investments, then this legislation does have a provision that can be used to exclude certain investments from extended deeming and so protect the investors.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Section 1084 of the legislation provides for the minister to make a determination to exclude specified financial investments or a specified class of financial investment from the deeming provisions. This would have the effect that only the actual return on the specified investments, if any, would be taken into account under the incomes test. I have sought and got assurances in writing from the minister that this provision would be used to protect any friendly societies finding themselves in such difficulties.

         It seems obvious to me that this anomaly that finds friendly societies saved bonds disadvantaged by extended deeming would be better addressed in the tax system rather than in social security. Treasury is currently conducting a review of the whole trustee tax issue. Part of that review would be to provide friendly societies with the opportunity of offering bonus paying bonds which are untaxed at source and assessed in the hands of the individual investor.

         The Australian Friendly Societies Association has requested that Treasury, as a matter of urgency, give a firm commitment that such a change would be forthcoming to avoid the problem of those pensioners and part-pensioners with friendly society investments being forced to sell their investments before or soon after the introduction of extended deeming next year. Solving this problem through the tax legislation is, it seems to me, the more complete and permanent solution. I urge the government to allow friendly societies to be able to offer bonus paying bonds untaxed at source for the sake of those pensioners and part-pensioners who do not want to be forced to sell up their friendly society investments.

         The Senate is debating the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which puts into place a number of changes to the two principal acts of the title. The major changes enacted by the bill are welcomed and have the support of the Greens (WA). That said, there are some measures in the bill which we are concerned about as seems to be the case with almost every social security bill which comes before the chamber.

         I will make a comment at this point about the most important part of the bill—namely, the new deeming structure for those people receiving a social security pension which is affected by their investments. All senators would recall the extraordinary difficulties created by the previous approach to assets and income testing for this group in the community. I am sure that the experience in my office of confused and angry people ringing or writing to complain about the system is shared by all other senators.

         The government announced this change in the budget in May this year to almost universal acclaim. Since then that sense of welcome for this new structure has not changed even though people have reservations. Certainly, the Greens welcomed the budget announcement as not only a move towards more equitable arrangements but also a sign of the government's commitment to simplifying the social security system.

         I will raise one niggling complaint which is not related to the bill but to the explanatory memorandum. I have mentioned this on previous occasions. The explanatory memorandum appears to be used as a propaganda tool rather than as a technical document. Page 4 of the explanatory memorandum states:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Most social security recipients will be unaffected by extended deeming.
       </para>
       <para>
        At first glance that statement is quite straightforward and without flaw. However, the fact is that every pensioner with investments will be affected. They may not have the amount of their pension changed, but the Department of Social Security will need to measure their investments to ascertain whether or not the rate of their pension will alter. I make this point because of the significance of the explanatory memorandum in the legal system.

         While the particular paragraph is unlikely to ever be crucial in a court case, I have referred on a number of occasions to the lack of precision that is creeping in. In case those comments should cause any concern to people who may be listening to this debate, I am informed by the department that very few people will be adversely affected by the changes. I commend the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) for his continued commitment to simplifying measures such as this. No doubt some of the technicalities will receive extended discussion in the committee stage.

         Another matter in relation to this change, and one of greater substance than the one I have just mentioned, is the lack of a legislative framework establishing an assets assessment structure. It is one thing to say that from now on investments held by pensioners will be deemed to be earning a certain level of income, but it is not a complete measure without telling people when their investments will be valued. As was pointed out to me by the Welfare Rights Centre, it could lead to the absurd situation where two pensioners, neighbours even, could have identical investment portfolios valued quite differently because of different valuation dates.

         I have been assured by the minister's office that there will be a way of adjusting that administratively rather than legislatively by eventually looking at six-monthly intervals of March, July and September. That makes me somewhat uneasy as it would seem that a change as significant as this one would be best brought about by means of the most certain powers available. I would appreciate some further comment about that from the minister responsible at an appropriate time in the debate.

         Before I move on from schedule 1, there is another matter that I believe needs to be raised. I refer honourable senators to proposed section 1073 in clause 28 which deals with certain amounts taken to be received over 12 months. This is, by and large, a carryover of the existing provision 1074 of the act. It is a measure which appears in similar form in the act as it was in the 1987 and 1988 acts, but was changed in the plain English version of the act which came into effect in 1991.

         As I indicated, there was a change in the 1991 act. It appears to be minor and has not resulted in any change in the department's treatment of income received by pensioners. However, the change, which removed the words `of income' after the word `amount' could have significant implications should the department, under pressure from a future government, choose to read the section on the basis of its apparent meaning. That meaning could be used to treat gifts given to pensioners as income over a 12-month period with a potential reduction in pension. I acknowledge that this interpretation has not been put on the section up till now, but I can see no barrier to such a move. It could even be suggested that this section could stand in the way of pensioners receiving Lotto prizes. Hence, we will be putting in an amendment to clarify this in the committee to restore the words `of income' to section 1073.

         Schedule 2 of the bill makes another welcome change to the act in that it will simplify life for certain people who are on unemployment related payment from DSS. Doing away with people having to move on to sickness allowance if they are unable to fulfil the requirements of an activity test due to ill-health makes good sense and will hopefully reduce the stress on staff and clients alike.

         Another welcome change is the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart. I recall very clearly in 1991 that various groups in the community thought the separation of unemployment benefit into a number of payments was an unnecessary complication. So it is encouraging to see that the government has now chosen to reverse at least part of that move.

         I cannot, however, be so congratulatory of the government about the changes to the mature age allowance. It seems that schedule 6 of the bill is an admission of failure. The mature age allowance was introduced, if I recall correctly, as a temporary measure to assist certain older unemployed people during a period of crisis in the economy. It was put into place with a sunset clause to reinforce that view from the government. Schedule 6 removes the sunset clause and puts the mature age amount in place permanently. More significantly, this measure gives the lie to the government's recent move to raise the pension age for women.

         We now have the ludicrous situation where a woman, who in years gone by would have moved onto an age pension at age 60 and who after recent changes would have to continue in the work force at that stage in life, will now be eligible for a pseudo pension in the form of the mature age allowance at age 60.

         In my concluding remarks on this bill, I draw the attention of honourable senators and to anyone who may be listening that this measure is accompanied by the usual tax file number requirements. We will continue to raise our concerns about the use of the tax file number in ways which were never countenanced at the time of its introduction. It is history now that the government was taken right through the courts and defeated in the case of Mr John Malloch and has since sought to use extraordinary sophistry to satisfy its desire to make TFNs compulsory for social security clients while also satisfying the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner. While I have indicated some of our concerns—no doubt, we will discuss more in the committee stage—I wish to indicate that the Greens will be supporting this bill in spite of those concerns.

         Schedule 2 of the bill sets out changes in relation to the Child Care Act 1972 and to the data-matching program. The changes are quite extraordinary. In the first place, the changes will enable the government to require recipients of child-care assistance to provide tax file numbers. I say `require' deliberately because the government seems less and less inclined to hide the fact that it requires people to provide tax file numbers, in spite of the Privacy Commissioner's concerns.

         In this case, the requirement to provide a tax file number has a potentially more worrying aspect to it; namely, the need for a provider of child care to satisfy themselves that a child-care relief claimant has provided DSS with their tax file number. I am assured by the minister's office that the department would give the child-care provider the necessary information about their clients so that there can be no question of the claimant having to give their tax file number to someone other than the department. That sounds fine, until something goes wrong.

The second worrying aspect is that, at some point in the future, this government or some other government will decide that, since the child-care provider already has to be satisfied about the client's tax file number, why not save the client more time and trouble by putting the onus on collecting the TFN on the child-care provider?

The second flows from that and puts a question to the government: has it ever dawned on those in power that perhaps the Australian people are more honest than the government gives them credit for? Is it possible that the reason the savings are not there is that there simply is not the rorting of the system going on which the government would like us to believe exists in order to justify the intrusions that it is making?

The new note will make more explicit the point that imprisonment is not the only option open to the courts in sentencing. Honourable senators would be aware that this is an issue which is very close to my heart and that removing the prison penalties has become something of a personal crusade of mine.

Part 1 includes items 1 to 5, and that is the CES notification that participants can join case management. The Greens have no problem with this section of the bill. Instead of two letters going out about case management—one letter to notify that a person has become a participant in limbo waiting for a case management place and the other letter to offer them a place in case management—the latter correspondence will be the first correspondence. This seems fine and an administrative simplification.

The problem is that the part-time worker needs to be working part-time for only 13 weeks before they are knocked off the case management participant lists. There should be more certainty here.

It is, however, good to see that the government is not fixed in the opinion that full-time work is the ultimate goal, when it may not be the individual's goal to find full-time work, nor would it be a realistic goal under current labour market conditions.

I have to question whether the amalgamation of these two allowances is a public relations exercise to cover up the extent of long-term unemployment in this country. Having two different allowances is one way of delineating who was long-term and who was short-term unemployed even if the definitions kept changing—that is, whether long-term unemployment meant either 12 months or 18 months of unemployment.

         It is also important to have two allowances to target special services to those with greater needs.

         To a large extent case management has been a tool to provide the appearance of the creation of jobs which were really training. Case management's purpose was to move the long-term unemployed for 16 weeks into either training or subsidised employment, which took them off newstart for a period long enough for them to fall out of the long-term unemployment category. Upon returning to unemployment they would return to the jobsearch payment instead of newstart.

         This process has the ability to skew the unemployment statistics and make it look as though the long-term unemployed are being helped. This then leaves the case management system to deal with `creaming' off the work-ready who were going to be picked up by the labour market anyway. Then the government can claim unemployment is falling and can cut huge amounts of spending from labour market programs.

         My last comments relate to items 20 to 22 of the Employment Services Amendment Bill. It is good to see that the government is being flexible with its eligibility criteria for a jobs compact in that people can still be treated as being on newstart if they have been unemployed for 12 months and working or training for a 13-week period. So all in all we think that unemployment by mirrors is what is going on and continues to go on. We will be looking very carefully at the bill and its consequences to see what actual outcomes result.

The coalition will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment.

         I think the process is conciliatory and supportive in that it assures, as much as possible, Senator Woodley, that the government's attention here is focused on the concern of the people. I understand the concern you have raised that a small number of cases would require consideration in light of the secretary's discretion in the proposed new section 121(8)(a), and that it is not open to external merits review. But the government considers that the section 121(8)(a) discretion does not require such an approach to be followed, in particular, because the discretion is not open-ended. Rather, it clearly defines the range of cases where it is appropriate to exercise the discretion—for example, where there are circumstances that are not within a person's control that justify their continuing qualification for pension.

         Examples given in the legislation provide further clarification of the situations where it is appropriate to exercise the discretion. In other words, the power has little in common with a broad discretion, and merely requires a simple consideration of whether or not the facts of a particular situation meet the objective criteria specified in the legislation. Further, the legislation also requires that the discretion be exercised only by the secretary, himself or herself. It is considered another protection, if you like; a best way of achieving fair and consistent decision making in this area. Departmental experience indicates that the external review of other discretionary powers have often led to arbitrary, inconsistent and irreconcilable decisions.

        The coalition amendment, as I foreshadowed last night, relates to the data-matching amendment in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill, which contains a number of amendments to the current data-matching program. It proposes to extend the data-matching program to cover the child-care assistance payment. As I indicated during the second reading debate, the coalition is not opposing this measure, but we are very concerned about the insidious extension of data matching.

         In addition, the data-matching program presents major privacy concerns to the coalition.

So the government has now introduced this bill, which provides that the agency would only have to provide a comprehensive report to parliament every three years, rather than, of course, the current requirement of reporting annually, and would only report to the Privacy Commissioner on an annual basis.

         Very briefly, Senator Woodley, the data-matching program has been reviewed annually since 1991 and participating agencies have been tabling reports in the parliament. The present requirement to report annually and separately is very costly in resource terms and, further, the government believes it is no longer necessary to prepare such reports on an annual basis in that the reports have been useful to demonstrate the value of the program in its early years but are no longer necessary now the program has proved its worth.

         It was for this reason that the government proposed the data-matching program be amended to provide full reports only every three years, with interim annual reports being provided to the Privacy Commissioner annually. These interim reports will basically deal with financial outcomes of the program—for example, savings achieved, cancellations effected as a result of data matching, et cetera. The Privacy Commissioner's office was consulted about the proposal and indicated it had no problems with what was proposed. But the amendment from the opposition says, `Can we stay with what we have got?' and the government will not be opposing the amendment.

         —The government is also not minded to accept this amendment. The legislation states that a proportion of the debt that is solely due to administrative error must be waived. The suggestion that the word `solely' be changed to `dominantly' would make the legislation ambiguous and impossible to define with certainty. Review bodies are likely to view cases in the widest possible light and on an ad hoc basis. It is very difficult to accept that the department should not pursue all or part of a social security payment that is overpaid because of a client error.

         The requirement that a social security payment be received in good faith will not protect social security revenue, if the Democrats' amendment is accepted. Whether a payment is received in good faith involves a subjective judgment based on whether a review body is inclined to accept a person's claim that the payment was made in good faith. It is not an objective decision that can be relied on with certainty. It can be very difficult to prove lack of good faith.

         The amendment will make the waiver provisions unclear and could lead to ad hoc decisions that potentially allow people to receive a financial advantage where it is not reasonable that the person should have that at the taxpayers' expense. For those reasons, but mainly because it introduces an element of uncertainty into this area of the legislation, the government is not minded to accept it.

        The bill allows that if a person has accrued a debt through non-fraudulent overpayment of, for example, a sole parent pension and if that person would have been entitled to a parenting allowance during that period, the amount they must repay can be reduced by the amount of parenting allowance they would have received in the three years preceding the date the overpayments are stopped. Given that there is no fraud involved, the Democrats do not believe that there is adequate justification for placing a time limitation on the offset period. This amendment will remove the time limit.

         —The government is not willing to accept this amendment. Prior to the amendments made by this bill, the Social Security Act 1991 provided that the secretary must waive that part of a debt that is equal to the amount of family payment that would have been payable had a person lodged a claim for family payment. The maximum amount that could be waived was limited to the family payment that was payable in the three-year period prior to the date the overpayment was stopped.

         Given the similarity between the parenting allowance and the family payment, this bill provides for a similar waiver of a notional entitlement to the parenting allowance that was payable in the three-year period prior to the date that the overpayment was stopped. The provision already represents a generous concession, and the government does not see any justification for further extensions. If there was no limit, then it would be very difficult to retrospectively determine whether the person was entitled to the payment and, if so, what the rate was more than three years ago. Limiting the period to three years allows the department to use existing evidence to determine possible entitlement to parenting allowance. So for those reasons we are not supporting this amendment.

         —The schedule provides for the rent assistance threshold to increase by $5; that is, a person must earn $5 extra to receive rent assistance, and the schedule provides for rent assistance for families to increase by $5. The rent assistance measures in this bill are typical of the way the government treats people, to be honest. Some people will benefit from the rent assistance measures, but many more will lose out. It is estimated that around 191,000 families will benefit from the $5 a fortnight increase in rent assistance, with a cost to the government of around $26 million per year. Of course, as Senator Woodley has just said, the Democrats are opposed to the increase in this threshold. However, the coalition will not be supporting this amendment.

The package of measures put forward, including the increase in the threshold, will not reduce the level of assistance available to those people who pay high rents, but it will improve the level of access to rent assistance for particular groups in housing stress. These groups include families with children, families that are paying high rents and also people entering community based care. From March 1996, the amount of rent that people will have to pay before they are eligible for rent assistance will be increased by the $5 per fortnight.

        The first amendment provides that a person's assets will be valued every six months but also with the option of the Department of Social Security client being able to request evaluation at any time. Schedule 1 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 introduces a new system—extended deeming for calculating income from financial investments. A standard deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of financial investments for single people and the first $50,000 for couples. Above these amounts a deeming rate of seven per cent will apply.

         The government has argued that the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty and they are comparatively simple. The problem is that the government has made no provision in the bill to determine how often a person's financial assets are to be valued. While the coalition supports a simplified and more equitable valuation of assets, it believes that the timing of the valuation of financial investments should be incorporated in the bill.

         —I will be opposing schedule 3, page 57, item 3. I will explain the reasons why the Democrats are firmly committed to opposing this item. The item relates to the earnings credit scheme. This scheme allows unemployed people to earn a limited amount of outside income without affecting their social security entitlements. It is a very good scheme.

         The problem is that the government wishes once again to tighten the availability of this scheme. I noticed that a couple of speakers in the debate in the House of Representatives said that the scheme is designed to allow unemployed people who have very high levels of income for a couple of weeks to spread that income over a longer period so that their unemployment payment is not affected. That really is not what it is about. The scheme only allows a modest amount of extra income to be offset under the income test in the fortnight in which that income is earned.

         Currently only between six and seven per cent of jobsearch and newstart allowance recipients are making use of the scheme. I believe that there are a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, it is somewhat complicated to calculate exactly what the effect is going to be on a person's entitlement. Let me give a prime example of this that I gave last night in my speech in the second reading debate. I have a very good friend who completed a PhD about 18 months ago. He has been seeking full-time employment ever since. He has only been able to get part-time employment, so the scheme is of interest to him. However, despite the assurances of the CES, when he did accept a four-week casual employment position he discovered at the end of the four weeks, because of the complicated calculations, et cetera, that he actually lost quite a considerable sum of money by working over that four-week period. So you can see the problem.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second problem with the scheme was one that I warned about when it was first set up—that is, conditions that we have placed on the scheme are so restrictive that it simply is not very useful for people. Fortunately, one of those restrictions will be removed by this bill, so I give a tick to the minister for that. That is the rule that says that earnings credit cannot be assessed in the fortnight where the person's income is over the income test cut-out. This would be a wonderful reform—half a tick actually—except that at the same time the government is seeking to save around $30 million from the scheme by restricting the amount that can be offset to just $50 per week. The earnings credit scheme available to the unemployed is already less generous than the scheme for age pensioners, which allows pensioners to offset up to $1,000 of income in a fortnight and which the recent ageing agendas review said should be made more generous.

         Further, the whole push behind the Working Nation reforms was to remove disincentives for people to take on any work opportunities available to them. This move is in the opposite direction. So it is not Working Nation that we are now really dealing with. If we place highly restrictive conditions on the earnings credit scheme, the unemployed simply are not going to make use of it. That would be a great shame. The effect of that will be twofold. Firstly, the unemployed will not take up those work opportunities which may have given them a foot in the door to full-time employment and, secondly, because of this the government will be faced with higher social security outlays. For these reasons, the Democrats will be opposing that part of the bill which seeks to limit to $100 the amount of earnings credit that can be used in any one fortnight.

         —The government opposes this amendment. Senator Woodley, I am always pleased to get a tick from you, even if it becomes a half tick in the course of your comments. The legislation before the parliament proposes a number of changes to the earnings credit scheme. They have been incorporated into a package. You cannot just look at one of these without looking at the others. There is a change over a number of things that we hope will be of assistance to people. Amending one part—in this instance, the $100 limit—has an effect on the viability of the other components. Although we acknowledge that the measure will result in savings, it also removes a number of inefficiencies and areas of criticism with the current scheme.

         The important area where change was necessary was to ensure that persons who were in regular casual work should be provided with some incentive to receive a reasonable rate of jobsearch and newstart allowance over an extended period. There has been a concern that where people have the opportunity to undertake regular, casual or part-time work, they only receive, in effect, a one shot benefit from the scheme. The proposed changes will better target those persons by allowing their earnings credit balance to be used over a longer period.

         As an example: following the July 1995 income test changes, a person with an earnings credit balance of $300 who is paid at the single rate—currently, $310.50 a fortnight—and is regularly receiving $300 per fortnight from casual employment, would receive a one-shot benefit that would ensure that the person received the maximum benefit in the fortnight. For the next two pay periods, the person's payment would be reduced to $158.50 in each fortnight. Over the three pay periods, the person would receive $627.50.

         Under these modified arrangements, the earnings credit would be available to the person over the three pay periods and that person would receive three equal payments of $228.50, or a total of $685.50 over a comparable period. On those figures that is a benefit of almost $60 over those three pay periods. The difference would be caused by the combined result of the current changes to the rate and method of accrual of earnings credit.

         The changes will better assist low and moderate income earners.

The losers under these arrangements will be those persons who have an earings credit balance with one-off earnings.

Since then he has increased the petrol excise by 5c for unleaded petrol and 7c for leaded petrol, increased sales tax by two per cent, increased the tax on wine, increased the Medicare levy twice, increased company tax by three per cent, increased the sales tax on non-luxury cars, extended the sales tax on building materials and, of course, repealed the l-a-w income tax cuts which were due to come in on 1 January next year.

         What the Prime Minister said at the last election referred to the overall level of taxation in the economy.

         This question also raises the issue of what the opposition thinks might be the definition of low taxation. During the period that John Howard was Treasurer of this country, the Fraser government period, the ratio of taxes to GDP collected from Australians was 26 per cent. Under us, we have become the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. What do we expect the ratio of taxes collected as a percentage of GDP to be after this quarter's figures are in—24.1 per cent? So you think low taxes are at the level of 26 per cent. Low taxes, according to our definition, are at the level of 24.1 per cent. There is a vast difference between both of us on that issue.

         The OECD's latest figures confirm that Australia is the second lowest taxed country among Western developed nations. In 1993 the tax to GDP ratio for Australia as a whole, which is Commonwealth and state, was 28.7 per cent, compared with the OECD average of 38.7 per cent. In other words, if we had the level of taxes that the peer economies to which we are often compared have on average, Australians would be paying $50 billion more in taxes than they do under the Labor government, which is a low taxing government. If we had in this economy the level of taxation that John Howard presided over, Australians would be paying $3 1/2 billion more in taxes a year than they do under us.

         That is what families want, and that is why we have, with the accreditation system, 3,600 centres accredited and participating in that process, going on with the business of producing quality care, as the independent evaluation from Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows. Families like it; staff and centre operators like it. In fact, there has been a clear improvement in the quality of child care provided.

         Yet you, Senator Troeth, in particular, but the opposition in general, come in here and barrack for the 10 centres not participating—which are now down to eight. We are actually making sure that our commitment to quality child care shows. We were very interested to note that the opposition should betray in estimates the fact that they do not know anything about the accreditation process but have opposed the legislation and campaigned to distort the facts about it. The process of quality in our child care is something that families love and something that this government will not shy away from.

Minister, since 1983 the government has increased the petrol and diesel excise tax from 7c a litre to a massive 33.5c—that is up. In November 1992 you promised not to put up taxes—you promised not to put them up. You again broke your promise by increasing the taxes on light fuel oil and topped crude from 6.9c to 33.5c a litre, almost a whopping 500 per cent—that is also up.

         Senator Crane, let me go to the rest of it. Your Treasury spokesman, Mr Costello, has made certain undertakings about taxation to the Australian people. None of those undertakings is credible. They are reminiscent of George Bush before the last presidential election in the United States saying, `Read my lips: no new taxes.' That is exactly the level of credibility that attaches to Mr Costello.

         When it comes down to it, the government has said that we will not increase the overall level of taxation on the Australian community. When you look at our record that promise has been delivered on in this term of government and it will be delivered on in the next term of government. When we take the record of governments in wide shot and compare ours to yours, what do we find? We find the figures I just quoted to your colleague Senator Parer.

         Let me quote them again. The total revenue collected by the Commonwealth government in 1994-95 is expected to be 24.1 per cent of GDP compared to 26 per cent of GDP when the government was elected to office in 1982-83. The government collected less revenue in 1994-95 as a share of GDP in a growing economy than the opposition did in its last year of government during the recession.

         In other words, with the economy in growth, where you would expect the level of taxation to mirror that growth, the level of taxation fell. Under your leader as the then Treasurer, with an economy in contraction, where you would also expect the economy to reflect a reduction in taxation, the level of taxation grew. That is the comparison to be made here. But let me go wider than that.

It will be recalled that Mr Peng had been found guilty on two charges and convicted as follows: for unauthorised seizure of company funds of 290,000 renminbi, which is about $A48,000, he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment with a supplementary sentence of deportation; for embezzlement of company funds of $HK800,000, which is about $A133,000, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Sixteen of the total 18 years were enforced imprisonment. The courts also ordered the confiscation of the 290,000 renminbi. That sentence, as I say, has been confirmed.

For example, at the same time as I made representations to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at the APEC ministerial meeting, the Prime Minister raised his concerns about the case with the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, in Osaka. As recently as yesterday I made further representations to the visiting Chinese National People's Congress delegation led by Vice-Chairman Wang Bingqian.

         —First of all, I want to draw attention to the Yellow Pages survey. As I said last week, when they did a special survey on attitudes to state and federal governments, it is a credible survey; I continue to say so. I continue to say it about the survey that came out today. No matter whether it has good or bad news, I always acknowledge that the sampling methods of the survey are quite reasonable. I do acknowledge that that survey out today did show that Queensland, as you said Senator Macdonald, for business confidence prospects in the next 12 months was the lowest, at 14 per cent, which is far too low and does indicate that there are problems with small business confidence and growth prospects in that state.

         It is a national survey and, as Mr Marsden commented in his statement and on radio today, overall, small business in Australia is more confident about 1996 than they were and have been about 1995. He also says that small business does not expect to go back to the high levels of growth that they had in 1994, but are more confident about prospects in 1996 than they have been in 1995.

         I think, overall, the survey shows a confidence in small business that is improving. I don't beat about the bush; in Queensland there is a weakness in confidence. Mr Marsden also apparently said today in remarks that one of the reasons for the decline in confidence in small business has been the decline in population growth to Queensland from other states. I think it has also been mentioned elsewhere, Senator, that the fact that the drought does seem to be breaking in some parts of Queensland has resulted in some improved prospects for the future.

Minister, will you concede that it is your tax system which has made tollways an inevitable infrastructure choice, given that they are extraordinarily profitable for private operators? Isn't it true that in New South Wales Premier Bob Carr could not buy out the private tollway operators because he could not afford to compensate them for the loss of these tax concessions? While it might suit you politically to try to wash your hands of any responsibility for making City Link possible, it is your responsibility, isn't it, to make sure that tax concessions which you provide are not used to steamroll both environmental and local planning processes?

         The second part of the question was a bit confused. Let me spell out what the Development Allowance Authority does so that you can see that this is an arms-length transaction by the government. The Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 requires that when a valid application for an infrastructure borrowing certificate has been lodged the authority must issue a certificate if the application meets the criteria of the act.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The criteria of the act include the commerciality of the borrower and the borrower's corporate structure; the borrowing and use of the moneys borrowed; the ownership and the use of the facilities; and whether a law exists restricting or prohibiting the operation of other facilities in competition with the approved facility. In this case, the Melbourne City Link tollway, the responsibility will be the same. The responsibility for the infrastructure borrowing certificate process is primarily a matter for the Development Allowance Authority. If the statutory criteria outlined above are met, a certificate must be granted.

         Under the existing legislation, the sole power for a minister to intervene in the process is where the Treasurer may direct the authority not to accept applications during a specified period. This can occur where the Treasurer is informed by the authority that the cost to revenue of approved applications has reached the limit set in the regulations.

         The other question asked of me by Senator Kernot was: do our tax arrangements drive an inevitability of tollways? It was that question or a question of some such nature as that.

         There is a wider question at the back of all of this. Australians obviously require and do demand a high quality public infrastructure to be provided. At the same time, Australians require and do demand a low taxing base in order to fund public infrastructure. So, when you have private investment heading into the provision of public infrastructure or state governments putting aside massive parts of their own expenditure priorities to fund public infrastructure, recovery of the cost of that means increasingly that we will be looking at projects where there may be tollways or infrastructure provided simply straight off the public purse.

         It is the demand for the provision of high quality infrastructure and the requirement by the public to keep tax levels at the lowest possible level that are driving this process. This means that, where funding for infrastructure can be provided by users, that is an option that can be considered at state government level. It is not the structure of taxation that is driving it. But I do repeat my threshold point, which was in answer to the last part of your question: such a project has to meet the environmental criteria under the appropriate regulatory authority in order to qualify for application.

         I go back to what reasonably seems to be your preoccupation with this question, the environmental elements of tollway or freeway construction, and repeat: such a project would need to meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities in terms of getting an environmental clearance. When it does, then it is in a position for the other mechanisms for support to be checked in. That includes, if it meets the criteria of the Development Allowance Authority, Development Allowance Authority assistance.

The national market will initially encompass a number of physically interconnected jurisdictions such as New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT.

Is the minister aware that the latest critic of ATSIC is a Victorian police sergeant who has worked with Aboriginal communities for over 20 years, won the inaugural police officer of the year award from Victoria's Aboriginal community justice panel and immediately after receiving the award criticised ATSIC for failing to deliver much needed funds to community level?

         ATSIC is a democratically elected organisation, elected by the Aboriginal people of Australia themselves. It fulfils a vitally important role in providing much needed services on the ground. It has many critics, and most of them are non-Aboriginal. Most of them, in my experience as someone who has spent a lot of his life in Aboriginal communities, are people who apply for grants and do not get them. I notice that Senator Panizza is nodding in assent. Before I can give Senator Panizza a considered answer to this question, I would like to examine whether the particular person's concerns are related to individual communities or individual grants.

It is all part of the democratic process. It is the sort of slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that we have to take from time to time and the same thing applies to ATSIC.

         The fundamental strength of ATSIC—and it is unlike any other Aboriginal organisation in Australia in this regard—is that it is constituted from a national system of fair and free elections by Aboriginal people across Australia.

In the minister's statement of 21 September 1994, the minister said that targets would be set for the upgrading of Telstra's network to ensure upgrading proceeds on an equitable basis; priority would be given to the digitisation of exchanges and improving services in rural areas. The formal network development undertakings are one part of a range of initiatives in response to the CoT cases, many of which are either completed or significantly progressed. The other network and customer initiatives are: accelerated development of network performance standards and independent testing of network performance by Austel.

         The minister received an understanding that Austel's new end-to-end network performance standard was gazetted on 14 June 1995 and that Austel was to establish a special unit known as the carrier monitoring unit to manage network performance issues, quality of service and customer complaints about difficult network faults and related privacy issues. In addition to that, I understand that Austel has established a consumer liaison section and implemented a program of direct consultation, which now takes place through its consumer consultative forum.

         Regarding the second part of Senator Bourne's question, work in relation to all of these undertakings has been taking place since the minister's announcement last year. A number of complex issues and detailed considerations have needed to be dealt with in developing the undertakings. This has been taking place in a rapidly changing environment that Telstra is operating in, which does have consequences for its business strategies. Despite this, the minister expects that the annex which outlines all of these undertakings will be released next month.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane this day, relating to taxation and fuel excise.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        My question was a very straightforward one to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I asked him to rule out further increases to existing excise on fuels or the extension of excise to other forms of energy, particularly gas. I do not believe that Senator Cook once mentioned in his answer the words `fuel excise' or `tax relating to fuel'. He totally avoided the question that was asked. One can only conclude from that that the intention of the government must be to further increase existing fuel excise with the real possibility of extending it to other forms of energy, in particular gas.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I look briefly at the record of this government in terms of its position on fuel excises during its 13 years in government. When we look at petrol we find across-the-board that that has increased from 6.155c to 33.5c per litre. That is almost an increase of 500 per cent; it is an increase of 498 per cent over that period. We see with diesel that once again it is the same situation—from 6.155c per litre to 33.5c per litre. We find that light fuel oil and top crude oil, for example, have increased from zero to 33.5c.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Not only have there been massive increases over that period—and I believe it is very close, if you work through it, to there being on average a 40 per cent excise increase per year—but also there has been a significant extension of the base as far as these taxes are concerned. It highlights very clearly that this government has decided to continue taxing policy or an excise policy that is going to hit rural and regional Australia very hard indeed. It is also going to hit very hard indeed the transport industries.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Coming to a more particular aspect of it: since November 1992, when we were told by the government that it was not going to put taxes up, we find in this instance that excise on petrol has increased from 26.154c to 33.5c and on diesel from 26.154c, or just over 26c, to 33.5c. Then we get to some real crunch times in terms of what has happened since the last election from a government that was not going to put taxes up. We find that the light crude, the kerosenes, the fuel heating and oil, the top crude oil—all fuels that are used extensively in our transport systems and in the railways—have gone from 5.425c to a massive 33.5c in just three years.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think that highlights very much what the taxing policy of this government is concerned with. Firstly, it is going to continue to increase taxes significantly, particularly in the area of excises, and, secondly, it is going to attack that area of the community that is least able to defend its position in the ballot box. This government is going to hit particularly our productive industries, our primary producers and our mining industries. It is going to kill totally any chance of getting any real decentralisation of industry out into the hinterland or even up the coast—for example, up around Karratha in my state of Western Australia. We should see secondary industry developing up there where there is gas, iron ore and just about every conceivable mineral in large quantities that you can mention.

         The point I want to make, in terms of this question I asked today about whether the government would rule out further increases to existing taxes on fuels, is that Senator Cook did not rule them out. In terms of the extension of excise taxes to other forms of energy, particularly to gas, once again he did not rule it out. He did not even address the substance of the question.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator West this day, relating to quality assurance in child care.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, I find it quite amazing that a government member, and a minister to boot, would take the time of the Senate during question time to remark on comments given by an opposition senator in estimates. Surely there must be more pressing matters going on in family services than commenting on opposition senators? Secondly, if I need to ask questions about the actual procedures of the department, it is a comment on a system that is so complex, bureaucratic and difficult that it is hard for people to understand.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, I would also like to make the record quite straight about some of my comments that Senator Crowley saw fit to remark upon. Firstly, there was her comment that I had given the impression that reviewers in child-care centres were actually government inspectors. I defy Senator Crowley to find anywhere in the transcript of estimates one comment by me using the words `government inspectors'. It was actually Senator Crowley who used this comment. I will quote from the draft record:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You asked a minute ago about reviewers. I think it is very important to place on the record a correction of a misunderstanding widely circulating that those reviewers are government inspectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        This issue was not raised by me. Obviously, it has been raised by the child-care industry, by proprietors of child-care centres, and possibly by parents. Senator Crowley needs to get that straight. The industry is the one that has raised the possibility of intrusive questioning by reviewers, not the opposition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, Senator Crowley pointed out my mistake in using the comments made in 1988 by a person now appointed as a moderator. Those comments indicated a bias against the private child-care sector. We had a discussion about this at estimates last Thursday night. At the end of that discussion about the moderator, Senator Crowley said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I think your point is well taken, Senator.
       </para>
       <para>
        So to some extent she agreed with me about my comments on this person and the comments that person made in 1988. I did not think she would use that exchange as a basis for a question.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The most important point that I want to make in the time available to me is that, at that estimates meeting, some of Senator Crowley's comments on her own processes were peculiar, to say the least. For instance, I asked her about the role of advisory boards and how many of them give her, as a minister, advice on the child-care industry. I asked her:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . what are the principal advisory structures in place, Minister, that advise you on child care?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Crowley replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You mentioned the National Parent Child-Care Council. That is all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked about the accreditation council. Senator Crowley said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We do have the accreditation council, but that is a bit of a gimmick.
       </para>
       <para>
        For a minister to make a comment like that about an advisory board that is supposedly providing the professional advice that she needs to run the whole accreditation system I find totally amazing. I asked her how persons were appointed to those boards. We agreed it was by appointment, not by election. Senator Crowley also admitted:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Very often what happens is by the time they get to me it is a sort of shortened list.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the only advisory body that advises the minister is an appointed body. There is only one advisory body and the minister is presented with an extremely short list from which to make her selections.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The minister needs to receive all sorts of advice. I hope that she will cast her net much wider in order to get a true representation of what parents think, of what child-care centre operators think, and what the general public thinks about the child-care industry rather than confining her efforts to attacking opposition senators who at least have the sense to ask the right questions.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ian Macdonald this day, relating to small business in Queensland.

        I was very sorry today to hear that Senator Schacht was not prepared to rule out increased taxes on small business. Coming hard on the heels of his statement—if the government had to make some tough decisions for the sake of the overall economy, small business would reluctantly accept some of those tax increases—it means to me that this government has a mind set on increasing taxes on business in the unlikely event of their winning the next election.

         I am also very concerned about my state of Queensland. I remember the days in the recent past when Queensland was synonymous with a go-ahead, aggressive, exciting state where there were lots of new businesses, lots of new jobs, and where the economy was booming. But, after six years of state Labor government and 13 years of this mob in office federally, my state of Queensland has gone downhill very quickly.

         I remember the days when Gordon Chalk, Bill Knox, Llew Edwards, Mike Ahern and Joh Bjelke-Petersen were treasurers of our state. They were very careful treasurers—treasurers who looked at growth in Queensland and ensured that the finances of the state were very carefully kept. In those days we Queenslanders could look forward to an expanding economy. You might remember, we used to be the Cinderella state back in the bad old days, after 30 or 40 years of Labor rule. We suddenly became the progressive state, with the mass migration to Queensland being just tremendous.

         Only a net 14 per cent of Queensland's small businesses have confidence in their business prospects for the next 12 months. That is absolutely distressing. It comes hard on the heels of very high and even record bankruptcies in recent years in my state. Bankruptcies are not just statistics. They are, in fact, people's lives, people's savings. They are the lives of those in families. Everything for which they have been working for years has just gone out the door. They have resulted from the mismanagement of this government, the federal Labor Party, for the last 13 or so years, and the Queensland state Labor government for the last six years.

         Senator Schacht says that we are to have a statement next week that will fix everything up for Queensland small business. I am not sure which statement he is talking about. Is it the so-called innovation statement for which we now have been waiting for something like six to nine months? The government have not been game to bring this statement down. They are still arguing about it; they still cannot get it right. Or is it the forest policy statement that I notice they are not going to bring down while parliament is sitting? Whichever it is, of course, we will not have any chance to comment on it in this place because, in typical fashion, the Labor Party is again avoiding parliament. In that way, it avoids the criticism it knows will come.

         As I have said and would point out once more, in November 1995, on the national figures across Australia, there is a 41 per cent net balance of people—no matter whether they are positive or negative about their prospects—with confidence in business in the years ahead. That figure is not as high as the peak positive of 59 per cent which was recorded in November 1994—and, of course, no mention of that was made by the opposition in November 1994.

         —Yes, it has a nice rhythm to it, hasn't it? I certainly acknowledge that the Queensland figures are very low and have dropped from a high of 55 per cent in November 1994, which has been commented on by a number of other surveys and a number of people on all sides of politics. People have pointed out that the impact of the drought over the last year in Queensland has affected sales and business confidence in that state. The slowing down of net migration to Queensland has affected the building industry. The building boom in Queensland of 12 or 18 months ago, when the housing industry in Queensland indicated that the number of homes being built in Queensland was unsustainable, clearly has had an effect on business confidence. All of those things are acknowledged. We at the macro level of policy setting have always said you have got to get a low inflation environment in Australia with sustainable growth. We have both.

         —The national figures overall. We have sustainable growth of 3 1/2 per cent, and an expectation of inflation of around three per cent. The last figure was around the five per cent mark, but the underlying expectation is around the three per cent mark. As a result, we have sustainability over this year. Despite endless speculation and hope on the coalition side that interest rates would go up further, because we took the adjustments in the latter part of 1994 there have been no further adjustments in interest rates all through 1995.

         I point out to Senator Macdonald—you talk about Liberal or coalition governments in other states—that a number of other states have also shown some drop, which reflects the pattern across Australia, from the high of November last year. Talking of promises and commitment, I want to point out the very famous document put out in June of this year by Senator Macdonald, as the shadow minister, about infrastructure. In commenting about policy, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particular projects which then of necessity must rule out others.

       <para>
        There it is. This is the duplicity of the opposition. They are going to speculate about the whole range of things they would want to do—to do it in such a way that, if they did win the election, they would straight after say, `There is an opt out clause; we are not going to do any of those.' Senator Macdonald stands up here and complains about policy from other parties, yet he has put it on paper circulated to his colleagues that the strategy for the shadow cabinet, for the coalition parties, is to go round with this duplicitous position of promising everything and, after the election, to find a way to drop the promise.

         We are talking about small business. It is crucial to Australia. It is, of course, the sector which can provide employment for the hundreds of thousands of young Australians who do not have jobs. Senator Macdonald gave the minister the opportunity to say to small business people in Queensland what the government's policies will be in relation to small business, what they can offer. What does he do? He pulls out pieces of paper that he says are coalition policy. One day they say we have got no policies; the next minute they come in here and say, `Here are their policies.'

         Small business people, in the famous slogan of the Yellow Pages, do not want the minister to let his fingers do the walking; they want him to do the walking. Senator Macdonald and I spend many, many hours and days of our time walking from small business to small business. I quite often drop in to see them, to door-knock, and sometimes I ask them to join the Liberal Party. Every time this minister is asked about small business policy, he says, `We are going to amend the Trade Practices Act.' It is his great achievement in nearly three years as small business minister; he was sacked as science minister. His only achievement on small business is, `We are going to amend the Trade Practices Act to try and level the playing field between small and big business.' Well done, Senator Schacht!

Senator Schacht is going to jump on the roof and put his amendments down the chimney and hope that small business think that he is delivering this fantastic achievement for them. I can tell you that when Senator Ian Macdonald and I walk from small business to small business up the Queensland coast and out in Western Australia and around Australia, they do not say to us, `You have got to support Schacht's amendments to the Trade Practices Act.' They are not interested in that. Do you know what they tell us? Senator Macdonald can nod his assent if he agrees with me. Those of you listening on radio will not be able to see that; you will just have to trust me on this one. They talk to us about interest rates. They say, `Why has the Labor government put our interest rates up 20 per cent?' They say, `They say that we are a low interest rate, low inflation party.'

         Senator Schacht just repeated this absolute rubbish that they are a low inflation party. We have the highest inflation rate in the Western world. You only have to look at any of the business or economic magazines. Small business is saying, `It is putting our prices up. We can't expand because it costs too much to borrow money. We would like to employ more people but you hit us with this new unfair dismissal law.' Small business talk about the unfair dismissal laws. They do not say, `We want you to amend the Trade Practices Act.' They say, `When are you going to amend the unfair dismissal laws?' They ask us about this government that promised them low taxes, no new taxes, yet on Senator Cook's admission today in question time, taxes have actually gone up since the last election, even on their own basis in terms of percentage of GDP.

         All of the sales tax that business pay have gone up. The petrol taxes that they have to pay when they are running around in their one-tonne trucks and business cars have gone up. All of these taxes have gone up. That is what small business is talking about. That is what Senator Macdonald asked about. He said, `Where is your policy? What are you going to do for small business?' All we can presume is that it is going to be business as normal from the Labor Party. They will stick to the policies they have got already—no change, stand on your record. Good on you, government! If you want to stand on your record, do so. Small business will judge you, and they will judge you harshly.

The government, of course, hopes it can go to the election and not give any specific commitments on taxation. That is not going to be possible. What small business are interested in—in fact, business of all size are interested in—is simply: what is the tax policy of the Keating government? What range of new taxes are going to be imposed? What is the secret tax agenda?

         Immediately after the last election, the fuel excise was lifted from around 26c a litre to some 33c a litre. There was no mention of this during the campaign; in fact, a constant attack on the taxation policy of the coalition, but no comment by the government that they were going to increase taxes. I asked government ministers and senators to indicate to me where they had indicated to the electorate that there would be a massive increase in fuel excise taxes.

         This is probably an extra secret tax of the order of $50 million to $100 million.

         It is quite clear that the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, has not in any way cleared up these matters with the Australian Customs Service and has not issued guidelines for the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. They have not indemnified from prosecution claimants who, because of the total lack of information and guidance by the Australian Customs Service, have placed themselves in jeopardy and could now be subject to major problems in the assessment process.

         Similarly, Senator Schacht and the government seem to be hiding on this area of secret taxes the interpretations for eligibility of both mining industry and agricultural industry activities.

        Many members of the public will be well aware of the significance of this issue at this point in the week and also my colleagues in the chamber are well aware that this week the federal cabinet has been meeting to consider the fate of our native forests. Of course that has aroused considerable concern within the community. That is the reason for this matter of urgency debate today.

         This is a vital time for forests and the outcome of the deferred forest assessment process will be announced on Friday of this week, we are told, as part of the decision that the federal government is making to renew export woodchip licences. This is really the last chance for the government to patch up its very blackened environmental credentials. I believe that the vast majority of the community is justifiably concerned that the government will not take the opportunity that is provided to it to actually take a decisive step in the protection of our high conservation value native forests.

         We seek their protection particularly from the depredations of the woodchip industry. The scale and extent of logging of our forests for the woodchip export industry over the last 10 to 15 years has increased so markedly as to cause concern to even the ordinary observer who travels, as is their usual wont in the south-west of Western Australia, to see the beauties of that unique forest area.

         The major concern is the extent of the logging, sometimes involving clear-felling of high conservation value forests that are remaining and their use as woodchips. It is particularly ironic at a time when there is a huge stockpile of logs lying in native forest areas and alongside roads and also when there is a clear glut on the market. It is adding insult to injury to be considering the renewal of the licences for export of woodchips at this time.

         The particular bill that I introduced in the Senate this week actually had as its focus the protection of Australia's native forests and it deals with the issues we are discussing in this matter of urgency debate. We believe that the community is calling for the government to have the political will to protect old-growth forests, to preserve wilderness, to actually make sure there is no more export of woodchips from native forests in world heritage areas, on the National Estate or on the interim register of the National Estate.

         We certainly know the government made a commitment that it would be phasing out export woodchips. We have seen no evidence in that respect. In fact, if the decision goes ahead with only the threatened holding back of 20 per cent as a kind of insurance that the conservation and the deferred forests assessment process will be upheld, it means there is no reduction in the export licences, and that is a disgrace. This is a time when we were promised there would be a total phase-out by the year 2000 and nothing has moved in that regard.

Those areas deserve our protection. The community has called on the government to do that and, if the government does not respond to that call, it is falling far short of what it is expected to do.

         There is growing international research, especially from Greenpeace New Zealand, but also from Europe, that multi-species and multi-age cultivations are much more robust and productive and less susceptible to the pests and diseases which affect other monocultures. This transition needs to be carefully planned. It needs to be flexible and it needs to be well advised with statistics. We also need to recognise that what is proposed by the government as a continuation of what exists at the moment cannot be defended. It has produced division and anxiety in the industry, as well as the community which is not directly involved.

         There is a range of tree harvesting practices, tree resource type and forestry type covering everything from those pristine, untouched, high conservation value, unique, precious and aesthetically priceless treasures which all Australians would agree need to be protected. There are a range of forest types—whether they be fairly mundane, ordinary land which is often described as scrub, through to land which is shared in an agricultural sense, through to rough grazing and a mixture of agricultural and private forest types to public or private plantation types. These all require a different management style. They cannot be treated just by drawing a couple of lines on maps and then arguing about the extent of a quantum of numbers.

         We need to recognise that there is a range of forest management practices which range from clear felling—the slash and burn mentality—right through to what is essentially gardening of individual trees and plantations. In recognising that, we have to ensure that we make allowance in a forest statement and a wood products statement to recognise the opportunities that exist for different management styles and a different range of treatments. That is not recognised in what we are expecting in a couple of days.

         I have asked the government for the costs of chipping and the benefits of chipping. The information is not available. We find just today from ABARE—from some figures I have had analysed—that if exports of pulpwood have brought us $564 million, imports of timber have cost us $538 million. We are exporting pulpwood in one form and importing timber which we see used in construction sites around Australia. We do not see a lot of high value quality wood. These figures demonstrate the need for much more research.

         —The motion specifically mentions a transition strategy. Why is it important and why has the government crossed it out? It has been continually asked why a low value product has been sought when a high value product could have been used. Frequently there have been interjections across the chamber, `Why would anyone use a tree for a low value product, Senator, when they could make a high value sawlog?' Good question. The answer is: you are talking about labour costs and about volumes versus value minus labour costs.

         So when you look at the volumes in relation to export woodchips, that is what is sought by the companies involved. We have heard today about the values of the imported products. Therefore, we can see that, no matter how much volume of woodchips we go after, we are never going to have a positive balance of trade at this rate in the way the industry is structured. We must have a transition strategy.

         In timber towns in Western Australia people are very dependent on a major industry like a woodchipping industry. Another way of looking at it is that while those towns were produced, and a lot of the time owned, by governments—say, the Western Australian government—the housing, infrastructure and so on was often given to the companies involved. People have lived in those houses for years and years. The company has been more than paid, over and over again, for the value of those houses. Guess what? When those people lose their jobs, not because of the conservation movement but because of the nature of the industry—because it is using more volume of forest and fewer people, and has been doing so at a rate over the last few years—then those people's only options are to leave town or buy one of the houses.

         That is something that should be looked into. If industry is saying that it is really concerned about the jobs of workers, then the fact that those workers will have paid many times over for their houses should be taken into consideration. That should be part of any severance package, I believe, when the nature of the industry has caused the retrenchments.

         Are the large companies really concerned? What is a transition strategy? I will tell you what it is not. It is not replacing export woodchips when the market for export woodchips tails off with whacking great pulp mills which will continue to rely on the exploitation of old-growth forests. I will get to that later.

         We need to look at the people who are currently working in the industry. If we are looking at jobs, we also have to look at what kinds of areas those people could reasonably be retrained in. We have to look at, as I mentioned before, where those people can live and the viability of the towns in which they live. We also have to look at the fact that a lot of the towns in which they live also have other needs for resource security.

         To give you an example, the Gloucester Tree in the south-west of Western Australia has been closed. The official reason is that the tree is not safe to climb any more. Many people suspect the real reason is, if you climbed the Gloucester Tree now—which earns the local community something like $8 million a year from people who come and want to look at the area—you would be disgusted with what you saw from the top of that tree.

         We had an announcement the other day that a new tree has been opened. They have found another bit of forest which might be able to be looked at from a tall tree. In the future perhaps they will have to change to another tree. That resource, which is necessary for the tourist industry, for small business, for craft industry and for high value industry in that area—creating jobs, not losing jobs—is being taken away from those people. Those jobs are real jobs too.

         Plantations are an existing resource. We have had copious information about that. In Western Australia agroforestry is an almost untapped reserve of future timber not only for pulp but also for sawlogs and reducing salinity. We have to be looking at these strategies sensibly and we have to take all of this into consideration. We have to talk about the real viability of towns, we have to talk about jobs in a total sense and we have to talk about resource security in its widest sense. If we really do look at those and if we really do look at the actual benefits and cost to our community, then we should make the right decisions.

         This is a very significant report by the Auditor-General into risk management by Commonwealth consumer product safety regulators. The Auditor-General is a very useful person and his office is of great assistance, particularly in looking at areas where there is the capacity to save taxpayers' money.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Every time the opposition says that there is scope for saving money, the government asks, `Where?', in some sort of accusatory way. The fact is that there are many areas—and the Auditor-General keeps pointing them out—where money can and should be saved. This report by the Auditor-General points out yet another area. I hope that the next coalition government will take action, as recommended by the Auditor-General, to save millions of dollars.

          According to the Auditor-General in this report, it is conservatively estimated that annual government outlays on medical treatment of consumer product caused injuries and on deaths is between $194 million and $238 million. Clearly, here is a situation where prevention is far better than having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in governmental outlays—that means taxpayers' money—on medical treatment of injuries and on deaths caused by consumer products either malfunctioning or doing something which they are not supposed to do. The Auditor-General says:

         As the Auditor says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         These figures illustrate the extent and cost of unsafe consumer products. They also indicate the scope for the Department of Human Services and Health to reduce medical treatment costs through the better adoption of a risk management approach by regulators and increased leadership and coordination by the Department.
        </para>
        <para>
         Yes, the department could and should be doing more to cut out this horrendous bill, which is not only a bill in financial terms but also an enormous impost in physical terms on those people who are injured or, of course, who suffer death as a result of consumer product failures. The Auditor-General in the report found:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . regulators—
        </para>
        <para>
         that is the whole range of them: governmental authorities charged with regulating various consumer products ranging from ordinary consumer products to therapeutic goods, the Federal Office of Road Safety, the National Food Authority, the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and so on—

         Regulators usually focus attention on specific regulatory action rather than coordinated, systematic countermeasures . . . with clearly defined objectives and outcomes. To protect consumers better, they—

        <para>
         the official regulators—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         need to adopt risk management principles involving the identification and analysis of injuries, illnesses and deaths related to consumer products; setting priorities; and designing, implementing and evaluating intervention strategies which reduce the human and economic cost of unsafe consumer products.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General goes on:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To reduce consumer product related injuries and deaths, regulators should identify injury causes and interventions. This information is also necessary to target such interventions and assess their effectiveness. The ANAO found that all regulators need to improve their risk identification and analysis as part of their management program.

        <para font-size="-=2" justification="CENTERJUST">

        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is a particular need for more coordinated risk identification and analysis across the Commonwealth and for regulators . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         It is interesting to note that the report says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs—
        </para>
        <para>
         for example—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         has not adopted a strategic approach to identifying and analysing consumer product safety risks. The Bureau has acknowledged that its role `has tended to be one of reacting to injuries rather than preventing them'.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is no doubt that that clearly is an area where the Auditor-General believes, and I think the parliament believes, that there is real scope for far better coordinated activity by the government. In the area of recalling faulty items, the Auditor-General points out:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There is scope for all regulators to improve their monitoring and coordinating of voluntary recalls . . . The ANAO found that regulators did not encourage compliance sufficiently with recall codes or ensure that the nature of the hazard and potential consequences were effectively communicated to consumers. As a result, recall effectiveness was impaired.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         He goes on:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Only three mandatory recalls of consumer products have ever been ordered. All were requested by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. There were instances where regulators decided that mandatory recalls were necessary but were unable to have mandatory recalls ordered through the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. The ANAO considers the Bureau should facilitate the use of mandatory recalls by all regulators to ensure mandatory recalls are ordered when necessary.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         That strikes me as extraordinary—that over all that time these regulators have been in existence there have been only three such mandatory recalls. I might say that the business community has behaved very sensibly and you often see product recalls at the initiative of industry itself rather than mandatory recalls at the request of government. I think that is a very positive point. No doubt the need for intervention may well be limited if the private sector in fact behaves in that kind of responsible way. The Auditor-General in particular looks to the consequences of failing to protect Australian consumers. He says:

          The report found that consumer products were a prime cause of injury. A study commissioned by the ANAO . . . found consumer product-related deaths totalled 4630 in 1991-92.

        </para>
        <para>
         So the enormous cost of consumer product-related deaths and injury to the Australian community is enormous. I commend the Auditor-General for examining this matter in the way that he has. It is another instance of those studies which do reveal that there is potential for the cutting of government expenditure, or at least the saving of government expenditure, if proper preventative measures are adopted. It puts the lie once again to the statement continually made by the government that there is no way of further cutting government expenditure. There certainly is and the Auditor-General has pointed out yet another of them.

         Before speaking specifically to it, I remind the Senate that this is the third in a series of reports prepared by the joint select committee arising initially from a review of the Family Law Act and its operations. Senators will recall that prior to that happening Senator Brownhill was significantly involved in urging senators, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and others to become involved in this issue, which was a significant issue in the electorate offices of all of us from the number of constituents who came to us about problems with the court, as they saw it, and about problems with the Child Support Agency.

          In the initial terms of reference, though, we were restricted to looking at the operation of the court itself and were not asked to look at the Child Support Agency. Of the vast array of amendments—many of which senators have come to know better in recent times as we have debated bills putting into effect some of the recommendations—one of the recommendations was that the act be reprinted and made easier to use. Considering that it all started from what was supposed to be a simple procedure, that was a necessity.

Nobody was challenging that the legislation was sound. Nobody was challenging the fact that if you parent a child you will contribute to its support as the first line of support, not other taxpayers as the first line of support. We have presented the report in relation to the agency.

The first report was an excellent one, due to the skill of his chairmanship and the way he went about the inquiry, which was a difficult one.

I recognise the role that Robina Mills played in the life of the committee. When she left in March 1994, Jane Vincent became the secretary. She has worked most diligently, having had a great deal to catch up on.

          In the time available I can refer to only some of the issues in the report. Our conclusion is that the court is adequately funded. We base that in part on the statement the Chief Justice made in 1992 to the effect that funding was adequate to do the existing tasks at existing standards. We felt that was a significant comment.

          We believe that the court ought not embark on initiatives without first securing funding. Mechanisms are in place for it to go to the Department of Finance to discuss additional funding from time to time. We were critical of the court's practice of overspending and of the management practices that enabled it to borrow against future funds. In the end, the view of all of us on the committee was that this year the court has been rescued by the Justice Statement. I do not know how it would have coped with its funding situation had the Justice Statement not been put down. That is not a satisfactory situation. As noted in the report, continual borrowing is analogous to a person living on their bankcard, and we have been somewhat critical of that.

          We dealt with the area of funding in some detail. I want to deal now with an area that flows from that—counselling. We make no specific recommendations about it, but counselling is an area that should be noted. The Family Law Act implies that counselling will relate to the parties' situations in such a way that many people who go to Family Court counsellors believe they will get counselling to put their marriage back together. That does not happen and most people involved with the act know why it does not happen at that point—it is too late.

          Marriage counselling is something that needs to take place much sooner and in the community. We have suggested that that part of the counselling function be removed from the Family Court completely. I do not want people to think that we are abandoning the concept of trying to make marriages work. We believe very strongly in that concept. We are suggesting that counselling take place much more in the community and away from the court, especially at the stage when parties are trying to work out what has gone wrong with their marriage, how to keep it functioning and how to keep a home environment for their children.

          The Family Court counselling service should be dealing with the consequences of breakdown and keeping things as civil as possible by letting parties work through their grief over losing their marriage, and so on. Again, you would have to read what we have said. When we were discussing this issue, many of us agreed with Senator Spindler's comment that the bit about reconciliation counselling was probably put in when the bill was being debated in 1974 or 1975 to make the whole thing more palatable, to make it look as though saving marriages was part of the aim.

          Saving marriages is my aim in life—so I would not want to be misunderstood on this at all—but it is my experience that by the time people go to a solicitor or to the Family Court their marriage has long since shattered. Although that might not be so for both parties. One party might go to the court and say, `I want my spouse back. I want our problems resolved.' They are the ones who did not realise early that the marriage was in trouble.

          In relation to the judicial structure of the court, we have recommended that there be a two-tiered structure. There were two tiers of judges once; we are not going back to that. We want to strengthen the role of judicial registrars. We were impressed with the work they are doing. We want to extend that and extend their authority. We have recommended that chapter 3 of the constitution be used to enable judicial registrars to have more power and to be able to deal with greater amounts of property. We have advice that that is possible. If that advice is incorrect, things might have to be done differently. But there are other recommendations of significance there. I would have a lot more judicial registrars, with appeals from their work going to the judges.

          . Like Senator Reid, my thoughts went back to the beginnings of this committee, to 1991, when Senator Brownhill and I were jointly responsible for establishing the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. Little did we know that we were embarking on a five-year journey.

          The committee's first report was tabled in 1992. I wish to acknowledge the excellent chairmanship and leadership provided by Senator McKiernan to the committee in producing that report. The committee, in a somewhat different structure, secondly inquired into the child support system. Most recently, it has inquired into the funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia.

          During those three inquiries my overwhelming impression was that this is perhaps the most traumatic area of the law in which one can be involved. The sheer volume of submissions that we received to the first report—more than 6,000 submissions—would indicate how traumatic many people in the community find this particular experience. We should also acknowledge that, when a marriage shatters, it is very difficult for the law to find solutions; it is essentially a human problem. I think we all found out that in this process there are limits to what we as legislators can do and what the law can do in remedying something that is essentially a human tragedy.

          This also needs to be borne in mind when we talk about the Family Court and those who work in it. I have found throughout that, without exception, Family Court personnel devote themselves, with great diligence and conscientiousness, to a task which at all times is extremely difficult. I believe that this needs to be borne in mind, especially when reading this report in which the committee has expressed some clear criticisms about the administration and funding procedures of the Family Court. So, firstly, we must bear in mind the immense and difficult task confronted by personnel at the court; and, secondly, we need to take into account the fact that the tasks of the court were not as clearly defined in the legislation as perhaps they could have been.

          Senator Reid has referred already to the comment I made during the committee deliberations, that perhaps it was wrong to include—and it may have been a political move—the task of reconciliation in the tasks of the Family Court. This is in no way to understate that task: it is an important one and must be pursued. Obviously, the saving of every marriage is a task that we must pursue, especially if there are children involved. However, by the time people come to the Family Court, in most cases the time for that is past. If the Family Court finds that there is still a glimmer of hope, then it may be more appropriate to refer such reconciliation efforts to agencies who are directly concerned with and focused on that particular effort, rather than to incorporate it into the work of the court.

          This, of course, does not include the counselling that takes place as a particular case proceeds within the court's structure. Even in that case, I believe that the main task of the counselling is to find the best possible solution for the two separating partners and, more particularly, for any children involved in the situation—and that must at all times remain the highest priority of the court.

          It is useful to note that the committee has stated that, for the current work the court is undertaking, the funding is adequate. I emphasise `the current work' because it is quite clear that there are areas, particularly for people in remote locations, where the court could and should extend its services. In that case, the committee recommends that the Family Court approach the Department of Finance, document clearly the additional services that are demanded by the needs of the community, and base further funding negotiations on a clear understanding of policy decisions to meet those needs.

          It will also be useful to have, from time to time, regular external reviews of the court and an efficiency audit by the Auditor-General as a guide that would assist the administrators in the Family Court. I believe that some of the other recommendations will no doubt be dealt with in some detail by people in the profession and people in the court system, such as the role of judicial registrars that the committee recommends, and also the suggestion that other courts, particularly magistrates and local courts, enter the field more extensively with the support of the Family Court.

          A separate word needs to be said for the area of mediation, which the committee in principle certainly supports, as have previous committee reports. This is clearly an area which will expand greatly in the future and may save many a court case from proceeding. However, it should be noted that the mediation field is still in its infancy. When we discussed amendments to the Family Law Act in this chamber recently, it became a matter of debate whether private mediators are adequately accredited and whether there is sufficient supervision of the work that they would carry out.

          The minister then referred the Senate to a discussion paper that addressed possible regulations that would be drawn up by the government. But on perusing that discussion paper, I have found that there is no real provision for the qualifications or accreditation of private mediators. That, therefore, remains a deficiency. Certainly in the transitionary period, until that is properly established and proper supervision is provided, the continued involvement of the Family Court would, in my personal view, be useful.

          Originally the school was to go to Townsville. With the relocation of the 1st Armoured Regiment to Darwin, facilities become available at Puckapunyal. This factor, and the large field firing range at Puckapunyal, prompted Defence to re-examine the Townsville option.

          The proposal examined by the committee was somewhat different from other projects examined during the year. In this particular instance there was intense opposition to the move from North Head from local members of parliament, Manly Council and a number of community groups. The honourable member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, left the committee in no doubt regarding his opposition to the move.

          Despite claims to the contrary, the committee believes opposition to the move is based more on local interests than national defence interests. North Head is a very pleasant location, but it lacks access to a field firing range. The range at Holsworthy is no longer suited for the type of training undertaken. It suffers from urban encroachment, is too small and is under the flight path to Sydney airport. It is also a two-hour drive away from North Head.

         The 17th report of the Select Committee on Superannuation examines the adequacy of retirement incomes policy arrangements in meeting the needs of those members of the community whose participation in the paid work force falls outside the traditional 30 to 40 years of continuous involvement. The inquiry has predominantly focused on women, as, in the main, they are the members of the community who are most affected. This does not negate the fact that some men also experience broken work patterns.

          Changes to superannuation legislation over recent years have significantly increased membership of superannuation schemes, most significantly for women. However, a recent study by the Retirement Income Modelling Task Force of the distribution of private sector superannuation assets and contributions found that women had substantially lower average superannuation asset accumulations than men.

          Throughout the course of the inquiry it was obvious that the current superannuation system is designed for the individual with a traditional employment history, the individual who enters the paid labour force full time at the end of their education and stays there until retirement. This pattern fits most men. It is not the pattern that fits most women. It does not fit women because: women have a higher incidence of part-time work; women's broken work force participation patterns mean that they have fewer years of contributory service; and women's average earnings are lower than men's.

          The committee, however, was very conscious that broader community expectations abound that influence women's participation in the paid work force and that the achievement of total equality in retirement income would require changes to other aspects of society. Superannuation should not and must not be beholden to overcome the inequalities that exist elsewhere, but all efforts must be taken to ensure that the system we have in place does not unnecessarily compound them.

          Of particular concern to the committee is that the shift towards self-funded retirement may result in a two-tier society. The fear is that those who, for whatever reason, are not able to provide for their retirement—a significant proportion of whom will be women—and therefore remain on the age pension will become `second class citizens', scorned by society. It must be acknowledged that for some women, who forgo years in the paid work force to undertake caring and family responsibilities, occupationally linked superannuation will never be sufficient to provide for them in their retirement.

          Measures to reduce tax imbalance: the committee considered that some aspects of the current contribution system could be improved to assist workers with intermittent work patterns. The committee was concerned that the limited tax advantage flowing to low income earners from superannuation contributions did not encourage such contributions. The committee therefore recommends that measures which would redress the tax imbalance for low income earners be investigated.

          Transfer protocols, vesting and portability: the committee recognised that intermittent worker work patterns can result in a worker having a number of disparate accounts and, because of the employment periods required for vesting, the worker missing out on any employer contributions above the mandated superannuation guarantee charge, SGC. The issue of small amounts has been addressed by the committee previously but it believes that there are further opportunities for improvement. The committee makes three recommendations to improve the position of such workers.

          The first is that the government ensure that appropriate transfer protocols are adopted by all funds accepting compulsory contributions.

The second is that the exemptions relating to vesting, portability and preservation, together with all other exemptions relating to superannuation in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, be removed before the end of March 1997. The third is that the superannuation legislation be amended to require immediate vesting of all employer contributions.

          However, two areas remain of concern. One is the differing costs of annuities for men and women. Whilst a range of factors are taken into account in the pricing of some insurance policies—for example, smoking habits for health insurance—only gender is taken into account in the pricing of annuities. The committee is concerned that this is inappropriate and recommends that the government encourage and monitor research on the use of gender and morbidity actuarial tables in respect of the provision of annuities with a view to either amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to exclude the exemption for actuarial or statistical data, or declaring the gender based actuarial tables to be not covered by the exemption if it is discovered that reliance on these tables cannot reasonably justify the resulting discrimination.

          Divorce: an area of significant concern to the community is the treatment of superannuation assets on divorce. The high incidence of divorce and the increasing value of superannuation as an asset within the family unit require that clear guidelines be determined. The committee understands that a working group has been in existence for some time, with little or no obvious results being evident. The committee is greatly concerned about the serious delay that has occurred in the resolution of this problem and recommends in the strongest terms that this issue be rectified as a priority.

          Education: the committee is concerned that the current superannuation awareness raising campaign,`Super: it grows on you' will have little impact on the many women who are yet to recognise the need to engage in any form of financial planning. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in some, maybe many, instances, women are anticipating that their partners will look after them in retirement. Therefore, the committee recommends that, firstly, the Office of the Status of Women develop a comprehensive educational strategy to raise understanding and awareness amongst women of the components of, and the imperative to engage in, financial planning; secondly, the government, in conjunction with the superannuation industry, should develop an educational strategy to promote understanding and awareness of superannuation which goes beyond the provision of information only and which involves active participation of the community.

          Female trustees: men will gain a greater interest in superannuation if it addresses their employment patterns and recognises their broader needs and aspirations. This will best be achieved by involving women in the management of the funds, in particular as trustees. The committee therefore recommends that strategies be developed which provide avenues through which women can gain the necessary confidence and expertise to participate as trustees. Such a move will also have significant benefits for the superannuation industry, ensuring that it more fully reflects the community it serves and drawing on the widest pool of talent available to it.

          To ensure that this occurs, the committee has made three recommendations: firstly, that the Affirmative Action Agency develop reporting requirements for superannuation funds of programs that will enhance equal opportunities for women to act as fund trustees. It is recommended that these reporting requirements be ready for implementation by the 1996-97 financial year; secondly, that regulated, non-excluded superannuation funds be required to comply with current affirmative action program development and annual reporting in relation to developing equal opportunities for women to act as fund trustees in order to maintain their complying status; and, thirdly, that the appointment of female alternates be a matter upon which superannuation funds must report to the Affirmative Action Agency and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.

          Pension age increase: an area of dissent within the committee was the raising of the pension age for women from 60 to 65 years of age. The implementation of the change, to be phased in over a 20-year period, has already commenced. The major parties have committed themselves to the increase whilst the Democrats strongly oppose it. However, all committee members strongly support the recommendation that the government undertake an information program specifically targeted at those women who are likely to be affected by the change in the pension age in the coming years, which explains the change and outlines the alternative maintenance benefits available. This should be supported by an identified officer within the Department of Social Security from whom women concerned about the change can seek advice.

          Meeting the challenge: during the inquiry it has become clear that the past and present experience of women, and their capacity to provide for their retirement, is such that it would be irresponsible for any government to ignore the arguments for change and allow the status quo to continue. It has also become clear that removing the obstacles inherent in the superannuation system which mitigate against many women achieving a retirement income that will ensure a dignified standard of living will benefit all members of society, both male and female.

However, the challenge remains to ensure that the superannuation system that Australia carries into the 21st century is the most equitable system possible so that in future years it will be judged resoundingly as a significant contribution towards ensuring equality and dignity for all members of the community.

          I want to make only two points in this debate. The first is that it is obvious that the current superannuation system is designed substantially for full-time workers with unbroken career paths; that is, people who begin work in their teens, continue with full-time work throughout their working life and retire in their late fifties or sixties; that is, still mainly men.

          I was struck by what one witness said. The plea went along these lines: why can't you admit that the present superannuation system is not designed to meet women's needs? I do not know that that is an entirely accurate description of the system, but it certainly gave the committee cause to think.

          The other comment I want to make deals with a particular concern of the Australian Democrats about increasing the pension age of women to 65. Chapter 15 of the report, which is titled `Moving the goal posts—increasing the pension age for women', I believe, underlines the various sides in this debate. I believe this chapter underlines and reinforces the position taken by the Democrats in this debate, and that is that the pension age should not be increased. I believe the evidence given by witnesses underlines the position we have taken.

          —Of course they did. If there is a question of equality to be resolved, and the conclusion to the chapter points out that this is the Democrats' position—and I believe the witnesses supported our contention—the pension age for women should not be raised to 65. If it is a question of equality, the pension age for men should be lowered. I say this for a number of reasons. I believe they were brought out in this chapter.

          The participation of women in the labour force over recent decades has improved. There is no doubt about that. That is not reflected in figures for women aged 60 and over.

          The increase in women's superannuation coverage also does not mean that a majority of women will have adequate cover to retire with dignity even in 20 years time. It may be that younger women now in their teens or early twenties will be able to retire with an adequate superannuation cover, but this will depend on a number of factors. It will depend on a number of current barriers being overcome. These barriers include still lower rates of pay, broken work history due to caring and child-bearing roles and the much lower participation rate of older women in the paid work force.

          The Department of Social Security argued before the committee that raising the pension age sent a clear message to employers and the community at large that the government did not endorse early retirement for men and women. I believe that argument is a little self-serving. There have been attempts by employers to force women to retire at 60. They have been strenuously resisted by women. A number of test cases have established the right of women to remain in the paid work force beyond 60. That is the element which has caused the change in the attitude of employers.

          The Department of Social Security also stated before the committee that a range of alternative income support payments exist to assist women affected by the increase in women's qualifying age for the age pension. Again, this is a little misleading. The Department of Social Security did not say that the alternatives provided by the department are at a lower rate than the age pension, lead to stigmatisation, and attract significant disadvantages such as the activity test and case management for jobsearch and newstart allowances. I have put on the record what women say about what happened to them because of those provisions. If it is necessary to provide an alternative income support system I believe that is proof that claims about equality and labour market participation are wrong.

Particularly when we are talking about people with broken work patterns, it is inextricably linked to what has always been referred to in the past as the small amounts problem. We tend to think that the small amounts problem has been addressed to some degree. It took a long time. Many of the factors raised during this inquiry about broken work patterns reinforce some of the decisions that have been made or need to be made in relation to small amounts.

          There are widely differing views amongst the members of this committee, particularly in some areas, and one of those that Senator Watson did not mention was the chapter on `Choice of fund'. I think it reflects the goodwill of members of the committee that we were able, at the conclusion of the final paragraph of the chapter on `Choice of fund', to say:

        <para>
         I think it is fair to say that we do have different philosophies with regard to the choice of fund. But if we are going to look at freedom of choice in the context of trying to help solve the small amounts problem, we need to think not only of employees, and employees who are involved sometimes in quite large industry funds, but also of people who in some cases are providing for their own retirement by way of self-employed funds, people who these days by choice are doing some other work—whether it be perhaps doing a month's lecturing at a TAFE college or spending a small amount of time in a hospital as a resident medical officer.

          This impacts on their own personal superannuation. Choice of funds does allow people in these circumstances to make sure that all of their preparation for retirement and all of their funding for their retirement is going into the one fund. This lessens the impacts of any fees and charges that might be levied, and it certainly does not allow any of these amounts to erode.

          So there were a lot of differing opinions amongst the members of the committee with regard to freedom of choice of funds. I hold my own particular strong views because I believe there should be freedom of choice. A person may choose at the start of his working life to use a certain fund. No matter where that fund is, should he change jobs or should he have a variety of jobs, I believe he should have the choice to be able to keep that fund for the remainder of his working life. Currently that is not the case in many situations. That is just one of the issues that was dealt with at length.

          Also, the issue of taxation was touched on by Senator Watson. I think it is very important that we see that people who are on low incomes because of the taxation arrangement of superannuation contributions are not disadvantaged by the scheme that has been put in place, because they pay an unfair tax burden on their contributions when compared with those people who are in a far better situation.

         —The requested amendments that we are asking the House of Representatives to make relate to Meridian Investment. The request provides that those investments are deemed to be saved investments. As I explained last night in the second reading stage of this bill, the trust collapsed in 1990 and investors lost a considerable amount of money at that time. The trust has now, of course, been relisted as the Meridian Investment Trust. Since that time, investments have increased considerably. However, the gains have not been sufficient to make up for the massive losses that originally occurred.

         Investments in the original trust were exempt from the unrealised capital gains rules as they were classified as saved investments. When the trust was relisted they were no longer exempt and the total gain since that time has been assessed under the income test. This has caused large reductions in many investors' pensions. The coalition indicated last week that it would be proposing requests in the committee stage of this bill to treat Meridian investments as saved investments until July 1996.

The government recently decided to bring forward the well-received extended deeming measures to clients holding Meridian Investment Trust investments in recognition of the high rates of return being assessed for this investment, despite the large capital losses of investors. Global Funds Management, the managers of MIT, had asked the government to bring this forward.

         The government believes it has introduced the fairest arrangement for holders of MITs.

         —I would like to begin by agreeing completely with Senator Knowles that those who had Meridian investments were most unfairly treated by the previous rules. The way in which their small gains—from a very low base and only a fraction of what they originally put in in terms of investment—were counted as increased gains in an asset that was treated as income. Therefore the effect on their pension was quite considerable.

         However, as we read through these requests for amendment, we understand that all former Estate Mortgage investors who exchanged their investment to Meridian shares should have their investment treated, as it says, as a market-linked investment made or acquired before September. This means that any pension or payments lost as a consequence of the unrealised capital growth assessment should be then reimbursed to all or most of those pensioners or part-pensioners.

I think it is also relevant for the chamber to consider a related type matter that does not affect Meridian but affects another winding up of a fund. This will be of particular importance to members in Western Australia. The fund I refer to is known as the Excelsior Managed Superannuation Fund.

         People in that fund will be forced by the winding up to transfer their capital to another fund. Then the Department of Social Security will apply the new rules which apply to allocated pensions purchased after 1 July 1992. Those rules, if applied, will mean that the capital in all those people's allocated pension funds will be brought in as an asset for the purpose of the assets test. Aged pensioners, including those who wrote to me in my capacity as chair of the Select Committee on Superannuation, believe that the result of that action would be that their pension could be drastically reduced or perhaps, at worst, terminated.

         Unfortunately, it was never intended that allocated pensions would be treated so harshly in cases such as this. It is not their fault that they got caught up in a scheme which some so-called eminent chartered accountants lost control of. They lost control of certain computer applications. It was taken over by another body, but because of the high withdrawal rate the new managers were forced to wind up the fund.

         The consequences of the wind up are that the members have had to transfer their allocated pensions to a new fund and are fearful that they will lose social security entitlements as a result of this Excelsior-demise problem. I ask the minister to advise whether people in such situations will lose their entitlements as a consequence of having to transfer to new funds.

         I note that you said that it is not the responsibility of any of the people who had Excelsior managed superannuation funds that this fund has been wound up. I have to also say that it is not the responsibility of government that this happened. It is very regrettable.

         I am not proposing at this stage, unless the opposition produces a magnificent argument that I have not yet heard, to support the opposition's request for amendment. I will be supporting the process that the department has taken up until now which is to address the very legitimate concerns that I believe the opposition's request raises. The department is addressing them in a way that is more practical than the request that is currently before us. I believe that it may be a logistical nightmare and involve a lot of retrospectivity. I believe it is better to go with what appears to be a simpler arrangement and which the government appears to be proposing to continue.

         —While the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, is attending to the amendments, could she clarify what the government's rationale is for treating tax paid income—in other words, income that has been subject, say, to an interest type withholding tax or a tax paid income prior to distribution—differently to a distribution without tax? It seems to me that the government in adopting the same application to the two types of income is effectively discriminating against an investment bond that is issued by Australian friendly societies.

         Friendly societies have been a traditional form of saving in this country for over 100 years. They have been the repository of funds for, generally, those sections of the community that have below average earnings. I find it rather difficult to understand why a government of compassion is taxing and assessing for social security these investments in such a discriminatory way. The government has announced a series of increments to the tax rates for friendly society products. That means that they will ultimately rise above the ordinary corporate tax rate. Currently they are frozen from further increase at 33 per cent until July 1997.

         To apply these rates to the incomes of low income persons is quite discriminatory, quite harsh and quite unfair. Therefore, I ask the government why it is not prepared to take into account the after tax consequences of tax paid income, particularly that income which flows from investment bonds? If the government adopts that process we would then have what is known as a level playing field. However, the government does not acknowledge this distinction; it stands condemned for imposing a penal rate on products which are held by that section of the community which does not have great financial resources.

         Has anybody not got any conscience about imposing obligations such as these and saying that these organisations can encourage these people to move out of these sorts of investments? If one adopts that argument, the result will be that the investment values of friendly society products will fall if everybody pulls their money out before maturity. It is going to cause a rush on the funds and some other difficulties will follow.

         The problem can be so easily overcome. I understand that the government is prepared to take submissions from life companies and also friendly societies on the incomes of their constituent members. Until the government makes its announcement on what the new rate should be and what it has predetermined to be excessive then I think it is only reasonable that these changes before us today are on a level playing field and don't impact unfairly on friendly society bond holders. In other words, the Senate should look at the after tax consequences in terms of the income which is to be deemed from these particular investment products.

I would be interested to see whether the government would be prepared to put up a motion to ensure that those people are not discriminated against in the way that I have just explained.

Senator, this issue that you raised has been very extensively canvassed in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. For example, a number of submissions from ACOSS, the Council on the Ageing and the Australian Pensioner and Superannuants Federation urged no change. It is important to note that the recommendations from that committee report were for no change.

         I think the points that you raised have been very extensively canvassed. On balance, the government's move to the five per cent and seven per cent deeming is a preferred way to go. It certainly seems to have received very high acceptance across a whole lot of people, organisations and institutions involved in retirement income. I think you made the point a minute ago that there are a raft of complexities, confusions and possible difficulties for people. The changes to deeming mean that many of those complexities and confusions have been removed. Maybe in the end it is a toss-up or on balance that you make decisions, but certainly the acceptance of that simplification of deeming has been very highly appreciated by people involved in here.

I am not saying that deeming is not appropriate. I am saying that in applying the deeming rules, let us apply them consistently to all forms of products, particularly those which have had tax pre-paid compared with those products which have had no tax paid at all. Otherwise you are discriminating against those products which are tax pre-paid. Keep your deeming proposals of five per cent and seven per cent, but in calculating the income which is subject to deeming, adjust for a tax rate that has been pre-paid, namely 33 per cent. That is a very simple exercise. If you would like an amendment, I am prepared to give it to you.

         I think it is important that we do not discriminate against pensioners who could be worse off by virtue of the nature of the assets they hold. I know that there are people in favour of generalised deeming and I know that support comes from wide sectors of the community. I am also aware of the arguments put to the committee by the Department of Social Security. I say to the Senate and the government that we are putting a lot of emphasis on superannuation and saving, yet we are effectively putting all our eggs in the superannuation basket. For centuries friendly societies have been a repository for savings funds in Australia and yet the Senate is squeezing out friendly societies. This legislation before us today appears part of that squeezing process and discriminates against those people who have been prepared to save something for their retirement. Let us be generous to them. Let us do the right thing. Let us look at a transitional process so that these pensioners will not be worse off—for example, those who have no immediate plans to withdraw their investments and would now become income assessed for the first time and pensioners with investments on which a loss has been made.

         You are discriminating against the thrifty. We talk about savings. You have just introduced a new minister to promote your superannuation campaign. At the same time, you are discriminating against another valuable traditional area of saving, through friendly societies, most unfairly. I impress that you consider this question of an amendment to take into account the after-tax consequences of these particular products until July 1997. It is a simple change and will create fairness and equity. As a Senate, are we going to stand condemned by legislating against that section of the community that is least able to help itself?

        These amendments will clarify issues relating to valuation dates for managed investments and listed securities that fluctuate according to market values. Because of this amendment pensioners will know with certainty when the rate of their pensions may change because the Department of Social Security has revalued their investments. The amendment will provide that listed securities and market linked managed investments will only be revalued when the investment values are reviewed on 20 March and 20 September or the recipient requests that the department revalue any of his or her investments or an event occurs that affects an investment and is specified in a recipient notification notice. An example of an event that may be specified in a notice is a change to a bank account of more than $1,000. The recipient is required to notify the department of changes such as these so that the recipient's social security payment can be correctly reassessed.

         The government had intended to consult the community before introducing revised arrangements for valuing assets. It has already informally discussed some options for better administrative arrangements with groups such as the APSF. However, the non-government parties were keen to have arrangements set out in the legislation. While the government would have preferred the opportunity to have consulted more widely, it does support the general principles of providing pensioners with certainty and clarity in revaluation of assets. For these reasons the government has moved what it believes are workable and equitable amendments. In relation to the revaluation of these investments, the government undertakes that revaluations will be determined in accordance with departmental guidelines using the current market value of the investment.

         —The coalition will support the government amendments because basically they reflect the amendments that we were proposing earlier this afternoon prior to the redrafting by the government of this particular set of amendments. While we certainly support a simplified and more equitable valuation of assets, we do believe that the timing of the valuation of financial investments should be incorporated in the bill, and that has now been done. This system and timing of valuation must not only be administratively simple but also workable. It should also place minimum demands on those clients of DSS who will be affected by extended deeming.

         Our amendment that we were moving earlier this afternoon does fit hand in glove with what has now been moved by the government in so far as we wanted to ensure that the valuation of financial assets was to take place at six-monthly intervals, with the option of a client being able to seek a valuation at any other time during the year. The amendment clearly states that the revaluation must occur on 20 March in each calendar year after 1996 and on 20 September in each calendar year after 1996. As Senator Crowley has said, a person can request a revaluation of one or more of the person's listed securities and managed investments and following an event that affects the relevant investments and is the subject of a recipient notification notice. The coalition will be supporting the government's amendments.

         The purpose of these two bills is to make changes to the youth training allowance provisions which were incorporated in 1994 in part 8 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. The provisions of that part are modelled on the jobsearch allowance provisions contained in the Social Security Act 1991. Any changes to the jobsearch allowance provisions need to be mirrored in the youth training allowance provisions.

Schedule 4 removes redundant references to jobsearch allowance from the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. As I have indicated, the coalition will not be opposing these bills. However, I move:

        I would like to make some comments as to the reasons why the coalition has moved that amendment. During the last 13 years Labor and the federal government have comprehensively failed Australian youth. Youth unemployment at the national level of 29 per cent is unacceptable. It is obvious that the policies pursued by the Labor government over the last 12 years have failed to address the youth unemployment crisis in any effective way.

         We have just seen the third consecutive rise in the unemployment figures. Unemployment now stands at 8.7 per cent and 787,000 people are out of work in Australia. This number does not include the 106,000 discouraged job seekers who miss out because they are not actively looking for work because they do not expect to find any. It does not include the 177,300 parents who want work and are otherwise available, except that they cannot get appropriate child care. It does not include the 82,200 unemployed people who are sick or otherwise prevented from actively looking for work in the survey week. It does not include the 140,000 people who want work and are available but are in TAFE, or university or training and were not actively looking for work at the time of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' survey.

         When all these people are taken into account, 21 per cent of Australians—one in five—want more paid work than current policies are able to provide. There are approximately 85,000 people in subsidised employment at any one time under government programs such as jobstart, new work opportunities and so on—perhaps half of whom will be back on the unemployment queues when the subsidy runs out. Youth unemployment in particular is at the highest rate since Working Nation commenced 16 months ago. The national rate is 29 per cent, and in some areas it is almost double that.

         Unfortunately the youth training allowance is not doing anything to assist young people to find and keep jobs. In September 1995, 292,600 people between the ages of 15 and 24 were looking for work and unable to find it. Working Nation has been a failure. It has added to the national training reform agenda with its bureaucratic and complex arrangements such as the youth training initiative, the youth training allowance, NETTFORCE and the national training wage—the so-called centrepiece of the white paper. Further to this we must add increased targets for entry level training.

         The gulf between the government's rhetoric and its achievement is vast. The Australian traineeship system, with its target of 75,000 traineeships per year, would seem to have been invented. Its targets have never been met. Numbers never got much above 15,000 people and usually hovered around 9,000. The latest OECD figures show that Australia has the second lowest proportion of young people of upper secondary age in vocational education or apprenticeships of any OECD country. For a nation with our resources and our comparatively highly educated population, that is a disgrace.

         Working Nation set a target of 26,500 trainee commencements for the first year and achieved only 16,000—less than the target for the previous year. Even though apprenticeship numbers have started to climb, although very slowly, in 1995 Australia had the lowest number of people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force for three decades. It is doubtful whether the unimpressive target of 34,000 traineeships in 1995-96 will be reached.

         The government has ensured that formidable obstacles are placed in the path of addressing the problem of youth unemployment. It has insisted on linking the training agenda to the industrial relations agenda, and the national training wage is the prime example. The bureaucratic complexity and the top-down approach of the national training reform agenda has been driven by bureaucracies and their rivalries rather than by training needs, according to the ACCI. The system again has developed its own dynamics, remote from industry needs and the needs of employers, and assessment arrangements are still not in place.

         Young people in Australia today are being ignored by Labor and ignored by the federal government. Under these bills they are being shuffled around. The real problems and causes of youth unemployment are not being addressed. It is all very well to take a little bit off one allowance here and add a little bit on in another place, but real jobs are not being created, and real jobs are what young people want. Youth unemployment is devastating for the individual. It constitutes an unacceptable loss of energy and motivation to the wider community and it threatens to destroy confidence and faith in our society amongst a whole generation. These are the reasons why I have moved the amendment on behalf of the coalition.

         Our position on the bills now before us is identical. For the record, I simply state that the Democrats, one, are opposed to the increasing of the rent assistance thresholds; two, are opposed to the limiting of the earnings credit to just $100 per fortnight; and, three, believe the test for the waiver of debts where there has been administrative error should be changed from a sole cause test to one of dominant cause.

These bills are the DEET duplicated version of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995, making changes to the youth training allowance in line with the changes to jobsearch through DSS legislation.

         In relation to the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995, our major concern is schedule 7. That schedule raises the rent assistance threshold by $5 to cut off more people from receiving rent assistance. The Greens oppose this government proposal. Our financial arguments are sound enough without looking at the moral consequences of raising a rent threshold by $5.

         The explanatory memorandum admits that, while the administrative cost of raising the threshold by $5 will be $60 million over a three-year period, the increase will save the government $65 million in the long term. Whoopee-do! The government is undertaking a lot of work for little financial return and, along the way, causing much hardship to the poor in our society, because $5 does make a difference to your earnings.

         We should not deny the fact that the youth training allowance is below the poverty line and rent assistance is sometimes the only hope for people to be able to survive in rented accommodation. Why should people have to pay more in rent to get assistance from the government? Why should people who are trying to cut their rent by sharing with more people be penalised by not being eligible to receive rent assistance? Rent assistance can be the difference between living in debt and surviving on an allowance.

         Also, how can the government justify giving rent assistance—which could be up to $30 a week—on the basis of a $5 difference in two people's rental bills? This is hardly targeting money to those who need it the most, which is the government's usual justification. This amendment will not result in any increased fairness. It will only make people find more expensive rental accommodation so that they can access rental assistance and have slightly more money to meet their needs.

         The report has been tabled so that NBEET could provide input into the government's national strategy for information and communication services technology. I found a number of the specific recommendations very constructive and commendable. If implemented, they should go a long way towards skilling people to use information technology effectively in education, in the work place and for leisure.

We have a great advantage here. It is a great thing that we have developing in this country a much better access on the information superhighway for our young people than they have in that country.

         That statement is very much akin to the activities of a certain Labor senator in the state of Victoria who has been using immigrants for the purposes of branch stacking within the Victorian division of the Australian Labor Party. Unfortunately, the use of immigrants to stack out trade unions for membership or for Labor Party purposes in factional brawls simply demeans the role of the immigrant within the Australian community.

However, they were both overridden so that Martin Ferguson could be endorsed as the Labor candidate because his trade union credentials were a lot more important than any aspirations of the ethnic community.

         The report, indeed, goes on to say that even as recently as 1977 some unions were engaged in a closed shop arrangement that effectively excluded immigrant workers from employment in certain industries. I also recall how certain of the trade union elements, after peace had been achieved following the Vietnam war, took a very strong stance in relation to accepting Vietnamese refugees into this country.

         Page 83 of the document tells us that, as overall trade union membership has declined in recent years, so too has trade union membership of immigrants of non-English speaking background; it went from 53 per cent to 44 per cent between 1986 and 1992. The general trend of decrease in trade union membership which has been reported in this document also indicates that there has been a general decline in the relevancy of the trade union movement to the workers of this nation.

         The report goes on to say that, nevertheless, immigrants of non-English speaking background had higher trade union membership rates in 1992 than immigrants from an English speaking background. Clearly, I would have thought that that would be a clear reason for ensuring that the workers of this country were provided with adequate language skills—they then could fully understand what the trade union movement was all about. It is quite clear that those who have a full command of the English language are less likely to join the trade union movement than those who do not have such a command of the English language.

         —I did not intend to speak on this report, but I think I should put some facts fairly straight and on the table. To my knowledge, from my 20 years in the trade union movement and from observations I have made—and I hesitate always to talk about 100 per cent of people having a certain view—certainly the policies that many of the trade unions have had in place have gone to the question of defending the rights of immigrants who have not had a good command of the English language. If one looks at the clothing trade, for example, where most of the outworkers are women who do not have a command of the English language and who are paid very low rates, there has been a need and an acceptance by the trade union movement of their role in defending the rights of these people and seeking wage justice and reasonable conditions of work for them.

That has been my attitude and it is the attitude I have observed of many people in the ranks of the trade unions.

But I would be as critical of those people as anybody else in the community.

It is very clear that the trade union movement has played a very good and constructive role in this particular area and that it will continue to do so, while people like Senator Abetz want to be negative and dishonest in accusing people of having a particular attitude.

        I welcome the opportunity to take note of the annual report for 1994-95 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. In 1994-95, AWRAP was integrated with the International Wool Secretariat to form a customer oriented international marketing and research organisation. Its goal was and is to build a sustainable demand for Australian wool by ensuring that wool and wool products satisfy our customers.

         With trade barriers collapsing and an increasingly fierce level of competition in the textile industry, it is imperative to have a strong organisation focused on looking after the interests of wool promotion and wool growers. After the turbulence the wool industry has experienced in the past few years, it is stability and commitment to succeed that we need.

         In reviewing the activities of the now merged organisations for 1994-95, there are many notable achievements. AWRAP's research and development was more closely aligned with customer needs, while the IWS launched a $70 million international Woolmark advertising campaign in Australia and for the first time more than 3,000 firms paid a Woolmark licence fee. An annual fee is now paid by spinners, weavers and garment manufacturers wishing to use the IWS's certification marks, Woolmark and Woolblendmark, on their products. These trade and identification marks rate with such notable product identifications as the three-pointed star for Mercedes and the golden arches for McDonald's.

It was unfortunate that New Zealand did not see fit to remain a funding partner of the International Wool Secretariat, and that decision may cost our Tasman neighbours dearly.

         The Australian Wool Realisation and Promotion Organisation is the body that has the responsibility to receive and spend the compulsory industry levy, which is 8 1/2 per cent, of which 4 1/2 per cent goes to the disposal of the stockpile as administered by Wool International.

         There are two ways to sell more wool. One, of course, is to have substantially reduced prices, which over the last five years has not worked very well. The second is to promote the product, and to promote the product you have to both market it in the sense that you promote it with advertising funds, but you have also got to have forward selling methods that spread the risk so that growers alone are not bearing all of the risk.

         With the actual promotion of the product—and that is what AWRAP is involved in through its compulsory industry levy—when the price fell the amount that was recovered by AWRAP to be used for promotion fell, and it has been very pleasing to see the price rise in 1994-95. Of course, it has slipped a little now, but that made it possible for a larger contribution to be made in the form of the advertising campaign which is quite evident now. The promotion and research component is very important too and vital to be maintained.

        Wool International was born from the former Australian Wool Realisation Commission in December 1993. As a statutory authority, Wool International is committed to disposing of the stockpile, enhancing the long-term viability of the wool industry, and repaying the government-guaranteed debt. The act under which Wool International was established confers on the organisation a responsibility to encourage forward selling mechanisms for risk management, amongst other things.

         To prosper and indeed survive, the industry must hasten its introduction of risk management techniques for both wool growers and buyers. The market must move away from its near total reliance on the auction system. After 150 years of wool being grown in this country, we still have about 85 per cent of growers accepting a spot price—in other words, they put their whole 12 months of production up on the day and take it—which, of course, is subject to enormous variations in price.

         The Garnaut proposals overall have worked extremely well in reducing the stockpile and also reducing the debt. I believe that, regardless of the role of Wool International and the stockpile in recent months, there would still have been a correction in prices because China has not been active in the market. The crucial missing factor is market confidence. Once that is restored, textile activity will lift and prices will begin to rise again, led initially by fine wool, which will be most affected by the reduced availability in 1996 if the drought continues to break.

The options for a privatised Wool International would have to provide choice to growers. Until these recent price falls, the future role of Wool International had really risen to unrealistic levels in the industry because it had been so successful. I think we must put it in perspective; it will be two years before Wool International is out of debt—in other words, in 1997-98.

In a new privatised body, perhaps in the form of a public company, the two requirements are that it must be able to provide a service to growers and it must be able to charge for those services—in other words, make a profit.

         To a point Wool International has done a remarkably good job in getting the stockpile down to now under 3 million bales and the debt down to somewhere in the order of $1.5 billion.

         I believe that there was a case for limiting that forward selling and getting it back into the current quarter to take some of the pressure off the depressed prices that occurred. I think that is the one blight on their performance to this time. I would certainly hope that, between now and the start of the autumn selling season and going into next year, the board of management will take into consideration the points I have raised that woolgrowers and industry representatives have raised with me. I believe, from the support that is being shown by senators at this time, that they support us as well.

         I think the minister should take a firm stance. In saying that, I am not being critical at this stage of him. He still has the opportunity to do that prior to the next part of the selling season, but wool has been depressed to a point now where it is as low as it was two or three years ago. I do not think Wool International has been able handle the market depression for a number of reasons, not the least being what has occurred in China, which has dumped some 200 million kilos of extra wool on to the market in Western Europe as well as in China. This has never before occurred in the history of wool marketing in the world. I believe that is one of the most significant factors. Wool International should have been aware of the potential of that and they should have reacted in a totally different way to handle that problem.

         —This evening I wish to congratulate the Liberal candidate for Franklin, Mr Les Glover; the liberal candidate for Lyons, Mr Russell Anderson; and the Liberal candidate for McArthur, Mr John Fahey; and many others from regional Australia who fought so very hard to ensure that we on this side of the house, the coalition, will give a guarantee at the next election that we will not support the Labor Party's proposed tax increase on the cider industry. In my home state of Tasmania that is a very important issue. Labor announced the proposed tax increase without any consultation with the industry. I had occasion to address that matter last week. I am delighted to announce that, because of the hard work of people like Les Glover, the coalition has now committed itself to opposing that 160 per cent tax impost.

         In Tasmania there has been a double bonus, because yesterday the Tasmanian cider industry launched a new product called Murdoch Cider. Given the coalition's policy, new courage has been given to that industry to continue to develop, to market its products and to expand its production base.

         One of the ironies of the Labor government's approach to politics is that it seems to think that if it spends money on band-aid schemes that somehow will create jobs; whereas, if it taxes an industry, that will not have a negative impact on jobs. In Tasmania just recently the federal government announced a $1 million package to assist with job creation in the Huon district. It was anticipated that about 100 jobs would be created by that scheme. That is only a band-aid measure.

         The proposed tax on the cider industry and the apple industry will have the effect of denying to the Huon region at least 100 jobs. Here we have the government taxing so that people lose their jobs and then using those tax funds to create band-aid jobs to try to assist those that they have thrown on the unemployment scrap heap by having a very unwise policy in relation to taxing this industry. I am delighted that the Tasmanian cider industry, the apple growers and the workers on the apple orchards and in the cider processing factories throughout Australia can be assured that a vote for the coalition will be a vote for their industry and a vote for job security.

What would John Hewson's GST have produced? Only $23,000 million. Paul Keating and the Labor government's indirect tax regime are now collecting an extra $7,700 million out of the pockets of those lower and middle income earners that Mr Keating acknowledged are worse off under an indirect taxation regime.

         Clearly that is not the truth, but it is also true to say that some previous councillors have been involved in criminal activities.

Another councillor has not long since been released, also after being convicted of official corruption. Indeed, it is expected that more people will be convicted in the future and will also serve prison terms.

         There has been an inquiry set up by the West Australian government. It is known as the Kyle inquiry because its chair is an eminent citizen, one Mr Peter Kyle. It has commenced taking evidence. The first witness to the Kyle inquiry into Wanneroo Inc. has been none other than the former mayor of Wanneroo, the person recently convicted of official corruption, who is now serving a prison sentence for that crime. He has been the first witness. He has provided to the people of Western Australia—indeed, to the people of Australia because it is now an event of national importance—categorical evidence of why there ought to be a royal commission into the affairs of Wanneroo Inc.

         The reason I say that is for what has not been published. Mr Kyle, in order to protect individuals who may be implicated in Wanneroo Inc., has had to order that the names and certain events not be published. The reason for that is that the inquiry is being held under very limited terms of reference. This is not something new or unique to Western Australia, but this particular inquiry has very limited terms of reference. It is being held under the Local Government Act of Western Australia. The inquiry allows no protection whatsoever and no privilege to any person who wants to come forward and give evidence about the corruption that occurred within the city boundaries of Wanneroo over quite a period of time.

         It is interesting that a state such as Western Australia is hiding and running away from such an inquiry. What have they got to hide? There must be something to hide if such an inquiry is not going to be held. That question was answered this afternoon in the other place, when the local member for Moore, Mr Paul Filing, stood up in the House of Representatives and made a speech and named quite a large number of people who are, and continue to be, involved in the corruption that has gone on, and perhaps is still going on, within the boundaries of the city of Wanneroo. I am not going to refer to all of the names here tonight. I do refer and commend people to the speech of the local member of parliament, Mr Paul Filing, and I ask them to read it with great care.

         With Mr Filing's speech and with other matters that have occurred within the Kyle inquiry, I think the pressure is upon the Premier of Western Australia, indeed the government of Western Australia, to broaden the terms of reference to provide for a royal commission to get to the bottom of the corruption that has occurred in the city of Wanneroo, and it is going to reach a position where the government will not be able to afford it. Mr Court may have a lot of very important people that he seeks to protect on the way through. Some of the people may serve in his own parliament; some of the people who were named in the House of Representatives today are actually currently members of the Western Australian parliament, and I am not just talking about one or two people, there are more than that.

         I fear that, unless the terms of reference are broadened, we will not get to the bottom of it without a royal commission, but I think that one is certainly coming. The weight of public opinion is such that the government, in order to save itself in the finish, will just have to bow to the will of the people; will have to open up the inquiry; and will, in turn, expose those people, including some very senior people in the Western Australian government, to the possible charges that will, I believe, inevitably arise from the report of such a royal commission.

Unfortunately, the matters we have raised have fallen largely upon deaf ears, particularly within the state of Queensland, which I represent. As a committee, we have raised serious matters of public concern which go to the very heart of the administration of justice. These matters are not limited to Queensland and ought to be of national concern, although it has been appalling to witness the enormous number of complaints which have emanated from Queensland itself.

         Sadly, our committee was unable to address the majority of complaints due to the limitation of resources, time and limitations as to our jurisdiction. Although the committee was unable to examine the vast majority of submissions from these people, I have read many of them and met personally with some to hear their cases in more detail. It is evident that many people in Australia have legitimate complaints which are not being listened to nor being addressed. Politicians and bureaucracies unfortunately have frustrated and even whitewashed some of these complaints. Ultimately, the responsibility for these actions must rest with the state ministers who have been alerted to these wrongdoings.

         In one case examined in detail by our committee, two former police officers, Reynolds and Harris, had their careers ruined because they tried to act on evidence they had which indicated serious misconduct within the senior ranks of the police service. Reynolds and Harris acted in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Fitzgerald report, but unfortunately the police service, the Criminal Justice Commission, the Director of Prosecutions and the Attorney-General all failed to ensure that these two officers were not penalised for doing their duty.

Indeed, in the case of whistleblowers Reynolds and Harris, correspondence proves that the premier, the then Attorney-General, Dean Wells, and the police minister, Terry Mackenroth, were all aware of the serious allegations against former Detective Superintendent Huey.

         Rather than addressing these issues, the premier has whitewashed these matters by accusing the Senate of holding inquiries for political purposes. When making his accusation, the premier failed to recognise that the committee was chaired by a Labor senator and that all five parties of the Senate participated in this seven-member committee. The premier appears still to be shooting the messenger—namely, the Senate committee—rather than dealing with the real issues involved. In fact when Senator Murphy, as chairman, tabled our committee findings, he had this to say:

         In the matter of Gordon Harris and John Reynolds, it is clear to me that the actions taken against Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds demonstrated a classic whistleblower dilemma whereby the whistleblower, rather than the disclosures, becomes the focus of attention. The investigations, court cases and appeals to which Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds have been subjected boiled down to Mr Harris being found guilty of disclosing information contrary to the Police Administration Act—an offence determined by a magistrate to be so trivial, and with such mitigating circumstances, that Mr Harris was discharged without having a conviction recorded. It was the committee's view that the severity of the reprisals to which Gordon Harris and John Reynolds were subjected could not be justified and I believe the state should consider some form of compensation for these two people.

The CJC appeared incapable of admitting or even acknowledging a wrong. Rather than adopting such a position, even when blatantly obvious, the CJC went to extraordinary lengths to discredit whistleblowers. The CJC attempted to mislead the committee, I believe, and used its considerable resources in this endeavour.

         —I rise today to bring to your attention the case of Dr Michael Wynne. Dr Wynne, a Queensland surgeon, has been a whistleblower in regard to the conduct of National Medical Enterprises. His case illustrates the way in which the law can be misused to stop whistleblowers from speaking out and the fact that multinational companies can pursue whistleblowers from outside Australia. National Medical is one of the largest and wealthiest owners of hospitals in the United States of America. It purchased a controlling interest in the Western Australia company Markalinga in December 1991. Markalinga was renamed Australian Medical Enterprises.

         National Medical has recently paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle actions which include fraud, bribing doctors and even, extraordinarily, kidnapping patients. Over half of National Medical's US hospitals are now listed in a guilty plea to pay bounty for patient referrals. Australian Medical contracted to pay National Medical over $1 million a year for the services of a senior National Medical administrator and for access to National Medical's business expertise.

         In 1992 and 1993 Dr Wynne personally undertook an investigation of National Medical's practices, travelling to the USA at his own expense. The documents he brought back were a factor that caused the health department in New South Wales to advise against the granting of licences. The health department stressed the `lack of frankness' displayed by Australian Medical in its dealings with the department. National Medical claimed that the US directors of the Australian company knew nothing of the fraud. They claimed this occurred in a few hospitals only.

         Dr Wynne also took these court documents to Mr Griffin, Australian Medical's Australian chairman. Dr Wynne asked Mr Griffin to stand these persons aside while the matter was investigated.

This federation is a powerful group representing corporate medicine in Washington. It is dominated by National Medical Enterprises and Colombia Healthcare.

         Under the agreement which National Medical made with the US justice department when it pleaded guilty to criminal charges in June 1994, National Medical set up an ethics committee and a compliance program. To escape its past, National Medical has changed its name to Tenet Healthcare. It claims that this new name with its positive associative meaning reflects a new commitment to integrity. I quote from National Medical's company report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission:

        A curriculum vitae issued by National Medical in 1993 indicates that Focht was president of National Medical's international division at the time when Dr Ng alleged the company's vice-president and other staff were offering him unethical inducements. It also indicated that he was a director of the Federation of American Health Systems. He became a director of Australian Medical in 1993.

He has asked Tenet's ethics committee to investigate the conduct of National Medical's international division in Singapore, to investigate their refusal to explain why they did not properly contest the Ng allegations and to examine the ethical implications involved in taking defamation actions against him.

The bill is in response to a Senate select committee's inquiry into animal welfare in 1985. Some five years ago an initial draft was produced in response to that committee's findings.

The exposure draft seeks to place animal welfare issues on the national agenda, provide a positive Commonwealth approach to animal welfare and set standards for the behaviour of humans in their relationships with animals. Former federal environment minister Graham Richardson, if somewhat flippant, recognised that when he said that the 1990s is the age of animal welfare. He was talking about the control of kangaroos, but nevertheless I think there is a recognition that it is of increasing importance.

        However, I can say that in conjunction with the bank finance for the Lihir project, support is being provided by the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), EFIC's Canadian counterpart, the Export Development Corporation and EFIC. Environmental considerations were addressed and found to be acceptable by all three agencies in their decision to support the project.

        I remind the honourable senator that Senator Faulkner and I made a joint statement announcing EFIC's support for Australian exports to the project making it clear that the Government gave very careful consideration to all the relevant factors, including environmental issues. The extent of that process was outlined in the statement and included assessment by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. The Government's assessment of the Lihir gold project was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.
