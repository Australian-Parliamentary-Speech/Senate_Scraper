         —My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the Treasurer's announcement that the government has decided to slug business a further $121 million with an increase in fringe benefits tax on employer provided cars. I ask the minister whether he has noted the comments of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries that, in its view, people will hold on to their cars longer now which will cost the industry sales. I ask: what studies did the government make of the effect of its tax slug on the Australian automobile industry? Did it examine the likely consequences on sales? I ask this in light of the concerns that are being expressed about local manufacturing in Australia and, in particular, the interests of the Ford Motor Company.

         —The changes to the fringe benefits tax arrangements are the product of an extended review of compliance costs through a process which took fully into account not only the revenue implications of various possible options but also, naturally, as one would anticipate, the larger economic consequences. The view that was taken by that review, which the government has accepted, is that there was a very strong case to be made for rebalancing the impact of the FBT and, in particular, to deal more appropriately and sensibly with a whole variety of issues like entertainment, car parking, after hours taxi travel and the treatment of other items that are primarily for business use. Those issues did need to be addressed in a way that was, nonetheless, revenue neutral.

         The other side of the coin was to change the rate at which cars were taxed, still making it perfectly clear that car benefits will remain significantly concessional under a whole wide range of circumstances. There is never totally going to be three cheers whenever it comes to any kind of tax review exercise of this kind. People will always scream and yell about what they perceive to be the additional impost while, at the same, pocketing very cheerfully—

Obviously, it is very much part of the opposition's strategy to divert attention from the mess it has got itself into in terms of its own budgetary proposals and its own macro-economic capacity. This is the alternative, would-be government that would have us believe that you can have a `See, Mum; no hands' budget where you do not have to worry about outlay reductions or do anything that is too difficult in that respect; where you do not do anything about tax increases; and where you do not have any kind of rational monetary policy either.

         The truth of the matter is that all the implications and all the possible impacts of this kind of a review of the compliance costs were fully and sensibly taken into account. It was obviously necessary to address some concerns. Your own alleged business constituencies have been very concerned for a very long period about some aspects of that compliance regime. We fixed that. We are determined to maintain revenue neutrality because we are determined to maintain fiscal responsibility. All you can do, as usual, is to bay about the terrible iniquity of it. You have to realise that in this particular business you cannot just pocket all the benefits every step of the way and whinge to this or that constituency about what you perceive to be the downside. This was a balanced and sensible result of a process that was full and complete in its review of all relevant considerations.

Minister, you are clearly concerned about the recent events relating to the proper standards of operation being applied in the meat industry. There is public concern and fear as a result of a recent Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome case in South Australia. These concerns were further highlighted by media claims, including those of the Meat Inspectors Union, pointing to the lack of integrity in our meat inspection process.

         —I thank Senator Burns for the question and I acknowledge his strong personal interest in this issue as Chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. There is understandable concern in the community about food safety and meat inspection. Regrettably, that concern has been heightened by a number of inaccurate and very misleading claims that have been made publicly, following the tragic HUS case in South Australia. The combination of both has the potential to undermine public confidence in our domestic and export meat systems.

         In my view, the Australian public and our international customers need to be reassured as to the veracity and integrity of our meat inspection systems. As all senators in this chamber would be aware, the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to impose a national meat inspection service. However, a number of codes of practice are in place to underpin national standards for inspection in these areas. The compliance of respective states with these codes is now voluntary.

         It is essential that our domestic and export systems operate around a common core of standards that satisfy consumer demand and requirements.

He is very concerned about it and wants to take some action about it, which I am very happy to have the opportunity to tell the Senate about.

What he was really trying to ask you to do was to take account of what he would like to have asked which would have made it relevant.

         —The minister and I have had this campaign technique drawn to our attention by concerned citizens who thought that this was the first time—but we have subsequently discovered that it is the second time—in Australia that this technique has ever been used, a technique pioneered by the extreme right wing Republican candidates in the United States. I am very concerned about this technique as it has been employed by the Liberal Party both in the Northern Territory last year, as I now discover, and in the ACT last week. I think it ought to be referred to the Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I think the committee should inquire into it. This is a conscious attempt to deceive intending voters and manipulate them under the guise of objective research. David Broder in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Washington Post
         </emphasis>
         last year exposed this new technique when it was being developed in the United States. He said:

        It is the lowest form of political conduct I have ever heard of in Australia—the worst I have ever heard of. The technique in itself is dubious but its application on this occasion is based on outright lies—and things that must have been known to be lies by the people who sought to ask the questions. In the course of the introduction to the questions that were asked, they said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        All of the statements I'm going to read to you are true—
       </para>

        Then they proceeded to read the most scurrilous list of defamatory allegations about an individual I have ever heard, knowing that they were untrue. This is gutter politics of the worst order. It is no good Andrew Robb this morning getting up and saying, `I thought they were true.' How can he have thought that a quote from a book that does not exist was true? He alleged that Sue Robinson had written a book that does not exist and then delivered a quote that was not from it and sought deliberately to create false impressions in the minds of hundreds of people who were rung in the hope that a rumour they could not state in public could be started under the lap. This is not something that the Federal Liberal Party can dissociate itself from. The architect of this campaign works out of John Howard's office, and we know that it is true.

Following the death of a child in South Australia and the hospitalisation of 18 others, does the minister agree that the lack of a uniform system of meat inspection for all meat slaughtered in Australia, whether for domestic or overseas consumption, is unsatisfactory? Is it the case that there is no national notification of food poisoning data nor any national keeping of such information and that the recent outbreak of food poisoning, which has already resulted in one death, will not be recorded in a national register of such events? Will the government seek to implement a uniform national system of meat inspection both for domestic and for exported and imported meat, using its constitutional powers if necessary, and a national system for the central collection of data on food poisoning episodes in all parts of Australia?

         The document reaffirms four guiding principles for cooperation between the two governments, the UK and the Irish government, in search of an agreement—that is to say, the right of self-determination, the consent of the governed to the implementation of any new arrangements, the pursuit of a settlement through exclusively democratic and peaceful means, and full respect and protection for the rights and identities of both traditions.

         I will turn now to the question about the HREOC determinations. I am advised by the Attorney-General that, as an immediate but interim solution, the government has decided to reinstate the scheme which existed before the amendments were made in 1992. That scheme, of course, was very expensive for the parties but did not provide for enforceable determinations and placed a heavy onus on complainants to bring Federal Court proceedings to obtain a binding order. Although it is recognised that the scheme has significant drawbacks—that is why it was replaced in 1992—it did provide a valid process for the resolution of complaints.

         As well as that, the government anticipates the introduction of legislation to establish a permanent mechanism within six months. With this in mind, a review committee has been asked to report in three months on the most effective means of creating a constitutionally sound scheme for the investigation and resolution of complaints under the Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws—a scheme which meets requirements for accessibility, informality, simplicity and cost-effectiveness. We have been driven in this area by the need to ensure a quick access to ready remedial measures. That has been the driving force in the past, and that will be the driving force now in terms of the government's long-term response to this problem.

         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In 1990, when agreement was reached on the national Aboriginal health strategy, Minister Tickner said that the health, life expectancy and lifestyle prospects of Aborigines would be `dramatically boosted'. After 12 years of maladministration of Aboriginal affairs by this government and five years down the track after that statement, the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of Aboriginal people shows a dramatic decline in living standards, Aboriginal unemployment up to 38 per cent from 30 per cent, 50 per cent youth unemployment, 29 per cent of Aboriginals worrying about where the next meal will come from, one-fifth of those over the age of 13 being arrested, 50 per cent smoking and an education participation rate for 17-year-old children of just 31 per cent. How does this constitute a dramatic boost to the lifestyle of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders? Can the reasons for the failure of the national strategy be identified? Exactly how does the government intend to ensure that this downward spiral in living standards does not continue?

I do not have to go back very long—just a decade—to remember the appalling conditions that existed in my electorate of the Northern Territory before this government came into office.

         —I assume my time starts again. My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I ask: what is the government doing about the fact that the Tasmanian Groom government is wasting taxpayers' money by desperately pushing ahead with its road to nowhere in north-west Tasmania in anticipation of world heritage nomination and subsequent federal compensation, a strategy which of course is an exact repetition of a strategy adopted by former Premier Robin Gray when he knew that the Franklin would be protected? What is the government doing about this disgraceful repetition?

         —No matter what the Commonwealth's view is of the Tasmanian government's decision to waste what I believe is a reported $3 million of taxpayers' money for a road that probably will carry no more than 10 cars or 10 four-wheel drive vehicles a day, the Commonwealth has not had and does not have a role in the approval of that road. This is a matter for which the Tasmanian government has to take responsibility. It is its responsibility. It has a responsibility to protect that area, to protect the environmental values and, if world heritage values exist in that area, to protect those values as well. I have certainly indicated to the Tasmanian Premier what those values are. The Australian Heritage Commission has done work in relation to the values of that area. That has been communicated to the Tasmanian government. I have indicated on behalf of the Commonwealth its views on the environmental impact of building that road.

         The Commonwealth's powers to act in relation to this particular matter are limited. The 1992 intergovernmental agreement on the environment sets out agreed consultative processes to be followed in relation to the identification and nomination of areas for listing as world heritage areas. This Tarkine area has not been nominated by the government for inclusion on the world heritage list. Any nomination of additional areas in Tasmania would in fact be in the context of the agreement that was struck on 28 November 1988 about this issue. Paragraph 12 of that heads of agreement said:

        That was an agreement reached between the then Prime Minister and the then environment minister and resources minister on the part of the Commonwealth and, on the part of Tasmania, the then Premier and the then minister for forests. In terms of the identification of potential world heritage values in that area, the government's preferred position, as I have indicated on a number of occasions, is that that be done as part of the comprehensive regional assessment process.

I refer the minister to recent news reports that a $400,000 fighting fund has been set up by Queensland brothel owners to appeal against state prosecutions relating to prostitution on the basis that the sexual privacy act provides protection from gathering evidence and prosecution. Firstly, is the government absolutely certain that the sexual privacy act will have no bearing on state laws regarding prostitution, pornography, incest and abortion? Secondly, if the prostitution industry is successful in its bid to render state laws ineffective, will the government reconsider amending the legislation in line with the amendments proposed by the coalition last December which would rule out such interference with state responsibilities and which have the backing of nearly every church organisation in Australia?

Both the debate in the parliament and the explanatory memorandum made it quite clear that the act covered only laws which are an arbitrary interference with privacy that is unreasonable and unjustified. When this bill was being debated here issues were raised about whether the act would affect state laws on incest, abortion, pornography and prostitution. There is, of course, a broad range of laws across Australia which deals with the private sexual conduct of adults. Most of these laws are reasonable, justified and necessary. They draw an appropriate balance between the needs of the community and the right of the individual. Such laws will not be affected by the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994.

         As I said earlier, that was made clear in the explanatory memorandum and during the debate in the parliament. Just because the act has been raised in the context of a challenge to Queensland's prostitution laws does not mean that it will provide the basis for a successful challenge. The government's position is as expressed during the debate: that is, that we believe those laws will not be affected by the act.

Last Friday the Bureau of Industry Economics released its evaluation report on the partnerships for development program and the fixed term arrangements program. These are programs that work in the information technology area and essentially they encourage major international information technology companies which wish to bid for government contracts in Australia to set up associations or business arrangements with domestic information technology companies for the purpose of developing new technology or simply working together and achieving a better international as well as domestic output by the Australian part of the partnership and the international part of the partnership.

         The evaluation of these programs found that the partnerships for development program has been a net positive for the Australian economy and that it has been a key factor in ensuring that the Australian information technology industry has grown dramatically. In 1993 Australia's information technology and telecommunications exports by the partners under this program were valued at $1.2 billion. I might say that is six times more than the level of exports only six years ago—in 1988. So over that six-year period there has been a six-fold increase in exports out of Australia of information technology.

         What is really needed in this country—we are starting to get there—is an integration between public and private superannuation. This will be necessary to alleviate a lot of pressure on the budget. I remind people that, by the year 2031, we will actually have three people working for one person who is on some form of government assistance, particularly in relation to the aged.

         Firstly, the superannuation guarantee charge was introduced in an environment of lifting the level of national savings. That will be a long-term reality. The minister may have misled the parliament a little in indicating that it has already raised the level of saving. I think he is being a little optimistic, but obviously in the very long term it will lift national savings.

There will always be people in the community who for one reason or another—whether it be lifestyle, health reasons, et cetera—may not accumulate the necessary funds for a satisfactory and a viable retirement incomes policy.

         I also use this opportunity to point out that Australia is one of the few countries in the world that actually taxes superannuation at three levels—on entry, which is the contributions tax; on earning the income; and sometimes on exit. Most countries normally tax at two levels. I think it is important that, in order for there to be greater confidence in superannuation, we wipe out the possibility of any suggestion of increased taxes on superannuation contributions, earnings or the like.

         Superannuation is already under some scrutiny, and there is a degree of lack of confidence. Some of that lack of confidence is due to what I call `short termism'. I call on everybody, particularly the financial reporters, to look at the longer term. After all, superannuation is a little like buying a house. If you valued your house each quarter and looked at the movements in interest rates, you probably would not get much sleep in terms of paying off your house. This short termism of looking at returns from superannuation on a quarterly basis is not particularly helpful. I call upon everybody to look at the long-term perspective in order to get this situation right.

         In the 15th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which we recently released, we also indicated that the government should examine the feasibility of certain exemptions or tax relief, particularly for contributions during the early stages, so that the beneficiaries can build up an investment where there is going to be a viable, compounding segment. Unfortunately, in the lead-up to a budget situation, a lot of ideas are being floated. Unfortunately, this question of a tax on superannuation or employees being forced to contribute to superannuation was very badly handled by Canberra. I refer to Canberra in its widest sense, because perhaps four or five groups got it hopelessly wrong. Even the trade union movement has accepted the concept that ultimately there will be employee contributions.

         The committee has before it a reference to terms of the 9 to 12 component. I think it was always acknowledged that, if there was going to be an employee component, it would always be part of a package. In other words, there would be some sorts of offsets but what sorts of offsets from that package were not spelt out. We must clarify the issue that there should be no further taxes on superannuation.

         —It is more than you have done. The way it is proposed, a three per cent employee co-contribution or tax would raise about $5 billion, and it would reduce the disposable income of an average worker—about $600 per week—by $18 a week. The government is arguing that the employee co-contribution could be a way of dampening demand without increasing taxes or interest rates.

         I think we need to look at who this co-contribution would affect most. The Democrats believe that the effect of this would be to hit fairly and squarely low income earners. High income earners would be able to switch other savings, but low income earners who have no savings would have to dip into consumption and save more under compulsory saving. There could be some benefit, we think, in forcing high income earners to switch from speculative to long-term savings—like superannuation—but most high and middle income earners are already paying superannuation contributions in excess of three per cent and would not have to pay any more.

         In an analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, we discovered that an employee co-contribution would hit hardest those earning less than $500 to $600 a week, while those earning above $600 a week would be largely unaffected. We further concluded that the SGC employer contribution has provided an overwhelming benefit to low income earners because their superannuation coverage has risen dramatically since 1991. The amount of superannuation payments voluntarily made by employees though, as distinct from employers, has dropped markedly since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. This could be explained by a reduction in the $3,000 tax deduction—although the low level of confidence in superannuation, the likely rearrangement of private schemes by employers following the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, and employees reducing their own superannuation payments as their employer contributions rose could all have had an effect on this result.

         I think we need to look at the drop-off in voluntary contributions and see that it highlights the need to get the tax concessions right and, as Vince FitzGerald and the Democrats have said, to move away from compulsory contributions towards encouraging voluntary payments. Senator Cook answered the question that was asked today by referring to national savings, and what he said was true: Australia's household savings ratio across all incomes is well below what it should be. Since 1980 it has fallen from 10 per cent of income to four per cent. The harsh reality is that even low income Australians seem to be living beyond their means. So by international standards we are a low wage country, yet we still seem to think we can sustain a high wage standard of living.

         Is this the answer to the national savings problem? Both Tony Cole, ex-Treasury, and Vince FitzGerald argue that the primary benefit of the superannuation guarantee charge is to boost national savings and improve the current account in the long term. But at this stage I think we should be asking just what contribution an employee co-contribution will make. I think the extent to which it will reduce demand is probably overstated.

         There is that more difficult question of where the national savings is enhanced or reduced by choosing between public sector and private sector savings. But that is something I could come back to. It is early days. It is very important that Senator Harradine too is raising the question of the impact of an employee co-contribution on low income earners in Australia. They are not the only ones who have families but certainly we are right to concentrate on the effect of this co-contribution at this point of time on the disposable income of low income earners in Australia.

         I may have misunderstood Senator Watson. He was talking about taxation on superannuation. I agree that there should be no further impost. I agree that it is triple dipping in some cases at present. But I feel very strongly that we should not have a compulsory superannuation impost such as is being canvassed around the traps at present. If we do that, then we are regarding household investment in human capital as inferior to investment in physical or financial capital. Only monopoly capitalists do that. If government members are all monopoly capitalists, I certainly am not. I wonder what the federal government is doing when it adopts the philosophy of a monopoly capitalist, because that is what it would be doing if it regards household investment in human capital as inferior to investment in physical or financial capital.

One of the matters I would like the minister to also refer to is an action by the Department of Administrative Services relating to the last federal election. That was the provision to the Transport Workers Union of something in the order of 90 Ford Fairmont vehicles, which were delivered just prior to the federal election.

         Particularly, I know they were used during the campaign to assist the member for Canning, George Gear, who was elected with a margin of 123 votes.

But, of course, they were provided during the election campaign to these officials of the Transport Workers Union. That was, I think, a gross abuse of Commonwealth taxpayers' money, an example of the Minister for Administrative Services providing taxpayer funded largesse to Labor's mates, designed purely to assist Labor win the last federal election.

         Many senators will be aware that part of the deal of providing those cars to the Transport Workers Union was that they were provided sales tax exempt because the union told Dasfleet, the trading arm of the Department of Administrative Services, that it did not have to pay sales tax. Of course, we found out a year and a half down the track that the Transport Workers Union lied to Dasfleet, that Dasfleet has subsequently had to pay a quarter of a million dollars of sales tax liability and has now had to sue the Transport Workers Union for that quarter of a million dollars. The Transport Workers Union has yet to pay it. So the Australian taxpayers are now, because of that grubby political deal done by the Labor Party, a quarter of a million dollars out of pocket—plus interest, I would hope. The Transport Workers Union is now having to be sued by Dasfleet to recover that money.

        This fuel tax was originally supposed to go to fixing the roads. But as I have said time and again, people on the sea do not use roads, so the government gets an absolute skinner for that. Fuel tax of 33c a litre is an absolute rip-off of private boat users. In addition, the Queensland government rips them off with a registration charge and it has just recently snuck in another $12 a year charge which no recreational boat users in the north were aware of. Both the state and federal government think they can keep taxing recreational boat users time and time again.

My boat these days is only a four-metre tinny and I would not go out anywhere near the Barrier Reef so I do not have to pay that fee, but I do pay registration fees and I do pay the 33c a litre fuel tax for the outboard I use. I agree that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority needs more funding but it should get it out of existing government taxes, not from some new taxes which this government, desperate to try to balance its budget, wants to impose.

The contracts with these conservation groups—the assessing agencies—that were tabled in the Senate indicated that the groups would put in acquittals. Those acquittals were supposed to be detailed statements of where the $125,000 was paid because, amongst other things, we wanted to find out whether this $125,000 went to highly qualified assessors or whether it went to Natalie and others. We were really trying to find out how much Natalie and others got and what their qualifications were.

        The documents that Senator Faulkner tabled today—and he actually tabled these in the Senate estimates committee at my request—showed that the Western Australian group did detail where it went and what it spent the money on. But it showed that, of the $125,000 that went to the Western Australian conservation movement, only $1,200 went to the highly qualified people. The rest of the $125,000 went who knows where—to people without qualifications and on materials, office expenses and rent.

        For Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, there is no detail at all—just a bland statement saying that some money went to office administration and some went to assessors. When we inquired further, we were told that the conservation group—I think it was from Victoria, but I stand to be corrected—just said that it charged a percentage of the grant as a rent.

This is not what this chamber expects to see as an acquittal for expenditure of taxpayers' money, so we have asked for more details. Senator Faulkner said that he will try and get those details from the various conservation groups, but it seems to me that we need a lot more accountability when it comes to the huge amounts of money paid by this government for those assessments—assessments which, as it turns out, were completely useless.

        <para>
         I will not speak for too long on this matter because, as the report has only just become available, I have not had a great amount of time to look at it. I think it is important to make the point that specific purpose payments to the states and territories are a very significant component of the Commonwealth's expenditure—something like $16.68 billion, or $16,680 million. So any report by the Auditor-General of efficiencies that can be made, therefore, is quite significant, particularly in the run-up to the budget process. We all know that specific purpose payments are made under section 96 of the constitution. That provides:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General has been quite critical of some matters relating to the administration of these particular specific purpose payments. This report documents the results of a survey that was carried out jointly by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Australian National Audit Office. No doubt we will hear a lot more about that when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts makes its report.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Auditor-General points out that the administration of specific purpose payments has potential for considerable improvement. He lists particular concerns in areas such as the accountability to parliament, the content of the specific permanent agreements and the management of the specific purpose payments. He points out that some of the key findings of the survey are that for many programs the accountability to the Commonwealth is poor. He points out also that some programs do not require statements or certifications of expenditure. He points out that there are deficiencies that have been identified in reporting to the parliament on specific purpose payments and many problems exist in the collection of data on specific purpose programs. So it is a very important report.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          He notes that the survey identified a number of specific purpose payments where the authoritative basis of those particular payments consisted only of copies of letters and copies of cabinet decisions. In one case he could not find any authoritative basis at all for these payments being made. We are talking about $16,680 million. When you see these types of queries being raised, it shows you just how inefficient this government has let the Public Service become and how lazy and tired this government has become. We heard earlier Senator Campbell raise some points about the inefficiencies of the government and the things it gets up to. The Audit Office, in its usual precise manner, has targeted some of these areas.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The report has only just been made available, but I remind senators that in 1991 the Auditor-General pointed out that in this particular area of specific purpose payments there had been excessive delays in the provisions of statements of expenditure. He raised complaints and questions about the independent certification of these particular payments. Then in 1993-94 he was again critical when he said that he had noted that there was a potential for improvements in accountability. There was also a need for more accountability, value for money and protection of the Commonwealth's interests. These are quite serious allegations, yet here again we have the same types of criticisms in the Audit report No. 21 of 1994-95.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          For instance, the Auditor-General points out that most payments made from the Commonwealth to the states have conditions attached, yet a lot of these conditions have not been adhered to. This is the part that strikes me—and we are talking about a bureaucracy that has been around for so long and with this amount of money to be spent: in conducting the survey the Auditor-General tried to find, through the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and through the Budget Papers No. 3, how many specific purpose payments had been made and a register of those payments was produced. He said, `Difficulties were experienced in attempting to establish the total number from two official sources,' and they are the ones I just quoted, `so we ended up with a best-guess list.'

          It is not good enough in this day and age to come up with only a best-guess list when you are talking about the expenditure of over $16 billion and when you want to find out how many specific purpose payments have been made to the states and local government bodies. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts will have plenty of criticism of the government for allowing this situation to arise. We end up with something like 92 as a best-guess list—92 of which 50 are administered by the Department of Human Service and Health and DEET. Seventy-three per cent of the funds are paid through these two particular areas.

          We know that a lot of this money obviously is tied up with the one nation and better cities programs and the bandaid approach that this government tried to make to the unemployment situation in this country. No doubt, when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts looks in depth into these problems it will find that a lot of this inefficiency has been brought about by the government decisions made on the run—the bandaid approach to the great problems caused by the recession we had to have in this country.

          The other area the Auditor-General is critical of is cash management. He is quite critical of the in-advance payments and states that 28 specific purpose payments, worth $4.2 billion, are paid solely on an in-advance schedule and a further 32, totalling some $9.7 billion, are also paid on a combination of payment schedules which includes an in-advance component. He believes that the Commonwealth should use its powers to make sure that this area is cleaned up. In fact, he recommends that for future specific purpose payments departments negotiating SPP agreements liaise with the Department of Finance to determine appropriate payment schedules so that these matters can be corrected.

          I talked earlier about the fact that the survey identified a number of grants for which letters and cabinet decisions were the only things that existed. The Auditor-General pointed out in one case that there was no basis for any authority and I just wonder whether in fact that was one that was wiped off a white board.

          The Auditor-General has made a constructive suggestion that greater use could be made of incentives for the states and local governments to cut down the wastage that obviously exists in these programs and says that by sharing the savings it is an incentive for the states, local governments and the Commonwealth to be more efficient. I hope that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has a good look at this and makes sure that these things are brought forward.

          As I said, other members of the coalition have not yet had the opportunity to view this report. It concerns me, and I am sure it concerns others, that once again the Auditor-General has been critical of the way this government is handling taxpayers' money and particularly the way in which it is being distributed to the states and local governments through these specific purpose payments. I hope that this survey and inquiry that is being carried out by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts finds out the problems and recommends to the government ways in which it can clean up its act and start saving a bit of money rather than just wasting it.

         In tabling the report of the visit to Thailand and Laos by a delegation of six members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I would like to comment on three issues.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first is the tabling of a separate report on this visit.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Honourable Senators may be aware that the Joint Standing Committee has been, for the last twelve months or so, conducting an inquiry into Australia's relations with Thailand. The delegation's visit to Thailand and Laos was an integral part of that inquiry. The delegation, and then the members of the Committee, took the view that the matters dealt with in this report should be presented to the Parliament before the overall report on the terms of reference was tabled. That will happen later this year.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The delegation was in Thailand from 18 November to 1 December 1994. In that time, it was able to visit Vientiane in Laos for part of a day. Within Thailand, it was able to travel quite extensively, spending much of its time in and around Bangkok, holding discussions with a number of Ministers, officials and other organisations such as UNHCR. The delegation also went to Hua Hin, Chiang Mai, the lignite mine at Lampang, and to Nong Khai in the north east. While in that part of Thailand, members saw the Friendship Bridge over the Mekong River and crossed it to get to and from Laos.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The delegation was able to make visits to Hellfire Pass and the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery. Wreaths were laid at both places on behalf of the Government and People of Australia. Simple ceremonies as these reinforce the links between Australia and Thailand, links forged in terrible circumstances more than 50 years ago.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A breakfast with the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce was a valuable way to hear about the experiences of Australian firms working in Thailand. Information from this meeting was supplemented by visits to some factories and building sites run by Australian companies. All these firms left the same messages with the delegation: optimism about the future of the country and also about their company's future there.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The second matter on which I would like to speak today is Thailand's view of its position in its region.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The submission to the inquiry on relations with Thailand from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade drew attention to the primacy that country attaches to its immediate region in the formulation of its foreign policy. This in itself is hardly surprising. Thailand is an influential member of ASEAN and a central country, in more than a geographic sense, in South East Asia.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What did surprise the delegation was the frankness of the exposition of Thailand's views about its place in its region. In particular, members were told of its involvement with the Mekong Corporation, made up of the six riparian states and now increasingly involving Burma and Cambodia. There was mention of the quadrilateral of Thailand with Burma, Laos and southern China, and a growth triangle with Malaysia and Sumatra in the south. In the analysis of these and other possible groupings involving nations in the region, the point was made that the changed definition of security now included economic components. In keeping with this emphasis, likely opportunities for Australia were frequently mentioned.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Thirdly, I would like to comment on the prominence given to Laos in this report.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Since the adoption of a new Constitution in 1991, Laos has gradually liberalised its attitudes and practices. Debate within the National Assembly has been relaxed so that there is more debate about legislation. The 1991 Constitution also formalised the establishment of a market-oriented economy. With its small population, Laos faces many difficulties as it continues its change from its former ways.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While in Vientiane, the delegation held discussions with members of Assembly committees, and with the Chairs of two others. It was clear that Australia is held in high regard in Laos and that there are a number of areas where we might, in consultation with the Laotian authorities, be of assistance. One of the primary reasons this report has been tabled is to ensure the opportunity to assist Laos is made clear to the Australian Government. Even more important is the fact that, without such a separate report as this, Laos could not have been dealt with in the report on relations with Thailand.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As the delegation found out in Vientiane, there are already a surprising number of Australian firms and personnel in Laos. The Friendship Bridge has shown the region what Australian expertise, and development assistance funds, can do. Many opportunities exist in such a climate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Finally, I would now like to thank the members of the delegation for the work they have put into this report. Their three recommendations, about funding for the National Thai Studies Centre at the Australian national University, about funding for laos and about the Embassy's facilities in Vientiane, all deserve serious consideration.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current legislation provides for the mandatory participation by Business Skills migrants in the monitoring of their business activities for three years after their arrival in Australia to ensure individuals comply with their obligations to engage in business and to evaluate the effectiveness of Business Skills migration. The legislation also gives the Minister the power to cancel the visas of Business Skills migrants, within 3 years after their arrival in Australia, if they do not engage in a business or make genuine efforts to do so.

        Amendments to the Migration Regulations which are expected to be introduced in April 1995 will create extra opportunities for business people to migrate or remain permanently in Australia, namely those who have substantial business skills and funds to invest or have established businesses in Australia. The Government is introducing these new opportunities for migration following recommendations by the Business Skills Advisory Panel, an expert panel of business people and other key stakeholders in the business migration field.

        This bill provides a power to cancel visas held by those people who are approved under the new Investment-linked migration provisions if they withdraw the funds they have invested in designated investments in Australia within 3 years of investment, but not on other business related grounds. The designated investments will be government guaranteed securities with certain features, including maturity three years after purchase, and a commercial rate of interest payable. A notice of the approved designated investments will be gazetted once final details are agreed.

They will, however, be required to participate in the mandatory monitoring system for 3 years after visa grant. The monitoring system has provided valuable information on the performance of Business Skills migrants in Australia and will continue to be used for policy development, evaluation and planning services to assist migrants to engage in business.

        I now turn to the provisions which propose to implement some of the recommendations of  the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions (CROSROMD). It is intended that these provisions will enhance the operation of the Immigration Review Tribunal and further strengthen the non-adversarial nature of the Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In December 1989 changes were made to the Migration Act 1958 to establish a two-tier system for the review of certain migration decisions. The review system established the Migration Internal Review Office, a first tier and internal system of review, and the Immigration Review Tribunal, an independent external merits review Tribunal which operated within a non-adversarial framework.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The then Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Minister Senator the Hon. Robert Ray, in establishing the new review system, gave a commitment that the system would be examined after it had operated for two years. CROSROMD, chaired by the Hon. Ian Macphee, was established in 1992 to put that commitment into effect. The Committee examined and reported on the extent to which the system for merits review of migration decisions met the statutory objectives of providing a review mechanism which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. It reported to the Government in December 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        CROSROMD found that the Immigration Review Tribunal had earned a reputation as a credible, fair and independent body for review of migration decisions. Notwithstanding its positive view of the role of the Tribunal, the Committee made recommendations for a range of legislative reforms relating to the operations of the Tribunal, to strengthen its non-adversarial nature. In particular it proposed amendments to the Migration Act to include changes in the gathering of evidence, the conduct of hearings, and the power of the Principal Member of the Tribunal to give directions about the operation of the Tribunal and the conduct of reviews.  The proposed amendments will give a review applicant an entitlement to obtain access to information and material relevant to their application before the IRT. An applicant will  have the right to submit written material to the Tribunal, to request the Tribunal to obtain written material relating to the matter under review, and to give oral evidence and submissions to the Tribunal. This complements the current legislation which already allows an applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence at their hearing, and to request the Tribunal to call witnesses.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fairness and effectiveness of the review system will be further enhanced with the extension of an applicant's rights in relation to the information before the Tribunal. Amendments will extend the rights of the review applicant to present arguments in addition to giving evidence at the hearing of their application. The review applicant will also have the right to see any material which is before the Tribunal, unless contrary to the public interest. Together, these amendments will ensure that an applicant has access to all the evidence, other than such evidence excluded on public interest grounds, thus strengthening the thoroughness and fairness of the system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the IRT was established it was envisaged that the Tribunal would always operate in a non-adversarial manner, and the legislative provisions passed at that time were meant to require the Tribunal to operate in that manner. Some judicial comments have cast doubt on whether the Tribunal was always required to operate in this manner. To reinforce the non-adversarial role of the Tribunal this bill clarifies the matter of cross-examination; that is, that an applicant, their assistant or a witness is neither entitled nor permitted to cross-examine any other person appearing before the Tribunal. The amendment is consistent with the CROSROMD report which recommended that applicants and their assistants should not be able to cross-examine witnesses, and strengthens the non-adversarial ap proach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The introduction of a provision for interpreters to be appointed during the oral hearing for any applicant or witness, where the Tribunal deems it necessary, implements a CROSROMD recommendation to this effect and is a positive reinforcement of the current practice of the Tribunal. The use of an interpreter, whenever a person does not have sufficient proficiency in English, ensures equal access to the review process for applicants from non-English speaking backgrounds and strengthens the social justice role of the Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The intent of proposed subsection 366A(2) is to strengthen the non-adversarial nature of the Tribunal by ensuring that people are able to assist applicants in limited circumstances before the Tribunal. People assisting applicants are not able to examine or cross-examine witnesses. They are not able to present oral argument to the Tribunal without its consent, to be exercised at its discretion and only in exceptional circumstances (other than where there is a lack of proficiency in English) such as when the applicant has a mental disability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Proposed subsection 366A(2) is not intended to prevent assistants from commenting on minor and routine matters which could assist the Tribunal, such as providing it with guidance or referring to relevant parts of the documentation. Communication of this kind should obviously occur.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As this is a matter which goes to the operational procedures of the Tribunal, I would expect the Principal Member to develop and promulgate specific rules relating to the conduct of those appearing before the Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In its report, CROSROMD recommended that the Principal Member of the Tribunal be empowered to give directions about the operations of the Tribunal and the conduct of reviews. This bill proposes that the Principal Member have the statutory power to give such directions. This will enhance clarity and consistency in the conduct of reviews and operations of the Tribunal and is consistent with general powers held by other review tribunal heads such as the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In considering information before the Tribunal, CROSROMD recommended that an additional level relating to the disclosure of information be introduced. This bill empowers the Minister to certify that the disclosure of information or documents, otherwise than to the Tribunal, would be contrary to the public interest and cannot therefore be disclosed to any person other than a member of the Tribunal. This complements the two levels restricting or qualifying disclosure of information already contained in the Migration Act for the purpose of review. The Minister can currently certify that certain information must not be disclosed to the Tribunal, or can provide a certificate alerting the Tribunal to the sensitivity of certain information, which has either been provided in confidence, or which if disclosed would be contrary to the public interest. In the latter event the Tribunal must then decide how to use the information provided, which can be released at their discretion. This additional level on restriction of disclosure, where the Tribunal must not disclose the information, ensures that the interests of third parties and witnesses are protected.

        This bill also proposes amendments to transfer responsibility for setting remuneration of members to the Remuneration Tribunal. To date the remuneration of IRT/RRT members, other than the Principal Member, has been determined by the Government. To enhance the perception, as well as the reality, of the Tribunal's independence, and after receiving the views of the Administrative Review Council on the matter, the Government has decided that it is more appropriate for remuneration issues to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. This bill effects the legislative amendments necessary for a Member's remuneration to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, subject to some transitional provisions.

        The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 is the first new law to be brought forward by the project team.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Early in the life of the project, the team identified the need to rewrite part of the existing law as a possible legislative model that could be publicly tested and assessed through processes of consultation. The substantiation provisions were chosen because they affect 7 out of 10 taxpayers. These provisions set out the rules to be followed in claiming deductions for work-related expenses.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Assistant Treasurer released an exposure draft bill in August of last year, and over 3,500 copies were distributed. As well, the members of the project held well-attended seminars around Australia to discuss the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Overall, feedback from the consultation process was very positive. It indicated that the redraft was much easier to understand and could be expected to lead to a significantly greater use of the tax law itself as a source of information for tax practitioners and others who need to understand the law. More importantly, most people who took part thought the proposed changes would reduce their compliance costs.

        Changes to structure
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill significantly changes the structure and order in which the substantiation law is presented, so that the important requirements of the law are more easily found. One of the innovations of the bill is the use of highlighted key principles at the start of each major segment of the bill. These give readers a simple entry point. As well the bill makes extensive use of navigational aids to identify, and guide readers to, those provisions relevant to them.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To make readers more comfortable in following the law, the bill introduces another innovation by addressing the reader personally throughout as `you', using a tone that is essentially friendly and not bureaucratic.

        In order to make the procedural rules less cumbersome, the main changes proposed by this bill are as follows.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The existing log book rules for calculating car expenses are so complicated that few taxpayers fully understand them. The greatest complexity is in working out what percentage of your car expenses you can deduct. The bill will greatly simplify this calculation and reduce the occasions when a new log book must be kept. This is one area of the bill where the approach taken in the exposure draft bill has been further improved as a result of the extensive consultation process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Access to the "cents per kilometre" method of calculating car deductions will be extended, so that more taxpayers can use it. The cents per kilometre method is the most often used of the 4 methods available for calculating car expense deductions. Currently, it can't be used at all if business travel is more than the 5,000 kilometres in a year. That restriction will be eased so that claims up to 5,000 kilometres can be based on this method even if business kilometres are more than this. The maximum claim remains unchanged at 5,000 kilometres.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">

        The exception from substantiation for taxpayers who claim no more than $300 of work and car expenses will be effectively widened by excluding car expenses from the limit. Most taxpayers with car expenses usually have such large claims that they are unable to benefit from the exception, even though their other work expenses may total less than $300. By excluding car expenses, these taxpayers will not have to substantiate their other work expenses within the $300 limit.

        Two measures contained in this bill relating to life insurance companies give effect to an announcement made by me on 30 June 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first measure relates to dividends payable to life insurance companies satisfied through the issue of bonus shares which form part of the assets of the insurance funds of a life insurance company. The normal situation with dividends paid to companies is that they are subject to the inter-corporate dividend rebate. Because of this, where bonus shares are issued in satisfaction of a dividend, the amount of the dividend is not treated as constituting part of the cost of the shares when calculating any profit or loss on their disposal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With a life insurance company, however, no inter-corporate dividend rebate is available for dividends paid to its insurance funds. This results in an element of double taxation. The bill will correct this unintended result in respect of bonus shares disposed of from 1 July 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second measure concerns the rate of the inter-corporate dividend rebate allowable to a life insurance company in respect of non-insurance fund dividends included in its taxable income. These dividends are eligible for the inter-corporate dividend rebate, but the rate of rebate currently allowable is the average rate of tax paid on the total income of a life insurance company. The average rate is lower than the rate paid on non-fund dividends. The bill will ensure that, from the 1994-95 year of income, the rate of rebate equals the rate of tax actually paid.

        First, the bill will ensure that any gains or losses accrued in assets or liabilities of the bank at the time when it is sold, will not be taken into account in determining the bank's taxable income after it is sold. This will be achieved by treating the assets as having been sold and the liabilities met at the time of the sale and then having been bought or assumed again immediately after the sale.

        Another measure will ensure that superannuation deductions are not tax deductible after the sale if they are made to satisfy a liability that accrued when the bank was exempt from tax.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The effect of the amendments is to eliminate an inappropriate deferral of tax. For classes of live stock for which no minimum value is prescribed, the existing law allows some producers to use historical costs that have become negligible compared to actual costs. This substantially defers tax, and gives these producers a corresponding advantage over competitors who must use costs at, or close to, actual costs.

         —The Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill 1994 is no doubt a bill that the government would hope is not taken as characteristic of its capacity to get a legislative program through to achieve a goal that it wants to achieve. The history of this bill is somewhat sad, to say the least.

         The bill is a result of a desire on the part of the Australian Stock Exchange to trade a new product share ratio. The ratio allows an investor to trade on the degree to which individual shares move relative to the market. A share ratio does not currently fall within the definition of a security under the Corporations Law and cannot be traded on a stock exchange.

         The regulatory regimes for the trading of securities and futures have developed separately—securities under chapter 7 and futures under chapter 8 of the Corporations Law. The separation reflects the different risk profiles and investment uses of securities and futures contracts. Each chapter contains a stringent regulatory regime, including provisions relating to market operators, clearing houses, licensing of dealers and fidelity funds.

         Derivatives straddle the definitional borders between securities and futures. They raise difficult questions about the appropriateness of the current regulatory regime. A share ratio may in one sense be described as a derivative; however, it clearly falls squarely within the definition of a futures contract. While the definitional distinctions mean that futures markets have greater ability to trade derivative products, the Stock Exchange argues that it should be permitted to trade the share ratio because the contracts require specialised knowledge of individual shares.

         The government has accepted that the legislative framework ought to be amended to facilitate trading of the Stock Exchange's share ratio. We are in this instance not talking about the over-the-counter derivatives that are specifically structured for particular needs and negotiated privately. The government has commissioned CASAC, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, to undertake a general review of derivative regulation. Given the size and scope of that task, it is going to take some time. Hence, we have this particular legislation trying to deal with one particular instance.

         The history of this bill, as I alluded to earlier, is something of saga which began in early 1994 when the government introduced a draft omnibus Corporations Law amendment bill. When the final bill was introduced, slipped in was a provision that effectively allowed the government, by regulation, to alter the division between securities and futures contracts under the Corporations Law. Those amendments were introduced to allow the Stock Exchange to trade unnamed product.

         Those changes obviously had serious implications for the wholesale regulation of futures, securities and derivative markets and were subject to industry, investor and academic criticism. This point was well made by my colleague the then shadow Attorney-General, Daryl Williams. As a result of that, the portion of the legislation dealing with share ratios was withdrawn. Subsequent to that, the Stock Exchange has provided details of its share ratio product.

         An exposure package was distributed by the Attorney-General's Department. This provided a draft bill and more details of the underpinning regulatory framework. The exposure package attracted, as I understand it, a number of submissions, including a detailed and voluminous one from the Sydney Futures Exchange. The Sydney Futures Exchange was particularly concerned that, if the Stock Exchange was to be allowed to trade instruments having the risk profile of futures contracts, it was imperative that there at least be a level playing field.

         What we have ended up with is a mix and match approach. Following discussions between the government and the Futures Exchange, a new version of the bill that addressed at least some of the concerns of the Sydney Futures Exchange was agreed upon. However, as a result of an administrative error—let us put it that way—the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 which was introduced was the wrong version. This is the second time the government has introduced this bill. The first time it was introduced, it was withdrawn. There was much consultation and discussion with everybody. A new bill was introduced, but all of a sudden it was the wrong bill. It is going to sit at the bottom of the

The differences are so fine that someone in the minister's office apparently did not know what was going on and the wrong bill was introduced. It is not an area in which you can talk about broad-brush policy making. Quite fine, detailed work has to be undertaken in order to satisfy all parties. Some people have been so unkind, and perhaps realistic, to describe this as a fight over a patch between the Stock Exchange and the Futures Exchange. Of course, the patch is becoming varied and, understandably, we now have the problem of sorting out how to regulate it.

         The bill essentially allows an agreement to be prescribed by regulation as a security or a futures contract. The regulations might apply, disapply or modify the application of the Corporations Law or relevant regulations to a prescribed agreement. The purpose is to allow the standard regime to be tinkered with to take into account special characteristics of particular instruments. That is what is planned in relation to share ratios. The proposed regulations have been drafted. They prescribe a share ratio as a security and modify the Corporations Law as it applies to such agreements.

         While the intention is that the product be regulated as a security, there is this degree of mixing and matching between the securities and futures contract requirements to take into account the specific nature of this product. In addition to that, the Stock Exchange has now developed detailed business rules which are designed to supplement the regulations, and those business rules are subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General.

         There is some existing concern. It is strongly arguable that the changes should have been made in a fuller legislative sense until we had an overall system that everyone agreed with for handling those things that fall between the two chapters. By not waiting until that time, we end up taking this piecemeal approach by regulation. I understand that parliament still has the capacity to disallow regulations. One of the basic reasons we are supporting this is that we understand the difficulties of holding up the private sector—in this case, the Stock Exchange—from marketing a new product because we have not got our act together. But that does not detract from the fact that the way we are doing this is not ideal. It is workable and suitable, but it is not ideal. We wish to highlight that point.

         The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny Bills stated that the predecessors to this bill really amounted to an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. That is probably still an appropriate conclusion for this bill. It is a concern expressed by a number of people. As I said, this is not an irretrievably bad way to go, but it is not the ideal way to go. Therefore, we point out that we are really only going this way because, if we do not, the government's incapacity to design a proper regulatory regime will hold up the Stock Exchange from marketing a new and innovative product.

We just want to flag the caution that the government should take in adopting the attitude that this system could be used on a permanent basis to allow the Attorney-General to yea or nay by regulation to other products as they come up. For example, the Futures Exchange might have a product that it feels falls between the two and that it wants to have treated in this fashion in one way or another.

        We do not move that amendment just as a means of sour grapes. They are serious points that need to be made.

He said that we could have asked the Stock Exchange any questions that we wanted. Of course we could, but we wanted the Attorney-General's answers.

         One wonders how the Stock Exchange knew we had provided questions. I will tell you how it knew: the Attorney-General's Department, as we are advised, gave it the questions to answer. The department gave the Stock Exchange the questions either right at the beginning or to be cleared. The department is going off to the Stock Exchange to check whether it is happy with what the department is putting before parliament. Quite frankly, that does not seem an appropriate mechanism to me. I wonder whether the Sydney Futures Exchange was asked whether it would like to comment on what the answers to be put before parliament ought to be.

         The bill will provide a much needed regulatory framework for a rapidly developing market in hybrid financial products. Currently, the Corporations Law provides little flexibility with respect to financial products that fall outside the existing definition of securities and shares. This problem has been highlighted in particular by the Australian Stock Exchange's wish to market a new product known as share ratio contracts. Such products allow an investor to trade on the degree to which individual shares move relative to the market.

         Without the amendments contained in this bill, the product would not be available to the Stock Exchange for marketing to the public. It appears more appropriate for share ratio contracts to be traded on the Australian Stock Exchange, given that they require specialised knowledge of individual shares and such expertise is more likely to be found in share broking firms rather than in their future trading counterparts. Therefore clauses 4 and 6 of the bill introduce new sections 72A and 92A into the Corporations Law to allow the addition by regulation of the type and variety of tradeable futures contracts and securities.

         As I mentioned, the Democrats recognise the need for legislative change in this area but we do have a number of concerns about the amendments that are placed before the Senate. First of all, we share the concerns raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that clauses 4 and 6 of the bill—those that provide for the definition of new products by regulation—may well be an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. The Attorney-General's view is that, because of the rapid development of financial products, a definition of derivatives may outlive its usefulness in a very short time and it would be impractical to introduce a legislative amendment every time a new product is about to be released. As a result, the bill is permitting prescribed agreements to be regulated as if they were securities of futures contracts. The bill, therefore, will not have the effect of altering the general understanding of what is a security or a futures contract, which was one of the concerns raised by the industry when the first bill was introduced. As I have said before, the Democrats will be supporting the bill. However, we will be monitoring this regulation making power after it becomes operational to see whether it fulfils the task that is set for it and the extent to which, if at all, it is exceeded.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Our second concern is that the bill does not attempt to regulate over-the-counter transactions. These are principally contracts concluded through private negotiations and typically involve large commercial institutions. By definition, they are not traded through the securities or futures exchanges. These, it is argued, are difficult to regulate and, in any event, do not appropriately fall within the government's regulatory sphere proposed by this bill.

         The Democrats accept that it is difficult to regulate these forms of investment. However, we impress upon the government the need for the utmost vigilance in this area. Transactions of this variety are not typically conducted by small investors but by large commercial operators such as banks and merchant banks. We should take the recent collapse of Tricontinental, Rothwells and the Pyramid Building Society as proof of the fact that not all financial institutions are as careful with other people's money as they should be. Indeed, only today we have learned about the derivative induced collapse of one of England's oldest financial institutions, Barings Plc.

         Finally, we impress upon the government the need to ensure that the licensing system for those dealers selling hybrid products is reviewed. The need for trustworthiness and a high level of professional competence in the brokers of financial products increases proportionately with the complexity of the product sold. The government should not wait for problems to develop before ensuring that the existing regulatory mechanisms are sufficient to deal with what would appear to be a major new investment market. Having noted these reservations, the Democrats welcome the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill 1994 and will be supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Vanstone.

         —Someone had to be a voice of sanity seeing the opposition was represented only by lawyers. I would like to thank senators for their contributions. The viability and integrity of our public securities and futures markets merit the close examination by the parliament of proposals affecting these markets. I would like to recount the major criticisms of this bill and indicate the response of the government to each of them. There has been open public consultation with affected parties about the proposals, and the comments received on the bill have been carefully considered.

         The government believes that each of the criticisms of the bill has been addressed comprehensively and adequately in one way or another in the overall package implementing this proposal. The proposals will enhance, not diminish, the effectiveness of the regulatory arrangements for our securities and futures markets. A major criticism of the bill has been that it delegates to the executive too broad a power to prescribe products. It has been alleged that the bill is a backdoor way of regulating the over-the-counter derivatives market.

         The power to prescribe products is quite restricted. The arrangements proposed are for the regulation of exchange traded products only and have nothing to say about the trading of over-the-counter derivatives. The amendments are not intended to anticipate or pre-empt in any way the outcome of the present inquiry by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee into the regulation of over-the-counter derivative products. The power will only be used on those occasions when it can be demonstrated that the ordinary operation of the Corporations Law is not appropriate. For most purposes, the regulatory regimes in chapters 7 and 8 will be quite adequate.

         The regulation making power will, of necessity, be limited to a narrow range of products. There are already similar powers to those proposed in the Corporations Law. Provisions such as these are needed to enable the law to be adapted to new financial products and market innovations. The exercise of the power of prescription will be subject to the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, which is due to commence on 1 July 1995. That bill mandates consultation with persons affected by legislative instruments proposed to be made on or after 1 January 1996. Consultation is also a current prerequisite under the corporations agreement with the states.

         A further criticism of the bill is that it undermines investor protection and market stability. There will be adequate and comprehensive provisions in the package implementing this proposal, the bill, the supporting regulations and the business rules of the Stock Exchange to ensure that investors are adequately protected in dealings in share ratio contracts. The bill allows the regulations to modify the law as applying to prescribed products. Specific rules to govern the trading of share ratio contracts will be set out in amendments to the corporations regulations and the ASX business rules. The regulations will ensure that all features of a strict and comprehensive regulatory framework for exchange traded products will be applicable to share ratio contracts or to any prescribed products.

         There are many aspects to this, including: licensing, disclosure, the conduct of brokers, relations with clients, the operation of a national guarantee fund, clearing arrangements, insider trading, market manipulation and fraud, and auditing of brokers' accounts. The overall package for the trading of share ratio contracts addresses each of these matters in detail. The national guarantee fund will guarantee share ratio contracts traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. The business rules of the exchange will incorporate many of the detailed features that are essential for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market and for investor protection. The rules have been subjected to careful scrutiny by the Australian Securities Commission to ensure they are both comprehensive and appropriate for the products to be regulated. They are subject to review and possible disallowance by the Attorney-General.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another criticism of this bill is that the national guarantee fund will be exposed to significant additional risks as a result of exposure to speculative futures contracts. Careful attention has been paid to this matter. The NGF will not be exposed to any undue risk as a result of its coverage of trading and share ratio contracts. An independent actuarial analysis of the potential exposure of the NGF to trading and share ratio contracts has been undertaken. The analysis concluded that `the introduction of share ratio contracts would not lead to a serious undermining of the financial resources of the NGF.' The risk posed to the NGF will be no greater than that posed by other derivative products traded by the Stock Exchange as those traded on the Stock Exchange options market. Before prescribing any other product under the proposed provisions, the government would seek the advice of the ASC and the Securities Exchange Guarantee Corporation which administers the NGF on issues such as adequacy and coverage of the NGF.

         The distinction between the securities and the future contracts is another point that has been raised. It is alleged that these amendments will blur the distinction between securities and futures products. The distinction between futures or risk management products and securities will remain a basic feature of the law. However, market changes and product developments are blurring the distinction between securities and futures. The critical point is to ensure that, whatever products are traded on public exchanges in Australia, the most appropriate regulatory arrangements apply to them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In conclusion, I reiterate that the amendments are necessary because they add an essential element of flexibility to the regulatory framework. Governments must be able to respond to requests by public exchanges to trade new products. The regulatory regime should not hinder market development and product innovation. The content of any regulatory regime that will apply to any prescribed products will be determined by the primary regulatory consideration of ensuring the conduct of fair, orderly and efficient markets and investor protection. The government does not support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Vanstone. It seems to me from my brief knowledge of her description that this was a matter of pro forma on her part, that the opposition has to go through the process of moving a second reading amendment that criticises the government because, if it did not, it might be reported that it was not doing its job as an opposition. I note that the Democrats are supporting the amendment. I suspect that the Democrats are building up a statistical count from time to time on how many times they vote with us and how many times they vote with the opposition. I am not cynical about these matters; it is a statement of fact. Anyway, I can assure Senator Vanstone that we do not support the second reading amendment.

         —I do not want to take up the time of the Senate this afternoon with respect to this matter. We support the bill and the subsequent amendments the government wants to make, but it is worth putting a couple of things on the record. The principal bill was introduced in the Senate. Upon introduction in the House it was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee is slowly but surely developing some skills at reviewing legislation, taking on a job for which it is elected. The committee made a number of recommendations, most of which were accepted by the government. Amendments were moved and passed in the House. The House amendments were due to be considered by the Senate the last time this matter came forward. The day before, the government advised that it intended to introduce further amendments to extend the application of the bill to the Rwanda Tribunal. Given the short notice and the desire to have the extended application of the bill considered by, for example, on this side the shadow ministry and party room, a motion was moved that consideration be postponed. That motion was passed—not, I might say, with the government's support. As I recall, we had to have a division in order to agree that we be given time to consider amendments of which we had been notified the day before.

         It is interesting to note that, in order to move the new raft of amendments, the government was required to move to suspend the standing order that prohibits amendments to a bill returned to the Senate and considered by the House unless the amendments relate to the House amendments. The procedure to suspend the standing order was used probably for the first time in the history of Senate. So it was quite exceptional. I do not think this side of the chamber feels they were given adequate notice of that exceptional procedure being undertaken—perhaps that standing orders would be suspended to do something, but inadequate notice of the historical nature of what was happening.

         I have since had time to consult with my party, and we support the changes that the government seeks to make. However many people there might be in detention in Rwanda charged effectively with war crimes, as I understand it there is no proper judicial system under which they can be tried. To release the accused would then subject them to revenge attacks. The establishment of an international tribunal was seen as an appropriate solution. The amendment is very unlikely to have any practical impact for Australia. While there is the possibility that war criminals from the former Yugoslavia will have made their way to Australia, that is much less likely in relation to Rwanda. The amendment, by applying the procedures of the principal bill to the Rwandan situation, provides a simple means by which Australia's international obligations are fulfilled and provides a gesture of support to the tribunal. The coalition does not oppose the amendments.

Senator Vanstone drew attention to the amendments which the government moved in the chamber after the bill had been dealt with by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I think it is worth noting that the House of Representatives standing committee recommendations in large measure accepted amendments which I had previously moved in the Senate and which had been rejected by both the government and the coalition at that time. When I gave them as recommendations to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that committee saw fit to adopt a significant number of those recommendations which ultimately found their way into government amendments which the Senate is now accepting.

         —We are addressing the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. This is an important piece of legislation where basically all parties have agreed. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in his second reading speech makes the commitment that this is a piece of legislation to recognise those rights that relate to the Hodgson Downs land claim in the Northern Territory and that agreement has basically been reached between the Commonwealth government, the Northern Territory government, the Northern Land Council and the claimants in the land claim, and that they have entered into an agreement which settles that claim. This is an important piece of legislation for what it sets out to do.

         I would like to take the time and the opportunity in the Senate today to refer to this piece of legislation. Hodgson Downs is a pastoral property some 40 kilometres south of the Roper Highway and approximately 200 kilometres south-east of Katherine in the Northern Territory. There is a population resident there of about 200 people, Aboriginal people primarily from the Alawa tribe, but also some Ngalakan people. Recently, the purchase of Hodgson Downs station by ATSIC was made on behalf of the Miniyeri community in the Northern Territory. This piece of legislation will recognise those important aspects.

         The other issue I have raised with regard to Hodgson Downs that I think is important is that it is a community where there is a CDEP program administered by ATSIC. In fact, the only criticism I have heard in recent times is that it is an area where ATSIC needs to carefully review that aspect of the administration and the importance of the CDEP program to ensure its ongoing area is free of other problems in the financial administration, and that the administrator look very carefully at those issues as to how the CDEP program is being properly administered in that area.

         This debate gives me the opportunity to also look very carefully at the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. That act, instituted in 1976, is a complex piece of federal legislation which relates to only the Northern Territory, as its title would have us know. With nearly two decades of the operation of that act behind us, the legislation continues to have considerable impact on the people and the land of the Northern Territory. Given this impact, the complexity of the act and the many contentious legal interpretations, there have been justified calls for regular, formal reviews of the operation of this particular legislation.

         That is what I want to concentrate on today. Whilst this particular bill sets out to put in place a particular provision for a particular property and particular people, it is important to recognise that there have been many requests for reviews and alterations to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act itself. For example, I know that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 1 February 1994.

         In that particular correspondence to the Prime Minister he canvassed a whole range of issues relating to the administration of the land rights act. The issues that Mr Perron raised with Mr Keating were that there should be an indication of matters that should be discussed further. They included the application of territory laws on Aboriginal inalienable freehold; the continuing conversion of pastoral leases to Aboriginal land and the implications of provisions of the Native Title Act; the need for the territory government to have compulsory acquisition power to acquire land for essential public purposes; confirmation of the crown's ownership of minerals and resources and the right of access to those resources; just terms compensation for the acquisition of crown land from the territory by the Commonwealth and for the loss of rents otherwise payable to the territory; and compensation for the loss of revenue to the territory resulting from the exercise of the veto.

         Each and every one of these issues are complex and certainly demand the attention of government; and it disappoints me that, given the length of time that the Commonwealth government has had notice of these particular areas and provisions—and some of them were addressed several years ago by the Industry Commission in a major report that particularly highlighted the areas that would impact on mining provision and the provision of benefits that would flow through to Aboriginal people—the government has not addressed any of these issues which have been on notice for some time.

         In more recent times we have seen the relevance of commercial activities, home ownership by and for Aboriginal people, and fishing issues such as commercial fishing which allows continuing and existing licences but restricts the issue of new licences and also commercial fishing operations that have to notify the Northern Land Council of their impending interests. These issues, coupled with those where coastal licensees are severely restricted in where they can sell fishing catches et cetera, are further issues that do need to be addressed. Unfortunately, these have been ignored by the federal government. And here we have a piece of legislation that the government should have looked at and ought to have added those specific provisions to.

         By contrast, the relatively new Native Title Act 1993, which impacts on the Northern Territory and the rest of Australia, is already under fire, sparking calls for review. Earlier in February and following rejection of the Waanyi claim in north-west Queensland, one of the architects of the native title legislation said it was time to revisit the act. Let me quote the director of the Northern Land Council, Mr Darryl Pearce, who told ABC radio only several weeks ago on 16 February:

        I think that there will always be an unforseen consequence in any piece of legislation that has been both beneficial and detrimental and part of that process is to have a look at it and find out where it's been working and leave that bit alone, and where it hasn't been working, (and) to revisit that.

        Mr Pearce's words are intriguing in light of the legal battles under way between the traditional owners and the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. Under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, the land councils are supposed to represent traditional owners but we now have two cases where the owners allege that their rights have been usurped. One is at Jabiru and involves the Gagadju Association and the other is the Central Land Council administration of Alcoota Station in central Australia. In the case of the Northern Land Council, the Gagadju Association, which represents the traditional owners of the uranium rich Ranger area, has taken its concerns all the way to the Federal Court. I believe it was last week that there was media comment with regard to that particular action.

        The future of the Gagudju Association, owners of the internationally know Crocodile Hotel and Yellow Waters Cruises in the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park is under financial attack by the Northern Land Council. The Northern Land Council has threatened to withhold mining royalties which it is statutorily obligated to pay to the Gagudju Association. The Northern Land Council established the Gagudju Association in 1980 as the vehicle to receive and distribute royalty monies from the Ranger Uranium Mine.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Executive Officer, Gail Lech said today the "Northern Land Councils threats to withhold royalties" could mean that the businesses the Association have built up such as the Gagudju Crocodile Hotel, Gagudju Lodge Cooinda, Yellow Waters Cruises, Jabiru Mobil Service Station, Border Store, Screen Printing Company Daluk Daluk and numerous other small business enterprises are all now under financial duress caused by the Northern Land Councils action of withholding the Association royalties.

        There is increasing criticism of Aboriginal bodies wasting money however the Gagudju Association have not only astutely invested in these businesses but the Association have employed Medical services, built outstations which supply housing for members in the Jabiru region, along with supporting infrastructure and services.

        Past Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs including Mr Clyde Holding and Mr Fred Chaney have publicly praised the Gagudju Association for the way it has invested the royalty monies on behalf of its members, for the benefit of both the present and future generations of the Aboriginal people of the Kakadu region. The future of these people is now being challenged by the Northern Land Councils actions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Association publicly calls on the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Mr Robert Tickner, who has to date not been to visit the people in their own region. The Association needs the Minster to intervene and assist to resolve this dilemma before the Association folds due to lack of funds that rightly belong to all the people.

That cover story describes land councils as `political and financial power centres which can dispense or withhold patronage'. Further, in a comparison with ATSIC, the article states:

        Over the past two decades, Aboriginal people have become much more sophisticated in their dealings with politicians and the bureaucracy. Unfortunately, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act has failed to keep pace with this growing sophistication, not to mention the changing needs and aspirations of Aboriginal people. That is why I specifically mentioned the issues that need to be properly addressed and properly amended by this parliament. Mr Perron, in that letter to the Prime Minister dated 1 February 1994, certainly set out a series of major points that need to be addressed. They are the self same issues that many Aboriginal leaders and Aboriginal people are also asking to be reconsidered and revisited by this parliament.

         For what reason does the Labor Party withhold? Certainly we support the legislation that is before us today. It is one small technical matter that has been resolved.

         It will also be a test of the bona fides of the Labor Party that it will look at these areas. We are well aware that the issues that need focused and concentrated attack and attention by government are to do with Aboriginal programs that particularly affect areas such as housing—the appropriateness of housing design, which is so fundamental to Aboriginal health and hygiene and, in fact, the survival of Aboriginal people in many areas. Many Aboriginal leaders are not happy with the administrative system that exists within their relationship with the Labor government, within ATSIC or within the various other areas, and we really have to revisit many of these issues.

         It is important that we pass the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) today. I acknowledge that. It is also important that we look at the complexity of the issues that must be addressed. For too long, the Left faction within the Labor Party has been focused on Aboriginal issues. It has been a matter of the ALP Left, with its historic socialism agenda, driving the issue in Aboriginal affairs of control, power and, in some areas, what I would describe as greed and nepotism. The shandying of funding and the way in which it has been manipulated in many Aboriginal areas is not in the best interests of Aboriginal people.

         —I wish to address a few short remarks to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. In doing so, I do not intend to address the issues raised by the previous speaker—perhaps we will save that for another day. This bill seeks to grant to an Aboriginal land trust freehold title to Hodgson Downs cattle station, a pastoral lease owned by Aboriginal interests. This amending bill—which has had the support of the Northern Territory government, for which it is to be commended—will make possible that purchase and so pass the ownership of the freehold title to the Aboriginal community who have lived on this property for many years, who have sacred sites there and who have close links to that land.

         It is interesting to note that the land was purchased by ATSIC in 1991. In many ways, the current bill and this purchase have interesting ramifications for the debate we have been having about the land fund bill, because the land was purchased in 1991 on behalf of the community using current ATSIC funds but will now become freehold. It is, in a sense, a model of how the government envisages the land fund operating.

         I am pleased to see that we have support for that model, which it places the ownership of the land in a land trust on behalf of the Aboriginal people and will allow them to strengthen their legal ties to the land for which they have had traditional and longstanding ties. I think all members of parliament will be pleased to see this legislation passed. It is consistent with the overall approach of the government, which is to try to help Aboriginal people re-establish their link with the land, wherever that is possible.

         Some senators opposite have today drawn attention to the recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey which highlighted some of the very serious problems confronting Aboriginal people in our society. One of the things that survey highlighted was the continuing identification with the land held by Aboriginal people. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survey found that 75 per cent of those surveyed continued to identify with their home land, while only 30 per cent of those surveyed still lived there. So there was a continuing identification with traditional land, an ongoing affinity with the land and a desire by many Aboriginal people to strengthen their links with that traditional land.

         The response by the government in this instance is part of that response to the need and desire in Aboriginal people. I think it has been recognised by a range of inquiries—such as the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody—that dispossession of land has made an enormous contribution to the degradation of the Aboriginal population and that their association with the land and the link to their culture and way of life is very important to the health, dignity and self-respect of the Aboriginal people.

         This bill is one element in the overall strategy that the government has adopted. Another element of that, of course, is the native title legislation, which the previous speaker referred to. It is obviously too early to make any assessment of that legislation, but I think it is clear that that legislation will not result in large amounts of land being transferred, through the granting of native title, to Aboriginal ownership. I think there will be significant successes, but this can only be seen as part of the policy response.

         Another aspect of the government's approach is, of course, the Land Fund Bill. It is a shame that that bill has met with such resistance and opposition in this place, but I am hopeful that it will be able to be put in place very shortly. That legislation will contribute to a strategy of helping to assist Aboriginal people build and rebuild their connection with the land. In addition to native title legislation and the Land Fund Bill, we will have to look at other innovative ways of ensuring that Aboriginal people gain access and connection to their land. This bill represents one way that can be achieved, but it is a situation peculiar to the Northern Territory.

         In speaking today, I want to deal with an issue that continually crops up in this debate; it continually crops up in my own state in relation to Aboriginal persons buying cattle stations. We get an economic argument from certain groups who oppose Aboriginal communities buying cattle stations. In speeches made in the debate on the Land Fund Bill we have heard the opposition that there is to such measures which allow Aboriginal people to buy land and run commercial enterprises.

         I think it reflects a difficulty we have that, whenever we confront other economic interests in debating the provision of facilities and land for Aboriginal people, the debate changes. We really have to come to grips with that: people cannot mouth rhetoric and platitudes if, whenever it comes to the question of conflict of economic interest, they want to walk away from the argument. That is something we are facing in Western Australia, in particular. Some of the opposition coming from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association in that state has, I think, been quite unhelpful. On a wider front, obviously the whole attitude of the Western Australian state government in its attempt to abolish native title in that state has been a demonstration of the WA Liberal Party's position in representing economic interests, at least in relation to these issues.

         I wish to tackle, briefly, the issue that is raised constantly in relation to the granting of land to Aboriginal people; that is, that it somehow discourages mining, will result in a lack of investment in Australia and is to the detriment of other Australian people because of the economic impact of such decisions. Recently, material was distributed by the Australian Mining Industry Council regarding its recent surveying of investor attitudes. While that material was interesting, I was more interested to see a world risk survey, published in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia's Mining Monthly
         </emphasis>
         in February 1995; this surveys risk which is associated with the international mining industry and compares the world's 15 major mining countries.

         The important thing to note is that that survey revealed that Australia was the least riskiest place in the world to undertake business in relation to mining investment. This annual world risk survey is not some left wing survey but is, in fact, a survey commissioned by
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia's Mining Monthly
         </emphasis>
         . It makes the point very clearly that, in terms of the mining industry, Australia is the least riskiest country in the world in which to invest.

         As to our rating, on a scale which gives marks for various risk categories, Australia has a weighted average of 11.6—and the lower the figure, the less the risk. That compares with Canada at 12.7, South Africa at 16.4 and Papua New Guinea at the top of the scale at 20.4. But Australia is by far the least riskiest country in which to invest. Quoting briefly from the article in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        That is a real danger we run in this debate about making land available to Aboriginal people. It suits some people to talk up the risks to the mining industry, and it suits some people to put that sort of argument into the bargaining process to try to resist measures that go to empowering Aboriginal people and giving them access to the land from which they have been dispossessed. I think this world risk survey is very useful in putting paid to the sorts of arguments that are run about those issues.

         I hasten to add that, obviously, it will be an ongoing battle. I notice, Senator Panizza, that the President of the Liberal Party's Kalgoorlie South Division, when appearing before the Land Fund Bill committee, claimed that dispossession of Aboriginal people in Australia was not a problem because, unless any of them were over 200 years of age, none of them had been dispossessed, and so really there was not an issue about Aboriginal dispossession in Australia. Those are the sorts of attitudes that are rife in the Australian community and which have to be countered. Surveys such as this world risk survey help to put paid to some of the arguments about the economic risks of doing the right thing by attempting to allow Aboriginal people to reclaim their connection with as much land as is possible. I commend this bill to the Senate.

         Former Senator Richardson made a much publicised visit to the Northern Territory. The people from Karpoo in Alice Springs established an alcohol and drug rehabilitation service based on the Canadian Indian program. They got their fares to Canada by holding a chook raffle. They really proved their determination to do something for their people by the sweat of their brow. When they came to Canberra, Senator Richardson, the then minister for health, was not able to spend five minutes of his time seeing them. So much for this government's concern about Aboriginal health.

         Alcohol and drug abuse is a critically important issue in Aboriginal health as it leads to many other problems such as diabetes, domestic violence, the failure of babies to thrive and maternal death in very young mothers. All these things can flow from that one subject, which seems to be taboo for this government to talk about. It seems to me to be politically incorrect to talk about drug abuse being a priority. It also seems to be politically incorrect to acknowledge the fact that over the last few years government action has made many Aboriginal people in these communities totally dependent upon government. Grog is again involved in this. If people do not stay in their community, they cannot get the dole. If they cannot get the dole, they cannot get grog. The men do not take their boys out bush to teach them bushcraft.

         It is desperately sad to see Aboriginal mothers and fathers watching their children play in sewage. I have been to Soweto. I have seen people living in abject poverty keep their homes swept and clean, and focus on the health and hygiene of their children. It is a natural instinct in any parent in any country in the world to do so. Yet grog has so debilitated some Aboriginal families that the parents sit by and watch their children play in this way. Their mothers do not retrain them and their fathers do not get out a spade. I am not being critical of Aboriginal people; I am being critical of the lack of focus on the canker that is ruining the Aboriginal race. I am sure that if Fred Hollow were here today he would be telling the government the same thing. The government did not like to hear what he had to say.

         I would like to air one more matter. I recently read of a health worker who was speaking about mothers giving Sunshine milk to their babies. It is an adult formula that is totally unsatisfactory for babies. She wanted the government to provide baby milk formula. There are health departments in the territories, states and the Commonwealth. How can it possibly be that in this day and age we are not focusing on the health needs of those babies by encouraging mothers to breastfeed? We know much about the good quality of breast milk and the protection of babies from a hygiene point of view by breastfeeding. To not encourage these women who are living in difficult, dusty and remote areas to breastfeed their babies seems to be a dereliction of duty. To be talking about formula as an alternative to Sunshine milk seems to me to have missed the plot.

         Although Senator Collins wanted to be argumentative about this issue, I plead with the government to put some of these basic things in place. These are priority issues. That does not mean to say that the issue of land rights is not important but, by focusing entirely on land rights, we are destining the current generation and at least the next generation to ill health and early death. Aboriginal women in this country I think have a particularly difficult life. I want to see that life improved for them and for their children. I am disappointed that Senator Collins could not see how vitally important some of these things are that I have talked about today in trying to improve the lot of our people.

Not one member of the Australian parliament or, I believe, any responsible member of the whole population of Australia would be irresponsible about such matters.

         Accordingly, it is appropriate for the government of the day to enter into international treaties in order to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Successive Australian governments, both Liberal and Labor, have entered into international treaties and, in a record that is bipartisan, have gone from there to passing appropriate legislation in the parliament that has the full consent of the Senate and House of Representatives to back up the treaties and to ensure that we have followed up with action our commitment in words.

         Australia is party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The first is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, ratified by Australia on 23 January 1973, which is substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The second is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, which is substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976.

         The third is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction. I observe that Australia was at the forefront of international measures that were taken to achieve that convention and that the government had the full support of the opposition in that endeavour. It was ratified by Australia on 6 May last year but has not yet come into force internationally. Action will need to be taken by a number of other nations before that is the case. With regard to Australia, it will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed—that is, upon the convention coming into force internationally.

         In addition to these three international treaties and their associated Commonwealth legislation, which place limits on the use and transfer of chemical, nuclear and bacteriological material, Australia has been involved in four international groups which aim to control the international transfer of such materials. Many senators will be aware of these four important international groups in which Australia plays a very responsible and sometimes leading role. The first is the Zangger Committee, which was formed in the early 1970s by countries who are suppliers of nuclear materials with the aim of developing controls on the export of equipment for use in the production of special fissionable material. It has developed a list of equipment, the export of which should be subject to safeguards.

         Secondly, there is the Nuclear Suppliers Group, formed in 1974, which has developed guidelines for the export of nuclear-related equipment and technology which is aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thirdly, there is the missile technology control regime, established in 1987, whereby a group of countries have agreed to a basic set of guidelines on the export of missile technology to be incorporated in national export regulations. Fourthly, there is the so-called `Australia Group', which was established in 1987 to facilitate the establishment of the chemical weapons treaty and to deal with the export of material for the making of chemical weapons until such a treaty comes into force. The group has developed a list of chemicals which require export controls.

         With this range of legislation in place, it is the case, however, that not all common commercial exports are fully covered by the legislative measures that I have outlined. It is practical to therefore consider legislation of the kind that we now have in front of us. It fills a gap. It means that common commercial exports which have legitimate usage in other countries—that is, they can be properly exported to those other countries but may also assist in the construction of weapons of mass destruction—can be identified either by the supplier or by the minister responsible and, with such a self-awareness on behalf of the exporter or a government publicised awareness, become subject to this legislation and so prevented from export from this country.

Wherever there is a reasonable reach of Australian responsibility, this legislation reaches to prevent any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by any action of an Australian who would supply substances, services or contracts that would have any such misuse.

         The legislation sets out in clause 7 a constitutional basis for the bill. I refer senators to look that up in the legislation that is circulated. I go on to talk about clause 9, which sets out the prohibition on the provision or export of goods or services. It requires a person to believe or suspect on reasonable grounds that the goods may be used in a program for the development, production, acquisition or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. A person knowing that that is the outcome of the export would be, by this  legislation, liable to an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of eight years.

As I have said, clause 10 relates to the export of goods. Clause 11 relates to the provision of services. Clause 4 also includes contracts for the performance of work.

         I notice that the structure of this bill, in closing this gap and living up to Australia's responsibilities to ensure that we have a comprehensive enactment of laws to back up the international treaties that we have entered into, is placing a responsibility upon commercial exporters. On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I must note that this is a new responsibility punishable by a very major sentence—indeed, for companies, it is five times the fine that would be imposed upon an individual—and that this extra responsibility upon individuals to inform themselves in the commercial world is one which we ought not to take lightly. The coalition, however, believes it to be reasonable that we have such a requirement upon those who will enter into the export of substances, services or contracts to so inform themselves. In any event, where there is a doubt there is the ability to seek a permit from the minister or to be fully informed by the minister—that is, the minister's department acting under instructions from the minister.

It has been very much the case, even in the years before the Gulf War, that exporters of chemicals in Australia have been very aware that certain chemicals exported to Iraq could well have been diverted from a commercial purpose—even a stated Iraqi commercial purpose—to use in the making of a weapon of mass destruction.

         I anticipate that some senators will want to strengthen this legislation and will say that the Liberal and National parties, in agreeing with the principles of the government's legislation, have left even now a loophole for the exporting of goods, services or contracts that could be used for such programs. I am not convinced of that position, but I will listen most carefully to Independent and Democrat senators to hear the case that they may put. I ask that it not be mere alarm that is put forward but, as we would expect, reasonable, argued and specific arguments put if there are inadequacies in the legislation in front of us.

         I conclude by reiterating that the coalition notes that this legislation will impose an additional burden on companies to become aware of the ultimate use of goods or services that they might provide or export. Although the criminal provisions require a level of intent of belief or suspicion, a jury could attribute suspicion to a company if it held or had access to information which indicated that the goods or services might be used for a weapons of mass destruction program, even if no-one in the company had actually turned their mind to it. The company then must also take care that one of its directors, employees or agents does not hold such suspicions without alerting the responsible person in the company, otherwise the knowledge of the director, employee or agent could be attributed to the company, resulting in conviction, a fine and confiscation of the goods.

         The coalition does not step back from requiring reasonable, responsible action of any company or person in Australia, but we are very mindful of this additional burden placed upon commercial operators in Australia and Australians abroad. This burden on companies should be balanced against the importance of limiting the capacity of countries to construct weapons of mass destruction. As I have intimated from the outset, the coalition does not oppose the legislation. We are mindful of some tightening or rewording amendments that the government will move that have been circulated and for which there is an explanation. We will support this legislation and listen to the contributions of other senators.

         The bill contains a number of sensible provisions that we are happy to support, specifically: the minister may prohibit the supply or export of goods or services which could contribute to a weapons of mass destruction program; a person may seek the minister's advice as to whether a proposed supply or export could assist such a program; gaol terms can be imposed for breaches; goods may be seized and destroyed where attempts are made to export them in contravention of the act; and companies and directors are liable for the actions of their employees or their delegates.

         So far so good, but the bill contains what we regard as a major weakness. It actually allows permits to be issued to supply goods or services to a weapons of mass destruction program provided this would not conflict with our international obligations or the national interest. To make matters worse, the power to issue permits can be delegated by the minister to someone in his department and there is absolutely no accountability built into that process. Permits do not need to be tabled or otherwise made public and they are not subject to any disallowance.

         The Democrats cannot see how it would ever be in the national interest for Australians to help develop or build weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, there is a strong body of legal opinion that weapons of that kind violate international humanitarian law. In our view, the power to issue permits should be removed from this bill and I will be moving amendments to that effect.

         This possibility arises because the nuclear non-proliferation treaty does not prevent nuclear weapon related exports to the five acknowledged nuclear weapon states—the US, Russia, the UK, France and China. In discussions with my office departmental officials have claimed that our bilateral safeguards agreements would prevent the export of nuclear weapon components or the supply of relevant services but as far as we can see this is simply not the case. Those agreements regulate the export of nuclear reactor parts not nuclear weapon parts.

         It would be alarmist to suggest that this bill is going to unleash a flood of Australian assistance to nuclear weapons programs; it is not. We simply believe that the possibility of any such assistance, even in the future, should be categorically ruled out right now. The significance of this proposed permit system, which somewhat fittingly is provided for in clause 13, lies not just in the apparent risk of highly undesirable exports. Just as important—perhaps more important—is what it says about the government's policy on nuclear non-proliferation. If this government had a clear and unambiguous policy favouring the abolition of all weapons of mass destruction it would not have provided for a permit system in this bill. It would have realised that any sort of assistance to a weapons of mass destruction program is automatically contrary to our national interest.

          Unfortunately, this self-evident realisation has not yet found its way into government policy, and that is a fact which was illustrated by two votes taken in the United Nations General Assembly on 15 December last year. The first vote was on a resolution which proposed a step by step reduction in the nuclear threat. This was a balanced and sensible proposal. It sought to move the world closer to the ultimate goal of general nuclear disarmament, as called for in the NPT. Article 6 of the NPT calls for negotiations for:

         In keeping with world opinion, the resolution for a step by step reduction in the nuclear threat won a resounding majority: 111 states voted in favour, 24 voted against and 33 abstained. Australia was one of those abstentions. The second vote—which, incidentally, took place some 17 minutes later—proposed to ask the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on a question which is crucial to world security, that is: is the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstance permitted under international law?

         With all that was at stake the nuclear powers worked very hard to neutralise the World Court project, which was established in the mid-1980s to get a resolution of this kind through the General Assembly. Fortunately, and amazingly, they failed in that. The resolution passed with 78 states in favour, 43 against and 38 abstentions. How did Australia vote? Did we stand up for humanitarian principles? Did we build on our self-proclaimed track record on arms control or did we abstain again? We abstained.

         It is not hard to work out why our government took that position. For all our great work on chemical disarmament—and it was great work; it still is—our approach to nuclear disarmament is conservative, outdated and heavily constrained by alliance sensitivities.

         The minister has argued that the court should not involve itself in a security matter, especially one as sensitive as this one. It is not at all clear why this should be so, particularly when weighty humanitarian principles and the integrity of international law are at stake here. He has also claimed that the standing of the court will be undermined because the nuclear weapon states will not cooperate with an adverse ruling. In fact, the contrary is more likely to be the case. The court's standing would be raised immeasurably by an opinion against nuclear weapons given the favourable climate of world sentiment.

A finding in favour of high yield weapons, the most controversial and threatening kind, is extremely unlikely for the reasons I have already given. It may be that some classes of tactical weapons would be found legal, but this would be peripheral. The government's objections to the World Court project have quite deliberately erred on the side of unjustified pessimism and have ducked the real issue—the illegality of nuclear weapons and the need to get serious about nuclear disarmament.

         We do, however, have an opportunity to redeem ourselves in the near future. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will be the subject of a review conference in April of this year. At issue is whether the treaty should be extended indefinitely or for a temporary period, amended in some way or abandoned entirely. A key focus will be whether the nuclear powers have honoured their article 6 obligation to move towards nuclear disarmament and whether that process should be given a kick along.

         My view is that indefinite extension without amendment would encourage complacency amongst the nuclear powers. A timetable for disarmament or at least some more ambitious steps towards that goal would be much more in keeping with the spirit of the treaty itself.

The result will be to undermine our disarmament credentials and to increase our regional isolation on this critical security issue. A policy rethink is long overdue. We need to be serious about nuclear disarmament. We urge the Senate to make that point by accepting our amendment.

         Ballistic missiles can be classified in a number of ways. There are very short range missiles, the tactical ballistic missiles that are used on the battlefields. Beyond that are the theatre type weapons such as the short range ballistic missile that go to about 450 nautical miles, the medium range ballistic missiles that go to 1,500 nautical miles, the intermediate range ballistic missiles that go up to 3,500 nautical miles and then beyond that again are the very large missiles, the intercontinental ballistic missiles.

         They are in quite a different league to the intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are hugely expensive. They will always be the province of only the major powers. The smaller nations will never possess missiles to rival the Russian or American ICBMs. In relation to the shorter range missiles, the world is awash with them—that may sound like hyperbole—and they are certainly increasingly available. There is an urgent need for us to develop a counter to those weapons. That is one of the military imperatives before us.

         Saying that, I recognise that there is no successful counter in place today. The Patriot missile that was used in the Gulf War was one of the systems used against them and there are several lesser systems available in the Western nations. An anti-ballistic missile system is a very system, but these weapons are real terror weapons. One of the great dangers is that they can be used against civilian targets, either in a mass area attack or for precise attacks on civilian targets.

There have been many moves to regulate the use of weapons of war, not just nuclear weapons, in the last 50 years.

         If we look at modern history, we find that in 1868 we had the St Petersburg conference which ultimately led to the Hague convention of 1907 which banned a number of weapons. Interestingly enough, the St Petersburg convention banned the use of poison gas as a military weapon. Somewhat strangely the development of poison gas was carried out by a Nobel Prize winning German-Jewish scientist Fritz Haber. He developed chlorine so that it could be used in the battlefield. He took it beyond a laboratory exercise, mass produced it and developed the technologies for using it. It was used firstly at Ypres in April 1915 and with devastating effect for the rest of the First World War. We saw gas widely used by both sides of the conflict in the First World War and we saw it used by the Italians at Abyssinia and most recently by Saddam Hussein, the friend of the Democrats, against his own Kurdish citizens in Iraq.

         I said that it is part of the series of international arms control agreements that we have. One of the principal agreements that comes to mind is the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which, despite the criticism we have heard from the Democrats, has been a great success. There is no question in my mind, having lived through the era that this treaty has been in place, that it has acted as a positive restraint on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. No-one who can take a detached view of history could come to any other conclusion. Sure, it is not perfect but, if we had not had the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, we would have seen many more nations possessing nuclear weapons today and the world would be a very much more dangerous place than it is today.

To make the claims she did that somehow or other we are in a parlous state because we still have nuclear weapons is to not recognise the enormous changes that have taken place since the end of the Cold War.

It is true that those rules have changed over the centuries, and we have not had the codification that we had under the Geneva conventions that we have at the present time. But there has always been some acceptance that there are limits to the use of force.

         One of the great differentiations that has been made is between armed force in regular military units and civilians. The general assumption has been that civilians are separate and that armed forces have certain rules that they conform to when they are using the force and the violence necessary in a time of war. Once upon a time, it was quite simple to differentiate between the two. In general, members of an armed force wore a uniform or badges. They were identifiable visibly and they always carried their arms openly. Nowadays, with the freedom fighters and the sorts of liberation struggles that take place within some regimes, it is very hard to identify a civilian faction from an armed faction. That leads to a blurring of the rules of war. Nevertheless, there are conventions.

         It is interesting that the great writer on warfare, von Clausewitz, derided laws in relation to armed conflict as being `self-imposed restraints hardly worth mentioning'. But I do not agree with that point of view. I would agree with Professor Martin Van Crevald, who is one of the most informed modern writers on the conduct of war and armed conflict. He once said that `war without law is not merely a monstrosity but an impossibility'. Those laws in the past have applied to the personnel who were involved, the weapons that were used and the circumstances of treaties and conventions for truces, the neutral states and the citizenship.

         Once upon a time, prisoners of war were enslaved and made to work. Now we have the Geneva convention, which provides that you have to give only your name, rank and serial number, and that is the end of it. Prisoners are required under the convention to be treated in a humane way. They are required to be fed, to be not turned into slave labourers or anything like that. But I can give another example of how conventions change. Back in Napoleonic times, if officers who were captured gave their word that they would not escape, they lived the life of luxury and ease that the officers in the army that captured them did. It is now accepted that, when both officers and other ranks are captured, they have an obligation to escape if they can.

         Some weapons have been favoured more than others. From Greek mythology right up to the Middle Ages the sword and the spear were always preferred to the bow. That, of course, was breached when King Harald got an arrow through his eye at the Battle of Hastings. As you would remember very well, the English had their revenge at Crecy and at Agincourt with the longbow against the French.

         We have a long history of rules or conventions relating to activities in a warlike sense, and they go back right to the dawn of history when the first groups or tribes were in conflict, right up to the nation states that we have today. It is against that historical background that the weapons of mass destruction bill must be judged. We recognise that all legislation is imperfect and it will not stop a wilful government breaking the conventions. If you look at the effect of treaties, like the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, you must come to the conclusion that it is better to do these legislative acts and work to support them and to get acceptance of them amongst the nations of the world than not do them.

         —Before making some brief comments on the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill, I would like to say a couple of things about some of the statements that have been made already by other senators. Senator MacGibbon says that war without law would be a monstrosity. I would like to see war without profits. If it became illegal to make profits out of such things as weapons of mass destruction, perhaps we would not be in this situation of trying to work out how we can stop people from continuing to try to make profits out of producing components or parts of weapons of mass destruction.

The dollar is responsible for a lot of that and from what I have seen so far, today's debate has not indicated that the members of the opposition recognise in any way that that is the case.

         Senator MacGibbon also said that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is one of the great successes. I am concerned that he misses the point that the conditions for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty actually guarantee proliferation of nuclear materials. Supposedly, that guarantees the supply of nuclear materials for non-aggressive uses. The only trouble is that there is very little way of controlling what happens to nuclear materials once a country has gained access to them. The reality is that the international body for controlling the spread of nuclear weapons, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is the same body whose role it is to promote the use of nuclear technology. Therefore, there is obviously a conflict of interest. It is a body that is very underresourced in the area of checking proliferation, so there is no way that this body has the ability to police what happens.

         Senator MacGibbon mentioned that we can breathe a sigh of relief that the Cold War is over, but we are not just talking about the existing superpowers that we recognised under the Cold War. As we speak, a cargo of plutonium is travelling to Japan. The problem with that is that Australia and other countries like the United States have jumped up and down about North Korea's gaining of materials that could be used in a nuclear weapons program. What has been said about the proliferation of materials that could be used in Japan's nuclear program? Senator MacGibbon says that no nuclear weapon is being developed. That is an extremely naive stance—and Australia has taken that stance.

The reality is that Australia's stance is far from acceptable to people who are concerned about what place we will take in the future and what role we might have in the future proliferation of nuclear weapons. Senator MacGibbon said, `Somebody has got to be around on the side of the good guys.' I have to tell you that during the inquiry into defence exports, it was extremely difficult for anyone to get any idea of who we classified as good guys and who we classified as bad guys. In fact, the new Uruguay Round of GATT does not allow us to make distinctions between good guys and bad guys, because they consider it is a barrier to free trade for us to make plans for the future of our exports, like uranium, or whether or not it might be making a situation worse in a particular part of the world. The reason for that is that the Uruguay Round of GATT specifies that we can only make decisions in that way if it is in our own security interests.

         I was extremely perplexed that Senator MacGibbon could say that his reading of the legislation indicated that there is no way that the permits mentioned under section 13 could be used for weapons of mass destruction. I would like to point Senator MacGibbon to the word `and' in clause 13, which states:

         The Greens (WA) welcome any legislation designed to reduce the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I would like to point out that in very recent times, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has been involved in a trip to Indonesia to actually ask them to support the nuclear weapons states' push for an open-ended treaty. As Senator Bourne mentioned, the reality is that there has not been enough movement towards the clauses that are required by the nuclear weapons states to go towards a position of disarmament. That is the preferred position. It surely must be that Australia works to strengthen those clauses. Why, oh, why is Australia siding with the nuclear weapons states?

The nuclear weapons states can continue to do what they like for as long as they like with nuclear weapons.

         We are also concerned about clauses 10 and 13. I have mentioned this before. It reads that goods may not be exported if it is suspected that they will be used in a weapons of mass destruction program except `where it is authorised by virtue of a ministerial permanent or written notice.' We are at a loss to understand why the government would authorise the export of goods it suspects may be used in a weapons of mass destruction program. We suspect that this may be used to ensure that this bill does not interfere unduly with the profit of Australian companies. It will also be used, we assume, to allow exports of sensitive goods to the nuclear weapons states, despite their possession of massive nuclear arsenals. This is consistent with the double standard inherent in treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

         Whilst we welcome any bill designed to deter proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we believe the government could be doing much more on the international scene with regard to nuclear weapons. In 1985 Senator Gareth Evans was asked:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Does the Government consider that the [Nuclear Weapons State] signatories to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have adequately complied with their obligations under Article VI of the Treaty?

       <para>
        His answer was that they had not `met the expectations of the non-nuclear weapons states.' Given that, why is Australia not doing more to support attempts to strengthen article vi at the April 1995 nuclear non-proliferation review conference, in particular supporting attempts to introduce a timetable for the elimination of nuclear weapons?

         Senator Evans cannot claim that things have changed in this sense since 1985. The United Kingdom has just commissioned the Trident nuclear submarine, which represents a fourfold increase in strike power over the previous Polaris. France and China have made no moves towards disarmament. Despite START II, the United States continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. The commitment to disarmament contained in article vi is still not being met. I agree that some nuclear weapons are being decommissioned but mostly it is because they have reached their use-by date, so it makes a very convenient gesture on the part of those states.

         In the 1994 defence white paper, the government stated that it was committed to `supporting the maintenance by the United States of a nuclear capability to deter nuclear threats against allies like Australia.' This flies in the face of moves towards disarmament. It reinforces the role of nuclear weapons as one of the major determinants of global power and makes the acquisition of nuclear weapons by non-weapons states more attractive. In that, it directly undermines non-proliferation efforts. Non-proliferation efforts will always be more difficult if nuclear weapons are given such a critical role in determining who is powerful and who is not.

         Australia has been an opponent of the attempt to have the International Court of Justice rule on the legality of using nuclear weapons. This position has seen us running the line of the nuclear weapons states, whose agenda predictably is to maintain their nuclear arsenals. We should then encourage Australia to support moves being made in the context of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference to accelerate nuclear disarmament, in particular moves to introduce a definite timetable for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Countries such as Indonesia and Mexico are proposing such moves, as are groupings such as Parliamentarians for Global Action, PGA. Australia, however, is pushing for indefinite extension with no timetable, which would set in stone the possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states.

         Finally, I give notice that I will be moving an amendment after clause 20 to incorporate a clause that requires the government to commit itself to implementing a program to eliminate the risk of nuclear weapons developed from nuclear energy resources. I will elaborate further on this issue at the committee stage of the bill. It is hypocritical of Australia not to include such clauses. Otherwise there is no way in the world we could indicate that we are anything but naive. To consider supplying the elements of weapons of mass destruction on the basis that we accept countries' assurances that they will not be used in a weapons of mass destruction program is naive in the extreme. So we watch with interest and with support from the various sides on these issues. In reality I cannot see any justification for supporting the ability of the minister to override without parliamentary scrutiny any ability to make the sale by Australia of parts of weapons of mass destruction illegal, full stop.

The government cannot agree with the suggestion made by some opposition senators that there are deficiencies in the government's approach to disarmament and non-proliferation issues, including in relation to the current bill. Australia's record under this government of being one of the most active countries internationally in promoting these objectives and of practical achievement in areas such as the conclusion of the chemical weapons convention and progress towards the comprehensive test ban treaty underlines this government's commitment and constructive approach. It is also an approach that is practical and realistic. That point must be stressed. Not only is it committed; it is also practical and realistic.

Since then we have committed substantial resources towards the negotiation, including the provision of a draft treaty text. Australia continues to urge the five nuclear weapons states to reach a common agreement on assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear weapons states which have fulfilled their non-proliferation obligations, known as negative security assurances.

         Australia abstained on a resolution promoting a step-by-step approach to nuclear threat reduction because the resolution was largely impractical. It is widely understood that the nuclear weapons states would not be prepared to negotiate a timetable for nuclear disarmament in a multilateral forum. Some of the steps prescribed in the resolution can only be negotiated bilaterally and those which can be considered multilaterally, such as the comprehensive test ban treaty and the cut-off, are already on the agenda of the CD. We were also concerned that the process of negotiating a timetable for nuclear disarmament could completely paralyse the CD.

The government believes that indefinite extension of the treaty can best guarantee the continuation of the international and regional security benefits provided to date by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

         I turn now to clause 13, which relates to the permit system. The suggestion that the permit system under clause 13 would allow a wide area of discretion to the government to supply goods or services to weapons of mass destruction programs is based on a misreading of this provision in the legislation. The example given in Senator Bourne's media release of 8 February of nuclear weapons triggers—that is, electronic switches—is particularly inappropriate as any export of the item in question is already regulated under Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulation 13(e).

In the case of complete missiles within the missile technology control regime parameters—that is, capable of delivering a payload of 500 kilograms over a distance of 300 kilometres—there is a strong presumption to deny any transfer. That means that the minister could only issue a permit to allow the supply or export of goods or the provisions of services in the narrow circumstances of cooperation on a missile program, consistent with our international or treaty obligations or the national interests, including defence interests.

         I turn to the reasons for government amendments. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills questioned the inclusion of subclause 14(7), due to a possible reversal of the onus of proof. Subclause 14(7) was added late in the drafting of the bill with the aim of precluding prosecution being mounted against a person who has acted in compliance with the conditions specified by the minister in a notice issued under paragraph 14(2)(a). The government believes such protection should be included in the legislation but agrees that the Senate committee has a point in its suggestion that subclause 14(7) could be read as reversing the onus of proof in this one possible element in a prosecution. The government, accordingly, is moving amendments to ensure this reversal onus of proof does not occur.

         I am provided with some comments that particularly go to the foreshadowed amendment of Senator Margetts after clause 13 concerning a program of international cooperation in energy resources. The government does not see that the development and use of non-nuclear resources is an effective way of dealing with the potential military use of nuclear science. The great virtue of the non-proliferation treaty is that, despite their inherent scientific and technological competence or capacities, countries consciously forswear the acquisition or development of nuclear armaments. This undertaking is bound in international law and verified by the international safeguard system. It has been shown to be effective in the case of the North Korean nuclear program.

         Thus there already exists a comprehensive international regime constraining nuclear weapons proliferation whilst providing a basis for legitimate nuclear trade and cooperation. This entails arrangements by which countries control the supply and export of nuclear related items consistent with their obligations under the non-proliferation treaty to ensure that such trade does not contribute to proliferation. As to the international cooperation in non-nuclear energy, there is already an abundant level of such cooperation at both the intergovernmental and non-governmental level. I hope that assists Senator Margetts in understanding why we do not accept that amendment.

         —I cannot let this go by without mentioning one small issue of relevance here. Senator Crowley has mentioned that the reason the government is changing clause 14(7) of the bill is the principle of the reversal of the onus of proof. Both the government and the opposition sat in this chamber—they did not sit in the chamber very much—during the debate on the Uruguay Round of GATT. The government moved and the opposition voted for the reversal of the onus of proof in relation to intellectual property. It seems to be a principle that is only put forward on occasions when it suits the government and when the opposition is listening. During that debate you did exactly the opposite. I would like to find out why it is applicable in some instances and not in others.

The minister has made it abundantly clear that that is fallacious; that is wrong. That is not the purpose of the permit. If you read clause 13—that is the matter before us, to exclude clause 13 from this bill—it talks about exporting certain goods.

         We are obliged by treaty and we are obliged by the minister's responsibilities under this act—let alone the individual exporter's responsibilities—not to see Australians exporting any matter for a weapons of mass destruction program.

I am not at all convinced by the contributions made by Senator Bourne or Senator Margetts that we should support any motion to have the permit system taken away from this bill.

         —With all due respect, Senator Crowley is perhaps not as aware as some of us of the fact that the Minister for Defence has actually overlooked a number of Australia's treaty obligations with regard to human rights on a number of occasions in efforts to make Australian Defence Industries and other defence related exports more profitable in Australia. So, when it comes to the dollar, it seems that some of our treaty obligations are not as important as others. The fact that it does say `and' gives me no confidence whatsoever, because it means that none of us get to check the decisions made by the minister or the first mentioned person acting on his behalf. What on earth are we doing? To whom are we surrendering this power of overriding this legislation?

        This amendment to the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994 is designed to provide the parliament with the opportunity to scrutinise permits issued by the minister under the terms of clause 13 of this bill. We agreed with the Democrats that it would be preferable if this clause did not exist, but it is the wish of the chamber to allow the minister to issue permits to allow export of goods or services that may assist with the weapons of mass destruction program. The Greens feel that it is absolutely essential that, in the interests of absolute, proper parliamentary scrutiny, permits issued under ministerial discretion be able to be disallowed by the parliament.

         Given the opposition's commitment to parliamentary scrutiny of issues in relation to international treaties, I trust that it will be consistent with that belief and allow this parliament to carry out its duties and ensure that the minister's discretion is not contrary to Australia's international or treaty obligations or the national interest, as stated in clause 13. Given the government's often stated commitment to openness and accountability, I trust that it too will support this very reasonable amendment.

I give the same substantial answer to this amendment as I did to the former.

         I ask further that this be understood: the Liberal and National parties believe that we will be in government soon, and that, in government, we will be accountable to parliament. We require this government now to be accountable to parliament. But accountability to parliament does not mean that the parliament has an immediate veto upon powers exercised responsibly by a minister of the government. There is an appropriate executive power, legislative power and parliamentary power.

         With Senator Margetts having referred to treaties, for the record let it be understood that the Liberal and National parties are, indeed, very concerned that the treaty making powers which are rightly in the constitution are being used as a loophole to bring upon the Commonwealth areas of legislative capacity which would not have been allowed by the constitution had there not been the exercise by the Australian government of a treaty. What we are calling for is that at an early stage in the contemplation of a treaty there be proper review and input by the parliament—indeed, I say, even by responsible bodies like state governments and state parliaments, so that there is full knowledge of the implications of any treaty.

The Liberal and National parties when in government have never agreed that the parliament has a veto upon a treaty that a Liberal-National Party government enters into. Rather, in coming to government—and I hope it is later this year or as soon as is possible—we want to take upon us a new discipline that we will, in government, give such forewarning of any treaty that would be contemplated to be entered into; that the full views of representatives in the parliament, representatives of the states and any other interested parties are fully able to be heard; and that there is consultation that is real and meaningful before the executive government exercises its real power to enter into such a treaty.

         I have had discussions in the past with Senator Bourne to see whether we can achieve the establishment of a Senate committee to which whereby all controversial treaties can be referred. For example, Senator Margetts raised the issue, by interjection, of the need perhaps to have the GATT referred to a Senate committee. Of course, if such a Senate committee had been established, that obviously would be the sort of treaty—if senators felt it were controversial—which would be referred to a Senate committee for discussion and analysis. Equally, a very large number of other treaties being proposed by the government which are controversial would have also been referred to such a Senate committee. I think it is a pity that, despite the earlier assurances we received from Senator Bourne, we have not been able to advance further on this basis, but I hope that in the coming weeks we can have constructive discussions.

         The opposition is assuming that it will win the next election. It may well be that Labor wins the next election; it may stay in power for the next 10 years. Earlier today we heard cries from the opposition that the government had lied about certain things. The opposition clearly does not trust the government. The government will probably enter into another 25, 50, or 100 international treaties during its next term in office—if it gets there. The opposition cannot assume that it will win office, yet here it is giving to the government not only the power to enter into those treaties but also the power under those treaties to do things which, as Senator Margetts has indicated, could presage the massive destruction of life over large areas, including the destruction of cities. We are talking about weapons of mass destruction.

         The opposition cannot assume that it will win government. It might well be stuck with the entering into of many, many other treaties by the government. The opposition then will have to live with having given the minister this sort of power, without there being any recourse available to it. It seems to me that the amendment we are considering here is a very reasonable stopgap, if the opposition is genuinely concerned about proper parliamentary scrutiny.

        This amendment is, in fact, a redraft of sections 501, 502 and 503 of the United States Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act 1978. The philosophy behind those sections is very sound: they are designed to ensure that the worldwide reliance on nuclear technology, including that for nuclear power, is reduced to minimise the risk that nations developing so-called peaceful nuclear technology do not use that technology for developing weapons of mass destruction.

         I wish to remind the committee that I outlined concerns in this regard during debate on a matter of urgency on uranium mining on 24 August 1994. At that time I quoted from an article by Elizabeth Clegg from the Centre for Defence Studies at the University of Aberdeen. In that article, which was published in

        In conclusion, then, it can be seen that the infrastructure required for the development of a nuclear weapons potential is best created under cover of a well established civilian nuclear industry; in all of the above cases the military option was made possible by the existence of a civilian programme.

        These concerns have been echoed in recent times with press reports that the United States Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, has been fighting to prevent a deal under which the Russian government will provide specialists, equipment and technology to help Iran finish a 1,300-megawatt light-water nuclear reactor. Apparently, one of the concerns outlined by the United States has been the fear that Iran was, in fact, involved in a crash effort to develop nuclear weapons.

         There is no doubt that, apart from the very real concerns about the environment associated with the operation of nuclear reactors and the disposal of nuclear waste from those facilities, there is also a great concern that so-called `peaceful' nuclear technology is very easily diverted into programs to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. I trust that the committee will support this amendment as a means of demonstrating to the world community that Australia is truly committed to reducing the possibility of proliferating weapons of mass destruction.

         —Tonight I wish to bid farewell from our parliament to a man who will go down in history as an enigma in the realm of Australian politics. I refer to Dr John Hewson. John Hewson entered this parliament as the member for the Sydney harbourside electorate of Wentworth in 1987 at the age of just 40. He had a background of achievement in business and finance and had considerable experience in political life as a policy adviser to successive federal treasurers between 1976 and 1983.

         John Hewson is a man of great intelligence. In many ways, he is a good example of a self-made man. Coming from a solid working class background, he rose through hard work and a beneficial exploitation of his own abilities to become professor of economics at the University of New South Wales at the tender age of just 31. By the time he entered federal parliament in 1987, John had amassed a striking background in economic life, the type of which is rarely made available to this place. No-one ever thought that John entered parliament for the kicks or the money; he had plenty of both in his previous occupations. He came here because he was a man of vision. He was a man who could see what this country could become, given the inspired leadership in economic matters which this country lacked in the late 1980s and which it still lacks at a governmental level.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I note that John Hewson's speech in the House today gave expression to some of the frustrations which he felt after seven years of struggling to put his vision into practice. It is not difficult to empathise with his feelings. He readily admitted all along that he was no politician. He readily admitted that he lacked some of the guile which long-term politicians acquire and which helps us to survive some of the more testing times of political battle, public and media criticism and the rough and tumble of political life. After all, John was an academic. He was also a man of the business world who came to Canberra with a vision, but not necessarily with the craft to bring about the results that he sought.

       <para first-indent="16">

         He never saw politics as anything but a means to itself. Unfortunately, he has now come to the conclusion that his ability to seriously influence the ends he sought is not in proportion to the influence he can have on affairs outside this parliament.

         Many would say that John's greatest mistake was to produce a policy document at the 1993 election that was too detailed. It permitted a decline into petty nit-picking to the exclusion of the greater picture. Others would claim that the detailed policy was his greatest success. Certainly the election was the first to see a policy document which allowed close scrutiny but also the ability for our political opponents to sow confusion and misconceptions by scare tactics and untruths. To spend too much time expressing regrets over the outcome of the 1993 election is of no value. John Hewson gave his best effort. He told the truth about his policies. He gave the full details and, regrettably, he lost at the polls.

       <para first-indent="16">

         It would be indeed unfortunate if this experience prevented oppositions or governments of the future from presenting the electorate with a comprehensive set of detailed policies for fear of the type of criticism and the campaign of misrepresentation which occurred in 1993. The action of John Hewson on that occasion took courage. It failed to pay off where it should have mattered, which was at the polls. To try to say that it was therefore the wrong tack to take belittles the exercise and the right of Australians to have access to in-depth policies at election time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe that John Hewson took not only a courageous road but the right one, and one that will set an example for the expectation of voters in the future. An educated and aware electorate will no longer be satisfied with motherhood policies and broad generalisations when it is seeking meaningful direction from political parties.

         From my personal point of view, I thank John for the opportunity he gave me to participate in the preparation and examination of policies in the areas of income tax and superannuation as a parliamentary secretary as part of a shadow ministry team. It was an experience that I relished. I appreciate it and thank him. Finally, as I say goodbye to John and wish him and his family all the very best for their future life, I believe that the parliamentary and economic debate will be the poorer for his leaving. However, I sincerely believe that Australian politics has certainly been the richer for John Hewson's time with us. I thank the Senate.

I am uniquely qualified to speak about this as I am the only parliamentarian who served as a volunteer in Rwanda last year. I was saddened to see the attack on CARE Australia, for whom I worked, on Channel Nine's

         I was amazed to learn today that some of that footage and the people who were used in that program had been employed as long as four years ago and were venting their spleen for some imagined misdemeanours that had occurred. I went into that program unaware of CARE Australia's activities. I ask Channel Nine and the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday
         </emphasis>
         program whether they can imagine the damage they have done to the reputation of CARE Australia and the other non-government organisations. Regretfully, when you throw mud, inevitably some of it sticks. I have certainly regarded the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday
         </emphasis>
         program as a high-grade program. Having seen the program yesterday—I have the transcript of it in front of me; I have re-read it—I am amazed at the lack of depth in what it did. I think it has damned itself by what it did yesterday.

         Interestingly enough, one of the people who appeared on that program I had not met but he followed on my service in Rwanda. He complained that he was a pharmacist but was not used as a pharmacist. I was senior surgeon of a teaching hospital in Brisbane, and I was acting as pharmacist at the hospital that he was at. I organised the pharmacy in Kitale because it was not organised when I got there. Only somebody who has been in that situation can really understand the utter chaos and the overwhelming demands made on organisations such as CARE Australia.

         This `poor' chap came in and, in the comfort of the studios where the program was produced, talked about the lack of organisation, lack of facilities and his not being promoted to his level of competence. I feel sorry for him, because the one characteristic that I noted with all the CARE Australia workers who were involved in this situation was that they put their hands or their shoulders to anything that was available because of the terrible death and destruction that was going on around them. We did not care whether we were pharmacists. We did not care whether we were the surgeons, the doctors or the nurses. We were there to work on the ground and support those people in their tragic situation. Seeing that fellow yesterday complaining about his skills not being used made me feel ill.

         program than Channel 9 because it is all embracing and each program has its own responsibility. I question the morality of the people who put that program to air without giving the opportunity to CARE Australia to respond. I have checked with CARE Australia as to the requests that were made. CARE Australia quite understandably asked to appear live.

         Mr President, you and I, as well as every senator in this chamber and those who are watching, would be aware of the editing that occurs in relation to programs. Certainly, when I was active in the organisation of my party I made it a rule to go live on every occasion. Television programs respected that, and they got a better program out of it. On this occasion, when a request was made not only was it not acceded to but, when CARE Australia and the President of CARE Australia asked that appointments be made so that he could explain the difficulties that were occurring, the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         The program did submit 35 questions, which were responded to by CARE Australia, but it still went ahead with the superficial program that covered only some of the points. For example, CARE Australia was said to have double billed for a pond that was built in a country. It turns out that two separate ponds had been built. One was billed to the United Nations and one was paid for by CARE Australia. Without checking that fact and without going on the ground and seeing the situation, Channel 9 came out with an irresponsible program which will damage not only CARE Australia but also other non-government organisations which seek the charitable dollar.

         One of the things that I have done since I came back from Rwanda is go to many public meetings. As late as Friday night I was at a public meeting raising funds for CARE Australia, which I willingly did, through the Baptist Church in Queensland. I unequivocally have done that because of my knowledge of what I have seen. I have been to the organisation on Northbourne Avenue. I have looked at the structures. I have even seen what has happened on the ground.

         One of the complaints was that CARE Australia did not buy trucks in Bosnia. It did not buy trucks in Rwanda or Zaire because it was safer to lease the trucks or use the trucks that were available there because they got hijacked. The same was happening in Bosnia. You do not buy trucks. It is all very well for somebody on the

          Sunday

         program to talk about buying a truck and transporting it to a foreign country. In Zaire, the regime is totally corrupt. A CARE Australia truck which had its material on it and which was ostensibly owned by CARE Australia—fortunately it was not; it was leased from a Zairean—was hijacked by the Zairean military. The Zairean military had run out of petrol so it held us up, took our truck from us, headed off and we never saw it again. We decided to let it go because, firstly, we did not own it and, secondly, we would have placed our lives in jeopardy if we tried to retrieve it.

         To have that reporter carrying on as if this were a great misdemeanour just staggered me. He had no concept of what goes on in these situations. CARE Australia was asked to respond to a disaster situation at a moment's notice. That is what these organisations do. They go into a situation where there are no lines of communication, no radio, no tents, no covering and no food. To then be very objective about it back here in the comfort of an air-conditioned studio and pontificate about the lack of structure is just beyond comprehension. Surely the reporter could have given CARE Australia the opportunity to appear on the program and be questioned.

         Instead, what has happened is that that slur has been cast, and it reflects on every other aid organisation as well. As you and I know, Mr President, when you are dealing with the public there is always that section of the community that says, `They're all rorting it for themselves. Why should we give money to the starving and people in disaster situations? They brought it upon themselves. We have all these terrible problems in Australia; surely the money should stay in Australia.'

Go over to Northbourne Avenue and have a look at what is going on there. CARE Australia is leasing a couple of floors in a building on Northbourne Avenue.

         CARE Australia cannot screen the people who apply to go into these situations. They are all volunteers.

Mr President, tell me how you can provide security when you are surrounded by 200,000 people, with a lot of them being armed. How do you provide security? This person complained that that area I was in got shot up a couple of weeks after I was there. I mentioned it in the Senate a couple of weeks ago. Of course it got shot up.

How are you going to provide security?' They said, `We're Toronto police. We have been trained in security.' I asked them whether they were armed, and they said, `Oh, no. We are not armed.' I told them that they would not be able to provide security, and they scoffed at me. A quarter of an hour later I heard that they had gone five minutes up the road and been held up by the Zairean military, who relieved them of their watches, wallets, passports and the works.

         —Tonight I pay tribute to a close friend and, as of today, a former colleague, Dr John Hewson, who has announced his retirement from the seat of Wentworth. John Hewson will probably be remembered as the man who sought to introduce from opposition the most dramatic reforms to the Australian economy in various areas of social policy that had ever been pressed in our history and who failed not because of a failure of those policies but because of a failure to convince the Australian public of the merit of those policies in the face of the most dishonest campaign of scaremongering that has ever been known.

         John Hewson's approach to life was probably encapsulated in Fightback. It was aimed at providing everyone with a fair go, with opportunity, with equality of access to everything in Australia. He was not in favour, as he said so eloquently today in his farewell speech in the House of Representatives, of governments telling people what they could and could not do. He was in favour of people being entitled to do what they wanted to do, with of course the limits being only to the extent to which their freedom to do those things interfered with the freedom of others. His creed, which he underlined today, was supremacy of the individual. That, of course, is the underlying creed behind the coalition parties, in particular the Liberal Party.

         I commend John Hewson on his farewell speech today. There are a couple of matters I do not agree with him about. For example, I did not agree with him about the way his outstanding policy was presented at the last election. I have to admit, I did not agree with the way that outstanding recipe for rescue of Australia was abandoned so hurriedly after the last election, because of the way in which the government had so dishonestly destroyed the policy's chances of being accepted by the Australian public. I believed then and I believe now that abandoning Fightback in that way at that time was not appropriate; it was most unfortunate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe that had John Hewson been able to retain the essence of Fightback he would have gained, if you like, a greater status and the status he deserved in political life. But, unfortunately, that abandoning of Fightback meant that he was subjected once again to a series of unfair and often dishonest attacks as no longer standing for anything. The fact is that John Hewson has always stood for the supremacy of the  individual. As I said, while Fightback was a manifestation of that principle, there are other ways of supporting that view. John Hewson was always in his leadership promoting policies that maintained that supremacy of the individual.

         He said in his speech today that he was, if you like, left of centre on social matters and to the right of centre on economic matters. To an extent, I disagree with his own analysis of himself. He was and is a genuine believer in individual freedom. Believers in individual freedom would naturally believe in freedom in social matters. If that puts you to the left of the spectrum, too bad; it seems to me to be an absurd definition of `left'. If the same belief in the same principle puts you to the right on economic matters, that is equally absurd. John Hewson is a genuine Liberal; he believes in the rights of the individual. There are many of us on this side who support John Hewson's approach to politics—that is, a belief in individual freedom. If that means being classified on the left on social matters and on the right on economic matters, so be it.

         I totally agree with John Hewson's view that he needed a mandate on Fightback, that he had to get public support as evidenced at the ballot box before he could introduce such an essential, albeit radical, set of changes. He could not have in any honesty gone to the electorate denying what he was going to do and then seek to do it, apart from the fact that this chamber would not have allowed it to happen because we would have had here a group of people with, for whatever reason, the capacity to block federal legislation. They would not have had that capacity had we received a mandate to introduce the Fightback reforms which, among other things, included a massive reduction in the cost of living in rural areas in particular; massive benefits to those industries which are major employers in Australia and which depend on overseas markets; and massive improvement for our capacity to compete in the world.

         It is a tragedy that John Hewson's master plan for Australia's recovery, for Australia's role in the year 2000 and the 21st Century, was rejected. Instead of his decency in that election campaign, we got deception from the other side. Instead of truth, we got trumped up lies. Instead of facts, we got falsity and fear. Instead of honesty, we got dishonesty. They were the essential differences between the campaign that John Hewson ran at the last election and the campaign of deception and dishonesty. In his speech today, the Prime Minister could not prevent himself from taking a cheap shot at the opposition—at a time, surely, when it was appropriate to comment properly and decently on the very significant role that John Hewson has played in politics, economics and economic politics in Australia in recent years.

         One of my disagreements, however, with John Hewson is his continual stressing that he was more interested in policy than politics. I agree. He went into the last election with an outstanding policy and all that countered him was dishonest politics. But politics is not necessarily dishonest—it is only the way the government plays it. In fact, politics is the art of the achievable. To that extent, when John Hewson says,  `I wasn't a very good politician, but I was good at creating policy,' he is probably right. But I do not think he should downgrade the role of politics. It is my earnest wish that John Hewson had been a better politician—in other words, someone better able to make his outstanding objectives more achievable.

         In conclusion, John Hewson has left a remarkable mark on Australian politics—a far more lasting, effective and positive mark than the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could ever hope to leave. I send my very kindest regards to Carolyn, Tim, Micah and Rachel. I have known John Hewson for almost 20 years. He was a constituent of mine when I was the member for Macarthur. I have nothing but the highest regard for him, for his ability and for his credibility. I wish him all the very best in his future endeavours and I am certain he will be successful.

        (1) The major Government program to improve energy efficiency in the industrial sector is the National Energy Management Program (NEMP), which is operated by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Principal activities of this program involve facilitation of energy audits, conduct of industry studies, and dissemination of advisory booklets, educational videos and information on internationally available energy technologies. In addition, the Commonwealth participates in joint projects with the States through NEMP. The main projects for industry currently involve investigation of the prospects for energy equipment and a review of energy auditing and energy management training programs for industry.

        The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (CEPA) operates a cleaner production program consisting of workshops, a research initiative and a demonstration program. Between 1994 and 1996, ten firms will participate in a demonstration program of before and after energy audits, based on the introduction of an energy management plan by a consultant. The research component will be based on a whole-life-cycle approach to the manufacture of several products, including energy consumption.

        Australia's response to climate change is coordinated and implemented through the National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS). The NGRS was always intended to be a phased approach to limiting Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The first phase, which we are currently in, focuses on no-regrets activities and improving our knowledge base. No-regrets is defined as measures that have other net benefits, or at least no net costs, besides limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Future phases will include a range of measures that take into account improvements in knowledge, the outcomes of the first phase, and key economic and international developments.

Over the last decade, policies have focused on diversifying our export base into the higher value and faster growing areas of world trade in manufactures and services. The policy agenda was reshaped immensely during the 1980s to enhance this transformation of our industrial structure. Attention shifted from a defensive approach based on border protection, to an outward looking program aimed at encouraging competitiveness, the achievement of best practice and sustained growth in exports.

        The Government's petroleum policy is to promote an efficient and competitive petroleum exploration and production industry. In January 1988, the Government deregulated the crude oil market and removed export restrictions on oil. Access to international markets gave local refiners more flexibility to lower costs, select feedstocks, increase efficiency and strengthen their competitive position. Producers are now able to operate with greater certainty with the freedom to supply oil at international prices.

        (23) A doubling or tripling of the world oil price is most unlikely in the short term. Short term increases in the world oil price, as illustrated in the dramatic price rises during the Gulf conflict, have a very marginal effect on any medium to long term economic indicators such as GDP, exports and inflation.

        For oil price rises to have a sustained effect on these indicators they would have to be long term trends and not simply market fluctuations. While such sustained price rises would have a considerable effect on the national economy they are not forecast to occur within the foreseeable future nor at a rate which would preclude the development of suitable policy responses. By being competitive, outward focused and innovative Australia can raise its potential rate of economic growth. Sustained high economic growth will generate the employment opportunities to get more Australians back to work. The Government has adopted several strategies to achieve this:

The Government does support, however, the export of medical services which may involve transplanted organs consistent with the policy of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC).

This did not constitute a formal referral and assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. The EPA recommended closer consideration of several issues, including: the ecological and cultural value of features of the Arun Valley; the availability of resources for regional conservation; the project's implications for endangered and other species; waste disposal issues; and the barrier effect of the dam on fish. Australia's Executive Director at the World Bank passed these comments to Bank management.
