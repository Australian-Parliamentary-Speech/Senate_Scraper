         This goes to the credibility of the government, the credibility of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the sense that they have interfered in the selection process in a way that has damaged Australia's standing in the art world. That is not simply my judgment: that is the judgment of many people, some of whom have been quoted in newspaper reports. Editorials have been prompted on the unfortunate nature of the ministerial intervention.

         It is clear, and has never been denied, that the selection panel appointed to find a new Director of the National Gallery of Australia on the retirement of Mrs Churcher at age 65 unanimously recommended Mr Lloyd. The Hon. Lionel Bowen, a former Labor Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, was chairman of that committee. The minister chose to ignore the recommendation. He says he never received that recommendation. Quite frankly, that may be the official truth but the unofficial lie because he asked not to be given that recommendation and so the department did not pass it on to him.

         This is an incredible situation. It is incredible on lots of scores. I and Senator Chapman have moved in this place amendments to various acts, including, I might say, the National Gallery Act, relating to the age limit of 65. In other words, had our amendments been passed, then this issue may never have arisen. But it has arisen and the fact is that a selection committee found unanimously that Mr Lloyd should be made the director.

         I have no comment, and I do not wish to comment, on whether that was a good or bad recommendation. What concerns me is the manner in which this government intervened in this process. It is all very well to say it is up to the minister to make the appointment. But we had a unanimous recommendation by a selection panel—in this case, as I said, chaired by a former Deputy Prime Minister of this country—which was ignored, which was treated with contempt and which has damaged the status of Mr Lloyd. What sort of position is he in now? Unanimously recommended, but unacceptable to this government.

There is no need for any extra preparation, I might say.

         The priority for the moment is to say, `What is the proper way to deal with this matter on a subsequent occasion?'

I do indicate that we will make every effort to make that an agreed matter that will take no further time. I cannot guarantee it, but I think we can do that, and I will seek to do that.

         Therefore, I do not know whether, Mr Acting Deputy President, you want me to suggest that that would be an amendment with regard to time relating to the motion of which Senator Alston has, in effect, given notice, or whether you will simply require us to vote on Senator Alston's motion and then move a subsequent one, or whether procedurally we are better to have Senator Alston's motion withdrawn and move a subsequent agreed motion to deal with the first item after the taking note of answers. Under any of those three procedures, I am sure we can take the procedural issues out of this debate and get to the substance, which I think, with a little bit of time and courtesy, we can then resolve quite simply.

         At the whips' meeting last night, Senator Bourne certainly raised the fact that she had had a copy of the resolution, but no-one else had a copy of the resolution, including myself and the opposition whip. Normally, whether it is a member of the government or a member of the opposition, unless a member sends a letter around to each whip seeking formality of a motion, we do not deal with it. If it is our member, I say, `No, we can't deal with it because he has not sent around the letter seeking formality.' So we do not deal with it. The same thing applies to someone in the opposition, and this applied on that occasion. We all agreed that we should defer it but that, if there was any change to the deferral, Senator Panizza was to come back and give us the information.

         I noted this morning that it was postponed on the printed `red', and that is what was decided at the whips' meeting last night. I had no communication with Senator Panizza or with anyone else in relation to the matter. So with Senator Baume moving the motion and then moving an amendment, it makes it very difficult for senators in this place to understand what it is about. Senator Bourne might know because she discussed the amendment with Senator Baume. We certainly did not discuss the amendment—and we do not know what the amendment is. My suggestion is to move the matter until after taking note of answers to questions. That is one way to resolve the matter and one way of showing courtesy towards procedures in the Senate.

         The Senate, indeed the whole parliament and informed people of Australia, have been for many years now enormously concerned about the transgressions against human rights in the country of Burma. In this chamber alone about 20 senators, at one time or another in the last seven years, have expressed very real concern at developments there, with the suspension of democracy and the persecution of the elected majority from the 1990 election and, in particular, of the leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Senator Hill and Senator Schacht have for many years expressed their concerns about developments in Burma.

          In 1993, two years ago, Senator Chamarette gave a notice of motion that eventually became a formal motion of this chamber. It was passed by all of us. With great conscience and without controversy, it was adopted. The terms of that motion drew attention to the lack of democracy and the transgression of human rights in Burma. As is our norm, the President of the Senate—and Senator Beahan was a former member of the Human Rights Subcommittee—passed on that resolution to the Burmese ambassador in Canberra, U Saw Tun.

          The ambassador replied. His reply was not to the satisfaction of the Senate. The reply is set out in the introduction to the report. The Senate did not allow the inadequate response from the representative of that country to be received and noted without comment. Accordingly, Senator Reid moved a motion, which was supported by all senators, that the original resolution and the response of the Burmese ambassador be referred to the Human Rights Subcommittee for inquiry and report. This was in March last year.

         Today, since the SLORC deprived the elected government of power in 1990, most of the gross human rights abuses committed by the Government result from that act of illegality, the opposition it has engendered and the systematic attempts of the SLORC to destroy the National League for Democracy and any political opposition to its rule. The Government lacks accountability; its rule is arbitrary; it has dispensed with a rule of law and has resorted to rule by decree. There has been little progress towards democracy.

          I would just like to make one final comment before Senator Margetts speaks. Senator Margetts has put in a dissenting report to this report. I feel I really ought to defend myself and other members of the committee. I do not believe that what Senator Margetts has put in her dissenting report is actually a dissent. I think we would all agree with pretty well everything she has put in it. It is a pity she is not on the Human Rights Subcommittee because I am sure she would have a lot of very interesting and good input, as we see by this report. I do not believe it is a dissenting report.

          I will just go through a couple of things she said. Her first recommendation is about ministerial level contact, which is already government policy and we mention that in the report. I think it is a good policy. I do not think there should be ministerial level contact except in very exceptional circumstances such as going to see Aung San Suu Kyi, which I think would be a good thing. Apart from that, no, I do not see why there should be any ministerial level contact and I do not think anybody else on the committee does either. I think that fact came out quite clearly in our committee's deliberations.

          Recommendation No. 5 is one of the recommendations of our last report. It would have been a very good idea to have put it into this report. I wish we had. It is one of our recommendations, and we agree with it. The country economic brief on Burma should be withdrawn. We deal with it under chapter 6. We disagreed with that country economic brief.

          I will finish by saying that there was little disagreement in the evidence on the way that Burma should be handled. I hope that the government and the opposition, as a possible future government, will take a great deal of notice of this. Last week, I was at a symposium on Burma, as Senator Chamarette was. I was a bit surprised by the comments made there about Burma by a member of the opposition. I hope that the foreign minister in the next government—be it the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), a member of the opposition, another member of the current government, or me—will take everything in this document into account when they decide what Australia's view will be on Burma in the next government. This is a very comprehensive document about what ought to be, and currently is, Australia's view on Burma.

          But support is not always possible. As someone from the government said yesterday, `We only have 19 backbenchers, Senator, to attend all the committees.' I said, `Talk to me about it.

          For instance, there was a difference of opinion on whether or not it is better to have engagement at a ministerial level at forums. The trouble is, if Burma is invited to a number of the forums, including ASEAN, such an invitation legitimises the SLORC government. That really sends the wrong signal—the same kind of signal as that sent by a former Prime Minister who travelled to that country. That trip was used considerably by SLORC and waved around as a symbol of their legitimacy.

          There is still an Austrade office in Burma. Despite all the rhetoric about Australia not trading with Burma, I can see no reason why we should have both an Austrade office and two staff.

          On the reference to an inquiry to create a code of practice, such a reference to the subcommittee might have been good. However, it is an effort to make a positive contribution for the future and it is something that may be picked up and worked on by government—and we hope that it will be. It is more a qualifying statement and a matter of degree. It is more a case of being a little stronger in some of the recommendations because of concern that the wrong interpretation may be taken by SLORC through limited engagement being interpreted as a recognition of legitimacy by the SLORC government in its current form.

During the year it has tabled seven reports, which was two more than in the previous financial year. The most significant report tabled was report 331, which contains results of the committee's review of the package of three bills intended to replace the Audit Act 1991 and of the committee's consideration of the government's proposal to establish an audit committee of parliament.

Senators will know that some 13 months after the tabling of the committee's report the three bills and the motion to establish an audit committee are still to be debated in parliament. They contain a number of contentious issues: firstly, the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct performance audits in government business enterprises; the extent of the parliament's involvement in the appointed process for auditors-general and the most important form for an audit committee; and, finally, certain provisions relating to the disclosure of sensitive information.

          The committee remains of the view that the recommendations in report 331 are sensible and constructive solutions that should be further considered and potentially taken up. The parliament has before it a rare opportunity to modernise the Commonwealth's financial management and accountability framework. If we cannot reach agreement on the outstanding matters in the next two weeks and enact the legislation before the end of this session in parliament, the opportunity will pass.

However, whatever the eventual outcome of the debates in the Senate and the House, the committee considers that its review demonstrates that the parliamentary committees can play a valuable role and that contributions to the legislative process can help ensure that legislation is of the highest quality.

          A major highlight of the committee's year was a visit to New Zealand as part of the committee exchange program established by the Australian and New Zealand parliaments. The centrepiece of the visit was a meeting between the committee delegation and the New Zealand parliament's equivalent of the JCPA, the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The meeting provided the delegation with an overseas perspective on some of the common issues facing the two committees. Discussions evolved around the role of committees in the New Zealand parliament; New Zealand's experience of public sector reforms; and the relationship between parliaments and their auditors-general. I must say on a personal note that it was particularly valuable in terms of our discussions on accrual accounting and fiscal responsibility, which are matters which we are currently considering.

         On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, it gives me great pleasure today to table the committee's 340th report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Cash Matters: Cash Management in the Commonwealth
         </emphasis>
         . This report is the result of the committee's review of two reports presented to the parliament by the Auditor-General. The first report was Audit Report No. 22,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Efficiency Audit,  Cash Management in Commonwealth Government Departments
         </emphasis>
         and the second report was Audit Report No. 10,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Efficiency Audit, Cash Management in Commonwealth Government Departments
         </emphasis>
         . Both audit reports resulted from the same performance audit, the first being an interim report and the second being the final report.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The committee's decision to review these reports was influenced by the same reasons which caused the Auditor-General to conduct the audit: firstly, that the Commonwealth manages huge amounts of cash each year; and secondly, that any improvements in cash management practices would potentially result in substantial dollar savings. In a nutshell, good cash management endeavours to match patterns of expenditure with patterns of revenue. In the Commonwealth, responsibility for this task is shared between individual agencies with deliver programs or collect revenues and the central economic agencies—the Department of Finance and the Treasury—which are involved in forecasting overall cash needs and engaging in short-term borrowing when cash holdings are predicted to be insufficient to cover forthcoming payments.

          When short-term borrowings are made, the Commonwealth incurs an interest expense known as public debt interest expenditure. In recent years, transactions to fund public debt interest have been the single biggest source of real growth in Commonwealth outlays. The budget papers for this financial year, 1995-96, show that the past two years have seen such expenditure grow from $6.6 billion to $10.08 billion this financial year. At the strategic level, good cash management involves the prompt banking of Commonwealth revenues and the development of payment schedules which recognise opportunity costs and revenue peaks.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The scale of the task is immense: in 1995-96 the Commonwealth's revenue is expected to total $110 billion, while outlays are expected to amount to $122 billion. Figures like this merely confirm that there is a need to pay special attention to cash management.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the revenue side, it is important that the Australian Taxation Office and the other revenue agencies have sophisticated systems in place to quickly process and bank incoming receipts, which in peak periods can amount to more than $1 billion per day.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the expenditure side, Commonwealth agencies need to pay far more attention than they have in the past to making payments in a way which not only meets the Commonwealth's program objectives but at the same time protects the Commonwealth's financial interests. This is true both of the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays and of the Commonwealth's payments to the states, which in this financial year amount to $34.2 billion, or a little less than one-third of the total outlays.

          The committee's current inquiry into the administration of specific purpose payments to the states has drawn attention to the significant cash management implications of these payments. There is ample evidence, for example, that by making special purpose payments before they are needed for program purposes, the states are able to invest the money and make significant interest windfalls. In effect, this is a form of hidden subsidy to the states. It is an issue I expect the committee to return to in the report of its SPP inquiry, which will be tabled before the end of the current parliamentary session.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another issue which is crucial for effective cash management is the need to accurately forecast cash flows. It is this activity which enables the containment of public debt interest expenditure. The committee has recommended the establishment of a series of cash forecasting benchmarks based on national and international best practice in both the public and private sectors. Treasury should also routinely monitor and evaluate its cash forecasting performance against these best practice benchmarks.

          There are also a great number of agency level functions which can have a marked aggregated impact across the Commonwealth. These agency level functions include: negotiation of prepayment terms, particularly for specific purpose payments to the states and territories; invoicing promptly for goods and services sold; expediting collection of amounts due; purchasing goods or services later without jeopardising program objectives; negotiating more favourable purchase payment terms; reducing the amount of inventory held; spreading payment terms; and paying invoices only when they fall due.

          The key message is that all agencies have a role in maximising the Commonwealth's cash management outcomes. Only efficient and effective management of these day-to-day functions by departments will achieve the levels of cash balances necessary to minimise borrowing and subsequently the net public debt interest cost to the Commonwealth.

          Commonwealth agencies maintain over 2,000—that is correct—bank accounts. It was of great concern to the committee that the Audit Office had discovered that several agencies were unaware of the number of accounts they maintained. It is an essential discipline that proper bank account records be kept. To do otherwise is an indicator of extreme laxity on the part of agency managers and exposes Commonwealth funds to significant risks.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In considering how cash management might be improved across all Commonwealth agencies, the committee came to the view that the potential for savings, the number of issues involved in good cash management and the absence of any whole of government monitoring or analysis pointed to the need for increased central focus in the Commonwealth, at least in the short term. Accordingly, the committee recommends in this report that Finance should play a more prominent role in providing guidance for line agencies as well as in the monitoring, analysis and reporting of cash management performance on a Commonwealth-wide basis. The central focus on cash management recommended in the report could result in Finance performing a corporate treasury function for the Commonwealth.

          One of the issues to emerge during the committee's review was whether or not the group of accounts maintained by the Commonwealth at the Reserve Bank and used for the targeting of cash balances was the most appropriate. Evidence provided to the committee suggested that in practice the target group of accounts has already been expanded by Treasury to include the overdraft group. As this wider group is the one which is used by the Reserve Bank to calculate the Commonwealth's interest bill, it seems logical to the committee that the target group should be formally expanded.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          An associated, and perhaps more important, issue is that of the level of balances in these target accounts. The government decided in 1989 that the average cumulative balances in the target accounts should be maintained in the $0-300 million range. The committee believes there is now scope to further refine this target range, towards the lower end, thus providing additional savings. The committee recommends that Finance and Treasury should discuss and agree on optimal cash balances or, alternatively, that the issue be resolved by a review process.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This leads me to the final issue. In the audit reports, the Auditor-General pointed to areas where better cooperation between Finance and Treasury could result in an improved cash management performance. Report 340 looks in more depth at this relationship between these two key central agencies. The report reflects the concerns of committee members that a number of important issues which appear to have been under discussion or review for some years have yet to be satisfactorily resolved.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It seems to the committee that better cooperation and communication between these two agencies could have seen a number of these issues resolved some time ago, with consequent benefit to the Commonwealth. Whilst both the committee and the Auditor-General acknowledge that there has been improvement in the working relationship between Finance and Treasury since the audit began, the committee believes there is scope for further cooperation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Given the range and significant nature of the issues requiring resolution, the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) should commission a high level review of cash management in the Commonwealth. The review team should: (a) have a chairman from the private sector with expertise in corporate Treasury functions; (b) consist of senior representatives from the Departments of Finance and the Treasury; (c) include a senior representative of the Australian National Audit Office as a member of the review team or as an observer; (d) focus on the cash management issues which remain unresolved; and (e) report within six months of being established.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee believes that such an externally-led review will enable a fresh perspective to be brought to the issues—a perspective unencumbered by inter-agency sensitivities. This is an important recommendation dealing with an important issue. The size of the Commonwealth's public debt interest bill and the potential savings which could flow from better cash management are too big to ignore.

        Over recent years there has been a trend by OECD national flag operators towards registering their vessels under open or international registers. These registers typically offer attractive taxation regimes and the ability to replace wholly national crews with lower-cost mixed nationality crews, predominantly from the developing countries.

        The Taylor Report found that, as a result of this changed overseas situation, the competitive gap between Australian ships and comparable overseas ships operated under international registers was about $2 million per ship per year.

        Accordingly, the Report recommended removal of the PAYE taxation cost element from Australia's international trading ships in order to match the position of overseas ship operators, whose crews are either exempt from PAYE taxation or where the taxation impact on crew costs is offset by other concessions.

        Mr President, the bill now before the Senate introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australian shipping industry employers, based on the notional PAYE taxation liabilities on the earnings of Australian-resident crew members on ships in Australia's international trading fleet.

        Clause 3 defines an eligible ship to mean an Australian-operated commercial trading ship with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tonnes or more.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 4 defines Australian-operated ship to include ships on demise charter to Australian entities, as well as ships owned by Australians.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 5 defines the meaning of international voyage. This is an important definition as time spent on international voyages is one of the key criteria for qualifying for the grant. Calls at intermediate Australian ports as part of an overall international voyage are permitted, provided any coastal cargo carried between Australian ports does not exceed the international cargo on board.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In clause 7 are to be found the general definitions such as "seafarer", "Australian-resident seafarer" and "seafarer berth".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These again are important definitions as the grant is only payable in respect of bona fide, duly qualified, seafarers who are ordinarily resident in Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, I would mention at this point that the term "seafarer berth" is used throughout in the bill in the sense of a crew position or job on the ship; rather than to simply mean a cabin or bed. By adopting the concept of the seafarer berth and using the notional tax on the award wages or enterprise agreement wages, as applicable, for that berth, the computation of the grant amount is reduced to a relatively straightforward calculation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Part 3 of the bill which covers clauses 8—12, contains the elements for establishing the entitlement to the grant and calculating the grant amount.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 8 sets the basic parameters for entitlement to the grant. Essentially, the grant is payable to the employer of the crew of an eligible ship, which has spent the requisite number of days in international trades.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 9 sets out the method of calculating the amount of grant unit for each seafarer berth. Factored into the grant calculation is the number of days in the year that each berth is actually occupied by an Australian-resident seafarer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore, Mr President, if any berths are occupied by non-residents or if any berths are unoccupied during a repair or lay-up period, or because the ship is sailing short-handed, then the grant units calculated for those berths will be reduced proportionately.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The grant amount is simply the sum of the grant units for the seafarer berths on the ship.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 10 establishes the eligible employment period, which is the period in respect of which the grant is paid. This clause also determines that the grant is to be paid to the actual employer of the crew and that the employer must be an Australian entity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of ship operators in Australia appoint a management company to look after the day to day running of the ship, including crew related matters such as paying salaries and making the PAYE tax deductions. In such circumstances it would be the management company that is the actual employer, not the operator.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because of the notional linkage between the grant and crew PAYE income tax, it follows that the employer of the crew is the appropriate recipient of the grant. Clearly if the employer and the ship operator are not the same entity, they will need to reach a commercial agreement on the allocation of the grant monies once paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the employer employs the crew on a ship for the whole year then the "eligible employment period" is the whole year. If the employer only employs the crew for a part year, then the "eligible employment period" would only apply to the part year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These eligible employment periods are not transferable. For example, if during the period covered by the first employer the ship is wholly engaged in international trading and during the period covered by the second employer the ship is mainly engaged in coastal trading, the international trading days accrued by the first employer could not be transferred to the second employer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 11 sets out the formula for calculating the minimum number of days in international trading to qualify for the grant.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, you will note that the formula excludes non-operational days of repair, maintenance or lay-up from the minimum days calculation. There will thus be no advantage for an operator to obtain repairs or lay-up the ship overseas simply in order to accumulate more international trading days.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, once a ship has crossed the minimum days international trading threshold, then the grant is payable in respect of the berth occupancy over the full eligible employment period, which would include any days of repairs, maintenance or lay-up.

        Its purpose is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the ALRC Report No 2 on Criminal Investigation, submitted as long ago as 1975, and reaffirmed in greater detail, after a thorough examination of the issues, in the Fifth Interim Report of the Review of the Commonwealth Criminal Law in 1991. Even in 1975, the ALRC was of the view that `the probative value of this kind of evidence is such that it ought to be obtainable and admissible, provided that enforceable safeguards for the accused are built into the system'. Whatever else may be said about forensic evidence, nobody says that it should be ignored, and nobody says that it should be rejected as a tool of law enforcement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law noted that there was no general Commonwealth law dealing with the medical or forensic examination of a person in lawful custody, and that the majority of State and Territory laws merely authorised a medical examination where reasonable grounds exist to believe that an examination of a person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence involved (cf s.353A(2) Crimes Act (NSW), s.236 of the Criminal Code (WA), and s.81 of the Summary Offences Act 1953 (SA)).

        In such general provisions, doubt exists as to the extent of the power, even on the basic question of whether or not samples may be taken without consent. The recent Fernando case in NSW clearly demonstrates this. In that case, the two men charged with the murder of nurse Sandra Hoare, refused to supply blood samples and challenged the NSW legislation. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal held that the legislation did not in fact authorise the taking of blood samples without consent.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following this decision, an amendment was quickly made to enable blood, hair or saliva samples to be taken in NSW without consent, although no additional safeguards were added at that time. Indeed, the fact that safeguards vary between jurisdictions is of concern. Some of the current legislation contains virtually no safeguards at all. Other acts have basic protections such as examination by a medical practitioner, limitation on the presence of persons of the opposite sex during the examination, and provision to the person of a copy of the report. Even the requirement for a court order is not consistently provided where there is lack of consent or where the use of force is required. For example, none is required in South Australia or Western Australia.

        The need for consistent, and if possible uniform, laws throughout Australia, especially those laws which profoundly affect the rights of Australian citizens in the criminal justice system, has been increasingly recognised during the life of this Government. We have seen the passage of the foundation provisions of the Model Criminal Code, which is a major step in modelling a co-operative scheme for removing basic inconsistencies in principles of criminal responsibility throughout Australia. The Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Act 1994 performed the same function in relation to arrest and search powers.

        The time has now come for the Commonwealth to grasp the nettle which has been enjoying largely uncontrolled growth for more than twenty years and apply the same principled and balanced regulation to the role of forensic science in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. It is clearly wrong, when, as a nation, we are rightly proud of our record of freedom and justice in a world where, sadly, neither of those things can be taken for granted, that different rules may apply to different groups of Australians depending purely on where they live, some of those rules being uncertain or oppressive.

        The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (which is the body working towards a uniform criminal Code to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions) prepared a model Forensic Procedures Bill which was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals, representing many interests—defence lawyers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, academics, law societies, bar councils, civil liberties groups, human rights organisations, women's groups, victims groups, legal aid organisations, government Departments and interested individuals. When the Commonwealth commenced its own consultation process, a revised bill was again circulated. Over 60 submissions were received, analysed and, as far as practicable, recommendations were incorporated into the bill. Few submissions advocated the complete abandonment of the exercise. Most were concerned with the striking of the correct balance between the civil liberties of the individual and the requirement for the police to have adequate investigative powers.

        Both the Model Criminal Code Officers Committees Bill and the Commonwealth Bill are modelled on the Victorian legislation, which, in turn implemented the recommendations of the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation.

        I will now describe the effect of the bill and the proposed government amendments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, I wish to clarify that nothing in this bill prevents the police requesting non-suspects to undergo forensic procedures, as sometimes occurs, in order to narrow the field of investigation. The proposed legislation applies only to suspects as defined in the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unlike most of the current state legislation, but consistently with the Victorian provisions, the Commonwealth Bill makes a clear distinction between intimate and non-intimate forensic procedures. Intimate forensic procedures consist of the external examination of the genital or anal area, the buttocks, in the case of a female, the breasts, and the taking of an intimate sample (ie blood, saliva, a buccal swab, pubic hair, and samples taken by swabs, washing, scraping or suctioning or the taking of a cast or photograph or lifting by tape from previously described intimate areas). The proposed legislation does not authorise any internal examinations except of the mouth. All procedures must be carried out by persons appropriately qualified for the particular procedure.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Non-intimate procedures relate to those parts of the body not defined as intimate, the taking of non-intimate samples from non-intimate parts of the body, including from a nail or under a nail, hair other than pubic hair, photographs and casts and, in some circumstances, finger prints, foot prints, toe prints and palm prints. However where a person is in lawful custody the applicable law for the taking of fingerprints, footprints and palmprints is found in Part I AA of the Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to those safeguards providing appropriate protection of a person's privacy and dignity which are common to all forensic procedures (of which I will speak later) unless a suspect gives his or her informed consent after receiving all relevant information, including the right to refuse (all of which must be recorded) no intimate procedure may be performed except by order of a magistrate. However, if a person is in lawful custody, non-intimate procedures may be carried out by appropriately qualified persons as ordered by a constable. These orders are subject to the same conditions as apply when a magistrate makes an order, and can only be made if the non-intimate procedures can be conducted within the custodial time limits provided in Part IC of the Crimes Act. Special procedures providing support and safeguards apply to children, adults incapable of comprehending the proceedings or giving informed consent, and to Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.

        The bill also specifies that, in considering the justification of any order, the magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence relevant to the offence, against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect.

The criteria to be taken into account are the same in each case.

        Normally suspects will be present and able to contest any application for such an order. However, urgent interim orders may be sought from a magistrate to carry out a forensic procedure which must be done without delay, for example where the sample to be taken is of a highly volatile or perishable nature. Such applications may be made by any electronic means but the suspect and his or her lawyer (or interview friend for those categories of persons warranting special support) must be given an opportunity to communicate with the magistrate. The magistrate may make appropriate orders, including arrangements for the final hearing of the application. The applicant must record full details of the application and send a copy to the magistrate. If that record does not accord with the magistrate's record in all material respects, the order is taken to have had no effect. Any sample obtained as a result of the interim application may not be analysed unless it is perishable. If it is analysed, the results may not be disclosed to any person unless a final order is obtained. If the final order is not granted, the sample must be destroyed and, if any analysis of the sample was done, all copies of the results must be given to the suspect.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The criteria, which I just quoted in some detail, set a very high standard and the magistrate must be satisfied these are met before making an order for procedures to be performed without consent. There must be evidence before the magistrate providing reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed the offence. If the magistrate is satisfied on this ground, then he or she must also be satisfied that the procedure is likely to produce probative evidence and, even if it is, that the conduct of the procedure is otherwise justified. That means that the forensic procedure cannot be sought by the police merely as a fishing expedition.

         Under Commonwealth law, arrest is a step of last resort. As well as the common law criteria for arrest, other conditions apply. Unless a constable, or in the case of a warrant, a magistrate, believes on reasonable grounds that proceeding by summons would be ineffective to ensure the appearance of the person before the court, or to prevent further criminal acts, including the destruction or fabrication of evidence and harassment of witnesses, a lawful arrest cannot be made.

         However, apart from strictly legal justifications, I believe that it is quite reasonable, in the interests of effective law enforcement, to request, and if necessary require, suspects to undertake relatively simple procedures either to exonerate themselves or to provide evidence that could confirm their involvement in a relevant offence. For example a man who is a prime suspect in a rape case may decline to provide a sample of saliva or blood to enable a DNA match with semen found on the victim. There is little difference in principle between evidence obtained from conducting forensic procedures and evidence obtained by means of a search warrant. I simply do not see why, as in the Hyland Case in Tasmania, it should be thought justifiable for police to have to wait 10 years, and for the victim's family to suffer an unresolved situation for 10 years, because a suspect refuses to consent to a forensic procedure and the law has no power to require him to do so.

        However, in my view, a most potent safeguard in the present bill is provided by the legislative barrier to admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. If there is any breach, the prosecution must justify to the court that there are
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        good reasons why the statutory scheme was not followed. In such a case the probative value of the evidence will not, by itself, justify its admission. The bill indicates a number of matters which the court must take into account in considering whether to admit such evidence, including the gravity of the contravention and whether it was intentional or reckless. Evidence is also inadmissible by the prosecution, with no discretion on the part of the court, where material was not destroyed in the circumstances required by the legislation. There are comprehensive requirements for the destruction of forensic material and inadmissibility of evidence derived from it, where proceedings have not been commenced within a certain period or where they have been finally determined.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should like to mention three further points which have caused some concern.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first is the provision which permits the fact of a person's refusal to comply with any reasonable direction for the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a person, given by an authorised person, to be admissible in any proceedings against the person in a court, provided he or she has first been warned of that possibility. That is, admissibility is not limited to proceedings for non-compliance with a court order, or obstructing an officer in the course of his or her duty, but is admissible in the proceedings for the offence for which the forensic procedure was required. Accordingly, it is open to the jury to draw an inference from the person's refusal to permit the taking of the sample, which could involve the conclusion that the person had reason to fear the result of the procedure. One could, no doubt, imagine innocent reasons for resisting certain procedures, and these could be cogently put to the jury by the defence, with supporting evidence. However, I believe that where serious offences carrying heavy penalties are involved, without some serious consequence rendering non-compliance of doubtful value, a mere non-compliance offence with the usual low penalty would be an ineffective deterrent It could defeat the value of the coercive provisions in the legislation—the penalty a price willingly paid by a guilty suspect to avoid the availability of damning evidence of the more serious offence and there would be little point in proceeding with this legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second matter is the retention and use of forensic material. There are two aspects to this. The bill provides for a database to be set up and maintained for statistical purposes. That database must be designed in such a way that the information contained in it cannot be used to identify any individual on whom a forensic procedure was carried out. Such a database will be used for a purely scientific purpose to develop norms against which the degree of probability that any particular forensic material came from a particular person can be assessed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second aspect is the requirement that information about a person obtained from a forensic sample taken under the bill may not be recorded or retained in a personal records system if that sample is required by the bill to be destroyed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, nothing in this bill affects the taking, retention, or use of a forensic sample, or of information from that sample, where that is authorised by another law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. It is not intended to repeal any other Commonwealth provisions that might exist—although these can if necessary be revised in due course. Nor is it intended to create any inconsistency with existing State/Territory provisions. It is expected that these will be revised as State/Territory legislation is developed to build up a national uniform scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, I will briefly address criticisms that forensic evidence in recent years has fallen into disrepute, that it is not infallible, and that juries, blinded with science, may give disproportionate weight to evidence of dubious validity. However, as I noted previously, no-one suggests that its use should be abandoned and almost everyone acknowledges its value when properly used.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All I wish to say on that issue, is that the present bill is concerned only with the procedural aspects of collecting and using forensic material. The procedures which are currently available are subject to varying, often minimal, safeguards. This bill aims to balance the need of law enforcement to have access to an investigative resource, which is constantly being developed and refined, against the right of the individual to live free of arbitrary intrusion by the state and free of arbitrary interference with his or her physical integrity and dignity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The products of the procedures provided by the bill, like the products of any other investigative technique, are weighed and evaluated as they pass through each of the filters provided by our criminal justice system: first by the investigators themselves, then by the prosecutors and their experts, then by the defence and its experts, and finally by the jury. Like all other evidence, it is subjected to the rigours of the adversary procedure. Experts are examined and cross-examined, the judge directs the jury on the applicable law and the standard of proof which must be satisfied, and the jury considers its verdict, taking into account all other evidence admitted as relevant in the proceedings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the view that this bill is bad and should be rejected because forensic evidence is less than 100 per cent reliable were applied to all evidence, the criminal courts would be cleared and no-one would ever be convicted. The standard of proof that is applied by the jury in a criminal trial is `beyond reasonable doubt'. That is a high test. In my opinion we must do the best we can with the means currently available to us. We must neither sacrifice civil liberties for expediency, nor reject available investigative techniques because they fall short of the standard of perfection.

        The only financial implications arising from the bill involve minor costs associated with training which will be absorbed in the normal budgets of relevant agencies.

        The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 puts in place the necessary legislative framework for the sale of the Commonwealth Government's remaining 50.4 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), as announced in the 1995-96 Budget on 9 May 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth's decision to sell its remaining Commonwealth Bank shareholding reflects the significant changes which have occurred in the Australian financial system since the early 1980's and the changes which have occurred in the Commonwealth Bank since 1990.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The deregulation of the financial system and the increased competition within the Australian banking sector in particular, has significantly weakened the case for majority Government ownership of a commercial bank. The Australian banking sector today is significantly more competitive, efficient and responsive to the needs of consumers and the Australian economy in general than was the case when this Government came to office in 1983.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no compelling reason why the Government should continue to hold a majority shareholding of a commercial bank in this environment. This view is shared by various State Governments which have recently privatised or announced plans for the privatisation of State Banks. For example, the State Bank of New South Wales was sold to Colonial Mutual in late 1994, the Bank of South Australia was sold to the Advance Bank on 1 August 1995 and the Western Australian Government recently announced its intention to sell a controlling interest in BankWest to the Bank of Scotland.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth Bank has undergone significant change since 1990. It is now a public company operating under the Corporations Law with a substantial private sector shareholding. This follows the two public share offers in 1991 and 1993, which resulted in around 49.6 per cent of the Bank's shares being held by both retail and institutional investors.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Despite being the majority shareholder, it has been the Commonwealth's long standing policy not to interfere in the commercial operations of the Commonwealth Bank.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The sale of the Commonwealth's 50.4 per cent Commonwealth Bank shareholding will provide a number of important benefits. The sale will contribute to the Commonwealth achieving a budget surplus in 1995-96, significantly reducing the need to raise public debt, to the benefit of all Australians and will place the Commonwealth Bank on a similar commercial and legal footing to that of its competitors. The sale will also provide an excellent opportunity for existing or prospective small shareholders to acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank.

        The bill provides appropriate transitional measures for the Commonwealth guarantee applying to the CBA's liabilities consistent with the Treasurer's Budget night announcement. These arrangements ensure that the CBA's depositors, creditors and superannuation fund members are treated fairly as a result of the Commonwealth's sale of its shares. The arrangements are broadly comparable with those applying to the sale of the State Bank of New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The transitional arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the CBOSC commence at the `Effective Date', which is defined as the time at which the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding falls to below 50 per cent, or 9 May 1996, whichever is the later. The transitional period for which the guarantee applies depends upon whether the liability is a demand deposit, a term deposit or any other liability.

        The bill provides an exemption from the possible application of section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the deductibility of losses on bad debts. This provision seeks to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's shares. This is irrespective of whether the sale is structured in such a way that an intermediary or intermediaries are interposed between the Commonwealth as seller and the buyers of the Commonwealth's shares.

        The bill also exempts various transactions associated with the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares from most State and Territory taxes, levies, fees, duties and charges. This measure is intended to enhance the attractiveness of the sale to potential purchasers. The Commonwealth, however, has indicated its in-principle support for providing relevant States and Territories with an ex-gratia payment compensating them for stamp duty forgone in relation to the sale.

        That the Telecommunications (Service Providers Class Licence) Direction No. 1 of 1995, made under subsection 204(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, be disallowed.

       The government's intention for the Telecommunications (Service Providers Class Licence) Direction No. 1 of 1995 is that it will promote competition, diversity of content, technical innovation and new investment in broadband services delivered by cable. I am moving this motion of disallowance because it is the Australian Democrats' firm belief that the direction will achieve none of these aims.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The direction will not promote competition. Instead, it leaves crucial decisions about competing pay operators' rights of access in the hands of the cable owner duopoly. The direction will not promote diversity of content. What new content industry producers will have the confidence to invest, if access to the main delivery systems is at the whim of the cable owners. The direction cannot promote technical innovation if new services cannot gain access to the level of infrastructure they need at prices which are both stable and reasonable. The direction will not promote new investment in broadband services if those services cannot be assured of the access they need to the paying public.

        The reality is that the direction is simply the government's compromise response to the very clever legal device Optus used to ensure that, when it built its broadband network, Telstra could not demand access to that network. Optus determined that it, as carrier, would install and maintain the broadband network, but the network would be owned by Optus Vision and, because Optus Vision would not be a carrier, it would not be covered by the rules requiring carriers to give other carriers access to their networks.

        Austel's report on the Optus Vision structure, issued in November 1994, found the structure was legal under the Telecommunications Act. But, in Austel's view, the structure's avoidance of carrier obligations did not fit comfortably within the pro-competitive spirit of the act or the government's policy intentions. Austel's report recommended that Optus Vision should follow the same rules as carriers. Optus Vision should permit carriers and competing service providers to connect to its network on the same basis as required for carrier networks, and Optus Vision should be subject to the same pricing principles and carrier arbitration procedures as the carriers.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The government's response—this direction—falls short of those recommendations. Instead, the direction created a new creature, a carrier associate. Carrier associates have fewer obligations on them than the carriers whose networks they own and control. They are free of the pricing rules covering carriers; they are free of the obligations to provide access to other pay TV operators, which are very widely defined in the direction; and they are free from the threat of an Austel direction to provide defined levels of access to their networks. Not surprisingly, Telstra's response was to immediately create its own carrier associate and gain similar exemptions from carrier responsibility for its broadband network or, rather, the network it is building and then handing to its carrier associate.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The rationale for the direction does make some sense, but not altogether. The amount of capital required for building broadband networks is in the billions of dollars. Carriers need at least some initial period to protect what will be small, but hopefully growing, revenue streams from the networks, and requiring carriers to give open access to a rival would clearly threaten that revenue source. It would be like insisting that every time a developer builds a new shopping centre, he or she must give rival developers access to the new shops. And with the rival's access to new shops goes the loss of profits and the rents necessary for our developer to build the shops in the first place.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The reality is that the networks being built are not like shopping centres. They are being built using the carrier's powers and immunities from compliance with local planning rules and state and territory laws for the protection of national heritage sites and for the protection of the environment. Our hypothetical developer must comply with all relevant rules and regulations to build that new shopping centre—carriers do not. The increasing public outcry against new telecommunications towers and facilities means that these new networks are being built at a great cost to the public.

        There is a second and much more important difference between our hypothetical shopping centre and the broadband networks. One shopping centre more or less makes almost no difference to national goals, but the broadband networks will be Australia's information highways to the future and central to Australia's entry into the information age. The broadband highways have the potential to bring new education and health services to areas starved of those services. They can provide avenues for new creative Australian talent. They will be a major factor in Australia's international competitiveness.

        As both the Broadband Service Export Group and the government's Creative Nation statement stressed, the information highways are essential for the development of new multimedia content. Clearly, access to those highways is the key for Australian success. Yet the direction governing access to those highways falls short of those national goals. It recognises the legal device of carrier associate and, with that, the evasion by carriers of their full responsibilities for access under the act.

        The Democrats do recognise the commercial reality of large investment decisions being made by both carrier associates based on the set of rules provided by the direction, and we are not seeking to jeopardise the very large sums being spent on broadband networks. What we are seeking through this motion is for the government to change the direction's rules to strike a better balance between the need for commercial certainty and the need for access to Australia's new information highways.

        Specifically, the Democrats have three major concerns about the direction, and we hope they can be addressed. Our first criticism of the direction is its definition of `pay TV service'. The significance of the definition is that carrier associates must provide access to their networks, except to other pay TV services. Therefore, the wider the definition of `pay TV service', the wider the exemption from that access.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Under the direction, `pay TV service' includes not only subscription television broadcasting services but also subscription narrowcasting services and services which provide movies on demand. Our concern is that there are many services, including community and local services, or very specialised, niche narrowcasting services, which are of no commercial threat to carrier associates, yet which could be refused access to carrier associates' networks under the current `pay TV service' definition.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        We understand that both Optus Vision and Telstra Multimedia are developing proposals under which new community and independent content providers can gain access to their broadband networks. To the extent that results in access to more diverse independent programming, we welcome those proposals. Our second concern is the lack of an unbundling requirement to carrier associate networks. Austel can now require carriers to supply specific levels of functionality or transmission capacity to service providers after an inquiry into the feasibility and the impact of making such a direction. Carrier associates are not subject to the same unbundling provisions, even though the networks in question are built by carriers under carrier powers and immunities.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Finally, there are very limited remedies for people seeking access to broadband capacity but refused by carrier associates. Austel has a very general power to promote competition in the telecommunications industry but it does not have specific powers to arbitrate over access disputes or direct that access be provided to carrier associates' networks on fair and reasonable terms.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        One solution we strongly urge to the government would be to mandate that each carrier associate set aside a percentage of channel capacity for open access. The danger in not doing so is that, otherwise, carrier associates can insist that all their channel capacity be taken and, therefore, claim they cannot provide access for independent content or service providers. There is no appeal mechanism which could test that claim.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Also, by setting a percentage of capacity for open access, the government can ensure that as broadband network capacity is increased, capacity available for open access is also increased. Open access cannot be seen as a threat to carrier associates. If the press is to be believed, the carrier associates, Optus Vision and Telstra Multimedia, are nowhere near filling the 60 plus channels available on the coaxial cable which they are now installing. Indeed, the fact that Foxtel was willing to go to court to confirm its ability to carry all five free to air television channels must indicate that there is spare capacity somewhere on their network.

        What mandated open access may well do is encourage new, independent content and encourage service providers to develop their products and their services. Surely, more independent providers seeking more access can only result in more money in the carrier associates' coffers. We are disappointed that the coalition has already telegraphed that it is not going to support this motion. Their press release calls our motion `well-intentioned but misguided'. While I agree with the first part of the description, I have to disagree with the second. This motion is not misguided.

        We recognise that if the direction were disallowed, there would be no rules governing carrier associates' behaviour, rather than the flawed ones now operating. What disallowance would do is force the government to develop new and better rules, something which Senator Alston has tried to do in the past—I might add—and which would strike a better balance between the very understandable and genuine need for carrier associates to have regulatory certainty when making massive investments and the equally important policy objective of having more open access to ensure more diversity of service and content providers.

        The other very important objective in moving this motion is to signal now that the Democrats believe this carrier associate regime should end when the direction says it will, in 1997. We note the government's statement in both the telecommunications policy principle post-1997 and the explanatory memorandum that the direction might be continued until 1999 if there is `appropriate competition' in pay television delivery using cable.

        Given the proposed Australis-Foxtel merger and the more precarious position of Optus Vision as a result of the merger, it is extremely difficult to even contemplate there being anything like the kind of competition in cable which could justify an extension of this direction. In this we do agree with the coalition's call for an immediate government commitment that the direction will end in 1997 with the beginning of a more competitive telecommunications regime. The government has promised very significant changes in the post-1997 telecommunications regime. Carriers will be differently defined and, if the principles are reflected in the legislation, they will include what are now defined as carrier associates.

        The access regime outlined in principles will also be stronger and will require carriers, which would include carriers associates, to give mandatory undertakings about interconnection and access rules.

They have addressed many of the issues that have concerned us. I suppose where we disagree is the outcome if the current regime were to suddenly lapse. I do not for a moment think that the government would do anything about it, simply because in the run-up to an election it would suit their purposes to suggest that there was chaos by allowing a black hole to develop.

        We have taken the view that we have got this far down the track. Both carriers have been led on, in a sense, by the government to a point where it would be very destabilising to suddenly pull the plug half way through. That is in large part a fault of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for taking such an inordinate length of time to make a decision. His original announcement was in November last year. He proposed a regime which was unique, in my understanding, in the world. Australia alone, of all countries, would have a duopoly regime which would allow a duplicate roll out. There was a potential for an overbuild of $3 million to $4 million. That would extend to 1997.

        In the classic words, which no doubt were drafted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), if there was appropriate competition they would extend that regime until 1999. If ever there was a licence for special deals, backroom discussions and grace and favour decision making, surely this has to be it. It is a classic example of the way this government operates. There is no transparency. There are no principles that people can understand. There is no coherence in the regime they put in place. It is all discretionary. `If you do us a favour, we will do you a favour. We reserve the right to decide whether or not we want to help the carriers at a later point in time.'

        We all know there have been exclusive regional franchise areas in places like the US, the UK and Canada. They have generally proceeded on the basis that in a defined geographic area only one carrier has the right to roll out the cable. A fundamental requirement, which as I understand was implicit in the Optus Vision proposal, was that they do it on a common carrier basis. Others would be automatically entitled to access that cable. You would not have duplication. You would have one carrier owning the cable, and other operators having an entitlement to access it. That was one formula that could have been adopted.

        Another model, which is certainly not unusual, is to maintain the distinction between carriage and content and to require that there be a utility that owns all the cable and then all those wanting to operate pay television services would interconnect to that system. It would be at arms length. You would not find one carrier beholden to the other. That was certainly an option that was available at that time. Instead, what the Minister came up with was this hybrid and very unsatisfactory compromise that involves 2 1/2 years or possibly 4 1/2 years of duopoly protection.

        Once again, I think it is quite clear that they have sought to muddy the waters by including the pay television exemption in the carrier associates direction. The whole concept of carrier associates is a device in many respects to avoid the consequences that would flow from the carriers otherwise being required to provide common carrier facilities which would automatically entitle others to access them. Given that that device is in place, it is simply extraordinary that it took the minister from 24 November last year to 22 August this year to table this direction. Our problem is that, with the best will in the world, the Democrats' proposal does not take account of what water has flowed under the bridge since that time.

        There is no doubt that Optus in particular, which is challenging the incumbent and therefore is taking most of the risks in this business—and, after all, Telstra is effectively using taxpayers' funds to fund its roll out—is using private sector funding and has gone a substantial way down the track. To use the blunt instrument of disallowance to effectively change the rules of the game halfway through would introduce a great deal of uncertainty into the environment in which the carriers would be operating. That is why we have made it clear that we are not prepared to simply disallow the entire direction.

        There are a number of aspects of that direction that continue to concern us. It is quite clear that the government has given no indication of its intention to extend the pro-competitive open access requirements for telecommunications, which will apply beyond 1997 to broadband interactive services. There is no reason in principle why you should not have the same regimes. There is certainly nothing in the carrier associates direction which would justify that differential treatment.

That is a tailor-made invitation for carriers to simply argue that at all times there is no surplus. Anyone who is familiar with the bandwidth that can be eaten up with virtual video on demand will understand that it is not a very difficult matter to simply have four or five channels dedicated on a permanent basis to the showing of one particular movie at 15-minute start-up intervals.

        It is very unsatisfactory, for example, that the government simply refuses to address Austel's report on service provider access to the current carriers basic network. Austel tabled its report back in March this year. There has been absolutely no government response to that. There is going to be no mandated interconnect regime, so once again those wanting to compete are left to effectively beg Telstra for access at reasonable rates. There is nothing to stop Telstra saying no. Austel's report states:

       Austel's assessment of the performance of the service provider industry indicates that it is not as yet performing in a way which would be expected from an efficient industry displaying the characteristics of commercially sustainable competition. Austel believes that under the current market conditions and carrier strategies it is highly unlikely that the government's objectives relating to effective competition, increased consumer choice and greater technological and service innovation in the service provider industry are likely to be achieved to a substantive degree.

      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       There is little genuine price or non-price competition occurring in the service provider industry. Many customers do not believe that they are receiving the price and other benefits potentially available in an effective competitive market. Currently, profitability across the voice resale segment of the service provider industry is generally low. A major factor which is adversely influenced by the profitability and return on investment achieved within the industry is the range of strategic barriers to entry resulting from actions of one or both of the carriers.
      </para>

       In other words, this is yet again another duopoly arrangement which effectively ensures that there cannot be a competitive market. We find it extraordinary that, whilst the government is at least promising to introduce a pro competitive, open access regime for telecommunications—and I must say I still reserve our position until we see the fine print that will translate those 99 principles into legislative form—the fact remains that at least it is on the record as espousing the principle of competition in the area of telecommunications after 1997. But the government is not prepared to do that in relation to broadband interactive services. That is simply another example of why this industry is fundamentally unhappy with the government's patronage system, which is now endemic.

Indeed, I do not think there is any good reason why the Democrats could not support that proposition as well. Given that they have a fair idea of the lie of the land and the ultimate outcome, it may well be that at least we have achieved something in this chamber if that motion is passed. Irrespective of the result today, I do not think there is any doubt that we both—that is, the Democrats and us—share the view that it is simply an untenable proposition to argue on some unarticulated basis that you ought to be able to extend duopoly arrangements through until 1999.

In an article by Fred Brenchley on Monday this week he talked about the deal that had been originally struck by News with Telstra which gives Foxtel a 25-year exclusivity for pay TV on Telstra's cable system. He said:

       Indeed, some analysts believe that the merger fine print even extends this deal.

       We are not privy to that deal. I would have thought that the government, as the ultimate shareholder in Telstra, would have every capacity to scrutinise that deal. Given that Mr Lee was boasting on

       only a matter of four or five weeks ago that he has very close and continuing relations with the Telstra board, I would have thought they would have been duty bound to bring the matter before him and to get the government's approval.

        We know the government turned a blind eye to things like the formation of the Packer-Murdoch-Telstra consortium and Telstra's purchase of 10 per cent of Channel 7 for $60 million. They were very major threshold decisions in terms of blurring the distinction between carriage and content. But the formation of the Foxtel joint venture is another thing again. I would be absolutely astounded if the government was not acutely or intimately involved in the negotiations that led to that agreement.

        The government is clearly in a position to throw light on whether Fred Brenchley has it right. I cannot believe that he has. It is possible that there might be a non-compete clause that would say that if either News or Telstra wished to get into the pay television business they had to do it through the medium of the joint venture. In other words, they could not separately compete with themselves as partners in the joint venture. If that were all that was involved in the 25-year restrictive covenant exclusivity clause, it would still allow third parties to have automatic entitlement to access to the cable networks. If Mr Brenchley is right, he is saying that third parties are locked out for 25 years or more. That would make a mockery of even the possibility of extending to 1999. So I hope that the government will clarify the position on that critical issue.

If that is not the government position—I suspect that it will not be—there will be a very clear difference between the major parties in the run-up to the next election. We will be on the record as being pro-competitive. They will be on the record as once again wanting to do the same old patronage deals to decide when they think it is appropriate, depending on who knocks loudest on their door or who rents them hardest and longest.

        For the record, the background is known to all the participants in the debate. It is necessary to put all the various elements of the government's action in context. On 24 November 1994, Mr Lee announced that the government would act to ensure that the access provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1991 would, with a limited exemption for pay television, apply to broadband cable being installed by the carriers. The catalyst for this was proposals by Optus and Telstra and their partners to construct cable networks to deliver a range of telephone broadband and pay TV services. The announcement also followed a report by Austel on the Optus and Telstra proposals. Direction No. 1 of 1995 gives effect to that policy. That is the sequence of background events.

        What is happening? Austel is currently implementing the direction, as set down, by preparing class licences that will enable access by service providers to the broadband cable. It is important to remember that, without the direction, cable that was installed by carriers but owned by a related company—under the mechanism, for example, that Senator Bourne referred to—would not be subject to the access provisions of the Telecommunications Act. Under the act, access provisions apply to cable owned by carriers but not by a related company. Let us look at what it all means for policy. At the end of the day, it is about what the policy principles are and what themes we wish to pursue.

        This open access framework should promote competition in telephony, technical innovation and competition, diversity and development of Australian content in the provision of the interactive broadband services of the future. The direction does provide a limited exemption from this access framework where access is required to provide pay television services. The exemption is often what draws the attention. That is not unusual; it is not exclusive to this area of policy—it is where attention tends to focus. But we cannot afford to focus only on that and ignore the implications for other elements of the policy that underpin and the action that flows from the direction.

        The exemption will apply, as everybody knows, until 30 June 1997, with a possible extension or a maximum period to 30 June 1999 if there is appropriate competition in the delivery of pay television services using cable. This limited exemption needs to be put into full context. It is only for a limited period and it does give carriers an incentive to roll out their networks rapidly. It also gives a clear indication to industry of when full access to broadband cable infrastructure will be available to all service providers, and a strong signal to the consortia that there must be appropriate competition. It is an exemption that recognises the commercial reality. The need for carriers to have incentives to justify the expenditure is currently estimated to be in the order of $7 billion involved in installing the cable.

        As foreshadowed in the minister's 24 November statement, the government has encouraged both Optus Vision and Telstra Multimedia Pty Ltd and Foxtel to make available some capacity on their networks for community access and education. The government has been advised by both consortia that they are currently developing initiatives to provide services for community and educational purposes. So it is important that we have those elements in the equation that is flowing and which we do not wish to see disrupted by the uncertainty that would flow, inevitably, from this disallowance.

        An uncertain regulatory environment which would inevitably follow from disallowing this direction could well discourage investment. It is important that we minimise uncertainty in the industry, given the significance of the telecommunications industry in general in Australian life and the significance of the proposed investments in cable in particular. The direction seems to the government to strike the right balance between encouraging cable roll-out and ensuring open access to the cable infrastructure for all service providers in the medium term. I should have thought we all agree that we want to achieve both those goals—but what is the balance that we want to strike between them?

        The policy was first announced in November. There has been some issue about whether it has perhaps taken undue time to finalise the direction first foreshadowed in November 1994, but it was a direction that involved complex policy and legal issues. We are dealing with new types of infrastructure and services. There has been extensive public consultation since November 1994 in preparing the direction. I would have thought the Senate would have felt that should be the case; they would have supported that. There have been two full rounds of public consultation since November, two drafts of the direction being circulated to industry, consumer and government groups or their representatives. We appreciate the fact that many people provided comments during the preparation of the direction and put a lot of effort into that. It was greatly appreciated by the government.

My understanding is that any dispute between a carrier associate and a service provider about any of the matters covered in the direction may be dealt with by Austel. In accordance with its powers of enforcement of class licence conditions, Austel also has power to investigate complaints about carrier associates not complying with the conditions of their class licence under part 15 of the act.

        Senator Alston's amendment is essentially the tenor of what we expected. I am not sure we actually thought he would move an amendment but the tenor of his remarks was not surprising. He would no doubt be aware that the direction currently provides for the pay television exemption to cease on 1 July 1997, but that the government will review the exemption in the lead-up to that time in a situation where the environment is changing rapidly. To be absolutely specific in the detail about exactly what we are going to do in this rapidly changing environment in 30 June 1997 is extremely difficult and probably in the end not helpful, but the general principle is that if there is appropriate competition and only if that competition is there in the delivery of pay television using cable the government will allow the exemption to continue for the maximum period of five years, that is, until 30 June 1999.

We often hear about competition policy in Australia. What we really see throughout the world is not increasing competition but decreasing competition. Massive investment is required in areas of media and communications. We know that this is one of the few areas within our investment regulatory environment where there are still rules about the level of overseas ownership, the level of cross-ownership, and so on. Other industries are very quickly going into oligopoly or monopoly situations which are not particularly competitive. It simply means that there are not too many rules about what happens these days.

        In the case of major investments, we are getting massive oligopolies throughout the world. In Australia we are getting cross-ownership of the media, telecommunications, and the superhighway. It is of great concern that, when competition is mentioned, there is some level of understanding of what it means. If what we are doing in regulations is actually entrenching that global oligopoly or creating the potential to entrench the global oligopoly without allowing access for local participation, then perhaps we have to take it more carefully.

         I have pleasure in tabling this report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee on its inquiry into long-term unemployment. On 17 November 1994, the Senate asked the committee to inquire into these matters. Most specifically in relation to long-term unemployment, we were asked to inquire into three broad aspects: first, to examine the research on the causes of long-term unemployment; second, to evaluate established programs and current opportunities which enable the long-term unemployed to return to the work force and reveal any legislative or other regulatory mechanisms which constrain those opportunities; and, third, to identify, describe and evaluate alternative innovative strategies being implemented in Australia and elsewhere, which could lead to the re-engagement of the long-term unemployed.

          That inquiry has now been completed after hearings held in all territory and state capitals, especially urban and suburban areas that are most affected by long-term unemployment—such as Campbelltown, on the outer edge of Sydney in New South Wales, and Broadmeadows in Victoria—as well as regional centres of high long-term unemployment—such as Tweed Heads, Whyalla, Burnie and Launceston. Evidence given in those hearings was collected along with 170 submissions, and they revealed that unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is one of the most desperate problems facing this country.

          One submission to the inquiry from a 42-year-old man who had been without full-time work for 12 years summarised the feeling expressed by many. He said, `I feel abandoned by the system, exploited by the system, abused by the system and held captive by the system.' A woman made redundant from a middle-management position by a municipal council amalgamation commented on how she was `avoided and made to feel a nuisance'. `There was,' she wrote, `a feeling of embarrassment on the part of my employers—a blame the victim mentality.'

          Losing a job for many of these people turns out to be the first shock. The difficulty of finding another job is the next. Many believed that they would not get another job. They learnt not to expect one to avoid that crippling sense of disappointment. We had on one occasion a man appear before us who had brought along his sheaf of 200 applications that he had put in for jobs over the last two years, and he had still not received a job.

          The long-term unemployed now comprise nearly a third of all Australia's unemployment—a massive rise over the last 10 years. Not only is this a misuse of Australia's human resources, but it multiplies all the ills that are attendant upon being unemployed. It is itself a significant contributor to unemployment. Several groups in our society suffer disproportionately—the youth, the older workers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people in some of the rural areas and in the outer suburbs, and people from non-English speaking background.

          There has been wide debate about the reasons for this unemployment and what are the appropriate solutions, but the fact is that the debate has produced little by way of major breakthrough to date in overcoming unemployment. This is the matter that gives this inquiry, and the results that come from it, some sense of urgency.

          The government heard a very wide range of evidence on what has been happening in this country with the unemployed and with the programs that governments have adopted to bring about a change. What we heard broadly—and the focus, of course, was on current programs—was that Working Nation is not working. Its failure is shown by the fact that, even during the huge boom that we were supposed to have had last year, although long-term employment did come down, there was still a very large entrenched pool of long-term unemployment in this country after the last recession, as there has been after each recession. What tends to happen after a recession is that there is a larger pool of long-term unemployed left than there was after the previous recession. This is a ratcheting up effect and is perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of the development of this problem.

          When we looked at how government programs are addressing these problems, we found major concerns around the country. In the case of the labour market programs, we heard major criticisms of the fact that they were tending to churn the dole queues. There was a negative perception of training, and that perception was not confined to the unemployed. There were doubts over whether Working Nation was decreasing unemployment or merely recycling the unemployed.

          Churning the dole queue was an expression we heard in many hearings. The labour market programs seemed in a lot of instances to be recycling the participants, who may go into job training programs for six months but, when they come out at the end of it, a lot are not being placed. We also received evidence that what we are looking at is people being placed for six months and then returned to the ranks of the unemployed because the economic situation in the area is on the downturn. These people face the very real prospect of again becoming long-term unemployed. What we have had is a recycling factor as the dole queue was being churned.

          With this churning of these training programs involving some work and some training for the long-term unemployed, that is exactly what was happening to them because, in the end, half of them did not receive a job; they went back not to becoming long-term unemployed—by the government's definition—but to the start of the queue. They were newly unemployed, according to the government. So a lot of this drop in long-term unemployment has largely been an illusion. People have been redefined off the long-term unemployment list, just as we find broadly with unemployment that we have great numbers redefined off the list by being called mature age and picking up a benefit on that basis.

          One of the most interesting graphs in this report shows not only the government official unemployment rate but also the unofficial unemployment rate; all those people who are desperate to get work but cannot. It includes people who are maybe working a day a week and would really like to work five days a week; and people who have just given up. If you take these figures—and the statistics are in the report—you can in effect double the unemployment rate in this country.

          It is a major tragedy that we face that when we got to the height—or should I say the depth—of the last recession, we had, in effect, not 11 per cent unemployment but a real unemployment rate of over 20 per cent. People were desperate to receive jobs but there was just no work available for them.

          One of the major problems with Working Nation and a lot of the government programs is that they are trying to hide the extent of the problem and make out that the rate is not as high as it is. There is a huge danger for society in that because if the public is lulled into a false sense of thinking, `Oh, the problem has been fixed,' when it has not been fixed, they do not give it a priority. We are storing up major long-term problems in society. We are developing a social underclass where in some cities and country areas there is more than one generation of unemployment; sometimes there are up to three generations. There are families where people have known no work at all. This not only does tremendous harm to society; it does great harm to individuals.

          Some of the more serious criticisms in the report suggest that programs not followed by work are of little value in economic terms and harm the unemployed, particularly older workers. The two major programs, Jobstart and Jobskill, which are used for the long-term unemployed, have caused great resentment among people.

          You say in terms of industrial relations and the freeing up of the labour market that workers' conditions have to be reduced. You say that workers are entitled to remain on an award. What you mean is that, given that 3.6 million workers will change their jobs every three years, 3.6 million workers will automatically be outside of your inadequate concept of a safety net. If we ever had a Liberal government, 3.6 million workers every three years would be faced with a situation, as we have seen in Western Australia and Victoria with Jeff Kennett, where contracts would be imposed. This would see a reduction in the standards of living for workers.

          What we are saying is that in terms of attitudes you have failed yet again. You have sought to have one policy articulated which slashes workers' pay and conditions, undermines public sector conditions and destroys the social wage.

Your policies would exacerbate unemployment and the inequalities of wealth and power in this society. As a consequence, you do not have any answers other than making the situation worse.

Why should Working Nation not be subject to scrutiny, Senator Carr, in view of the vast amounts of government money that is spent on the schemes that you list on page after page of the minority report?

         In that way they would get quicker access to being re-placed into the employment market. As Senator Tierney said, it has only been reduced to six months, not 12 months. The committee also recommended that:

          One area most severely affected by long-term unemployment is outer west Melbourne where the long-term unemployment rate is eight per cent. My electorate office is in Broadmeadows, which incorporates this region. I had a gentleman in my office the other week who was literally crying with frustration because he had been unemployed for two years and he did not know where to turn. If all these programs are working so successfully, why can he not get a job?

          During the hearing we saw witnesses who came from regions such as Broadmeadows who have been stigmatised by unemployment. One young person from Campbelltown, south-west of Sydney, said, `I lived in Campbelltown and people did not want people from Campbelltown.' Those offering training and employment services in the area also spoke of difficulties in placing people in employment because of the stigma attached to the region. There is no doubt that unemployment has become endemic in certain regions. Another frequent criticism heard during the hearing, and one which the coalition has made often, was that all the training programs in the world are useless if there are no jobs at the end of them.

The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow minister for employment, has regularly stressed concern that training programs are used merely as a smokescreen to get people off the unemployment queues.

         There appear to be many elements in this debate. One of the strong facts that came out was that people need to be picked up in the very early months of unemployment while they still have job skills and motivation. One witness said this to the committee:

          We need greater flexibility in the delivery of services. When you are over 35 or 40, time becomes very important. You cannot afford to wait six or 12 months, because you slip further behind in the job stakes. This was also highlighted in relation to non-English speaking background job seekers. Not only do non-English speaking background job seekers have difficulty in relation to the problem of unemployment itself; they also face a language barrier. While the minority report quotes that language programs are available to people, they are not the sorts of language programs that are needed to get people ready for employment. This was another element of the debate brought out in Broadmeadows. It is an area with a large ethnic population.

          We need much greater flexibility and a much greater sharpening of focus on local problems and the way in which they can be addressed. We heard of some excellent initiatives during the hearings. One was the Forty Plus Employment Group in Ballarat. This group was formed in 1993. It evolved from a vocational services project of the Ballarat rotary clubs. In February this year, they opened an Aussie Workways Enterprise Centre. It was designed to allow mature age unemployed people to work together and assist each other. The main purpose of the group was to establish viable and sustainable enterprises. At this point of debate, there are now over 100 people involved in the organisation. They have a five-year plan to establish Aussie Workways as a major facility for employment generation in Ballarat.

The committee repeatedly heard of the devastating impact that whistleblowing had on the lives of the people involved. Many of the people who gave evidence suffered employment-related reprisals and their health and family life were adversely affected. This evidence supported the need for whistleblower protection legislation as recommended by the previous committee.

          However, legislation may not be able to cover all contingencies envisaged by whistleblowers. The committee acknowledges that a number of states and the ACT have already enacted legislation in this area. It recognises the jurisdictional and constitutional difficulties requiring separate Commonwealth and state legislation, but considers the formulation of uniform and complementary legislation as essential if we are to achieve a fairer and more equitable process in the area of whistleblowing.

          The committee agrees that attitudinal change towards whistleblowers and the investigation of their complaints is imperative within public and private sector organisations and the community generally. The committee notes that public sector developments in ethics awareness and fraud control are taking place. It is essential, however, that if these developments are to have value, they must be strongly promoted and encouraged by senior management and not simply remain as rhetoric. The Public Service Commission and its new commissioner have a crucial role to play in this regard.

          The cases considered by the committee demonstrate the difficulties people have in raising their concerns and having them investigated in an objective and independent manner.

          These difficulties, when combined with reprisals and detrimental consequences for health and family, often resulted in a loss of faith in the system—which is supposedly designed to protect and support them—and generated a general feeling of helplessness. This can force whistleblowers into obsessive behaviour and pursuit of their case with a consuming passion which can then result in a loss of judgment and objectivity in their actions.

          The whistleblowers who gave evidence to the committee constantly emphasised the need for independence in public disclosure or whistleblower protection legislation. The previous committee concluded—and this committee concurs—that at the Commonwealth level the most appropriate approach is to establish a small yet powerful independent oversighting agency directed and controlled by a board consisting of representatives from government, parliament, whistleblower and community groups. This approach recognises that investigation of complaints and protection of whistleblowers should be primarily undertaken by existing organisations but with oversight by the proposed agency.

          In its report, the committee also discussed a number of detailed issues relating to whistleblower protection legislation. They include the importance of an initial independent screening to sift the vexatious and trivial allegations from genuine public interest disclosures. People whose disclosures came within the auspices of proposed whistleblower protection legislation could be assured of being directed to an appropriate place for their disclosure to be examined. In this way, no whistleblower would be stranded without knowing where to turn for assistance.

          Other issues considered by the committee included the provision of counselling, support, advice and assistance; the conduct of investigations, in particular the public interest value of open hearings and the application of rules of natural justice, not just for the whistleblower but, equally importantly, for the subject of any allegations; access to legal aid and assistance; retrospectivity in legislation; and recourse to the media.

          In terms of witnesses and cases, one of the key witnesses to the inquiry was the CJC, which is established under Queensland legislation. It is the responsibility of the Queensland Parliament to determine the functions and powers of the CJC and how it performs its duties. The committee was mindful that a comprehensive report reviewing the CJC had been presented by the Queensland parliamentary committee oversighting the CJC earlier this year and was still under consideration. The committee focused on the role and conduct of the Criminal Justice Commission only in relation to the whistleblower cases it considered. Nevertheless, the committee made a number of observations concerning the CJC.

          It is important to remember that the CJC was established as a direct result of the Fitzgerald inquiry. It is an independent and highly powerful organisation. Although the Fitzgerald report highlighted the difficulties of balancing accountability with the need for independence, the resultant accountability is limited. A person dissatisfied with the actions or conduct of the CJC has recourse to the Supreme Court or a parliamentary monitoring committee. The committee is aware of reports in the Queensland media critical of the CJC. It is possible that these critical reports result from the limited accountability options available to people so that they turn in frustration to the media.

          The CJC appears to have adopted an embattled and very defensive approach in response to criticism. It has responded in several cases by attacking individuals at a personal level. Whether or not these people provoke such a response by outrageous allegations of their own is immaterial. I do not believe that it brings credit upon a public institution to respond in such a vitriolic manner. Whistleblowers can have no respect for such an organisation and are deterred from seeking assistance from it. The committee was concerned from the evidence it received at the CJC's approach to investigations. The CJC indicated that it was constrained in what it can do by the powers prescribed under its act. Whilst accepting this, the committee believes that the CJC could have done more within its powers to investigate certain cases more fully.

          In relation to the cases considered by the committee I would like to make a number of personal comments. In respect of the shredding of the Heiner documents I do not believe there is any evidence of a political conspiracy on behalf of the government. A newly elected government was confronted with a problem created during the term of the previous administration. The government sought advice through the correct channels and, irrespective of whether that advice was correct or not, it acted upon the advice it was given. Nevertheless, from an administrative viewpoint the individuals involved could certainly have been handled more considerately and lot of unnecessary stress and heartache for them could have been avoided.

          In the matter of Gordon Harris and John Reynolds, it is clear to me that the actions taken against Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds demonstrated a classic whistleblower dilemma whereby the whistleblower, rather than the disclosures, becomes the focus of attention.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           The investigations, court cases and appeals to which Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds have been subjected boiled down to Mr Harris being found guilty of disclosing information contrary to the Police Administration Act—an offence determined by a magistrate to be so trivial, and with such mitigating circumstances, that Mr Harris was discharged without having a conviction recorded. It was the committee's view that the severity of the reprisals to which Gordon Harris and John Reynolds were subjected could not be justified and I believe the state should consider some form of compensation for these two people.

A particular problem, highlighted in the case of Mr Bill Toomer, is that of considering cases many years after they have occurred. Witnesses have moved on—

         —On behalf of the coalition, I rise to speak on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1995. This bill gives the force of law in Australia to a comprehensive double-tax agreement signed with the Czech Republic on 28 March this year for the prevention of double taxation and the prevention of avoidance of taxes on income flows between the two treaty partners.

         The agreement prevents double taxation by allocating taxing rights to Australia or to the Czech Republic on all forms of income flow between the two countries. The basis of allocating the rights is substantially similar to that adopted in Australia's other modern double-taxation agreements, such as that which was signed with New Zealand earlier this year.

         I do not intend to make lengthy comments. I think, however, it would be remiss of me not to highlight what I consider to be a major failing in the Labor government's vocational education and training program. In my opinion and, I would suggest, in the opinion of many others, there is very little point in having a world-class, best practice unemployed work force. Such a work force, while perhaps ready to accept work in the future, will today remain unemployed unless their skills are made relevant to the business environment of here and now. It is merely frustrating and demoralising to allow an individual to be trained or educated in the belief that employment will follow when the training fails to be targeted and has no hope of resulting in long-term work.

         If our educational and training regimes are not leading to employment in a growing and expanding economy, then I suggest there is something disturbingly wrong. So how should we assess the schemes and programs currently operated by the Labor government in this area of vocational education and training?

         I would venture the proposition that the first step in evaluation is to determine the goal of the program. In making this evaluation, we can look to the words of the government or we can look to the priorities of the government as evidenced by how the government spends taxpayers' money. While I enjoy reading the government's words, I think it might be more rational and enlightening to examine where the government puts the money. Clearly, while words are cheap, it is actions that pay the bills.

         In this year's budget papers—1995-96—the government indicates that it will spend $850 million on vocational and other education over the financial year. This amounts to 7.94 per cent of the Commonwealth's spending on education. Of the $850 million, the vast majority is spent on technical and further education, with just $19.9 million being spent on other vocational education institutions.

         At this time I could criticise the government for its mathematical gymnastics in reducing funds to the states over the next three years through adjustments to the process of indexation. However, as these reported savings are in fact only notional and cannot be guaranteed, I shall pass over that issue. The amounts to be appropriated to the vocational education and training area are significant, and it is important that we are able to assess whether their expenditure actually returns an appropriate value to the community.

         Let me say that I believe this funding does return value to the community. However, I do not believe the funds are being used to the maximum possible advantage. In this opinion I am no Robinson Crusoe. Major recent research has highlighted the weaknesses in both our system of providing vocational training and the form that that training should take. In the Karpin report entitled

        . . . it appears incontrovertible that Australian enterprises, training providers and educational institutions are not moving quickly enough to address the new paradigm of management. Many of our counterparts overseas, and especially the leaders in the various fields of industry and education, are changing more rapidly and more extensively, and will be better prepared for the next century.
       </para>

        What Karpin has said is clear. The world does not owe Australia a living and it is moving ahead of us now. We must get moving and react more quickly with better training or risk the potential of being left behind. The writing is on the wall and the message is clear. Either we must establish a vocational education and training structure and a system which is capable of a flexible response to the changing circumstances of modern commerce, or we will be an economic and social backwater not only in our own geographic region but also in the world as a whole.

Our social safety net will be useless if each and every one of us needs to have recourse to it just to live above the poverty line. So where does our system currently stand?

         In August this year, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia—known as CEDA—released the outcomes of its review of the national training reform agenda. That report concluded that progress had been slow and that the new training structures were too bureaucratic, overly complex and irrelevant to the needs of many enterprises. The report also concluded that the national training reform agenda suffered from a lack of industry involvement. These are very disturbing findings. If our training and education agenda is based on a stifling, complex bureaucracy, which excludes the very people that ultimately must employ the newly trained, then we are patently wasting not only money but also the future potential of thousands of Australians that undertake these programs.

         The first of the main provisions of the bill seeks to amend the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983. The bill abolishes the Economic Planning Advisory Council, known as EPAC, and establishes the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. This follows an announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 16 August 1994 that he was establishing a new, so-called economic round table to replace EPAC and that EPAC would be re-established as the Economic Planning Advisory Commission.

         I am not sure what has happened to the economic round table proposal. This bill, as I understand it, is solely concerned with the abolition of the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the establishment of an Economic Planning Advisory Commission. The council was a creature of the previous Labor government. It was established after the national economic summit of March 1983. It was intended to bring together business, unions and government.

         EPAC has, over the years, fulfilled in many ways a useful role. We have all had criticisms of EPAC from time to time; some of those I have agreed with. Overall, EPAC did play a useful role in various respects. However, like the Accord—and, importantly, it did flow from the Accord—and this government, it has apparently outlived its purpose and will be replaced by the commission. It does away with the auspices of tripartite consultation and will concentrate, I understand, more on advice to government.

The headline rate you are complaining about now is 5.1 per cent. As the Treasurer and as the Prime Minister have both made clear—and, indeed, many economic commentators have supported their view—the underlying rate is probably the more appropriate rate because it is shorn of high volatile factors, seasonal fluctuations and government charges. The underlying rate and the headline rate are such that they are within the budget forecasts and are, therefore, consistent with current economic policy. They are within the forecasts we made in the budget in May of this year.

         This question invites me to compare us with the rest of the world. One of the things is that you cannot compare economic indicators in isolation from other economic indicators. In relation to the rest of the world, the first thing you would ask is: are the other indicators of inflation measuring the same things as the levels of inflation being measured in Australia? When you ask yourself that question and look at the other indicators, the answer is that they are not, by and large. The headline rate in other countries, by and large, excludes all issues under the statistical category `shelter', which is to say that it does not include what would be the mortgage repayments, interest rates on home loans and things of that nature in other economies. So the first point about this comparison, `Is it apples to apples?', is that it is not apples to apples; it is an apples to oranges comparison—and you should get the comparison of your statistics right, Senator Hill.

         The second point is the more important one, because you cannot separate the interdependence, as I have said, of economic indicators. Look at the growth levels in Australia compared with the growth levels in the economies of the countries, Senator Hill, you are referring to. You often like to quote the rear pages of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Economist

         magazine. Let me look at its economic indicators page. Under the heading `Economic GDP Forecasts for 1995', it says that Australia has the second highest growth of all the developed economies mentioned there and well above a number of the significant economies that you compare our inflation rate with. If you look to the forecast for 1996 where the

         It is growth that creates jobs and pressure on inflation, that is true. But no-one wants to lose this level of growth. We are looking at a level of sustainable economic growth that creates work for Australians and we are looking at the other economies coming behind us. Their inflation is lower because their growth levels are lower. It is bad news for people in those economies, because of that.

         We heard Mr Howard at ACOSS last week giving the 22 promises of what he wouldn't do—he wouldn't do this and he wouldn't do that on social security. We now know from what Mr Kennett has said that the intention is to devolve those responsibilities to the states and allow the states to scuttle expenditure on social security, to undermine expenditure on health, and to reduce expenditure on education so that Mr Howard can stand centre stage, pristine and pure, hand on heart, saying `I kept my promises' but allow the state premiers, Kennett, Brown and Court, to do the dirty work for him.

         I am also asked a question about the BRW report `Libs' radical new tax plan' and what the impact of that would be on a state basis. The BRW article outlined a proposal being studied by the Liberal Party for states and territories to be allowed to levy individual income taxes, initially at a common marginal rate of 16 per cent above the tax-free threshold. Each individual state would then be able to vary its 16 per cent marginal rate to suit their own ends. What that would mean is New South Wales and Victoria would be better off by over $1 billion each; Queensland and South Australia would lose over $700 million each; Western Australia would lose $220 million; Tasmania would lose $360 million; and the Northern Territory, for some reason—obviously, the Liberals do not like them up there in the territory—would lose $837 million.

         What this government has been about in the last 10 years, in particular, is multiskilling the work force, freeing up the labour market and achieving a productivity driven economy. One of the key partners in that has been the trade union movement. Many employers are grateful for the role that not only the federal government but also the trade union movement has played in this process.

         Many of the unions now recognise that the benefits to their members will come as the economy grows. The economy will grow best by increases in productivity, flexibility in work practices and cooperative activities between the tripartite levels of governments, employers and unions. It is in that context that grants have been made over the years. Many grants have also been made in the employer and business areas to increase their productivity. The beneficiaries are not only those who get the grants but also the whole Australian economy.

They were being dealt with in court cases. We redefined the sweeper clauses, as they are called, in the bill to ensure that the original policy intent of this measure introduced by the Fraser government in 1982 would continue. The diesel fuel rebate scheme means that the mining industry in this country gets the benefit of $600 million in revenue forgone on excise. The agricultural industry gets $400 million. That is over $1 billion of revenue forgone, because that is the policy intent of the government. We will stick to that policy intent. With these further amendments, the opposition is trying to expand the intent of the bill beyond what it was originally designed for. It is doing that for political purposes to try to curry some short-term electoral favour with a number of people in a particular industry.

And those funds, as you have indicated in this question, Senator Kernot, have grown to very large levels.

         The Prime Minister was saying that, yes, tax concessions are provided by Australian taxpayers to superannuation funds and that does give us, as a government, a right to express views and take action about superannuation. But there is a clear dividing line—and one that we will not cross—and that is that we are not in the business of directing where funds should invest.

         We recognise that superannuation funds have the savings of ordinary Australians to invest and that the obligation on those funds is to give the best possible return for ordinary Australians who will be the beneficiaries as superannuants of those funds. We think that the best way of managing that process is to allow the funds to make the decisions about investment and not for the government to direct them.

         However, we do think—and the Prime Minister has colourfully expressed himself on this a couple of times in the last week—that the direction of funds' investment is not balanced when it comes to considering the need of developmental and venture capital in Australia; that is, investing in companies that want to start business and investing in companies that have just got started and have bright prospects but cannot attract investment in either equity or capital to grow beyond their smaller levels. That is a distortion in our market.

         You will recall that earlier this week I referred to the National Investment Council's report which said that our funds are about 3 1/2 per cent less attentive to this area of investment than are typical funds in the United States and the United Kingdom. I was just making the point that we have an underdeveloped venture capital market in Australia and we have a development capital market but still not a strong one, and this is a country which is typified by a large number of small to medium size businesses. If their capital is starved, it is harder for them to grow and bring Australian brand names to the international marketplace. The Prime Minister was talking about that distortion. Because of the tax concessions the government brings, we do have a right and a prerogative to speak about that in this area.

         On the first part of your question, we can have this debate in the chamber all day, but investment in foreign business by Australians gets a return to Australia, integrates us into the international economy more deeply and is a valid form of investment. I would like to see more of that investment at home, but I by no means write off the importance of a balanced portfolio which would include some foreign investment. On the proportional argument here the proportions are quite reasonably balanced, I think.

Specifically in Whyalla: `People are sick and tired of training for the sake of it. They are disillusioned with training programs that get them nowhere' and, `Participants in work experience programs after six months of feeling really happy that they are up and going all of a sudden, when their placement ends, they are dead in their tracks.' Finally and most tragically: `It is more comfortable to remain lying in the gutter than to be picked up and dropped back in it again.' Minister, how can you justify the abject policy failure to 760,000 officially unemployed Australians and what hope do you offer these people with unemployment on the rise again?

         If this government had not introduced the Working Nation program—which is a $10 billion program over four years—over that period to help the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, recently enhanced by Mr Crean's announcement to make it even more flexible to help those unemployed between six and 12 months, you would be the first person up here screaming that we are doing nothing. This program, started in May of last year, is the single biggest effort by any Australian government in history to deal with the issue of unemployment. One thing we find interesting is that you have not announced one word of new policy, of what you would do instead of what we are doing. You have no policy at all. We have a detailed policy which, after some 18 months, as has already been explained to you and many others, has worked successfully to significantly reduce unemployment in Australia, particularly long-term unemployment. Senator Tierney was just going on, as he usually does, attacking the government. It is fine to attack the government but you put nothing in its place. Until you do, you have no credibility.

At that time this was a significant achievement in the face of strong international competition. All payments were met on the due dates and the Export Payments Insurance Corporation did not incur any claim payments. This cover related to payment terms of 10 years and expired in the early 1980s.

         More recently, EFIC provided overseas investment insurance to two Australian firms which had equipment at the mine site. Claims totalling some $500,000 resulting from damage to this equipment were paid by EFIC in 1991. Beyond this, EFIC has paid some claims to Australian companies that have been exporting to Papua New Guinea, generally where non-payment by the PNG buyer can probably be attributed to financial difficulties flowing from the closure of the Bougainville mine.

The draft is now before him, and I think he is required to respond since he wants to make small business a major issue in the coming election campaign. He cannot go around telling small business he is all in favour of their issues when the fundamental response of small business organisations, through the Small Business Forum, overwhelmingly supports these amendments. They have done so because they see the benefits that they are going to get.

         So, over the next few weeks, this exposure draft will be out there for further comment and to give people one last chance to make a comment about whether it is the way the amendments ought to be drafted. I hope the opposition will have the courage at last to declare that it will help small business. If they do not, as minister for small business I look forward in the coming election campaign to hitting the opposition, and particularly Mr Howard, around the head for running away from the big opportunity to help small business with this amendment of the Trade Practices Act.

With regard to the requirement for carrier co-location, the national code requires that, if a carrier installs or relocates a telecommunications tower or similar structure, the carrier must locate the new facility on an existing tower or as close as possible to an existing tower unless it is not feasible on technical grounds, unless it is incompatible with configuration or intended configuration of the carrier's network or unless it is likely to have greater adverse effect on the environment than putting the new facility in another place.

         The code also requires that a carrier cooperate with other carriers in sharing sites and planning the provision of future telecommunications services. Again, this is unless it is not technically feasible, is incompatible with network configuration or has an adverse impact on the environment. I understand Austel has initiated discussions with the carriers on their endeavours to co-locate and two of the carriers have developed an agreement relating to co-location.

         The second letter was written to further ensure that councils were aware of their rights and responsibilities under the code. It emphasised that carriers must notify local councils in writing of proposals to construct telecommunications facilities and must provide enough information at the time of notification to enable the council to assess the activity. The letter also advised that, for mobile towers, when the council and the carrier have not reached agreement during the consultation process about the environmental impact of a proposed installation or modification of a tower, the council can require the carrier to refer the proposal to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.

         Both letters to the local councils notified them that, if they considered a carrier was not fulfilling its obligations under the code—including making an incorrect decision—they could refer the matter to Austel, which has the power under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enforce carrier compliance with the code. In addition, the carriers and the Municipal Association of Victoria have agreed to a guideline on community notification and consultation. The government expects carriers to endeavour to apply this guideline throughout Australia. The minister wrote to carriers in October this year seeking a report on their progress in implementing these guidelines in Victoria and nationwide.

         With regard to the improvement of information that carriers supply to councils, the code requires carriers to provide local councils with full details of any proposed activity in their local area.

The information package that the minister supplied to councils explains these rights.

         —In 1990, the Prime Minister and the premiers discussed the question of unexploded ordnance—which is not necessarily dangerous material but in some cases is. The decision was to review all sites around Australia, which comes to 1,070. So the government is progressively doing that. At the moment I think some seven sites have been reviewed, going through the past records and history. Once those reviews are available, they go to the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage and they, in fact, do the classifying.

         The nub of the problem is that in some cases, of course, there is lack of knowledge or lack of proper advice to the Queensland department as to how to classify. The difficulty is that from the production of the first report, which is a very broad-brush one, to the defining of actual areas affected there is always that no-man zone, if you like, in which worry occurs as to whether property is affected.

         In some cases many of these properties, arising out of activities in the Second World War, had compensation offered or paid for any unexploded ordnance or any other contamination of the property. Therefore, all accounts are settled. In some instances, no compensation was either offered or accepted at the time. Basically, that is the case in Mr Lavarch's area.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The argument was not whether those property holders would have their property marked as contaminated; it was: what advice would we in Defence give the Department of Environment and Heritage? One of the things we offered at least—and our view is that most of that area is not contaminated; therefore, the title should not be amended to show it is contaminated—was a random sample. That is the only thing that has been offered to Mr Lavarch's electorate—a random sample, on the basis that compensation was never paid, so that we can clearly define the area.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As to the other six areas so far in which reports have come in in Queensland, it is necessary for us to give advice to the Department of Environment and Heritage as to what our view is of the contamination. On these other sites the historical records are far more accurate, but there may be occasions when we also have to opt for random sampling in some of those areas too if we are uncertain as to what advice to give the Department of Environment and Heritage in Queensland.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">

         We are also trying to do an overarching plan between the two departments to come up with a methodology that will be consistently applied through Queensland—something that has not been done before, and maybe something that should have been done earlier—so that you will not have these sorts of scare campaigns, which I am sure you have picked up, that are often run.

         So, in answer to your question, what we are doing about it is making recommendations to the Department of Environment and Heritage so that they can, in fact, classify the land. Where no compensation has been paid, which is not necessarily obvious at the moment, that will be a matter for future government policy. But where compensation has been paid in the past, it is up to the landholder to then rectify whatever problem is on that land. We cannot have double dipping. The one thing I also assure you about is that, if any dangerous ordnance is found, Defence then goes to the assistance of the landholder and defuses and deals with the problem without any charge to the landholder at all.

         —The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet thought it more appropriate to direct that question, as they often do, to another portfolio for answer. They directed it to Treasury for answer. Treasury, however, before they can answer that, have sought advice from Attorney-General's and the Reserve Bank as to whether they can even answer the question. That is where the matter rests. Your raising it today surely will prompt them to expedite that advice and maybe get you an answer as soon as possible. But I can be of no more assistance.

That being the case, Senator Boswell's claim that there are only two is, in fact, nonsense.

         —Listen, Senator Boswell, I will answer the question precisely. You heard what I said. AQIS either employs or has access to a wide range of high level expertise in plant science, including entomologists, plant pathologists, botanists and staff with other relevant scientific qualifications. AQIS employs directly 28 scientific positions of people who are in the plant quarantine and export area but have scientific qualifications in those areas—that is, plant pathologists, botanists, entomologists, and so on. Twenty-eight, Senator Boswell, so I do not know where you got your figure of two from.

         There are 14 positions within AQIS that handle quarantine policy issues in international market access matters. There are 14 positions responsible for technical operational issues in plant quarantine, import clearance and export inspection. In addition, AQIS engages directly, through its state operations, the services of a further 19.3 full-time equivalent plant scientific staff who handle day-to-day program delivery issues. In some cases, these are permanent full-time jobs, and in other cases AQIS engages state specialists, as necessary, on a contract basis.

         In addition, as I pointed out before, AQIS has direct access, as necessary, to the plant scientists within the Bureau of Resource Sciences, which, of course, is also within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. In addition, AQIS contracts, as necessary, high level scientific expertise within the CSIRO, universities and other research institutions. I think that demonstrates, comprehensively, I might add, that Senator Boswell's assertion in the Senate yesterday, which he followed up with a press statement last night, that AQIS has only two people with technical or scientific qualifications in this area is a nonsense.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to the funding of trade unions .

        I asked the minister whether he could confirm that answers I had received from questions that I had put to ministers over recent years about these payments, which show that well over $90 million has been paid to the unions in direct grant funding, and that even this huge figure excludes certain large payments—for example, the funding of the Trade Union Training Authority that costs around $10 million per year. When you add up all the money that has gone from this government to the trade union movement in the 12 years since Labor came to power in 1983, on a very conservative estimate, the figure would be a minimum of $160 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That money has been used in a wide range of areas, including in particular to pay back the trade union movement for contributions that it has made to Labor's election campaigns. During the 1993 election campaign, for example, the trade union movement gave $3.5 million to Labor to assist in the funding of the election campaign. It gave direct donations of $2.1 million and engaged in an advertising campaign in support of the government which cost about $1.3 million or $1.4 million—a total of $3 1/2 million.

         What did it get in return? It got Labor elected. Let there be no doubt that that was the whole objective of the trade union involvement in 1993. We will certainly never forget the statement by Jennie George, the then Assistant Secretary of the ACTU and now President of the ACTU, after the election that it was the trade union movement that had won the election for Labor. There was never any doubt that that was the sole purpose of the union movement's activities in the run-up to the 1993 election. It paid them pretty handsomely because since the election the trade union movement has received a minimum of $26 million of taxpayers' funds to fund a whole range of activities.

         There would not be a taxpayer in Australia who would know that their taxes are going to trade union activities in the way that has become an art form for this government. The minister's response today was a classic example of what is, at the very least, the amorality of this government. This government does not know the difference between right and wrong. It cannot distinguish between legitimate uses of taxpayers' funds and legitimate uses of its role in government and those uses which, by the standards of decent Australians, would be regarded as a disgraceful and dishonest abuse of power and privilege.

         It is very easy for the opposition to get up and make these spurious claims about what happens to money and how it is spent.

That is something that did not happen under you people for 26 years. For 26 years you did nothing.

It is important that we place on the record that what we have seen today is a one-sided representation of the government's encouragement for representatives of employees and employers in this country to improve our industrial relations system, encourage enterprise bargaining and a range of other activities that improve the workplace.

         I pay tribute to the government's efforts in supporting employer organisations in one of my duty electorates. I had the pleasure of presenting grants from the government that were not mentioned earlier today to two employers in the very safe Liberal seat of Forrest: Albany Woollen Mills Ltd and the Bunbury City Council. Both those organisations received grants from this government similar to the ones referred to today to encourage enterprise bargaining within their workplaces. Far from only funding trade unions, we have a very comprehensive and even-handed approach to improving industrial relations and productivity in this country.

         The classic example of that is what happened in relation to minimum wage conditions in Western Australia. Under the previous Labor administration, minimum wages were set within an award context by the industrial commission after it heard argument from the employers and the trade unions about the appropriate minimum wage. Therefore, an independent umpire set that minimum wage.

         What we are seeing in Western Australia under the Liberal IR policies is that they have given the right to the Liberal industrial relations minister to set minimum wages. He recently got a recommendation from the industrial commission as to what that rate should be. He decided to reduce that recommended increase by 30 per cent. He set the new minimum wage in Western Australia at a lower rate than the one recommended by the industrial commission. He did not have to worry about the influence of unions in the system.

I do not believe that the point of order raised by Senator Campbell is a point of order.

         I congratulate unions and employers on the role they have played in this country. Under Labor governments, they will continue to receive encouragement and support. I am proud to say that in this chamber we have a number of former representatives of those organisations. I point to Senator Herron who was an official, as I understand it, of the most powerful union in Australia, the AMA. I point to Senator Crane who was a member of the Farmers Federation, another very strong and effective trade union in Australia. So we are lucky to have former representatives of trade unions represented on both sides of this chamber, and I am sure that that adds to the strength of representation in the Senate.

         This government is prepared to hand out millions upon millions of taxpayers' money to their union mates to be used for ostensibly blatant political purposes. Laura Tingle's article—and she is called Laura Tingle, Senator Murphy; the honourable senator wanted to make some obscene, sexist point about Laura Tingle because he did not happen to agree with what she wrote in the article—did not tell the Australian taxpayers one important thing. Senator Short referred to it, and that was in relation to the hidden gifts that this Australian Labor Party government gives to its union mates.

I agree with Senator Cooney that, in the balance of these things, commonsense means that there are others on the other side who probably want to jump. There may be a couple more over that way. Does that become a precedent? It is up to the chair to try and keep a balance of interleaving speakers and make a prospective or retrospective judgment about circumstances.

         —Thank you, Madam Deputy President, and I thank Senator Cooney for his usual wisdom. I want to say in this debate that Senator Short has massively understated the nature of the problem. Senator Short, while being robust, has also been, if you like, almost reticent in outlining the full extent of this corrupt practice.

         Senator Short only referred to the evident expenditure and donations to the Labor Party for political purposes, when we all know there were other donations. And I refer the Senate, if people have forgotten, to a speech I made last week relating to the Australian Workers Union where $58,000 was transferred from an AWU slush fund in Queensland, I think it was, to the firm of Phillips Fox and Partners, a legal firm.

         This was a repayment of a donation by Phillips Fox to a slush fund in the AWU for electoral purposes. I do not know, frankly, whether that was for electoral purposes of a particular faction within the AWU—it would be a pretty big donation, if it were—or whether it was a way of getting around the electoral laws and not being revealed. It does seem extraordinary when I look at this list that the only donation I see from the Australian Workers Union to the Labor Party is for $35,144. That seems to me to massively understate the volume of effort and support the AWU put into the Labor Party at the last election.

         Apart from anything else, there were teams of unionists involved—I understand, at the expense of the union offices—in campaigning and printing, delivering and distributing campaign material not only in the workplace but in suburban letterboxes. In other words, the union machine, which involves a large administrative operation, was massively diverted at election time into huge support of the Labor Party. At whose cost? It was a hidden cost. It is not costed or revealed. Yet it was at the cost of the Australian worker.

         That is why I say, apart from any other evidence of hiding this sort of thing, that there is no doubt that Senator Short was significantly understating the financial contribution by the union movement to the Labor Party at the last election, a contribution which was compensated by the government. We see here—and for example I will pick the AWU—that the AWU received grants in 1992-93 of $135,000. But it reveals that its involvement in political donations was only $35,144.

         I want to talk a little bit about TUTA and the money spent by the government in the training of trade unionists. As would be well known to people in this chamber, and generally in the community, people who work for big business for many years have had the opportunity of training in the areas of economics, human resources and personnel management through university courses that to a great degree were financed by all types of governments from time to time over many years.

         Trade union officials and activists within the trade union movement were never able to take advantage of those particular courses because of their disadvantaged backgrounds or the fact that they had to go to work very early in their working careers—at 14, 15 or 16 years of age. The unions themselves—some in particular, and the metalworkers union was an outstanding one—and the ACTU expended quite a substantial amount of their income to begin the training of activists in the trade union movement. It was obviously seen by the Labor Party and others in the community to be a useful practice because it led to more responsible unionism, it led to people having the ability to negotiate meaningfully, and it did head off many a confrontation in industry.

         The particular seminar I attended talked about the agricultural industry and how people could make a contribution towards making it a bigger and better industry that would provide increased income for people on the land and also for trade unionists working in the processing, transport and other industries. I recall that people were invited to that seminar from business—from Elders and other areas—and they made a very good contribution. There was a collective approach. It was all intended to create further wealth in the community and thus benefit the whole community. It was intended to establish an opportunity for people to cooperate, for people to be in every way supportive of each other and to head off any type of confrontation. It was also designed to develop the sort of communications that enhance this particular process.

It was very constructive, and I believe the money was well spent.

        I was the subject of two days of media saturation, assertions of the nature which I have just outlined. You will recall, Madam Deputy President, that at the time I chose to make no response. I declined to respond in any way on the allegations. Subsequently, I made a brief statement in the Senate denying the claim, and the Australian Federal Police also put out a brief statement denying the assertion. That was only done with grave reluctance by me. I did not want the facts or the reasons for their inquiries to be exposed because it was what one might loosely describe as a covert operation and it was likely to be compromised if I made any statement. So I and my family put up for two days with my being accused of threatening somebody's life because I thought it was more important that the proper processes of investigation be pursued, whatever price I had to pay.

It is on that basis that you seek to make your personal explanation, to explain why you were misrepresented. The Senate does not have anything before it at the moment.

The Australian Federal Police attended my office on several occasions as a result of a complaint by me. That complaint was that I was subject to what I would euphemistically describe as blackmail. In fact, they were threats. They were offences under section 28 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act that carry a penalty of three years imprisonment—

Firstly, Senator Crichton-Browne would make life a lot easier for some of us if he would read the passage that he says includes a misrepresentation and which he says concerns him. He seems reluctant to do that. Secondly, I understood what he was doing was seeking to argue that it was said that he had threatened someone. That does not seem to be the argument that he is developing at the moment, unless I have missed something that is fundamentally obvious to everyone else.

         Obviously, it is very serious if it is said that a member of parliament has threatened someone. Clearly, that member of parliament—I do not think it has been done in the correct form here—has the right to put the record straight. That does not seem to be what this is about now. This seems to be about the role played by a third party or the conduct of a third party. I am relying on the rather technical point which is that the misrepresentation has not been set out. I think I have good reason to rely on that technical point. The basis of the explanation that has been given so far does not relate to what the honourable senator said it would relate to and that is an accusation that he made a threat against some person or persons.

My wife, I might tell you, Senator Hill, and I hope you will not take a point of order here, was the recipient of a disgusting and foul letter put into her letterbox without an envelope which my son collected after school. So hurt and humiliated by it was he that he hid it under a tissue box. When his mother got home, and after being terribly agitated for several hours when he should have been doing his homework, he said, `Mum, there is under that tissue box a piece of paper I think you should read.' It was a most disgusting, vile piece of paper written to my wife and stuck in the letterbox deliberately, in my view, intended that my children should read it, otherwise it would have been in an envelope.

         As I understand him, he said that he made a complaint on the basis of communications he received, which he believed may have been in breach of the Crimes Act. As a result of that, certain investigations were carried out. That is very interesting, but certainly no suggestion of any misrepresentation has been made clear to me in this chamber today, which is the basis upon which he has sought leave to explain away. He has to be brought back to that. Otherwise, Madam Deputy President, as you correctly said, if he wants to, there are opportunities and procedures whereby he can certainly come in here and talk about complaints he made and actions that were taken upon those complaints.

         —Senator Crichton-Browne should understand that we have already squeezed out the matter of public importance on the issue of long-term unemployment today. The next item of business is the industrial disruption in Western Australia. Both are very important public issues. Before I get jumped upon, I am not saying that they are of greater importance than an allegation that is made against an honourable senator that he made death threats—I actually do not think they are. But we have had 20 minutes and if we had started off with putting on the table the public statement of the concern to the senator, which we still do not have—the Senate had it denied it, which we finally got to after 20 minutes and then heard the case in support of the denial—the matter would have been resolved by now. I still have this document on which you sought leave. I have got to page 2 of 128 pages. I do not know what the plan is in relation to that.

Otherwise, if you want to talk about the role others may have played in different matters or other investigations, then there are occasions, and proper occasions, on which it can be done within the forms of this place.

         —In debating the Australian Dairy Corporation's report, I would like to take the opportunity now to say that the actions of the United States government in relation to dairy exports from their country have been a matter of great concern to the dairy industry in this country. Obviously, the Australian Dairy Corporation is, in some respects, at the front line of what the government has done.

         I take this opportunity to say that before the Senate rose for the last recess I made some comments about the dairy industry, in particular the subsidies that the Americans were paying on powdered milk product going from the United States to the Philippines. I said to the Senate that I would be raising that matter on a visit to Washington which was to occur in June-July.

         I feel it proper that I take this opportunity to recount the meeting I had at the United States Department of Agriculture. Through the courtesy of the United States Information Service and government officials in the United States I had the opportunity to meet with the senior official in the United States Department of Agriculture who is responsible for the allocation of export enhancement program subsidies for agricultural exports. The farm bill sets out a certain amount of money available to EEP. This official and his assistants allocate that portion of the farm bill to particular subsidies on particular products in particular markets.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I thought it was appropriate to raise that subject with him and to say, as I hope honourable senators from both sides of the chamber would say, that it is not satisfactory that these subsidies are used to corrupt an otherwise incorrupt market. The response from the Department of Agriculture was as follows: `It is only 3,000 tons of powdered milk product.' They did not believe that had the effect of corrupting the market.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That may be the honestly held view of the United States Department of Agriculture. It should be a matter of record that that is not the honestly held view of the Australian dairy industry. Subsidies of this nature undermine the integrity of free trade in agricultural products. Subsidies of this nature destroy the fair market price, in this case for powdered milk products in the Philippines.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         After an enormous amount of discussion—the argument went on for about 20 minutes—the official in question was forced to concede that every time the United States uses EEP subsidies there are some winners and there are some losers. He concluded that obviously in this case Australia was the loser.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is an important concession, for the simple reason that hitherto United States trade policy has been predicated, at least in so far as EEP is concerned, on the basis that these subsidies are not intended to corrupt the international market but are intended to protect the international market. The argument that the American government has advanced hitherto has been that these subsidies are used only when the European Community subsidises similar product into that market. The subsidy is designed to neutralise the advantage to the Europeans of their subsidy.

         In this case they indicated that we were the losers, not the Europeans. They indicated that Australia was the loser under that subsidy. That should be a matter of great concern. It is also a matter that everybody in primary industry should note. Deep in their hearts the American government must know that what they are doing is damaging to us. I renew the appeal I made there and then that these subsidies should stop because they are damaging the trade of friends of the United States. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —This is the last report of the Horticultural Policy Council. The Horticultural Policy Council has been succeeded by an organisation known as Horticulture 2000 Group, which I chair. The Horticultural Policy Council has had a couple of priorities while it has been in existence over the last five or six years. One of those priorities was to bring about the establishment of a peak body representing horticultural producers in this country. Secondly, the council has been responsible for stimulating debate about a range of policy matters relating to horticultural industries in this country.

         Certainly, the policy council succeeded very well in the second of those objectives. Over the last few years, it has commissioned a number of reports which deal with fostering particularly the export development of horticultural industries. There are over 100 horticultural industries in this country, ranging from bananas, to citrus, to apples and to walnuts. A number of those industries are sunrise industries, new industries, where a number of critical issues—such as research and development, processing and marketing—are very important in the early stages of development of those industries.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The horticultural industries have been traditionally largely domestically oriented, but a significant change is occurring in that they are now searching for international markets, particularly in Asia. A number of the reports that the Horticultural Policy Council commissioned have stimulated debate not just in the horticultural sector but in the broader agricultural sector.

         The Horticultural Policy Council sits along with the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, another organisation that this government established, that is funded dollar for dollar of R&amp;D for the various horticultural industries. That organisation began in 1988, I think, with quite small funding of $1 million. It is now $15 million or $16 million a year. So it is providing a significant research element in the horticultural sector. We also have the Australian Horticultural Corporation, which is primarily concerned with promotional and marketing type activities.

         I would like to place on record the government's appreciation to John Pendrigh, the Chairman of the Horticultural Policy Council. John recognised that the first of its goals that I have mentioned here today—the creation of a peak industry body for horticultural producers in this country—was a very difficult goal to attain. Horticulture is characterised by over 100 different industry segments that are very decentralised with tens of thousands of producers. It is not easy to activate an industry organisation to represent horticultural growers in this country. I know that John Pendrigh and the other members of the Horticultural Policy Council came to the conclusion that that task—despite a significant number of seminars and conferences around the country at both national and regional levels—was, to some extent, beyond them.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The council took a view that, with the creation of Horticulture 2000 by this government, the ongoing stimulation and development of policy could be well handled by Horticulture 2000 and that the Horticultural Policy Council should therefore cease to exist. That is why the report before the Senate is the council's last report. I would like to place on record my thanks particularly to the chair, John Pendrigh. John has been involved in a number of other primary industry activities for this government. He is a man of wide respect and deep experience in the wine industry.

         —The Meat Research Corporation states that the goal of the Japan-Korea markets key program was `to enhance the ability of producers and processors to maximise benefits from the expanding beef markets in Japan and Korea'. Last year when I was on a delegation in Japan and Korea, we saw how the Aussie beef program was going. We picked up one piece of beef one day and had a look at it and it had `Aussie beef' on it. I was expecting to see `Product of Australia', but I saw on it `Product of the United States of America', and I made mention of it in this place. That is how successful the program was. Unfortunately, the Americans were using it, and they have actually used it to good effect, because they have increased market share in Japan and have done a very good job.

        I notice that in the report under the heading `Input requirements for the cattle feedlot industry'—and they are very big—there are some very good figures on the number of cattle that were grain fed in Australia in 1994. The domestic figure was something like 1.2 million, and the export figure was just under 800,000—a total of two million-plus. The optimistic estimates are that in the year 2002 there will be something like 2.6 million grain fed cattle. The pessimistic estimates are that there are not going to be many more than there are now.

         The amount of grain used to feed cattle, of course, is very important to the grain producers in Australia, because it is a wonderful value adding product when export beef goes through the feedlot industry in Australia, and the best estimate is that about 1.6 million tonnes will be used in the year 2002.

         What is of concern to me in this report, which is very well laid out, is the foot and mouth disease status of some of the countries of Latin America, and that is what we have to look out for as beef producers. We have to be competitive, and I will make some points about our competitiveness in a moment. Uruguay is expected to soon be free of foot and mouth disease. The Mesopotamia area of Argentina is expected to be free between 1997 and the year 2000. Paraguay is expected to be free in the year 2005. And Brazil is expected to be free between the years 1997 and 2000. Brazil has something like 144 million cattle, mostly Nellore, so it is going to be a very big competitor with us.

         The problem we have as beef producers in Australia, which brings me to the point of the input costs, is that we have a government at the moment that has actually paid lip-service to all our export industries. One of the points that has been made in this report is about the technical barriers to trade, including meat inspection requirements. We all know about that; we are having an inquiry at the moment into the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The report talks about the problems with hormonal growth promotants and the minimum residue levels, with which we have just recently had a big problem with helix into Japan.

         The point that is really going to make a big difference to beef producers in the future is our competitiveness. The Keating Labor government have not done anything to make us competitive as far as waterfront charges are concerned; they have not made us competitive with our transport costs in Australia. Our transport costs really have a big impact on beef producers. We have wholesale taxes, fuel excise and those sorts of things. Onto the farm and off the farm transport costs are always very big.

         We still have the capital gains tax on us as beef producers—de facto death duties. Inflation costs have gone up more than the government thought and more than their good friend Bernie Fraser at the Reserve Bank thought. That is going to make all the input costs to our farming, especially to our beef producers, so much more difficult to bear in the future. It is not going to keep us as a competitive nation.

         The New Zealanders are doing us like a dinner as far as competitiveness with beef exports into Japan and Korea are concerned. If we are going to be competitive, we have to get those things right. Basically, we have to have our transport costs and our waterfront fixed up so we can compete with the rest of the world.

         yesterday for the excellent work they are doing—to illustrate the very noisy and disruptive opposition that we have in the chamber. I listened in silence to their comments about the Meat Research Corporation report but, unfortunately, they do not do the same thing. There is a continual disruption by the opposition because they do not have any policies; all they can do is criticise and say, `We have some policies, but we are hiding them and we will produce them some time.' But back to the meat industry, the third and critical issue for the meat industry—and this is where comparisons with countries like New Zealand are not directly relevant—is that we have a significant transport cost because of distance from the port. That is a very critical cost factor.

It is an unfortunate fact that many of the meatworks around this country are inefficient not because of their labour practices but because their technology systems are outmoded.

         In recent times the minister for disasters, the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, has called down his wrath on what was a good organisation. The former Managing Director, Mr Bill Swingler, left on 31 July 1995; the reason being the minister took away from the FAC the right to charge at airports. Notwithstanding the debt and the job they did, the landing charges in Australia were among the lowest in the world. He decided to take that away so Mr Swingler came to the conclusion that he did not have much of a role left.

Except for two years, his entire career has been in the trade union movement. He has been put on the board of the Federal Airports Corporation. What are his qualifications?

But do not blame us when government speakers get up and respond to your outrageously personal attacks, which is symptomatic of your lack of policy debate—and the policies you do have you want to keep hidden. We really have to prise out of you the so-called tax policy and industrial relations policy.

         Let me return to Mr Peter Sams, who is a member of the Federal Airports Corporation. Firstly, I would make the point that I am not a member of the right. I think my factional allegiances are well known. I am in the centre left. So I am not a factional colleague, I am not even from New South Wales. My father was born there, and you will probably link that in some way to the right. I know Peter Sams very well. He is the secretary of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council. That is what gives him an appropriate background to be on the Federal Airports Corporation board.

         Hobart and Launceston are two of the four airports that we are proud to have in Tasmania. It is pleasing to note that the profitability of both the Hobart and Launceston airports has increased significantly. Hobart's profitability is $796,000, and Launceston's is approximately $706,000. The sale of the lease of these two airports, not the freehold sale, will take place some time in the next couple of years. It will certainly take place upon this government's return. This is part of an important aspect of government budget strategy, which is to bridge the relatively small deficit with some asset sales.

         What do we have from the opposition, who support in principle selling off everything, including Telecom? They are saying that they will not agree to the sale of airports unless we fix up the noise at Sydney airport and spread the noise around. `Share the pain' were the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). What an irresponsible approach. They have sabotaged the government's budget. They have no policies of their own. They will hold up the sale of an asset because they do not like the noise at Sydney airport. Five years ago, they were telling us to put in the second runway at Sydney. What an irresponsible approach from the opposition.

        I am conscious of the time. We are to move on to a debate about minimum wages shortly. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry report are very important. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is one of the most important institutions in this country. Why is it so important? It is important because, unlike most other countries in the Western world, including most countries around the world, we have an independent arbitration system which determines, through awards, minimum wages and conditions for workers throughout the country, certainly in the federal system.

         At the moment, workers, whether in a union or not, are covered by their particular industrial award. The awards set out in a very comprehensive form the various classifications for each industry with their particular rate of pay and their various conditions—superannuation funds, hours of work, overtime rates and matters of that like.

         The important thing about awards, arbitrated and determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, is that they protect workers who are not in a strong bargaining position. How would we like it if individual workers had to front up to their employer and individually negotiate their wages and conditions and overtime rates? How would you have equal bargaining power with an individual, sitting down with an employer and asking for a job and having to argue about what they are going to be paid and their conditions of employment?

         I submit to the Senate that without an Australian Industrial Relations Commission to determine these awards independently from the individual employee and the employer at the workplace, workers in this country, if required to individually negotiate with their employer, would be at an enormous disadvantage. I see a lot of young people in the gallery. It is nice to see them here. But imagine what would happen if they, as individual schoolchildren, had to negotiate with their school teachers about their attendance at school?

       In speaking to this motion before the chamber today it is my intention to correct the lie that has been perpetrated on the Australian people in terms of the campaign being run in Western Australia and the sorts of outbursts we just heard across the chamber. I do not know how those opposite in all honesty can stand up and collectively shout across the chamber that we hate workers. It is absolutely unbelievable that they can do that.

        In my time today I want to demonstrate how in many instances employees do better under Liberal than they do under Labor, both under the state systems and under the federal system. I want to deal firstly with the situation which has existed in Western Australia for many years with regard to the minimum rates of pay under both Liberal and Labor governments.

        As far back as I can remember—I have not gone back to the day dot—there has been a minimum rate of pay in Western Australia. During the period of the last Labor government in Western Australia, the minimum rate of pay fell gradually in real terms. From when Premier Brian Burke came to office it fell from $327.50 in real terms to $300.25 in real terms when Lawrence lost government. There were some variations, but I am not going to go through every detail. Seeing as the children were brought into this debate by the previous speaker, I make the point that it was under Sir Charles Court when he was Premier of Western Australia back in 1981 that equal pay was granted to men and women. It is very interesting that equal pay was granted to males and females in 1981.

        Let us now look at the situation which has exised since the so-called Court wave of industrial relations. For the first time in five years there has been an increase in real terms in the minimum wage. It has increased in real terms by $17 to the current figure of $317.10. I think that shows fairly clearly the direction that minimum wages have taken.

        The other point I must make—which is not consistent with the other states—is that this gives protection right across the board. It gives protection to those who are under awards if their awards have not been adjusted upwards. It gives protection to those who wish to go into an agreement. It also gives protection to those who have no award or agreement coverage. Western Australia is the only state that does that. It is worth looking at that particular aspect.

        Last night we heard a contribution from Senator Chris Evans. I want to comment on a couple of aspects of his speech because he was wrong in so many areas. He said that employees had the protection of everything in awards under the federal system but they do not have it in Western Australia. Under the Western Australian legislation employees have the option of staying within the Western Australian award or going out. There is a duress clause included. When Senator Sherry was in the chamber I sought leave to have this duress clause incorporated. It is a very strict clause. People on the other side of the chamber should take note of it. I seek leave to have this one page document incorporated.

        I wish to move to that part of the motion which deals with a series of federal awards which are under the direct responsibility of the Keating government. These awards are significantly below the Western Australian minimum. From the research we have done in the last few days we have discovered that the 1993 commercial industrial artists federal award has two classifications out of 10 that are under the Western Australian state minimum. We discovered that five out of five junior rates are under the Western Australian junior rates minimum.

I sought leave from Senator Sherry to table these particular awards so that people can see them.

        Of the classifications in those awards we find that 50 out of 84 have adult rates below the Western Australian minimum. I find that absolutely remarkable when we hear the nonsense that is being pedalled on the other side of the chamber and which has been put out in Western Australia. These awards are significantly below those of Western Australia. If these people were under state awards the rate of pay would have to be increased to the minimum established under the Western Australian legislation. This points out very clearly that in many areas the rates of pay to individuals under federal awards are significantly lower than those in Western Australia.

        I want to quote a few awards to put them on the public record, but I will seek leave in a moment to table these various awards. Let us take the squash court industry interim federal award. For the first classification, the federal award is $260.60 per week, versus the WA minimum of $317.10. If we go a little bit further down the table, we find $266.50 versus $317.10. One would wonder why this federal government does not like theatrical employees. Listed under theatrical employees we find Bibra Lakes Adventure World, which is worth visiting. It is a very nice place; I would commend it to anyone in this chamber. For Adventure World, which is under the federal award, we find 11 out of 11 sit in a classification on $288.15, versus the minimum rate of $317.10. One can go on working these things through.

        To come in here and suggest that the $246.10 rate per clause 9 of the metal industry award is a real rate of pay that exists in the metal industry is wrong. It demonstrates that you have forgotten anything you knew or are deliberately forgetting anything you knew about the process of minimum rates adjustment under the Accord or through the federal Industrial Relations Commission and the process of establishing supplementary payments. I am sure you remember these things. You were involved in some of those proceedings. I will come back to that in a little while. That was when you were in the pastoral industry.

        The minimum rate under the metal industry award is $341.40. That is the base rate, plus the supplementary payment, plus the safety net adjustment. That rate is an entry level rate. It has application to very few people. When people with little or no qualifications or experience come into the industry, they start on that rate. They pretty quickly move up through the classification structure to the higher rates, generally after three to six months.

        If you understand anything about the way the federal award system operates, about how supplementary payments were introduced into federal awards and how awards were reconstructed by broadbanding classifications to base them on skill rather than on strict demarcation lines, you will understand that even that rate of $341.40 is a very bare minimum. In fact, people in the industry were getting paid well in excess of that.

        When the supplementary payments were introduced into federal awards some years ago, what actually happened was that this produced some of the biggest wage increases for workers on minimum rates in this country that we have ever seen. People in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, people in the hospitality and hotels industry under federal awards, people in the rural industry, people in small manufacturing industries all received huge increases because of the introduction of supplementary payments.

        The process was actually called the minimum rates adjustment process. It was endorsed by the federal commission whereby there would be adjustments to federal awards—particularly those for low income workers, people on low minimum rates of pay—to bring their award rates of pay up to more reasonable levels. It was particularly targeted at those people working in industries with little industrial clout that did not have the industrial strength or capacity that people in other industries may have had to go out and bargain for over-award payments. That is what this debate is very much about: it is about providing through an award system protection for people who are at the lower end of the income scale in terms of award coverage.

        Nevertheless, the point is that the figures quoted and used by Senator Crane and others on the opposition side are completely and utterly false. It is a deliberate distortion to use that rate, and Senator Jacinta Collins will take that issue up in her contribution. What also has to be remembered in this process is that award rates of pay are not set by trade unions and are not set by federal or state Labor governments; award rates of pay are set by the Industrial Relations Commission.

        The people who have done most to oppose any increases for low income workers over the years are those people sitting on the opposite side of the chamber; those opposite whose colleagues out there in the employer organisations have, on every single occasion bar the last couple, opposed national wage increases. When the commission awarded an $8, $10 or $12 wage increase or a two per cent wage increase, it did so after hearing opposition to those increases from the employer ranks and from the coalition parties. You are the people who have constantly argued throughout the 1980s and the 1990s that low income workers should not get any national wage increases at all; yet you have the hide to come in here and say, `Look at these rates, they're too low.'

We heard a few comments about ancient history.

        But what he forgot to tell us was the situation of the lowly paid farmers at that time. In many instances, they were loss making farmers who clearly could not afford to pay any more in wages at that time and who, because of the abuse of union power by the likes of Senator Forshaw and his mates, in the end were forced to increase wages despite the fact that they could not afford to pay them. This is what we see from the Labor Party side. They do not recognise the impact that increased wages, unless they are matched by increased productivity, have on the costs of production and on the capacity not only of farmers, but of all our industry to compete in the international marketplace.

The advertisement that the Labor Party put in the Western Australian newspapers recently is yet another example of Labor's lies in the run-up to the next federal election. Western Australian Labor politicians seem to struggle with the concept of truth, whether in relation to advertising or best recollections.

Why can't you accept that in relation to industrial relations? The answer to that is that you do not want to. It is quite clear that you do not want to.

The record is what is occurring in the states such as Western Australia, where people are being engaged as casuals only at an hourly rate of $9.10. They have an entitlement to bereavement leave and nothing else. There are no penalty rates, overtime provisions, holiday loadings or annual leave or sick leave entitlements. There is just a casual hourly rate of $9.10. Tell me this: how will the disadvantage test protect those people? It will not, because it is not based on a real base.

       That is the position. We have seen nothing from the opposition. They would not tell us anything different, nor indeed tell the Australian people anything different. So what have they chosen? They have chosen this sort of smokescreen approach and to say, `Under you people, Australian workers' wages have actually gone backwards.' The reality is that they have increased by seven per cent. Household disposable income has increased by 40 per cent.

        You said, `Our position has changed.' I thought, `I'll give you people a bit of a go here.' So I looked to Mr Reith and to what he has said on a few occasions. I will quote him on how he sees employment contracts. Laurie Oakes asks:

       Did you decide the big bang reform in industrial relations was the way to go?

       It certainly reinforced my view. The labour contracts will really open up the economy, help lower costs of production.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know Senator O'Chee seems to have all of the knowledge—he is the repository of all wisdom—but I do not know how you lower the cost of production without actually cutting wages. Productivity under this government has improved out of sight. For 26 years this country had a coalition government, and productivity went backwards. If you really are going to lift productivity in this country, you better tell people how you are going to do it and, at the same time, meet the claim of huge wage increases that you are making to them. I am quite sure a lot of employers would be very interested to see how these people are going to do that as well. In terms of unfair dismissal, Mr Reith says:

       Well, we'd abolish the court. We would also reinstate effective secondary boycott provisions.

       That is the hypocrisy in the opposition's argument with regard to industrial relations. You say that you are the workers' friend. When this government sought to remove draconian legislation and gave the workers back the right to negotiate on a fair and equitable basis, why did you oppose it? That is what is important. You have to tell the Australian public, you have to tell the Australian workers, where you really stand. We have Mr Reith on awards. The interviewer says:

       Will there be scope for wage rises under the award system as you seek it?

      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Yes, but that obviously is going to change over time as the nature of awards change.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know what that means, and I think the workers know what that means. That means that if you go into an enterprise agreement and the award is no longer in effect, you people will abolish the awards, as you did in Victoria.

        Let us look at Victoria in terms of wages and conditions and what Mr Kennett did. The Victorian government recently applied to the Victorian Industrial Commission for an hourly wage rate of less than $8.60. That brings up about $312 per week—between $16,500 and $17,000 per year. That is a joke. What have you consistently told the people? You have said there will be four fundamental aspects to your wages and conditions policy: there will be a single minimum hourly wage, four weeks annual leave, 12 months unpaid parental leave, and 10 days non-cumulative sick leave. What happens to penalty rates? What happens to all of those things that workers have to have to survive? You people say that their wages and conditions are so low that we have not moved their wages and conditions forward enough, yet you are purporting to take all of those things off them.

        I want to look at another little matter with regard to where you people really come from, and that is employing people to break strikes. I refer to a person who is being used to break strikes, a Mr Bruce Townsend, who is currently in Queensland. He is being paid by employers, supported by you lot, to break strikes and to crush workers, tapping their phones and doing all sorts of other things to them. They even had to shift an Industrial Relations Commission hearing in Queensland because the place was bugged. Bugged by whom?—by Mr Townsend and a few others who are being paid cash in hand, avoiding tax and doing all the sorts of things that you people support. That is hypocrisy. You ought to be ashamed of the fact that you come into this chamber and purport to say that we do not represent workers sufficiently and that you are the workers' friend.

He failed to add that when the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was Premier of Western Australia between 1991 and 1992 the minimum weekly wage was $268.80; and, further, that wage rates in a series of federal awards which are under the direct responsibility of the Keating government are significantly below the Western Australian state minimum.

That attempt fell flat. The federal government has been desperate to peg back the gap in the polls before Christmas.

        As evidence of the failure of that Western Australian blockade, there was nothing more pitiful than the most pathetic address of the head of the ACTU, Jennie George, before only 200 demonstrators on the day of the blockade. I think that said it all. The workers did not come out to support the union- and government-led blockade.

        Is it little wonder that union membership is at crisis level? It is now only 35 per cent of the work force. If you take out the Public Service—some 60 per cent of the Public Service is unionised—only 25 per cent of workers in this country are members of a union.

        You only have to look at the Asahi case as evidence that the non-union workers of Australia really do want to have the opportunity to negotiate directly with their employers. The unions should know that one of the main reasons they have had such a fall in union membership is that Australian workers feel so alienated from their union heads and bosses. They feel left out of any of the benefits that the union bosses seem to be getting. Many of them happen to get the benefits of a term in the parliament, jobs on government boards or direct grants to their union offices. There have been some $100 million in direct grants to unions by this government in the last 10 or so years—$16 million in the last 12 months.

        We only have to look to the last week or two to see one of the best reasons workers feel so alienated from their unions. That came from one of the most prominent union bosses, Mr Bill Kelty. The integrity of the union superannuation funds was put at risk because Mr Bill Kelty sought to intimidate, if not blackmail, the AMP Society with regard to union superannuation funds. It had nothing to do with the daily lives of the workers; it had nothing to do with their welfare. It had more to do with the board dispute at Coles Myer.

        I think the first mistakes of the union movement were made in around 1987 when they started to introduce the plan to reconstruct the unions to the point where they would have only some 20 major unions. That was a Kelty plan also, entitled

        . The government gave them some $40 million to introduce that plan for superunions. History shows that that has been an utter failure because it has further alienated workers. In fact, the amalgamation of many of these unions has really been not to the benefit of the workers or for the care of the workers but for simple power plays and factional plays within the unions.

        The workers feel even more alienated when they see the stronger unions that have come about because of these amalgamations, like the Transport Workers Union. They have been able to grab greater pay rises outside the government's much-loved Accord. The Transport Workers Union recently won a 15 per cent pay rise. This has had a cascading effect on workers in other industries. In fact, it has put them at a great disadvantage. In many respects, a protection racket is being run where the big, powerful unions are able to use their muscle to get huge pay rises to the detriment of workers in other industries. All of these costs, particularly in the Transport Workers Union, cascade throughout the economy.

        The same is true for the Western Australian blockade. It never related to jobs or the welfare of the workers. It simply related to the empowering of the union. In fact, the industrial relations reforms brought in by the Court government had more to do with empowering the workers, if you look at some of the proposed changes, such as a form of secret ballots. That point, I hear today, is under negotiation.

        Another proposed change is that workers will have the right to prevent expenditure of their membership fees on political donations. Why shouldn't they have that choice? It will be only a choice as they see fit. Employees can nominate their own superannuation fund, and union officials must adopt modern principles of financial accounting. What is wrong with that? Because it is all for the benefit of the workers.

        This pattern of government interference in the industrial relations of this country and union bosses getting together, as they have in Western Australia, has flowed through to the Tweed Valley case, a well-known and publicised case. In this case, workers have successfully negotiated with their employer, on a one-on-one basis, to cash out their sick leave. I believe they did not cash out all their sick leave; it was only half or some three or four days—just a part of their sick leave entitlements. When you look at the details of this case, you will find that they were allowed to take the full sick leave, but some of the days were not on pay.

        Because they were not taking their whole sick leave throughout the year, the workers decided to trade that off and to cash it out to have the advantage of something they were not receiving anyway. The government happened to think that was a very stupid idea. It treated the workers as if they were stupid and that they needed the union to tell them otherwise. This was the very basis of Labor's approach to the Tweed Valley case.

        The government did not think the workers were bright enough to make their own decision. The example of this is on 26 September, when the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, Gary Johns, said on TV that the Tweed Valley workers `traded away their right to sickness leave. That's a stupidity. They shouldn't be doing that'. If they shouldn't be doing that, why hasn't the government interfered in other examples of enterprise bargaining where similar circumstances have arisen? The reason is that the Tweed Valley case was a political move by the government to try to highlight a fear campaign against the industrial relations intentions of the coalition.

         The committee followed its normal practice of writing to the person who raised the matter with the select committee, Mr Peter Jesser, a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Business at the University of Southern Queensland, and to Professor Craig Littler, who was specifically mentioned in the report. The committee has received a submission from Mr Jesser, which it has attached as Appendix A to this report.

Today Senator Troeth and I, along with a number of other colleagues, planned to speak on this matter in a matter of public importance which, because of procedures of the Senate, did not come on this afternoon. I would just like to read what that matter of public importance was:

        The appalling and entrenched levels of long-term unemployment and the failure of the Keating government to address this scourge that is crippling Australian society.

       <para>
        What we have, and what I would like to draw to people's attention, is a government here which is covering up what is happening with unemployment in this country, particularly the plight of the long-term unemployed. It is only when you have bodies like Senate committees that delve into matters in great depth do you find out what is really happening in this society.

         Such an opportunity came to the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee when we conducted a series of hearings into long-term unemployment right around Australia. We had witnesses in every state and major regional areas of Australia that told us the real story about unemployment in this country which is at incredibly high levels. Don't believe the official rate: you have to more than double the official rate to get to the real rate of unemployment in this country. In reality, back in the depths of our recent recession, we had more than 20 per cent of the country unemployed—not only registered people but also people who were underemployed. In other words, they worked one or two days a week and still could not find enough work.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Out of this whole group, the greatest concern should be about the long-term unemployed, whose numbers have risen over the last 10 years to almost 30 per cent of the total unemployed in this country. This is a matter of enormous concern about which the committee took evidence right around the country. I would just like to provide the Senate with some of the flavour of what is going on out there. Witnesses before us made the following comments:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I feel abandoned by the system . . . exploited by the system—abused by the system—and held captive by the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In an area like Whyalla, people told us this: `We are sick and tired of training for training sake. We are disillusioned with training programs that are getting us nowhere.' Another witness said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . participants in work experience programs . . . after six months of feeling really happy and that they are up and going, all of a sudden their placement ends . . . are dead in their tracks . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        This is probably the most tragic comment of all:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . it is more comfortable to remain lying in the gutter than to be picked up and dropped back in it again.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the despair that is out there with the long-term unemployed people. What our committee did manage to uncover was the way in which this government is covering up the extent of the problem. That is of tremendous danger to our society, because if we hide this problem then the people in the community are going to think, `Well, it's not such a problem,' and therefore public policy will not be directed towards them.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What we have developing in this country is a major underclass of people who have not had any work and do not have any prospect of having any work. There are in some areas of Australia up to three generations of people now who have never worked. That is a disgrace and a condemnation of this government's record.

         But what has the government done about it? Yesterday, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, came out and tried to tell us how well his programs under Working Nation were working. He was basing this on a report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Unfortunately, Senator Schacht, who answered my question in the Senate today, had not even bothered to look at this report and certainly had not even bothered to look at the minister's propaganda on this matter—at least he might have repeated that but he did not even do that. Let me read from the department's report how it says its programs are working, and I will read between the lines for you and tell you what it is really saying. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is a jobs compact and most people realise this is aimed at guaranteeing training and/or work to the long-term unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        How many people are in this jobs compact? The report says that there was a fall in the number of jobs compact clients from more than 300,000 in July 1994 to 275,800 in July 1995. What a marvellous drop that is! I remind people that the height of the boom was from mid-1994 to mid-1995. During this boom they managed to get the figure down by 24,000 people—that is, less than 10 per cent—and they are trying to say that this was a great success!
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the government's programs and strategies is case management. Let us look at how successful case management is. They were supposed to be moving a lot of case management into private contracting, to Employment Assistance Australia. How well has that been going over this period? There were 376,000 clients entering case management and 347,000 of those were with Employment Assistance Australia, which is the government body. The contracted case managers had only 29,500, according to that government report, which is less than 10 per cent. If you work that out across the whole of Australia by electorate, you find it is a minuscule number of people who have been put into this private case management system.

         One of the major criticisms of our committee was the way in which the government was supposed to be implementing Working Nation and that is reflected in these figures. It is incredibly slow to get things under way. The government set up this program to solve the problems of the long-term unemployed that came out of the last recession. At the speed they are travelling with this, we will be into the next recession before anything starts to happen. Yet yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was trying to say, and it is in the press today, how marvellous it is. Let us listen to what Simon Crean had to say:

        He was talking about June 1995. I have news for the minister. The figures are out for this month and it is not June. It is now October and the figure is on the rise. Unemployment is on the rise in this country. And today we found out that inflation is on the rise. What we have is the double whammy, the double loss, which is rising inflation and rising unemployment. That is the real picture of what is happening in this country.

         The government has not put in place programs to solve this problem. What they have done is called churning the dole queue. What that means, under its Working Nation program, is that people receive training and that is often combined with employment, which in principle is a good idea, but under the government training program this only works for six months. What happens at the end of six months? Our inquiry found that half of them do not get a job. What happens to that half? What happens is that they go back not onto the long-term list where they might have been for a few years with a whole lot of extra benefits and assistance but to the start of the queue. Those people have to wait for months to get any assistance. That is one of the major tragedies of the government's program. People whose self-esteem has risen lose that, and because they do not have the opportunities, they are less employable. That is one of the most negative outcomes of Working Nation.

         Those people who are in that situation are taken off the long-term list. The government is trying to make out how fast long-term unemployment is coming down. A lot of it, as I indicated, is the churning of the queue. It is the failure of Working Nation. I am glad that the Senate now has a report which tells the true story to the people of Australia—that Working Nation is not working.

          —There are three matters I want to address in the adjournment debate tonight. Firstly, I want to follow up on comments I made on Tuesday night of this week in the adjournment debate, when I got up and defended the Governor-General, His Excellency Bill Hayden, from some pretty severe attacks that were happening in sections of our media. I said this on that occasion:

         I contend in this place and will contend publicly that whatever any public figure does when that public figure is on holidays is that individual's own business. If they choose to go off to Banff in Canada and have a relaxing holiday and stay at hotels reported to cost 1,500 bucks a night, that is their business; it is nobody else's business.

          I would defend the Governor-General's right to move to Vancouver, as was reported in the same paper on Monday of this week. He is reported to have stayed at a hotel in Vancouver costing $1,350 per night. The Governor-General, Mr Hayden, is reported to have said that he got that hotel for $800 a night. Good on him. If it saves him a quid, I am all for that too. I reiterate: it is nobody else's business what he does when he is on holiday.

         They are the comments that are on the public record. It has been brought to my attention that it is our business, indeed everybody's business, what has gone on in Banff and Vancouver. It has been put to me that the bills that I have spoken about are, in fact, being picked up by the taxpayers of Australia. I have not immediately accepted those assertions. I have sought, by contacting the Governor-General's office, to get clarification of whether or not the taxpayers, through the credit cards issued at Government House, are paying for His Excellency Mr Hayden and his wife whilst they are on holidays in Canada. To date, I have not had a response to the query that went over to Government House yesterday.

          If, in the next two weeks, the inquiry comes back and what has been put to me is confirmed—that, indeed, the taxpayers are paying these bills—I will, when this parliament returns or possibly even before it returns, during estimates committees, be asking that His Excellency pay those, what I consider to be, personal bills out of his own personal account. I do not think the taxpayers of Australia should pay for the holidays of governors-general or parliamentarians. I would hope that what I have been told since is not the case and, if it is the case, I hope it would be rectified.

          The second matter I want to address is a matter of some good news and emanates from a memorandum of understanding which was signed between Australia and China on 25 January this year. Under the terms of that MOU, China agreed to the return and the continued protection of Sino-Vietnamese boat people who could confirm that they had been resettled as refugees in China after fleeing Vietnam in the 1970s and early 1980s.

          More than 800 people arrived illegally in Australia late last year and early this year. I am very pleased to report to the Senate that this morning a seventh group—this time of 96 people who were covered by the MOU, and the largest group so far—flew out of Port Hedland bound for Nanning in southern China. They had arrived in Australia between November last year and March this year in six boats codenamed the Brolga, the Galah, the Heron, the Jabiru, the Kookaburra and the Nightingale. As was the case with all previous six departures, this flight left without incident, and arrangements have been made in China for their safe arrival. This latest flight brings to 465 the number of people returned under the agreement.

I hope I do not live to regret the recognition of that fact, but a fact indeed it is. Certainly that fact has something to do with the fact that we are returning people who arrive illegally on our shores.

Senator McKiernan, an acting deputy president himself, knows that it is contrary to standing orders to reflect upon a member of any parliament. Ms Cheryl Edwardes is a member of the state parliament of Western Australia, and she is the Attorney-General. She has vigorously and quite properly denied any wrongdoing or receiving gifts of the nature outlined by Senator McKiernan. What Senator McKiernan is doing, with the greatest respect, is regurgitating and recycling untruths for political advantage. It is my view that he ought not be able to proceed any further in his attack upon Mrs Edwardes and in his reflection upon her integrity not only as a member of parliament but also as the Attorney-General of Western Australia.

         The government claims that since April 1993 employment growth has led to 670,000 new jobs. In fact, the recent recession destroyed 337,300 jobs, and the number of unemployed people still exceeds the worst figures at the peak of the recession in the early 1980s. The incidence of long-term unemployment at 30 per cent in Australia is much worse than the rate of approximately 15 per cent in Japan and 12 per cent in the United States. So the government's claim that its programs are having a significant impact is simply not true.

         Both in suburban and regional Australia, unemployment has become endemic in some areas. By the middle of 1994 there were 703,900 children aged between 0 and 14 years growing up in families where no parent was employed. The parents of more than half of those children, 448,200, were not in the labour force. Most were single parents, predominantly women, with caring responsibilities. In these areas, both in suburban and regional Australia, national programs must be tailored to the needs of those regions in order for them to have any chance of being effective. A program which will work in Tweed Heads may not necessarily work in Burnie.

         I have mentioned training programs. Let us look at some of those training programs and their outcomes. One of the programs specifically targeted to indigenous people is the community development employment project. The evidence put to the committee suggests that opinion in the Aboriginal community is divided about the benefits of the scheme. One indigenous witness told the committee:

        is also a way of disguising unemployment figures in terms of Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        That witness also contended that the CDEP failed to provide adequate training for future employment. The figures that I am about to quote relate to the status of clients about three months after program assistance had ended—that is, after they had been through a labour market training program. In regard to Aboriginal employment, 57.3 per cent were still unemployed three months after program assistance had ended; in jobtrain, 63.4 per cent were still unemployed; in job clubs, 59.4 per cent were still unemployed; in jobskills, 60.3 per cent were still unemployed; and, in the environmental program LEAP, 60.7 per cent were still unemployed. Even the most successful of these programs, jobstart, had a rate of 37.6 per cent unemployment three months after completion, so these programs simply are not working.

         If we look at the numbers of those in what is called continuing program assistance, the figures are even more interesting. For those who are uninitiated in DEETspeak, continuing program assistance means that people are in another training program three months after finishing the first one. Of these people—that is, those who have gone on to the second training program—48.2 per cent reappear in the office of labour market assistance; 30.1 per cent reappear in jobtrain; 27.4 per cent reappear in Aboriginal employment; 29.8 per cent in job clubs; and 19.1 per cent in LEAP. This is a damning indictment of what the government chooses to call a successful program to look after the interests of the unemployed.

         A recent international study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation ranked Australia fourth behind Norway, New Zealand and Britain in the growth of inequality in the 13 years from 1979 to 1992. At the heart of this inequity has been the inadequate growth of jobs since the 1970s and this government's failure to adequately tackle the problem of unemployment. The government have often quoted their version of the social wage based on models created by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling.

        When the actual incomes people receive are used, Labor's claim that the social wage is progressive is a sham. On the basis of actual incomes, the lowest earning 40 per cent of households receive 35.5 per cent of the money spent on the social wage, and the top earning 40 per cent of households receive 46.6 per cent.

         The government calculates the real increase in the social wage since 1983 as $736 for every Australian. This of course comes nowhere near the $7,000 absolute decline in household incomes in the poorest five per cent of neighbourhoods. This government likes to talk about the $2.2 billion it spent on Working Nation but, when all this rhetoric is laid aside, the government cannot escape the fact that there are still over 763,100 people classified as unemployed; and the long-term unemployed make up over one-third of that total.

         —I rise to share some thoughts on what I believe is an extremely significant change in community values in relation to the destruction of our ecologically precious old-growth forests. On Sunday, 8 October, St Francis Day, I was privileged to participate in an Earth Day mass at Christchurch, Claremont in my home state. It was an occasion of celebration, reverence for life and joy in which parishioners brought their animal family members for blessing and focused on our mutual needs to love and care for the earth.

         I am sure this was not the only St Francis Day celebration of this kind. I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to another gathering on Sunday, 8 October in Sydney, where a group of people from different churches called Christians for the Environment held a service called the `Celebration of the Gift of the Forest', choosing Lane Cove Valley because it was the first logging site in Sydney.

         Christian faith suggests that we are to work with God for the redemption of the whole world. Theologically and socially we argue that it is vital for us to nurture existing native forests and their biodiversity in order to work for a sustainable life style. The destruction of forests has an impact beyond the immediate areas where logging has taken place. The loss of old growth forests and wilderness areas means a loss to a whole diverse ecosystem of which human beings are a part. Loss of forests is a loss to this whole community of living things.

         The churches along with other groups have a role to play in reminding society of the giftedness of the forests and so to make a commitment to responsible management of these forests and wilderness areas. The current harvesting of old growth forests and wilderness areas is unsustainable. As whole ecosystems Forests must be nurtured and conserved rather than exploited and destroyed or reduced in size and potential. We seriously question selective logging given the importance of forest biodiversity. Wood production and supply must be taken from plantations. This is particularly so in relation to wood chips. Nothing to our mind represents the utter exploitation and devastation of the God given ecosystems more than wood chipping.

In any restructuring of the forest industry we, the churches, must commit ourselves to the support of people and communities whose lives currently depend on the forests for a living. We are indebted to their work for gifting us with wood products and for contributing to the life style we enjoy. The necessary restructuring of the forest industry must be undertaken with compassion and understanding for those engaged in the industry. Forest workers must not be the only group within our society to carry the weight of the necessary restructuring of the forest industry if we are to maintain our commitment to creation.

         Therefore to continue to log them, for whatever purpose, must be considered ethically and even morally wrong. The text of the Book of Genesis, often referred to by those seeking to justify such destruction [`be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion' (Gen 1:28)], does not grant to humans the right to exploit, let alone to destroy, God's creation. To use the text to justify environmental destruction is a fundamentalist misreading of the text.

         We make this statement fully aware of the implication for woodchipping producing communities and of Australia's export demands. Certainly, `Christian social justice demands that the wider community, governments and woodchip exporters look to the needs of those involved in this activity'. However, we accept the clear scientific and economic evidence that we already have in Australia plantations of both soft and hardwood timbers well in excess of our present needs. We also accept the fact that the plantation industry is able to provide more employment and jobs than those provided by the logging of old growth forests for woodchip export.

I will make a few comments in the few minutes available to me, and in the weeks ahead if that is possible. This is a very cautious report. It certainly follows some very narrow terms of reference, which we were given. Those terms of reference were negotiated very carefully, and it was important that they be agreed to by the parties. For that reason, I certainly supported those terms of reference and have agreed with this report to the need for it to be unanimous. We certainly achieved that.

         I underline that it is a cautious report. I will give a couple of examples. On one of the critical issues, which is the shredding of the Heiner documents in Queensland, the committee says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With the benefit of hindsight, the Committee considers that the shredding of the Heiner documents may have been an exercise in poor judgment. Greater consideration ought to have been given to alternative approaches to resolving the problems associated with the inquiry. In particular, the Committee considers more heed should have been given to the `Crown as a model litigant' notion: it might have been more appropriate for the Queensland Government to have retained the documents for a certain period to allow for their production, if required, in legal action.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a criticism of the Queensland government—cautious, nevertheless a criticism. I wanted to press some stronger words than that on the committee. That was prompted by the findings and advice of Callinan QC, who, in a letter which has been released and published by the committee, quite clearly pointed out that sections 129 and 119 of the criminal justice code in Queensland clearly indicate that the shredding of documents in this kind of event may be a criminal act. Callinan made no judgment on that because obviously that would need to be tested in a court. But he does say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is evident from all of the above that the Criminal Justice Commission has not given serious attention to the implications of destroying documents knowingly in order to avoid or render more difficult litigation. They have ignored these serious matters. Arguably relevant provisions are as follows.
       </para>
       <para>
        After quoting from the criminal code, he goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Again the Criminal Justice Commission's narrow/strict interpretation of `judicial proceeding' is too significant to ignore. There are now clear compelling reasons for these matters to be investigated comprehensively. Mr Barnes made findings of fact which were not based on all of the relevant documentation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a lot more to that. I personally agree with Callinan's opinion and with the opinion of Neil Turner, a National Party MP from Queensland who was very critical of the CJC's performance, particularly in this matter. When I have more time, I will read into the record what he said in a dissenting report, because I believe that what he said is accurate.

        All organisations are government bodies or non profit committees and Associations. The largest amounts were received for the hire of space to exhibitors at the two Finance Expos held in Hobart jointly by ABC Radio and the non profit Financial Planners' Association. The ABC initiated the organisation of these Expos, which provided budgeting and investment advice seminars, aimed at low income families, and were an extension of similar on air programs, which are highly valued by listeners. The ABC used the revenue to pay for exhibition and promotional material, and lines.

        ATSIC's travel expenditure, however, must be considered against the nature of the agency. Elected representatives are required to travel regularly to Regional Council meetings, and often air travel is the only practical alternative. ATSIC Commissioners represent zones across Australia, and must travel to all Commission meetings. Much of the travel for ATSIC staff is to rural and remote Australia, at times involving travel by chartered aircraft, and such travel is disproportionately more expensive than business travel to Australian capital cities.

        Approximately two years ago the government gave a guarantee or an assurance that the Reserve Bank would act as a lender of last resort to an Australian bank which was subject to a run on its deposit base as a result of depositors withdrawing a high percentage of their funds from that bank. Since that time there have been certain suggestions that that protection may be somewhat qualified support. Can the minister confirm that the Reserve Bank still has an unequivocal policy and resolve of acting as lender of last resort to all Australian trading and savings banks?

        There is no formal guarantee of bank deposits in Australia by the Reserve Bank. However, the Banking Act 1959 places a duty on the Reserve Bank to use its powers for the protection of depositors of all banks authorised under the Act. To this end, the Reserve Bank closely monitors the operations of banks to see that they adhere to sound management practices and comply with various prudential requirements.
