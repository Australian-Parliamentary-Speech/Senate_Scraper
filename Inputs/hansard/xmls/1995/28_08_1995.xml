         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I ask: is the Prime Minister arguing that because he questions the political motives in the establishment of the royal commission in Western Australia he is now entitled to disregard its findings? Is that not an attack on the integrity of the royal commissioner and the many witnesses who contradict the Lawrence version of events? Aren't the Australian people entitled to expect that they not be lied to by a minister? If the evidence demonstrates that she lied, aren't they entitled to expect the Prime Minister to act on that finding rather than defame the commission?

         —Mr President, the most reasonable thing to do in this whole unreasonable business is to wait and see what the findings of the royal commission actually are before making any judgment at all about what the response will be by the government or by anyone else. It is the case that we regard this royal commission as wholly inappropriately established, for the wrong purpose at the wrong time, by a government which ought to be absolutely ashamed of itself for using the forms and practices of royal commissions to embark upon an escapade which simply has no precedent in anyone's memory in any jurisdiction—an exercise involving the investigation neither of criminality nor financial impropriety, nor abuse of power, nor a national security issue, nor a policy issue, nor anything of a kind which has traditionally been the subject of a royal commission. So it is a political exercise, it is not a proper royal commission exercise, and it should be judged by the kinds of standards that are applied when we are evaluating allegedly political offences. And that is all I say, and that is all anyone in the government has said, about the royal commission.

         We are not going to respond to hypothetical questions about what we may be prepared to do and when. Let the course of events unfold and, in particular, let Dr Lawrence speak for herself before that inquiry, before rushing to judgment and before making assumptions. It is outrageous that she should have been targeted for this assault by this West Australian government in this way. To the extent that the question in issue is the accuracy of different recollections three years after the events, there is every reason, we repeat, why Dr Lawrence should be believed, notwithstanding how many other people might purport to have different recollections. She should be believed on the basis of her own clearly stated recollections just a few days after the events in question, and she should certainly be given the benefit of any reasonable doubt in this respect.

People can simply make mistakes in their recollection of these events, and this is a point that was of course acknowledged very, very frankly by none other than your leader, Mr Howard. He was asked, you see, how it was that Alexander Downer could possibly have got himself into a situation of directly contradicting what the Vietnamese ambassador and the visiting Vietnamese minister had said when the question was raised earlier this year as to whether Mr Downer had raised human rights questions in a meeting held just a few hours earlier with the Vietnamese ambassador. `Well', said Mr Howard—

What about, for example—as appeared on Channel 9 news last Friday night—when he was reminded of Mr Tuckey's famous statement, `At times, I guess, by downright lying,' when asked how he handled things in terms of the leadership challenge. Mr Howard was asked how he responded to that. He stated:

However, it is perfectly credible and sensible for the Prime Minister to say, as I have said and as all of us have said, that this is a royal commission unlike any royal commission that has ever previously been established, and anyone's reaction to its findings should have very close regard to the nature both of the motivation with which it was established and the nature of the task on which it was embarked. The nature of this particular royal commission's task is not to make a finding of criminality or financial impropriety or abuse of power or any of those things; it is to make a judgment about a particular course of events that occurred in a wholly political context, in a parliamentary context, a long time ago—as Mr Howard would be inclined to say `under those circumstances'. It is perfectly reasonable, under those circumstances, to approach this royal commission and anything associated with it with a very jaundiced view indeed. That is the approach we have adopted from day one, and that is the approach with which we will continue.

It is vitally important that the action agenda we are currently developing to implement the APEC leaders' commitment to free trade and investment endorse the principle that there be no exceptions to the free trade and investment undertaking. To settle for less than this would undermine the credibility of APEC and would limit the opportunities APEC presents to our exporting communities.

         As one of the most open trading regimes in the region, Australia stands to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of a general opening up of economies in the region. The most vulnerable to any exceptions would be agriculture, where protectionism remains high in the region. But there are other important industries that could be affected. Financial services, food processing, automotive parts, vehicles and processed minerals could also be disadvantaged if countries were allowed to carve out sectors and rules from the Bogor free trade and investment commitment.

         For this reason we welcome the clear statement of support provided by Japanese ministers last Friday for the principle of comprehensiveness. It is correct that Japanese ministers raised the sensitive political consideration that the principle of comprehensive will have for their agricultural sector. There was no surprise in this for us. You would not have thought there was a surprise for anybody; but it seems it did come as a surprise to John Howard. The Leader of the Opposition comes thundering out today with a comment on this matter, as if it was some startling revelation.

         Living in the ideal world of textbook trade and economic policy, you could argue that APEC economies should be able to see the overwhelmingly powerful argument in favour of a strict interpretation of the comprehensiveness principle. But we do not live in an ideal world. As a responsible government, one that is determined to deliver gains for Australia's export industries, including agriculture, we cannot venture into discussions in APEC with unrealistic and unrealisable objectives.

         It is important to remember that they will, of course, need to provide compensatory early reductions in other sectors to balance delayed reductions in any others.

We are not without them, of course. The obvious ones are TCF and automotive. I was discussing with the NFF this morning some sensitive agricultural sectors.

You cannot just be an independent commentator standing on the side, as if your comments had no impact on the lives of Australians.

It has obviously served a very useful purpose for the Court government in operating as a major source of distraction from the events in Western Australia they have got themselves caught up in so far as Senator Noel Crichton-Browne is concerned. It is obviously a very useful exercise so far as John Howard and the opposition are concerned in diverting public attention away from their spectacular inability to come up with any positive policy responses on anything that Australians are genuinely interested in. Of course it has got a utility as a diversionary political tactic of a peculiarly squalid kind, and if you want to live with and enjoy that particular reputation for engaging in and supporting those tactics you can live with that in the court of public opinion.

         As to the rest of your question, of course matters of integrity and honesty are crucial for governments to maintain their credibility. It is crucial that governments maintain the highest possible standards in this respect. All of us have frankly conceded that. All of us live by that rule and some people in the past have perished as a result of the application of that rule, politically speaking. But the point remains that these are matters to be determined when they do not involve criminality, when they do not involve abuse of power, when they do not involve financial impropriety, when they do not involve national security breaches or any of the things that have always justified royal commissions in the past and which have never allowed royal commissions to go beyond that.

         When questions of this kind have arisen in the past as to whether or not someone may have misled the parliament or the public on some issue not going to financial impropriety or criminality or any of the other things I have mentioned, they have been dealt with in the ordinary way—in the court of public opinion, on the floor of the parliament through no-confidence and other appropriate procedures in the parliament and by executive governments themselves, who of course have to live by that standard of honesty and integrity and suffer politically if they do not. That is the way these issues have been dealt with in the past. That is the way this issue should have been dealt with. That is the way it will be dealt with so far as this government is concerned.

         We do not need a royal commission going down the path that this one has gone down, with all the indefensibility of its processes, its procedures, its motivation, in the way that this one has been set up. It is a travesty of any decent process. It is a clear-cut, unashamed exercise in political point scoring and an attempt to mount a political assault on a minister whose integrity has been absolutely unquestioned by the Australian community. You cannot stand the prospect of going into an election with a minister like that standing up there against you, so you are going down every squalid, sordid, miserable, backhanded path that you can. We have got absolutely nothing to be ashamed of or concerned about or worried about in the way in which we have handled this issue.

         —As honourable senators would be aware, the pilchard mortality task force presented its interim report on pilchard kills in Australian waters on 26 June, and that report was made immediately public. I am advised that the report represents the agreed views of over 40 Australian scientists. The scientists were drawn from the Animal Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian Animal Health Laboratories at Geelong, the CSIRO, the Victorian Institute of Animal Science and all state fisheries and veterinary authorities. The task force concluded that the underlying causes of the mortalities were complex and related to a number of factors. A likely hypothesis is that the initial factors involve stress associated with environmental changes, coupled with agents such as a herpes-like viral infection and/or amoebic infestations.

What we are supporting, because we think it is realistically achievable, is an absolute ban on the production, stockpiling, and sale, and so on, of any landmine which is non-self-destructing and non-self-utilising—a long-life mine. It is those that have caused the problems in the past when they have been sowed indiscriminately right across battlefields, have been unable to be detected, have not been properly mapped and have caused awful disasters. We are deeply concerned about the injuries to civilians which have been caused by the indiscriminate use and lingering presence of anti-personnel landmines, and that has obviously been one of the most tragic aftermaths of war in countries like Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola and Mozambique.

         We have been among those countries which have been right at the cutting edge, among those most active, in seeking a new approach internationally under the Inhumane Weapons Convention, which is to have its first review in a few days time, next month.

         What we want to do, what our overriding objective is at this conference, is to achieve real and immediate results which will have real and immediate impacts in terms of saving lives. Of course we are sympathetic to the long-term objective of eliminating completely anti-personnel mines. Last year, for example, we supported a UN General Assembly resolution that affirmed `the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines as viable, humane alternatives are developed'. But the reality is that there is simply no prospect whatsoever of achieving a total ban on all classes of landmines at this stage, in particular certainly at this review conference.

         What we do think there is a chance of achieving is the following: first, I repeat, a ban on anti-personnel mines that lack a self-destruct or self-deactivating mechanism. To do that would be a huge step forward, solving—if we could do it—overwhelmingly the major problems so far as civilians are concerned. The argument that these are very technically complex to produce, very expensive to produce and are as impractical as we are saying a total ban would be simply does not stand up. There are simply degradability elements that you can put into the production of these things which make them neutralise, even if they do not self-destruct in the sense of blowing themselves up, after a relatively short period of time.

         The trouble with a total ban on all forms of mines, not just the non-self-neutralising ones, is that most countries around the world regard them as legitimate weapons against potential enemy combatants, not only in the stable protection of borders and so on but also static installations or fixed installations in war time. And countries right around the world regard these as weapons no different in kind than machine-guns or artillery or any of the other conventional weapons that are capable of causing destruction. You have to find a way of getting them to accept the principle of not using any mines which, if not picked up after the event, can cause massive civilian damage.

         It is different in that sense from nuclear weapons. We have committed ourselves unequivocally to the absolute elimination of nuclear weapons in a way that we have not committed ourselves absolutely to the elimination of all forms of landmines. But the reason is that, whereas there is no defensive justification, no military justification, for nuclear weapons that does not constitute a worse evil than their continued existence—and we are wholeheartedly committed to that however long it takes to achieve—there is a problem in the reality of what armies need to defend themselves with in static defence positions.

But, with many of the councils being very reluctant to take on new child-care services in this long interim period of confusion and chaos there, thousands of those places are at risk of being lost to the Victorian people.

         There is a demand for child-care places. There is a concern that services be provided. There is also a great concern that the services that are there be not confused, changed and altered in a way that makes it very upsetting and puzzling for families. What families want more than anything is a sense of ongoing security about those child-care places. At the moment in Victoria, that is exactly what they do not have. Mr Kennett wants to erode local government and state government involvement in child care. In that way, he is just like Mr Malcolm Fraser, who steadily eroded the Commonwealth government's involvement in child care when he was Prime Minister. At the time, Mr Howard was Treasurer. Unfortunately, no-one knows what he will do about child care.

         The last time that the quarantine policy was reviewed in Australia was as a result of a committee being established by John Kerin in 1987. That committee was chaired by Professor David Lindsay, who was the professor of agriculture and dean of the faculty of agriculture at the University of Western Australia. The Lindsay committee brought down a report in 1988 recommending a number of changes to our quarantine regime that operated then. One recommendation of the Lindsay committee was that quarantine operations be reviewed again post 1994.

         In terms of the current initiative, we are acting on a recommendation of the last review—that is, that post 1994 a further review be conducted. The Lindsay committee in its recommendations found, and emphasised the fact—and it is worth having a look at this in light of the controversy alleging a shift in basic quarantine policy in Australia to negligible risk; there has never been a policy of zero risk in Australia and commonsense would tell you why there has not been—that all movements of people and goods into Australia involve some risk of introduction of exotic pests and diseases, however small.

         Quarantinable pests and diseases can be carried on or in the clothes or bodies of international air travellers or on or in any imported cargo or mail coming into Australia. The only way you could reduce those risks to zero would be by halting all international traffic. Of course, a major trading nation such as Australia is not about to do that.

         As I have said, one of the important recommendations of the Lindsay committee was that there should be a review every four or five years and that there certainly should be a review post 1994. We are simply implementing that recommendation. In respect of the impact of the review on procedures currently under way, I point out that those procedures will continue.

There are only about a dozen indigenous organisations around the world that have that status, although there are some thousands of NGOs who have that status in other particular contexts, such as the environment and so on.

         —My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to the minister's statement last week announcing a review of the current drought assistance measures. In that statement the minister said that one area that would not be changed is the framework for declaring and revoking drought. Does that mean that the minister will not review the mechanisms by which exceptional circumstances drought is determined, primarily the use of the rainfall data formula as the threshold for assistance? Is the minister satisfied the effective rainfall formula devised by his department accurately identifies those areas in most need? Given that drought at this stage appears unlikely to be broken and, indeed, further areas may need to be assessed or reassessed, when will the review be completed?

         —I should point out that it was a decision of ARMCANZ—that is, of the whole conference—to endorse the framework for the declaration and revocation of drought. I might add that that included the state of Victoria. It was not simply something that the Commonwealth unilaterally declared at ARMCANZ. I also point out that that is easily verified because the proceedings of the ARMCANZ meeting are published documents, and the report from that particular ARMCANZ meeting will, in due course, be published as well.

         The review was implemented—it was initiated by my writing to all of my state colleagues prior to ARMCANZ and suggesting it—because the government's drought assistance package has now been in place for a year. Very significant amounts of public money have been expended already, as well as the money that has been committed—several hundred million dollars have been actually spent. It is appropriate to review the operation of the program after a year, which, I might add, was also endorsed by all primary industry ministers.

         As part of that review, an examination will be made of the contribution that has been made to drought affected farmers by state governments. One of the difficulties in providing a comprehensive scheme of assistance to farmers at the national level is that there are wide variations, as Senator Brownhill knows, between the approach that is made by the states to drought.

         Of course, it is the states which deliver our programs on our behalf. The Commonwealth, as I have said many times before, is not about to duplicate the bureaucracies of the state departments of agriculture, and no national scheme could effectively operate in any other way; that is, the states will administer it on the Commonwealth's behalf.

         But when the states differ so widely in their assistance to farmers, then there needs to be a lot more common cause between the states as to how drought will be treated. As it happens, the states of New South Wales and Queensland have provided significant assistance to drought affected farmers, but many other states provide virtually nothing. That is something that does need to be addressed and has to have some focus given to it. Part of the terms of reference for this review clearly reflect that in that the relative contribution that state governments are making to drought affected farmers is also going to be examined, along with the Commonwealth.

         So far as the rainfall criteria is concerned, there is no question that the presence or absence of rain has to be an important determinant in respect of whether there is a drought or not. As I have said before, I do not have a lot of patience with people who seriously suggest you should simply discount rain as being a primary determinant of whether or not there is drought. The reference that is made to rainfall—it is an important enhancement of the criteria—is that effective rainfall has been agreed as being the determinant.

         Farmers—and there are some of them in here—know that rain can fall at times of the year when it provides no really useful boost for farmers at all. Effective rainfall is the criteria which has been continually refined since day one of this drought package and is continuing to be refined now. We will continue that process until we have a drought policy in place.

         I might add that that stands in stark contrast to what the coalition is offering in response. We have now provided the drought package to over 10,000 farm families. It has been acknowledged by both industry and government that much of rural Australia would now be on its knees if it had not been for the assistance provided by the package. I understand the Leader of the Opposition in Roma today—and I stand to be corrected—despite questions on this matter did not provide any detail at all of what the coalition will be doing in the future for drought affected farmers.

Given the fact that your government uses the much publicised figure of $600 million as the current total moneys allocated to drought funding but does not publish the lesser known figure of moneys actually spent of about $177 million, will the minister not agree that there is a yawning gap between what is being offered and what is actually getting to farmers in need and that the limited nature of the `exceptional circumstances' definition is a major contributing factor to farmers not receiving the assistance they definitely need? The other part of the question the minister has not answered is: when will the review be completed?

I know that no-one in this chamber has actually ever been in government, but that does not excuse the ignorance of that question. What a foolish proposal it would be that you not only commit $600 million but you have to expend it on day one, otherwise there is a huge gap. What Senator Brownhill has totally ignored was an extremely important advance that was made—widely welcomed by farmers in Australia—with that drought package.

         We have committed ourselves to providing assistance for six full months after the drought declarations have been revoked. That is, you must commit in advance that funding in order to assure farmers that they will continue to get those payments. What I have said—and, Senator Brownhill, you clearly have not noticed—is that, because of the continuing nature of the drought in much of New South Wales and Queensland, I have no doubt, unfortunately, that the whole of that $600 million that has been committed will have to be spent.

         —I thank Senator Wheelwright for his question. Yes, I have seen the reports that appeared in the papers over the weekend—in particular, what appears to be an inspired leak from the Liberal Party of a long document outlining what tax changes they would supposedly offer to small business. Just to refresh the memory of the Senate, the story on the policy document from the shadow minister mentioned that the following matters would be looked at: the provisional uplift factor, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, depreciation allowance, abolition of the CPI indexation on excise, and also allowing small business eligibility for drought relief.

         On the provisional uplift factor alone, Treasury estimates that would cost $300 million. As far as one can determine on the others, it would certainly be in the order of around at least a billion dollars reduction in tax revenue to the Australian government. We have had many examples of the Leader of the Opposition saying that they are going to cut government expenditure, and here we have them going to cut taxes. Tax is an area that in one fell swoop would put the present budget surplus back into deficit. What would that do? That would put pressure on interest rates to go up in Australia. As any of the small business organisations will tell you—this is the No.1 issue—the one thing they do not want is increases in interest rates, because that is a daily cost on their bottom line. So what we have here from the opposition is a suggestion of a whole range of tax cuts that would put the budget surplus into deficit, that would put pressure on interest rates to go up and that, therefore, would make a much bigger impact on the profitability of small business than any of the so-called tax cuts.

         In the press a day later I noticed that a spokesman for Mr Howard said, `No, this is only a policy options paper; we haven't made up our minds'. This reminds me of what Senator Ian Macdonald, the shadow minister for infrastructure, said about his proposals. He said, `This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long-term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.' It seems that in the small business area the opposition is working on the same tactic: leak a document that lists every possible tax cut for small business that they may be interested in, then get into office and use the Senator Macdonald formula of saying, `Well, we weren't really going to do it anyway.' That is exactly why the small business community ought to be very wary of accepting any of the opposition's promises in the small business area.

         I can say to the Senate that shortly I will be announcing a package of small business policy measures. Each of them will be properly costed and each of them will be an issue of substance into which the small business community will have had an opportunity to have a proper input. It will not be like this wish list that the shadow minister has released, knowing full well that, closer to an election, they will let it all be pulled back. But, by that stage, they will have misled the small business community.

         —During question time, Senator Chamarette asked me a question about the NGO status of ATSIC before the United Nations. If she is interested, I will be happy to give her a full answer. The situation is this. ATSIC made application for UN NGO status according to standard UN procedures. It provided full information on its legal status in Australia, its structure and its financial arrangements. The application was considered by the UN NGO committee in June this year in New York. Two ATSIC officials attended the meeting and responded to the committee's questions, of which I understand there were quite a few. On the basis of that application and full evaluation of it, the NGO committee approved the granting of that status on 19 June.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         ATSIC's status within the UN is, of course, a matter for the UN. The granting of that status by the NGO committee has application only within UN organisations; it has no wider significance. However, as I said earlier on, we do believe that that status will be a useful way of emphasising the unique and positive arrangements developed in Australia for returning decision-making powers to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within a representative framework.

         As to what is the significance of this status for ATSIC as compared with other organisations, to participate in higher level UN human rights bodies such as the Commission on Human Rights itself, an NGO does require formal status. Several thousand NGOs have such status. They are from every part of the world and collectively cover the full range of economic and social issues of relevance to the UN. In the indigenous area, as I said there are only 12 organisations, however, representing indigenous people around the world. Only one of those, apart from ATSIC, is from Australia, and that is NAILS—the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services secretariat.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Until this year, however, ATSIC's participation in UN meetings on indigenous issues has been possible to a certain extent, notwithstanding that it lacked formal UN and NGO status. It has been able to participate, for example, in the working group on indigenous populations and so on even without that formal status. So the reasoning, equally, would apply to other organisations which, I guess, want to make an effort to participate before them.

         Finally, the government supports the participation by Australia's indigenous peoples and relevant UN bodies. We have been aware of ATSIC's application for some time. We are also willing to provide information and assistance to other Aboriginal organisations in Australia which may wish to seek that status. We would be very happy to provide the kind of support that we provided to ATSIC to any recognised Australian indigenous NGO seeking that status. We will be as helpful as we can be.

         —On Wednesday of last week, Senator MacGibbon asked me whether changes to IVF policies for ADF members were required as a result of pressure from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or to comply with HREOC legislation. The answer to that is categorically no. Health care of servicewomen is a responsibility of the Australian Defence Force. Unlike their civilian counterparts, who are able to claim for IVF treatment under Medicare, servicewomen do not have the ability to claim for such treatment. For those women who choose to pursue treatment under the IVF program, the matter of their infertility is, of course, one of great personal concern. The ADF certainly did not want servicewomen leaving the defence forces just so they could take part in the IVF program. A revised policy on the provision of IVF programs for ADF members was introduced in January 1995 to remove the injunction against IVF and to redress that previous inequity.

Indicative costs of the revised policy were developed by the services. However, these figures remain highly uncertain as the number of ADF servicewomen who might meet the clinical requirements for the assisted fertilisation is unknown, as is the number of treatment cycles and therefore the cost of what each may require.

        Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) took this matter a further step in the wrong direction. What we had been experiencing for some weeks was a systematic attempt by the Commonwealth government to close down the Western Australian royal commission using taxpayers' money to do it, using the name of Dr Lawrence as the vehicle for the actions and another Western Australian all for the purpose of avoiding the truth. Efforts were being made at taxpayers' expense to ensure that the truth did not come out and that Minister Lawrence was not therefore embarrassed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If that was not appalling enough, if that was not an incredible indictment of government and a terrible abuse of the responsibilities and functions of the government, Mr Keating again took it a step lower last week when the government basically lost on that issue. It spent the taxpayers' money but basically the court upheld the validity of the royal commission. Witnesses started giving evidence, evidence that was inconsistent with the version of events as has been stated by Minister Lawrence. Then Mr Keating went one step further and in effect said, `Whatever the decision of the royal commission, whatever its findings, we will repudiate those findings. We will not act upon them.' To use the expression of Mr Keating, which I quoted in my supplementary question today—words that we take from the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         of last week—of the findings of the Marks royal commission, he said:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course we'll reject them; it's a kangaroo court. It's a crook commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        What he was repeating was what Mr Beazley had said a few days before. As reported on AAP in Darwin, Mr Beazley said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the end of the day, whatever report is produced, I think it is open to the government to say, `well, nice to have your views fellas,' that's about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        So basically what the Prime Minister has been saying and what the Deputy Prime Minister has been saying is that they are not interested in the truth; and if this commission demonstrates in fact that Minister Lawrence has not been telling the truth to the Western Australian parliament or to the Australian people, `Well, who cares.' That is the attitude of the Prime Minister. There is no attitude in fact that in public life truth is important, that the public have a right to expect ministers to tell the truth. Mr Keating says that if it is not politically convenient to accept the truth then he will disregard it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I would have thought that was a particularly serious matter and one that would concern all Australians. I suppose we had the hint from Mr Keating even earlier, back a few months, from what he said on 15 May when he was discussing the potential for the royal commission. On 6WF, he said:

       </para>

        the thing is the royal commission—

        `found against Carmen' it doesn't matter a tinker's cuss.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So what we have seen here is the Prime Minister last week confirming the attitude he has had all along: `Closing down the commission is the best course of action to avoid the truth coming out; and if the truth does come out and it's a finding against the interests of Minister Lawrence, then we will disregard it because it is politically inconvenient to us.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">

         I guess this attitude of the Prime Minister is consistent with what we have been seeing from Labor governments now for so long. We had the attitude of the Prime Minister to promises demonstrated before the last election. All Australians will remember the l-a-w law tax cuts. He said, `It is not a promise, this is a law. You can rely on it. We are not just mere politicians making a promise; we have embedded this in law so all Australians know what their tax benefit will be in the future.'

         —The comments made by Senator Hill are very cogent. They once again reflect very badly on the government. Senator Hill referred to Senator Richardson, who clearly was a mainstay of both the Hawke and Keating governments whilst he was here in Canberra. But in more recent times we have had another very senior minister, the Minister for Defence, Robert Ray, tell all and sundry that politics isn't about fairness; it's about outcomes and, at the end of the day if you win—if the outcome is what you want—the means somehow justify the end. Dr Lawrence is being required to justify what she said in the House of Assembly in Western Australia on 10 November 1992. She said:

        They are the words of Dr Lawrence in the Western Australian parliament. It is a bit akin to somebody telling a lie or lying under oath. There is a higher standard required of parliamentarians when they are speaking in the forum of a house of parliament. There is the expectation that the temptation to tell those little porkies from time to time will be avoided and you answer basically on the basis that you are under oath. Clearly, that is the question that is being considered by the royal commission; and it needs to be determined.

         Most people who have nothing to hide are most anxious for their trial to commence so they can put their point of view and be assured of an outcome. It seems very strange that Dr Lawrence has spent so much time and the taxpayers' funds of this nation trying to avoid having to put her side of the story. The reason for that has become quite apparent with the huge number of witnesses who have now come before the royal commission in Western Australia.

         This is not a Liberal Party set-up. Senator McKiernan, as I recall, supported an inquiry to get to the truth of the matter—Dr Lawrence ought to rush there and give her version of events. That is what her Labor Party colleagues are saying. Every single witness to date before that royal commission is,  not a Liberal person, not a National Party person, but either her former staff member or her former ministerial colleague.

They all come up with a version of events that would seem to indicate that the answer provided by Dr Lawrence on 10 November 1992 in the forum of the Western Australian parliament was not necessarily correct. I believe that the people of Western Australia have a right to find out whether or not what she said was correct and, if it was not correct, on what basis she misled the parliament.

         Given the evidence to date, it is quite certain either that Dr Lawrence has a very poor memory or that there was a great degree of obfuscation, to put it as mildly as possible. Whilst I can understand that Dr Lawrence might have difficulty three years out from the event as to what actually transpired, on 10 November 1992 the petition had only just been tabled in the parliament. The meetings that she had attended that all these witnesses have testified about must have been fresh in her mind. It is interesting that the same Dr Lawrence knows nothing about what occurred around the Burke cabinet table—the same teflon Lawrence; nothing would stick about the Burke government because she was not really there, when of course she sat round there and got the ministerial salary at all times.

        There are a number of points about the current and continuing drought and the government's response to the drought that I would like to address. The first relates to the response by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) to Senator Brownhill's question today. It is worth noting that Senator Collins studiously ignored the substance of that question. The basic substance of that question was: what was the review of drought assistance going to look at in relation to what Senator Collins said last week with regard to the declaration and revoking of exceptional circumstances? If that had already been determined as being satisfactory by the state ministers and by Senator Collins himself, what would they be looking at and when would they report?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Once again, in terms of looking at the government's response to drought, Senator Collins ignored that question. I say categorically—and I will be talking to the state agricultural ministers—that the system of declaring exceptional circumstances and the assistance that is being given through exceptional circumstances has failed many farmers hit by drought. One only has to look at the total financial figure the government bandies around that it has put towards drought. In the view of many commentators, and certainly in the view of primary producers, particularly on the eastern side of the country, this has been the worst drought in Australia's history in terms of its severity and length. But only a third of the assistance money has got out to the people on the ground. There must be something significantly and severely wrong with the criteria under which it is operating.

         The other point I make about the exceptional circumstances—and this has been brought to my attention and, I am sure, to the attention of others in this chamber—is how the lines are determined where a number of operations fit inside the line with regard to being eligible for assistance, even though it is difficult to get, and those on the other side of the line, which is drawn on a map and where there is no apparent or obvious difference in terms of what exists, are excluded from being eligible for exceptional circumstances.

         I will repeat what I said in this chamber last September in a debate on the drought: there comes a time when those making the assessment have to actually open their eyes, go listen to people and make a decision. I think this is one of the fundamental problems with this particular aspect of the response from the government. While it says, `We have put $600 million on the table,' it is not getting out there. Some decisions need to be made about a visible assessment, because in many circumstances it is impossible to actually put scientific criteria to what is a drought.

         Senator Collins spent some time today talking about the rainfall data situation. Nobody is going to argue with what he said. But I will say this: the problem with using rainfall data is that there are so many other circumstances that come into play which make a smaller amount of rain either very valuable or absolutely useless—for example, temperature, wind and the time of the season the rain falls. It is a very imprecise science of determining whether or not that rainfall really means anything.

That is the area in which I condemn very severely this government's response to the drought.

         Senator Collins also made some reference today to Mr Howard's address to the cattlemen's conference at Roma. As I understand it, Mr Howard said today that dealing with this problem required a bipartisan approach, not the sort of reaction we got from Senator Collins in here today when he came in and thought he could just belt the coalition over the head word after word and refuse to address the question that was put to him. I challenge Senator Collins to come back into this place and to address the question that was put to him today.

One of the problems at the moment is that we have quite an horrific circumstance about to recur in some places and continue to occur in places in both southern Queensland and northern New South Wales—and the drought is slowly moving south.

         Senator Crane has already said that this is something that needs a bipartisan look at because it is just not working quite as well as it should be. Late in May, a few areas in the central west of New South Wales were added to the other areas on the list of exceptional circumstances. The new people who have been included in those areas will access some federal drought relief in the form of drought relief payments and assistance through the Rural Assistance Authority. Those people will get some help.

The thing about it is that a little bit of rain then made people sow crops.

         During question time it was amusing to hear Senator Bob Collins say that rainfall has something to do with drought—`and let no-one ever forget it'. Rain does make a bigger difference at different times of the year. For instance, even a mediocre level of rainfall right across Western Australia would make a big difference to the dollars right now, whereas three times that level of rainfall in the middle of winter would not make anywhere near so much difference. Of course, that reasonable level of rainfall and the big dollar difference would affect the government's balance of trade and export income.

         The reason for rising, mostly, is once again to put in front of the Senate the situation of the East Gascoyne areas of Western Australia which this year came out of four consecutive droughts. The government has steadfastly refused to agree to even look at the situation. I think that Senator Collins did say that an inspector or someone went over to look, but I do not think he got within 1,000 kilometres of the East Gascoyne area. But having had, to my knowledge, those four consecutive droughts, they got a massive drought breaking level of rainfall this year. Of course, rainfall has a much different effect in pastoral areas than it does on agricultural areas. Agricultural areas need rain every year, whereas one massive rainfall can set up a pastoral area for three years.

         Unfortunately, those people cannot afford to restock at this stage. It is a well-known saying in the agricultural and pastoral areas that, when it rains, it does not necessarily rain dollars. The dollars hopefully come in 12 months or so. These people need help to restock. They are set up for this season and the next two. The government has refused time and again to look at it. In that region, since the inception of the pastoral industry about 100 years ago, there has never been a forced sale. I am talking about the east Gascoyne. I am not talking about the Murchison area or anywhere else. So it is a pretty solid industry.

Seventy per cent of its costs are grain costs. Grain costs have increased remarkably during the period of the drought.

         There are many concerns regarding the possibility of diseases and pests entering this country. You only have to look at the beef industry to find an example. For years, the beef industry has had a competitive advantage over its main competitor, South America. South America is riddled with footrot. We have been able to sell a clean product to the United States and other parts of the world simply because this country is footrot free.

         Over the years, if there has been a possibility of footrot entering this country or the slightest hint of an outbreak, quarantine officers have, with good reputation, moved in swiftly to eliminate that possibility. They have wiped out whole herds—and not necessarily those with footrot but those within miles of the notified disease.

         That is a good example of how the quarantine laws work and why they should be there. The beef industry has been able to sell its product and enter new markets on the basis that we have good quarantine laws. In this case, the pig industry is in danger of diseases and pests from Canadian imports ruining any competitive advantage it might have.

         On the one hand, the bill states that `Australia is fully committed to observing its obligations under international instruments' but on the other hand states that `international instruments by which Australia is bound or to which Australia is a party do not form a part of Australian law unless Australian legislation provides otherwise.'. Consideration is needed of the accumulation of power by the Executive of the Commonwealth through the operation of its external affairs but without its being prepared to accept any of the responsibilities that flow from the exercise of that power.

         The existing law governing undercover police could be seen as both workable and satisfactory. Police activity that was the subject of the High Court decision in the Ridgeway case needs to be stopped, not legalised. Legislation which seeks to exempt police from the consequences of breaking the law needs serious consideration before being enacted.

         In this motion there is one change from the motion perhaps now being circulated in the chamber, that is, a reporting date of 28 September for the majority of the references. This matter relates to what is being referred to as the Easton royal commission and, in particular, to the government's decision to fund Dr Lawrence's private legal costs in joining in an action to try to scuttle the Western Australian royal commission and, for that matter, to the Commonwealth's intervention in those proceedings.

          The government would have us believe, as we have heard time and time again from the minister opposite, Senator Gareth Evans, that there is no point to this commission other than to get Dr Lawrence. So egocentric are the government and so high do they hold her in their regard that they cannot see that this commission has a legitimate basis. Western Australians are entitled to know the truth about a matter that has been of significant public concern in Western Australia. Perhaps not understood by those in other states is the degree to which this has become a topic of much interest and—more than interest—concern in Western Australia.

I am yet to hear an argument that it is not properly constituted, despite attempts, I might say, of Mr Stephen Smith and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to intimidate any members of the judiciary or former members into not participating and accepting the job of commissioner and equally to try to intimidate members of the profession into not taking up jobs as counsel assisting or participating in any other way in this commission.

          We could say at that point, `Well, that's how it was going to go, and it is of no concern to us,' but, not long after the announcement of the commission, the federal government announced they would fund what I believe were then described as—and I may be wrong here; I do not have the press release of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in front of me—`Dr Lawrence's costs'. The inference was that the private legal action being taken out to challenge the authority of the commission was, in fact, Dr Lawrence's legal action.

          We now know, of course, that that is a load of rubbish. We know that the Attorney knew at the time of putting out that release that Mr Halden was the one who had standing to issue those proceedings and that Dr Lawrence could not probably have issued them in her own right—that is how thin her interest, and how thin and feeble her association is with this matter.

          So, somewhere in the dark recesses of Labor back rooms, an arrangement was made that Mr Halden would put his name to these proceedings if the work was all done pro bono. Mr Halden does not have the money to pay. I do not mind pro bono work. I wish the government recognised how much pro bono work the profession does. Then we find that Dr Lawrence is joining in this action—which she cannot run herself—and, surprise, surprise, Commonwealth taxpayers will be funding her. That does raise the question of the consideration the government gave to what benefits Mr Halden would be getting from this arrangement if, by a nudge and a wink, everybody was acting for Mr Halden for nothing.

The government may be able to say, with respect to its legal advice as to the likelihood of the proceedings being successful, that it wants to claim privilege with respect to that legal advice. That is a debate that you could easily have, and there would probably be quite a lot of support for that. But there is no support whatsoever for saying that every other document associated with this decision to fund should be locked away, and that we, the parliament, will have only that which either the minister opposite, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), the Attorney, or whoever, decides we will have and that they will be accountable to parliament as they choose and not as parliament wants. We have already had that in the form of Labor ministers basically telling the Senate that it can go and have a picnic lunch and do something else.

          It is important to understand, if it is not obvious to everyone concerned already, that the commission in Western Australia does not have any association whatsoever with matters pertaining to Dr Lawrence's functions as a federal member or as a federal minister. The matters before that commission relate entirely to things that happened before she got into federal parliament. Let us also not hear from the government that somehow they are entitled to spend this money as they wish because it is assisting a minister in performing her functions.

It is just a free tipping of the bucket of money accessible to the executive, for one of their mates, with a quite inadequate explanation. We say that in all probability it is in breach of the constitution. You see, the minister opposite can wave around the Parliamentary Entitlements Act as much as he likes but, if the payments do not fit that act—if they cannot properly be described as attaching to that act—and if there is not enough power in the relevant parts of the constitution for that act to do what the minister says ought to be done, well, tough chips.

          I now move to another matter, and this is certainly not the last one. Bearing in mind that the government was funding the legal challenges from public funds, that is, from hard-earned taxpayers' money, what role did government play in relation to any of the legal challenges to the Marks royal commission, including in relation to the decisions to challenge or to appeal against lost challenges, and in relation to the nature of the arguments to be put to the respective courts on behalf of Dr Lawrence or any other person? Presumably this would allow questions to be asked about the contribution from the Attorney-General's Department. Just how much advice has flowed freely from the Attorney-General's Department to the office of the Attorney-General, and how much of that has flowed either directly or indirectly to Dr Lawrence, such that her costs need not be inflated any more than they otherwise would be? How much marrying together has there been with this convenient intervention by the Commonwealth in Dr Lawrence's proceedings? Does that mean that she and Mr Halden have free and almost complete access to the legal advice being offered by the Attorney-General's Department? These are matters that we think it is perfectly fair and reasonable to have honestly answered.

          I come back to my original point. If the Commonwealth government had chosen to respond properly to the Senate's return to order, these matters could have been answered. Since the reply was, `No, you come and fight for what you want', that is what the Senate is prepared to do. No doubt we will probably have further fights about it. Hopefully, out of this tawdry mess—and I think it is a tawdry mess when the government agrees to fund a minister's private legal costs in order to scuttle a properly established royal commission, an executive act by another parliament in this nation—will come something positive. The matter was raised with me by both the Australian Democrats and the Greens and readily acceded to by us—that is, what guidelines and conditions should be put in place to ensure the legality and propriety of any use of public funds to pay the legal costs of ministers and members of parliament.

          It is abundantly clear that the current guidelines are inadequate. The government is waving around the guidelines saying, `The guidelines don't refer to royal commissions; therefore we can pay. We can do what we like because we are not restricted by these guidelines.' I think that is a rubbish argument. I would say, `The fact that you are not covered by the guidelines probably means that you can't pay.' Why does the government assume that, because the guidelines do not mention royal commissions, it is entitled to spend on what it wants. For example, the guidelines do not mention legal costs relating to some other sort of civil proceeding. There must be a list of them that could be drummed up that are not mentioned in those guidelines. Do we automatically assume, therefore, that we can pay? No, we do not.

          I would say that the payment is outside the guidelines. That may not make it illegal, but it certainly questions the propriety of it. But that is another matter. At least we would agree that, since royal commissions are not mentioned in the guidelines, the guidelines are inadequate in one way or another because they have led to some dispute. We could be focusing on more important things like the constitutionality and legality of the payment as opposed to whether it is within the guidelines or not. That issue at least needs to be looked at.

There is concern right around the chamber, until you reach the Labor Party—and I suspect privately there is concern way past the line where the Labor Party starts—as to exactly what parliament ought to be told. No-one disputes that there are some matters that are appropriate to be withheld, but no-one believes that it is appropriate for government simply to make a decision and then say to parliament, `The only answers we need give you are a few press releases and we will leave it at that.' That is quite clearly inadequate. As I draw to a close, much, I imagine, to the minister's relief—

First, the community understands that just because you are in government you cannot spend money on anything you like. You cannot just say, `This is inconvenient, we want to spend money on this,' especially when you end up spending the money at an estimated rate of $10,000 a day—although we still do not know that because we have not had the privilege of having the return to order satisfied. The community is very suspicious of executive action that protects one of their own—one could draw a bow not much longer than that and say executive action that protects themselves.

          Quite clearly, in a pre-election environment, if you are sitting around at a table of cabinet ministers and one of them is under attack, that is very inconvenient. The easiest way to stop yourself being damaged by allowing that minister to be damaged is to step in and protect the minister. It is fine to do that in a sense of comradery, to all stand behind the person under attack in the media and in this place. You should work together as a team, but we are questioning whether you can say, `We will open the taxpayers' till, put our hand in the register and tip the money into protecting this minister.' I think you can say that each cabinet minister around that table, except any who may be leaving at the next election—by choice, that is, as opposed to being kicked out, and hopefully some of them will be—

          As I was saying, one of the reasons the community is concerned is that they smell a problem here. They see money being tipped into Labor interests, they see cabinet ministers voting for something that directly benefits one of theirs and indirectly benefits all of them, and they are very suspicious about it. Senator Spindler, who has an interest in this matter, has served with me on the costs of justice committee. We all understand what limited access Australians have to the legal system when they are under attack. When the executive of this government makes a decision that impinges on the liberty of a citizen in one way or another, does the executive vote to fund that citizen's legal cost to challenge that decision? No. Why do you suppose it does not do that? Because it does not have an interest in doing so.

          If I am judged against by the Social Security Tribunal or whomever, will the government fund me to take it all the way to the High Court? Will I be able to confidently walk out as Dr Lawrence did and say, `We'll take this all the way to the High Court, I am a fighter,' or will I have to sell my home, my car and lose my job in order to do so? That is what is aggravating Australian citizens. In funding a legal action, Dr Lawrence is getting Rolls Royce treatment when most Australians citizens cannot afford to get a foot in the court. She is given a blank cheque that says, `Go all the way to the High Court and back if you like, sweetheart. We do not want to see you bite the chop.' Citizens are annoyed about that.

          If you have a look at the legal aid figures, you will see that less than two per cent of Australians who get legal aid—and some of this is to challenge Commonwealth executive action—get more than $10,000. It is actually less than two per cent, but I will say two per cent for convenience. So Dr Lawrence is in the top bracket. Ninety-eight per cent of Australians have not got a stone's throw in hell's chance of getting $10,000 in legal aid. Yet we have estimates that this is what Dr Lawrence is getting every day. But the figures get worse than that, much worse.

          If you assume that Dr Lawrence has had at least 10 days at $10,000, you might ask how many legal aid applicants would get $100,000. It is 23 out of 130,000 approved applicants—that is less than one-tenth of one per cent—who receive this kind of treatment. They probably do not get this kind of treatment. In their case, that $100,000 would be at legal aid rates. I think it is London to a brick that Roger Gyles QC is not acting for Dr Lawrence on legal aid rates. They are the two reasons that the community is concerned. First, they smell a rat. What is going on here is that these guys have voted to protect one of their own; they have cast votes that will assist their political party. They want to keep this woman from being damaged, which of course has the ludicrous assumption in it that the minister must be making that there is damage to be done. Second, the public say they as normal citizens cannot access the courts yet she has been given Rolls Royce treatment.

          I have just had a quick look through the release of 20 June 1995 put out by the Attorney-General, who I notice, in his usual courageous way, since this decision has gone sour, has gone to ground in his marginal seat. You would think Michael Lavarch had never touched this decision, that he had never put out this release on 20 June. While there are many things about you that I do not admire, Senator Evans, at least you are not a gutless wimp. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, we have to at least admire the Minister for Foreign Affairs because he is not a gutless wimp. He is not running to ground like the Attorney-General. He is prepared to defend his government's decision. He and the Prime Minister are prepared to do that. Michael Lavarch, the Attorney-General, the man responsible for this, the man who has the carriage of the funding of this matter, this Rolls Royce treatment for Dr Lawrence, is nowhere to be seen.

Having had a quick look through his press release I do not see anything that says it is Mr Halden who is running these matters. It implies, I think, that Dr Lawrence can challenge this matter in her own right. If the Attorney-General did know at the time of putting out this press release that Dr Lawrence did not have standing in her own right, this press release is saying a lot more about the Attorney than we think. For those reasons, I urge senators to support the reference of this matter to the Senate committee.

          Let me begin with the legal basis for the decision and the sequence of events associated with that. At the starting point it is necessary for me to say that it is our judgment that the royal commission was established as a very deliberate political device to destroy Dr Lawrence's career as a Commonwealth minister; to undermine and, if possible, destroy her capacity to carry out her ministerial functions. She is entitled to defend herself from such a blatantly political attack.

          I do not stop to go into all the reasons why we make that particular judgment but one of the obvious ones is that the Western Australian parliament has explored the issues associated with the tabling of this petition in its own select privileges committee inquiry set up in November 1992. It has made certain findings about the way that matter was handled. None of those go to the impropriety—or, certainly, illegality—of the tabling of the petition by Mr Halden, although issues did arise about the role in the whole affair that was played by Mr Easton.

          Confronted with an attack of this kind, any minister is entitled to defend himself or herself by all reasonable available means, including not only appearance in the commission but whatever collateral action is reasonably appropriate to tackle what are argued by the body in question to be exercises of impropriety or action beyond jurisdiction. That has been the case in the past, where people on the receiving end of these sorts of assaults have never hesitated to take that action. That was so, for example, as we have said a number of times, in relation to Mr Greiner's collateral legal attack on ICAC in New South Wales and Mr Gray's collateral attack on the Rouse royal commission in Tasmania. Both those attacks were funded by the host government, the government establishing the royal commission in question.

          As to the basic position on funding, the Commonwealth government's view has been all along—and remains—that the primary responsibility for bearing those funding costs, both before the commission and in terms of reasonably based collateral attacks on it, is that of the Western Australian government. That has been a responsibility accepted by governments establishing royal commissions in the past. This one should be regarded as no exception. It was the responsibility accepted in both the Greiner and the Gray cases by governments then; and we have argued that that position should be adopted by the Western Australian government.

But, certainly, there has been nothing yet to suggest that the costs will be borne for the actions taken and which may still be taken in the Supreme Court and the High Court as this matter further proceeds. Anticipating, as we did as a Commonwealth government, that the Western Australian government might not honour its obligations in this matter—they had done so little else that was decent politically or morally that it was a reasonable assumption—we considered at the outset of this matter the question of paying any funds which were necessary for a legal defence and which were not picked up by the Western Australian government. Dr Lawrence, obviously, had a very great interest in what our position on this would be.

          Let me explain for Senator Vanstone's information—and that of anyone else who is interested and who is prepared to listen—the legal basis on which we approached this question of funding. When the matter first came before the cabinet on 8 June, the government had before it the product of consultations on the legal questions involved between the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance.

          In effect, those consultations had identified for cabinet's consideration two alternative and obviously available funding avenues, both of which were thought in the departmental advice concerned to be perfectly legal and perfectly proper. One was an act of grace payment under section 34A of the Audit Act. The alternative route was a straightforward single line appropriation, in the next round of appropriation bills, which would cover the payment in question.

          Both of these avenues were thought to be technically inappropriate. The difficulty about the act of grace payment under section 34A was that by legislation it was solely a matter for the Minister for Finance. The cabinet had no authority or capacity to direct him in the exercise of his judgment on this matter. It was thought that for an issue of this magnitude needing the transparency of process that it undoubtedly would need when attacked—as undoubtedly it would be in the public domain—it would be better for the decision to be taken by the cabinet as a whole as an exercise of collective responsibility. That was the primary consideration in the government's mind: to do it on that basis.

         There had been an interpretation in the case of Brown v. West in the late 1980s suggesting that that meant that any payment made to a member of parliament or, by extension, a minister that did not have the cover of some quite explicit legislative authority might run foul of that particular provision. So when that question was raised, as it was in the public domain, the question was further looked at by our legal advisers. When it was looked at, the view was taken that there was no difficulty at all if the payment was made after the one-line appropriation had, in fact, been enacted by the parliament because there would be ample legislative foundation then on which to build to satisfy section 48.

          But if, as was reasonable in all the circumstances, to pay the lawyers before next April, May, June or whenever the appropriation is passed, given that expenses are being incurred, and if money was to be paid under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, then there might conceivably be, prima facie, a problem with section 48. However, on closer inspection that problem disappeared because the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, which was passed explicitly in order to pick up the pieces after the Brown v. West case and to give formal legislative authority for a whole different series of payments to ministers and members, did contain an explicit provision in it which manifestly gave the legislative authority for this class of payment. Section 4(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act, which refers to—let me put it on the record—`benefits afforded by the government to a minister for the purpose of carrying out functions of the minister' is the basis on which the government decided, after looking at it again with the benefit of further legal advice, was a perfectly sound basis on which to proceed.

          Of course, that legislative authority does not authorise the payment of particular dollars and cents; that still has to be done by way of a parliamentary appropriation. All I am saying is that what happened, if you look at the sequence of events here, is that the Solicitor-General came into the issue at this point—he had not been involved before on these funding questions—and he gave some oral advice to the government. When the issue became one in the public domain and people wanted to know the legal basis on which the government had acted, it was at that point that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) asked the Solicitor-General to explain for the purposes of public presentation—because there is a legitimate matter of public interest here involved—the nature of the legal reasoning that was here involved.

          There is one further point to be made about all of this in terms of the Commonwealth's interest in this matter, and that is that the terms of the royal commission are such that issues of parliamentary privilege, and indeed cabinet confidentiality, will inevitably arise. That has become extremely obvious with the proceedings of the commission as they have worked themselves out. That involves, of course, real questions in which the Commonwealth, just as much as any state government, has an interest because they go to the heart of the effective operation of the Westminster system. So it goes to much more than any defence of a defamation proceeding or of the kind that has been regularly funded by governments for ministers of all parties over the years on your side of politics just as much as ours.

          Much more than that, this particular action against Dr Lawrence did not just go to her pocketbook but to her very capacity to perform her functions as a minister. The kinds of issues that have arisen in the course of the proceedings so far and that are manifestly interconnected with it go squarely to the heart of her capacity to perform her public office, both as a member of parliament and as a minister. So that is an additional reinforcement for the argument that 4(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act is the appropriate basis on which to proceed.

The government simply does not make available government documents which fall within accepted boundaries of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity to the Senate. We certainly will not be doing that to a Senate committee. Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.

          The same applies to material prepared for and considered by cabinet and any records of the discussion or outcomes of that consideration. The significance of cabinet confidentiality in this respect has been amply acknowledged by all sorts of people over the years, most recently by Richard Court himself in Western Australia, which I think is worth while acknowledging at this point for the public record. This is a submission made by the Western Australian government to the Western Australian commission on government in April this year under a covering letter from the premier:

         Secrecy of cabinet proceedings is fundamental to underpinning the doctrines of cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility under which all ministers, irrespective of their individual views, are required to support cabinet decisions outside the cabinet room, particularly in parliament. Without this secrecy, cabinet collective responsibility would be impossible to uphold. . . For collective responsibility to work, members of cabinet should be able to express views openly and frankly. In the deliberation of matters before cabinet if confidentiality does not attach to such discussions the quality of the debate in cabinet and the consequent decisions will be adversely affected. . . It is significant that the principle of cabinet confidentiality has been maintained since the inception of the cabinet system of government. It is considered that it is in the public interest to retain that existing level of confidentiality.

          Let me now come to the question of standing, which occupies so much of Senator Vanstone's waking hours on this particular subject. Contrary to media reports and her own suggestions in this place, Dr Lawrence is and has been at all times a party in her own right to the proceedings both before the Western Australian Supreme Court and the High Court. Reports in the press that her name is not listed in the court challenges is just plain wrong. Laura Tingle's report was plain wrong. She is, in fact, listed as the second applicant, the second plaintiff. No challenge was made to Dr Lawrence's standing before the courts at any stage of the proceedings which have been carried out so far. That is consistent with the fact that is blindingly obvious to everyone—except, apparently, Senator Vanstone—that the mere fact that she is not mentioned in the terms of reference does not derogate from the fact that she is the primary target of the commission; she has an obvious interest and obvious standing.

          It was a matter for Dr Lawrence and her legal advisers to be fully comfortable and confident about that question. Right back at the beginning when her name was not in the terms of reference, when she had not been called as a witness, when she had not been associated with the original petition, there was some concern on the part of some of her advisers that a court might be inclined to deny her standing. Might I say that was never my view. I do not think it was the view of the Solicitor-General and I do not think it was the view of a lot of others. But through an abundance of caution Dr Lawrence and her advisers sought the reinforcement of participation in those proceedings from Mr Halden.

          What is important, however, is that the Commonwealth government's funding decision, if it becomes necessary for us to pay anything, relates solely to Dr Lawrence's costs, not to costs referrable to any other party in this case. The Australian Government Solicitor, I am able to say to the Senate, wrote to Mr Halden's solicitors on 19 July asking that all legal expenses in relation to their representation of Mr Halden which do not relate to Dr Lawrence be separately itemised. Moreover, all bills submitted to Dr Lawrence will be carefully scrutinised to ensure that the government is not, under any circumstances, meeting his expenses. Any arrangements which Mr Halden and his solicitors might make in relation to his representation are purely a matter for him. We have not been a party to those arrangements.

          A question did arise—just for completeness, since your terms of reference refer to standing of any other party—about the question of whether the Commonwealth Attorney-General had standing himself to initiate these proceedings. I do not think anyone seriously thought there was a basis on which he could have initiated those proceedings himself, as they were a challenge then at that stage to the Western Australian royal commission.

          —As previous speakers have said, a number of question marks arise from and hang over what I too will call a messy issue. For the Australian Democrats some of those include: the motivation of the Western Australian government in setting up the royal commission and its terms of reference; equally important, the legal basis of the government's decision to fund the legal expenses of Dr Lawrence; and how past parliamentary actions in one parliament legally impact on present parliamentary functions in another parliament—one of the unique aspects of this particular case.

          The Democrats asked the government to give a detailed public statement on the legal basis of the funding and Senator Gareth Evans did that last week. On further scrutiny of that statement we felt that one or two areas required some further probing, some fleshing out. Specifically, we would seek to test the legal basis of part 4 of the government's advice—performing her functions as a minister. And, secondly, once one accepts the right to challenge, as the Democrats do, we would want to ask and probe the question: is this an open-ended acceptance of process? Does that mean that, with challenge and counter-challenge and backwards and forwards in jurisdictions, the government accepted that it would fund those without a cap indefinitely? I think those are legitimate questions. However, the Democrats did not feel, important though this is, that it warranted the expense of a Senate select committee at that time. It would be ironic if we ended up spending as much money on a Senate committee as the issue that we were inquiring into.

          In the committee, too, the Democrats intend to ask questions about the responsibilities of governments in setting up royal commissions, including responsibilities for funding. Without reflecting on any royal commission currently in progress—and there are some—I make the point that royal commissions are a very important part of the checks and balances of our democratic processes. In our committee inquiry we must also ensure that the public does not have a reason to lose faith in the objectivity of royal commissions. The Democrats support this reference to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee.

          —The extreme irony of the Marks royal commission is that it is on the use of executive power. The Greens (WA) believe that Premier Court's motives in instituting a royal commission may well be criticised as political and can also be argued to constitute an abuse of power as premier for political reasons, or as a vendetta for the personal accusations directed towards him in the Easton petition.

          However, one wrong does not justify a further wrong. The federal government's decision to fund Dr Lawrence's legal costs can also be argued to be a political exercise and an abuse of power. The question may well be asked whether this royal commission would have been mounted if Dr Lawrence were an ordinary member of the community. It has been asked and we know it has been asked several times. It may equally be asked whether she would have taxpayer funding for her legal costs if she were an ordinary community member.

          I believe that the government has a case to answer, because at least the royal commission was set up legally and the jury is definitely out on whether the federal government has acted legally. From the Western Australian perspective, what has occurred looks disturbingly like and very little different from a painful history of the Australian Labor Party using its power and access to public funds to protect itself and its mates from the consequences of its activities both within government and within business. So it is for that reason that we believe there is a case to answer by the government on whether it has fulfilled, or can answer properly four questions about the federal funding of Dr Lawrence's legal challenge to the state government appointed royal commission.

          Those four questions are: firstly, is there any precedent for this? We believe the answer is no. Senator Gareth Evans has argued two precedents which we believe are inappropriate: those of the Greiner situation where state funding was used to challenge a state commission; and the Rouse or Gray situation where state government funding, again, was to a state commission and the payment was done well after the event and only for one of the parties and was a highly controversial decision. So there is no precedent in our view, and that question still deserves an inquiry.

          Secondly, does it fit existing guidelines? The answer is clearly no. Senator Evans implied from that that it was a kind of oversight that it does not fit existing guidelines. The only point I would want to make here is that it was never envisaged that it should fit and that is why it is not mentioned. So there is a clear duty to look at why the guidelines have not covered this particular instance and not simply assume that it was an oversight.

          The third point concerns legality. As I have mentioned before, the jury is still out on that. It is quite clear that, when the government provided its final explanation on the legality of it, it was an after-the-fact explanation. It was required eight weeks ago when it initially announced the decision about the clear legal basis for providing that funding. Despite eight weeks of public debate and days of debate in the parliament on the matter, the government has still failed to give good reasons for providing the funding for Dr Lawrence's legal costs.

          It has only bothered to come up with a legal reason for the decision after the event and after the question was raised about the constitutionality of the whole basis of making those funds available. When the government makes controversial decisions of this kind, it clearly should provide full reasons at the time it makes those decisions and not because they have been repeatedly challenged.

          The fourth question which the government needs to answer is whether it is proper that such a decision has been made. I believe that there are serious questions about that because of the question of illegality, because it has not fitted the guidelines and because it is an unprecedented decision and action. Full justification has not been made available to the parliament and, therefore, the people of Australia. There is the persistent refusal of cabinet to accept, in its need for that kind of accountability, that there are questions over the propriety of it. In our view, there is doubt in all of these four areas. That is the basis of our support for this inquiry.

          The fact is that none of the precedents cited by the government fit the situation. The guidelines for providing ministers with legal aid do not fit. The legal argument the government is using is, at best, flimsy and, at worst, a clear indication that the government does not have the power to make the decision in the way that it has. Unfortunately, that flimsy legal power to pay Dr Lawrence's bill would evaporate if she were to resign. They have ultimately found under section 4(4)(b) that they are entitled to provide this legal funding. The problem is that they are using this section of the parliamentary entitlements legislation as a catch-all. It is quite clear that the government has not been provided with that section in order to have unfettered power and not be challenged. So it is being challenged, and quite appropriately.

          One could argue that, if having a house in Yarralumla helps a minister to carry out his or her duties, it should be covered by section 4(4)(b). There are many other interesting accoutrements of political survival or of even simply being a member of parliament in this place that could be argued to fit under this clause if you use the kind of loose and slapdash interpretation that Senator Evans has and which the Solicitor-General appears to have provided as the only basis for providing funding for the health minister's challenge to the royal commission.

The reason for that is that we are very concerned to see not that it will be any kind of political trawling exercise but simply that it will come out with tangible recommendations to ensure that instances such as this are not repeated. We suggested the parts of the reference that ask the committee to report on what guidelines and conditions should be put in place to ensure the legality and propriety of any use of public funds to pay the legal costs of ministers and members of parliament and what the appropriate level of reporting to parliament on these matters should be.

          It is very distressing that this government again and again fails to allow accountability to the people of Australia by the Senate process. Senator Evans, in his reply, has once again raised the point that the degree of cooperation will be limited to present legal thinking on the matter. There is still a refusal to provide what was in the mind of cabinet and the evidence before cabinet when it initially made its decision. It is a very serious matter that the government has decided to provide this federal funding and that it has failed to provide a sufficient reason for doing so.

          It is time that it be fully dealt with by a Senate committee. We were in two minds about the separate reporting dates. In the end, we concede that this measure may well be useful not only to give additional time to the committee to come up with guidelines for the future but also to separate more political aspects that apply to the present from the factors we need to take into account to see that such a shoddy way of approaching such an important and controversial decision should never occur again. Proper processes should be instituted by this government so that, when it makes decisions of this kind, it can give a full and complete explanation to the people of Australia at the time it makes the decision and not eight weeks later.

        From the start, I would like to thank the Democrats as this is in fact a shared motion. It is shared because of its importance, urgency and timing today in relation to this week's focus on the need for governments all around the world to take urgent action in relation to banning forever the production, transfer, sale, export, stockpiling or use of antipersonnel mines. There are a number of issues which I would like to address today but mainly I will deal with why the government's response to this issue has been inadequate, why there is a need to implement a total ban and why the government is not fulfilling what the majority of the community is asking for.

         First of all, I would like to remind the Senate of the answers that were given to me by Senator Gareth Evans in response to my questions about the legality of landmines, and why the Australian government was not taking a stronger stand in relation to them. Senator Evans responded that basically I was being hopelessly utopian in requesting that the Australian government take a stand to call for the ban. The interesting thing is that, without a vote, the United Nations, and that includes Australia, has taken a decision which has called for the total ban of landmines. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has also called for the total ban of landmines.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I looked up the word `utopian' in the dictionary and it said `ideally perfect but impractical'. Does that mean Senator Evans is saying that what both the United Nations and, in particular, Boutros Boutros-Ghali are asking for is totally impractical? Does that mean it is never possible, not possible now, or not wanted by a number of states? One could also ask whether in this particular debate it is something that cannot be decided, that ethics on this principle cannot be decided by individual nations. I would argue that this is one area where ethics can be decided by particular nations, but there has been a decision in Australia that we will not support it.

         Why is this the case? I have received letters from a number of people in the community on this issue. One of the letters I received was from the Charter 89 Society, an organisation for education and human rights with a South-East Asian focus. There were some quotes in that letter from Jane's Infantry Weapons with regard to the devices which Australia is making and selling, exporting or trying to export. In relation to fragmentation grenades that can be fitted with devices which make them usable as landmines—and Australia supplies the fitting devices—Jane's Infantry Weapons quotes the code that they are devices:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . which will allow individual modules to be adapted to special needs, giving great versatility in field conditions . . . or remote actuation, with minimum preparation or ancillary equipment . . . allows them to be easily converted to other uses in the field.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a definite message contained here. I have also asked the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) a number of questions with regard to landmines. The letter, quoting Jane's Infantry Weapons, continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The trip wire which we are selling, along with the fragmentation grenades and accessories which are an integral part of the illuminating grenade can also be provided separately and used with any grenades in the ADI system . . . the device has its own full range of accessories, including a trip wire for pull or tension release, plus pressure actuation and pressure release models.
       </para>
       <para>
        This information is particularly interesting because I asked the Minister for Defence whether any trip wire accessory or firing device F1A1 could be fitted to any grenades in the Australian Defence Industries' system, to which the answer was yes. I then asked to which grenades in the ADI system could any trip wire accessory or firing device be fitted, and the answer was all of them. I also asked whether any of the grenades or devices could fit into the international definition of a landmine and the answer was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No. The definition of a landmine under Article 2 of Protocol II to the 1980 Inhumane Weapons Convention is `any munition placed under, on or near the ground or other surface area and designed to be detonated or exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person or vehicle'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also looked up the definition of `trip' and found it meant `stumble, cause to stumble, make false step or mistake'. I would say it would be a very big mistake for people to stumble over, fall on or walk near any of the trip wire devices which were sold or used by Australian Defence Industries. The answer is that the Australian government does not want to take this action because we are selling devices which, under almost any definition except the pedantics of the Australian defence minister, would be considered to be a landmine. The point is that there are already protocols which make these kinds of devices illegal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are protocols which say that devices used in  situations which are likely to have most impact on civilians are not legal. But the government is saying that this is a legitimate weapon of war and not only are we going to sell these weapons, which are aimed in nearly all cases against civilians, but we are not prepared to ask the world to ban antipersonnel landmines. We heard today that many children injured by landmines do not die straight away; they are not taken to hospital and they slowly bleed to death because nobody knows that they have been injured.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Australia is pretending that we are taking action to strengthen the protocol but we are in fact allowing exceptions through which one could drive a truck. The exceptions include such things as detectability and the mapping of landmine fields. These days nearly all landmines are spread by remote means. A lot of landmines are dropped by aeroplanes and some of them are fired out of guns. There is no ability to map landmines. But one does not have to do that because, supposedly, they explode after a certain period of time. However, the problem is that they do not always work, just as ADI bullets do not always work. Landmines work even less than ADI bullets or Steyr rifles when they overheat.

         The Australian government and the Department of Defence are hiding behind semantic arguments. One could ask who is developing and pushing foreign affairs policy. It is probably the military in this particular area because the military and the Australian government are still saying that antipersonnel landmines are a legitimate weapon of war, even though they are seldom used in defence. There is very little to justify Australia using landmines as a defensive weapon.

         Possibly one or two airforce bases in Australia could be landmined but that would not stop anyone landing here. There are many ways by which to enter Australia and to landmine the whole area would be impossible. The expanses over which one would be required to lay landmines would create a huge problem. That would only be done if we were already fully occupied. The reality is that Australia is never likely to be in a situation to use landmines as a defensive weapon. Therefore this last vestige of excuse has disappeared.

         I will deal with some of the points raised. We are concerned about the injuries to civilians caused by the indiscriminate use and the lingering presence of antipersonnel landmines. We do not accept that the solution to the problem caused by antipersonnel landmines is a total ban. The government is aware that the Inhumane Weapons Convention is in need of overhaul. That is why we have been working for the last two years to develop proposals to strengthen it and improve adherence to it. These proposals will be considered at the first review conference being held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October.

         There are solutions to the problem of indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines other than a total ban. The government approach is to support a ban on long-lived antipersonnel mines and the conversion of stockpiles to short-lived mines—that is, self-destructing, self-deactivating landmines—thereby preserving our ability to protect Australia's defence personnel in military conflicts while doing away with the lingering threat of landmines to civilians once hostilities have ceased.

         Nevertheless, landmines, like other conventional weapons, are at present regarded by most countries—and I emphasise most countries—as a legitimate weapon against potential enemy combat forces in times of armed conflict. The creation of an international consensus favouring a total ban is therefore not remotely in prospect at the present time. Antipersonnel mines also perform a unique military function as a remote-controlled or delayed-action weapon in the protection of Australian defence personnel and the forces of our allies in the field, including on peacekeeping missions.

The gravest inhumanity of anti-personnel mines is their indiscriminate effect on civilians. Our proposal, in the context of the review of the Inhumane Weapons Convention, for a ban on long-lived mines and a commitment to the use of self-destructing mines addresses this problem.

         At the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference we will argue for the lowest achievable failure rate. We will also propose that mines self-deactivate.

The combination of a self-destructive mechanism with a self-deactivation feature means that the destruction of all mines is almost foolproof. These two measures together would greatly reduce the threat anti-personnel mines currently pose to civilians.

The restrictions on the use of landmines in the Inhumane Weapons Convention have long been incorporated into ADF doctrine and training.

One option is the establishment of a permanent commission of state parties which would collect information on compliance with the convention. Another proposal, co-sponsored by Australia, is to permit any state party to request the convention or a verification commission to open an inquiry into the use of mines in a particular conflict.

         Antipersonnel mines result in horrendous physical injuries and carnage, often long after conflict has ended. The term `weapons of mass destruction in slow motion' has, unfortunately, been well earned. The need for the medical treatment and rehabilitation of victims places great strain on countries with severely limited resources. Mines have an effect beyond the visible and often tragic impact of human suffering. Mines also result in widespread disruption to social and economic activity. Mines restrict the productive use of arable land in war ravaged countries where the people rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihood—no better illustrated than in Cambodia. But, for the reasons outlined, we believe the proposed amendment is the most practical course to follow on this very difficult issue.

         The ramifications of the landmine problem in affected countries cannot be understated. Apart from the direct pain and suffering of the victims, the effect on individuals is psychologically devastating.

Blindness or amputation, the most common physical casualties caused by landmines, usually mean the end of a person's working life.

The other really potent message from the photographic exhibition was delivered by Mr Rae McGrath, the Director of the Mines Advisory Group in Britain, who reminded us that the photographs were of the lucky ones—the people who were able to be rescued, who had had proper hospital care for their amputations, and who were provided with some measure of support. The unlucky ones bled to death in the fields with their sheep or with the firewood that they had been collecting. I think it is an indictment that Australia does not have a firmer stance.

         We have a call from 130 community groups within Australia in this international campaign to ban landmines. It is also supported by the Secretary-General of the UN, President Clinton, the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, the UNHCR, Pope John Paul II, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Secretary-General of the World Council of Churches, and I am sure that my colleagues have received requests for support from churches, and the heads of those churches, within Australia.

         There is no doubt that the Australian government recognises the humanitarian tragedy caused by the 100 million mines scattered in over 62 countries. We have contributed towards demining efforts in Cambodia and other mine-affected countries such as Afghanistan, Mozambique and Angola. These efforts are, of course, necessary. But how does Australia look to the people of these mine-affected countries when we have direct first-hand experience of the human tragedy—the laying waste of thousands of lives—that keeps going long after the war zone is cleared of any personnel that have to do with warfare? The United Nations has shown clearly that the cost of lifetime rehabilitation for landmine victims, over 35,000 people in Cambodia, is over $3,000. That means an added $105 million in surgery and rehabilitation for a country that is struggling to survive. We cannot estimate the human and social costs of that damage, let alone of those who do not survive.

We will not, therefore, be able to support the watered down version of the motion that we are supporting at present if the opposition unfortunately adds its support to the government to once again push through something that represents a very weak version of what we really want.

Australia is implicated in the military production of destructive weapons. Our whole reputation is compromised if we do not support a total ban on all landmines and urge that the Australian government stance be far stronger at the Vienna conference which is going to be held in September.

         —The issue we are facing and addressing tonight, the banning of landmines, is indeed one of the most important issues facing the world today. It is a major problem. There are estimates of up to 100 million landmines scattered worldwide. Estimates are that there are at least 20 million landmines in Angola, and that up to a third of Angola is actually unusable because of landmines. Apparently up to a million extra landmines are distributed—that is, planted—each year. In Cambodia, as a result of landmines, one in every 230 or so civilians is missing a limb, compared with, for example, in the US, one in every 22,000. Some 10,000 civilians die each year from landmines. The majority of those, disproportionately, are the innocents, the children, who are unable to understand the warnings about landmines. Another 6,000 or 7,000 are injured, usually with loss of limb, every single year. It is a major issue.

         But in many ways the issue is wider than that. There are a number of areas where we need to look at issues addressing world peace. One of the things we need to bear in mind, as any humane people I think would agree, is the need for us to look at generalised issues around the world. We need to look at the extent of the possibility of world mass destruction, and all processes which limit the nature of weaponry and its wholesale impact obviously merit the strongest possible scrutiny and support.

         In war, if there must be war, limitations must be made wherever possible to the main armed contenders. The protection of the civilian population deserves our strenuous endeavours. Total warfare, the blind, insensate unleashing of armed might against whole populations—children, women and the aged; unarmed, defenceless people, caught up through no fault of their own—is a greater abomination. There are lessons there from World War II. The bombing of cities in the UK and Germany in particular, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, must all cause us to look to ways in future to stop or limit the impact on non-combatants. We have had a number of conventions, notably the Geneva convention, to outlaw certain practices. Of course, we know how they failed with the Holocaust and the Japanese slaughter of millions of Chinese. Currently, too, there are episodes of racial and religious cleansing in Cambodia, Rwanda and Bosnia. There is clearly a need to achieve a reduction in weapons of mass destruction of a range of types.

         There is a need to achieve eventually the total banning of the production, transfer, sale, export, stockpiling and use of antipersonnel mines—indeed, of all mine devices which are implanted in the ground to prevent human or vehicle progress over the territory. All such devices can and do wreak havoc on civilian populations. The refugee camps and hospitals of Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos are testimony to this issue. There are thousands of men, women and, sadly, children who have suffered grave injuries and deformities from these weapons. The injuries and killings from the mines already dropped or laid will continue for many years. It is almost impossible to totally clear a known minefield. Many mined areas, as we have heard tonight, are essentially uncharted. For compassionate reasons these weapons should eventually be banned, along with chemical and biological weapons and, of course, nuclear weapons of all kinds, great and small—including the so-called theatre nuclear weapons and neutron bombs. For military reasons alone mines are unintelligent since they—like gas, for example, in World War I—deny the use of the territory to everybody for an indefinite period and may indeed turn upon the user.

         The question here is what is realistically achievable. There is no immediate prospect of a worldwide agreement to a total ban, so the coalition position is to support the government's amendment because it is realistic to ban long-lived and undetectable mines, to make sure the mines are sold only to signatories of the appropriate conventions and, importantly, to ensure there is good verification of the sale and distribution of landmines. This is the coalition's position. We have a proud record here. It was the Fraser government which signed the inhumane weapons agreement, and it is because we do not believe that a total ban is actually viable at present but believe that it is an aim which we should work towards that we are supporting the government amendment.

         There is a need for Australia to make a thorough study of all conventional weapons of war and to seek to get an international treaty reducing the production, sale and usage of all such weapons. The banning of antipersonnel mines, particularly those which we are addressing tonight—those with no detectable metal involved, which are non-self-destructing—is a vital step in the right direction. It is a small step, but a very valuable one. The best testimonial for their banning will come from the many Australian medical officers who did the amputations, who did the radical surgery and who operated on mine victims throughout Asia.

         The opposition believes the government's amendment represents the best chance of increasing the pressure on landmine producers and users and will therefore support the amendment. We look for continuing reviews of the convention over the next few years. But let us widen the issue. All weapons kill and maim people. We must ban the unlimited use of all weapons—not just nuclear ones, chemical ones, biological ones or ones which impact directly on civilians—because in the end war affects us all, civilians and soldiers alike.

         —This evening we are discussing the urgency motion concerning the need to implement a total ban on the production, transfer, sale, export, stockpiling or use of antipersonnel mines. Because of what has happened with the mining of the various battlefields and countries throughout the world, I suppose most senators in this place would agree with those sentiments. But it is also worth while noting that we are not living in a perfect world and that it is very difficult for that ban to be put into place. The government is about extracting the possible result that they can get. The possible result that they can get is the result that has been put before the convention.

         By aiming for that result, we believe we will be lessening the problems that exist in the international community. A total ban, I believe, and I think some of the other speakers stated, would not be accepted by the international community and it would be doomed to failure. The Australian government's submission about changing the inhumane weapons convention is aimed at achieving the possible, given the fact that most governments are opposed to the total ban on landmining. The issue we are trying to address is the risk to civilians, the threat of unexploded mines after hostilities cease. Our priority has been to get support for a ban on the use of long-lived antipersonnel landmines and replace them with a limited life mine that will self-destruct.

         The government's position is quite clear: the government is urging a ban on long-lived personnel landmines; that is, a ban on landmines which do not have a self-destructing and self-deactivating capability, a ban on non-detectable landmines, a ban on trade in any landmines which are not sanctioned by the convention, a ban on the supply of landmines to all countries not party to the convention, and an extension of the convention to cover internal conflicts and civil wars which would prevent the supply of landmines to non-government entities, such as the guerilla force in a particular country. Australia's proposals address the basic problems caused by the misuse of landmines and have a realistic chance of being widely accepted. It is a case of what is possible and acceptable to the international community that the government is pushing.

         I deplore the devastating results of antipersonnel landmines, the damage that they cause and the destructive effect on rendering the countryside unable to be used for primary industry or any other uses. I think someone once said, `War is hell.' No-one wants war, but it is unrealistic to expect Australia to unilaterally abandon the use of landmines when every army in the world utilises this method of warfare to some extent. In Australia's case, we have a huge and vast expanse of northern Australia which would be virtually impossible to defend without some judicious use of landmines. Everyone recognises the problems that landmines cause. They are a bit like nuclear weapons in that there is no use hiding our head and saying, `We are going to disadvantage our own side by not using landmines,' if every other nation with which we are in competition or are likely to be in competition is going to use these weapons of destruction.

In Angola the figure is one in 470, which is slightly less. Senator Margetts shakes her head in absolute disgust, and I concur with her feelings on this matter. During trips overseas, I have seen the devastation caused by these landmines. In a visit that I made to Mozambique five or six years ago, I saw young children with their limbs blown off, with one or two legs missing. I was absolutely shocked by the result of landmines.

         The inhumane weapons convention in Australia will seek to bolster the 1980 agreement through calling for bans on non-detectable mines made of plastic. Australia will also be seeking a ban on the use of and trade in long life mines. Modern mines should be embodied with a mine deactivating mechanism.

          Landmines are increasingly miniaturised and made of plastic components which are difficult to detect in the ground or on people. They are indiscriminate and last well beyond the conflict for which they are deployed. For instance, the Chinese T72 has a lithium battery which will last between 75 and 100 years.(40) For every person killed there are another two people on crutches or with artificial or missing limbs.(41) In Cambodia there are 4 million mines in a country of 8 million people. There are already 36,000 amputees. In Afghanistan, 20% (200,000) of the deaths in the civil war were caused by mines; 400,000 people were injured. In Angola one in 400 people is a surviving amputee; in Somalia, the figure is one in 650.(42)

          Removal of landmines is a dangerous, slow and expensive process. It is the work of individuals painstakingly testing the ground with prodders in order to uncover each mine. For every 5,000 mines cleared, one disposal expert is killed and two are injured. Landmines can be bought for as little as $3 but cost on average $1,000 per mine to clear. This cost does not take into account the costs of medical treatment, social security support, loss of working capacity and loss of land use. To understand the scope of the problem it is instructive to look at the example of Afghanistan. The devastating civil war and instability following the Soviet withdrawal has left 9-10 million mines scattered throughout the countryside. The International Committee of the Red Cross has estimated that at the current rate of removal it will take 4,300 years to clear 20 per cent of the country.(43) Starting in 1989, nine states, including Australia, despatched de-mining forces to remove and make mines safe through the UN Mine Clearance Training Team in Afghanistan (UNMCTT). While all nations except Norway withdrew their forces from Afghanistan in 1990 and 1991 for security reasons, Australia's team of initially six, later three ADF men remained until December 5, 1993, the last team to depart. Under UNTAC four million square metres of Cambodia were cleared of 37,000 landmines and 2,300 Cambodians were trained in mine clearance.(44)

          Landmines are manufactured by 48 countries. Major manufacturers, suppliers and traders have included: the United States, USSR, China, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Czechoslovakia, Singapore, Egypt, Pakistan and South Africa.(45) Components are manufactured in countries which have nothing overtly to do with the manufacture of the landmines themselves. For example the Swedes, who do not produce landmines, nevertheless produce explosives for landmines.

          There has been mounting pressure in the international community, especially from NGOs, for new measures to control the manufacture and use of landmines. A landmark event was the Inhumane Weapons Convention, 1980, Protocol 11, 1981. However, only 39 countries have ratified this convention and the United States is a signatory but not a full member. In the United States the convention was still before the Senate in late 1994. Moreover, the convention lacks implementation provisions and does not apply to internal conflicts, which are the basis for UN peacekeeping in the post-Cold War era.

          Some advance in the control of landmines has been made with the unilateral moratorium which has been placed on their trade by the United States, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Furthermore, at the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims in Geneva in August 1993, Australia called for a review of the 1980 convention. The proposal has come before the General Assembly for endorsement. The expert group has now met on three occasions and is due to meet once more, in January 1995, before the Review Conference, scheduled for 25 September to 13 October 1995.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reported some regional reluctance to becoming part of the convention.

         —And Senator Boswell. Senator Jones was about to clarify something. I must see afterwards what he was going to clarify before he was sat down. I hope he will not find me too churlish if I query what he was saying. His government has been saying that when they go to meetings on this very vital issue they should claim for what they think is a possible result. As a trade unionist, I put to Senator Jones, who has been one too for many years: how often do we go into negotiations with employers and claim what we think we will get out of it? We put the whole thing into ambit. That is what we should do on this occasion. It has been 10 years since the last review and there is a review coming up in October.

        Each year in excess of 700 temporary resident doctors and 700 o occupational trainees enter the Australian medical workforce. These overseas temporary doctors are issued with conditional visas which restrict them to work only in specific `areas of need', that is, in specified public hospitals or underserviced rural and remote areas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It has been conservatively estimated that at least 10 per cent of these doctors will be `moonlighting' to some extent.  The term `moonlighting' refers to temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees performing services outside their `host' institution or specified area of need, usually billing against another doctor's provider number. This practice is in breach of the Health Insurance Act 1973, but is difficult to detect.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the 1995 Federal Budget, it was announced that measures would be taken to reduce the number of temporary doctors `moonlighting' in the system. To achieve this, amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are proposed. These amendments will enable the effective detection of moonlighting.

        The proposed amendments should have no impact on those medical practitioners who are complying with the provisions of the Health Insurance Act. The amendments will, however, ensure that no medical practitioner will be able to "hide" behind another medical practitioner, except for the purposes of legitimate training. In addition to achieving savings in Medicare outlays, these amendments will reinforce the objectives of the National Medical Workforce Strategy agreed by Health Ministers in 1992 to reduce the impact of overseas trained doctors on the Australian medical workforce.

         Diagnostic Imaging

        The bill will also provide that Medicare benefits are payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consultant physicians;  amend provisions concerning the form of requests for diagnostic imaging services; and provide for improved arrangements for remote area exemptions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 which came into effect from 1 May 1991 implemented a formal mechanism for requesting diagnostic imaging services, specified activities which were deemed to be prohibited practices, and other matters. This included a provision that Medicare benefits were not payable for a diagnostic imaging service unless the rendering medical practitioner had received a written request for the service from another medical practitioner or, for certain prescribed items, a written request from a dental practitioner, a chiropractor, a physiotherapist or a podiatrist.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Certain exceptions and exemptions from the written request provisions were put in place and these included an exception that certain services rendered by a specialist practising in his or her specialty, following a written request, attracted Medicare benefits at a higher rate than would apply if the service was rendered by a practitioner who was not a specialist or who rendered the service outside his or her specialty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The lower rate traditionally related to services which were seen as falling within the competence of general practitioners and included x-rays of the extremities, chest and abdomen. The higher rate related to the same services when rendered by specialist radiologists after the receipt of a written request. The existing provisions allow Medicare benefits to be payable at the higher rate when these services are rendered by any specialist while practising in his or her specialty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An exemption from the written request requirement is also granted where services are rendered by a specialist in the course of practising in his or her specialty (other than in diagnostic radiology) and where that specialist had determined that the service was necessary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The exceptions and provisions did not refer specifically to consultant physicians who rendered a diagnostic imaging service in similar circumstances. Consultant physicians and specialists both possess the same qualifications and have undergone the same training. However, a consultant physician must conduct a wholly referred practice exclusively in their specialty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While it was intended that consultant physicians be treated under the provisions in the same way as specialists, there is doubt that the wording of the provisions authorise the payment of Medicare benefits in those same circumstances to consultant physicians.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To clarify the matter, the bill provides specifically for Medicare benefits to be payable to patients for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consultant physicians when rendered in the same circumstances by specialists, and provides that the Commonwealth will not recover payment of Medicare benefits paid to patients in respect of those services from 1 May 1991, the date from which the changes became operative.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also provides that the form and content of written requests for diagnostic imaging services by dental practitioners, chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists may be prescribed in the same way as those by medical practitioners.
       </para>

        The bill allows for remote area exemptions to be for a shorter term than the present fixed period of three years. It provides for exemptions to be granted from the date the application was received rather than from the date on which the exemption was granted, which could be some weeks after the practitioner applied for exemption due, for example, to a delay in making a decision because an application was being investigated. The provisions are designed to reduce inconvenience to patients who receive diagnostic imaging services provided by rural medical practitioners, such as practitioners just taking up practice, or locums at a practice for a few weeks.

         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—Safety Net Arrangements
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill also gives effect, by changes to the National Health Act 1953, to the decision announced in the 1995-96 Budget to change the safety net arrangements applying to general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The PBS has for more than forty years been providing the Australian community with access to necessary medications and enjoys international recognition for its success. However, with an ageing population and the development of new drugs, the costs of operating the PBS are increasing every year. In 1993-94, for example, the cost of the Scheme increased to approximately $1.7 billion. This cost must be borne by the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The PBS safety net, which was introduced in 1986 to help patients who require a lot of medication, will remain available. There will be no changes to the safety net arrangements for pensioners and other concessional beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For general patients, the safety net threshold will be increased from $407.60 in 1995 to $600 for the calendar year 1996, with this amount to be indexed for subsequent years in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Once a general patient and members of the patient's family have this amount recorded on their Prescription Record Form, pharmaceutical benefits will be available at the concessional rate of $2.60 (indexed) per prescription for the remainder of the calendar year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This change is estimated to reduce outlays on the PBS by $10 million in 1995-96 and by $30 million in subsequent years.

         —The Democrats support the government amendments. We note that the government amendments to the bill will rectify some of the defects by allowing a person to request a qualification assessment to be done. This will allow a person to find out whether or not they are qualified for the payment before the end of what could be a drawn out appeal process. However, the Democrats are opposed to schedule 16 because of the changes it makes to the treatment of compensation payments. If the schedule is to be passed, however, we would want to see the government's amendment incorporated in the bill because it does give some improvement. Provisions in schedule 16 will allow the department to apply compensation preclusion periods on claimants as well as recipients. While this process would be administratively simple, it would have a number of undesirable effects. That is why we would want to support the amendment, but we will be seeking to vote against schedule 16.

         What happened, as everyone knows, is that we had the grossest example of mismanagement that I have seen since coming into this place. We had a minister who, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, was all over the place, did not know what his program was all about and it never got up. Then the minister put out a release saying that the opposition was responsible for their mismanagement.

The condolence motion speeches in this place were not expected to be as long as they were in the House of Representatives—and they were not.

The main sections of the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill are clauses 5 and 6, which set out the method of calculating the levy. The levy would only be imposed on jet aircraft. It would not apply to aircraft operated by the Defence Force, the military, police or customs services of another country, nor would it apply to emergency or charitable flights.

         The aircraft noise levy bills are an integral part of the government's plan to insulate or acquire the homes and public buildings to the north of Sydney airport that are worst affected by aircraft noise. The government is in the process of buying 113 homes that are the worst affected. It plans to insulate 4,200 houses and units inside the 30 ANEF contour and schools, child-care facilities, health-care facilities and churches inside the 25 ANEF contour. The Department of Administrative Services is currently conducting a pilot study of 18 homes to determine the best forms of insulation.

         I and my other Senate colleagues have examined the Sydney airport insulation program over the last few months in our role on the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. The draft noise management plan recommended that the government insulate the homes in the 30 ANEF contour in accordance with Australian Standard 2021, which recommended that noise levels inside bedrooms should not exceed 50 decibels and that noise levels inside the other rooms of a domestic residence should not exceed 60 decibels.

         Most of the homes in the insulation area are made out of brick, which in itself is a relatively good insulator. However, the windows of most homes would need to be double glazed and this has caused all sorts of problems with protuberances now jutting into rooms and the inability of people, for example, to put up curtains. The doors would need to be replaced by four centimetre thick solid core doors with plastic seals around the frames. Some of the recipients of the pilot program have complained that their children now have difficulty shutting and opening those particular doors. So even with the best will in the world this thing will not go through smoothly.

         Most of the homes in the area would also require modifications to their roofs and ceilings, which are designed to keep out the weather, not the sound of howling jet aeroplanes. On one of the buildings we saw, in fact, it was obvious that you just could not put batts in the way you would for heating purposes; you would have to cover the whole ceiling. There could not be one crack or chink, otherwise the noise would get through. Complaints are being made, for instance, that with those insulations that are being carried out all the electrical wires have been covered up, so they cannot now get to the electrical wires within the ceilings.

         The other thing that was drawn to our attention was the sound insulation of weatherboard homes. The difficulties there were they had to skirt the whole underneath of the house. The claim was made that this would lead to dry rot and the introduction of white ants where the breeze has to be chopped off to get it through. I am just giving you some of the examples we saw.

         We inspected a number of houses in the pilot program. One of the houses we inspected highlights the difficulties in retrofitting insulation into old buildings that are so common in the insulation area. One we looked at was a workers' cottage in Albany Road, Petersham, with a slate roof. It had partly been restored by its owners. As you enter the house, you pass three bedrooms on your right, before entering the living room through a fully restored half glazed door. The eat-in kitchen, laundry and bathroom are located in the unrestored section of the house, which has a flat corrugated iron roof. The maximum level of decibel noise in the house is about 86.

I am not being critical of the people doing it and the pilot program, I think you have to go through that.

         The government misled the people of Sydney about the level of noise that would be associated with the closure of the east-west runway and the opening of the new runway. It was not the new runway that caused the problem. The new runway is south of the east-west runway and east of the main north-south runway. Theoretically, there should have been an improvement in the movement of aircraft and aircraft cannot take off on the new runway. So they cannot take off when they make the most noise over the northern suburbs of Sydney; they can only take off to the south. And from what we have seen there are no problems on take-offs to the south on either of those two runways. But the real problem came when they virtually closed the east-west, and I will talk about that a little later.

         The Minister for Transport's first attempt at developing a program was his announcement of the $183 million package on 1 November 1994. In early December, with community outrage growing, he announced a revision to that package that accelerated the insulation program and implemented a range of other measures, such as the designated flight paths, which have caused all the misery. In the budget, the government shovelled even more money into the insulation program. There is no reason why these measures could not have been implemented before the closure of the east-west runway and the opening of the new parallel runway.

         The east-west runway was virtually closed and the new runway was opened. Instead of aircraft being spread around Sydney, which had always been the case previously, a narrow flight corridor was introduced. This grossly affected two groups of people. One was the Labor heartland, which includes places such as Marrickville and Leichhardt. People there had bought homes under flight paths at a discounted price. They had lived under aeroplanes. Apparently, one aeroplane every five, six or seven minutes did not bother them. They were used to it. But they then found themselves, in peak periods, getting an aircraft over their roof taking off or landing once every two minutes. It was the final straw.

I am not going to pre-empt the committee in any way, but the committee has received over 3,500 individual submissions, and that does not include form letters. If you wanted to work out some rule of thumb which statisticians would use about how many people have not written compared with those that have, you would be looking at 400,000 or 500,000 people who continue to be irate.

Will the government be able to insulate a house every six hours if it keeps its promise of the time factor involved? Are there homes which, because of their structure, cannot be insulated? If so, what will it do about that? Are there schools that cannot be insulated? We saw one that is claimed to not be able to be insulated.

         —I will briefly take the time of the Senate to support Senator Parer. He has basically said all that needs to be said about the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995. What we are dealing with is purely a political response to an indescribably huge mess that the government has got itself into through its own incompetence. I am not a lawyer, but I remember people saying years ago something to the effect that hard cases make bad law. To design bills about the situation that exists at present at Sydney airport, with all the shortcomings that this legislation has, is really quite pointless.

         Senator Parer said that this is almost an open-ended commitment. You cannot really be concerned about noise in Sydney yet expose every other resident to similar noise from jets at all the other airports in Australia. Who knows where this will end. There are physical demands on insulating houses as a consequence of these bills. As Senator Parer said, one will have to be done every six hours to stay with the program. It is clearly quite impossible.

         The government should have been handling its affairs much better. Even at this late stage, it should be enforcing the use of quieter aircraft on the Australian airlines. When jet aircraft were first introduced, they were turbo jets. Later, they went to turbo fans. There has been a very significant reduction in noise output from jet aircraft. You only have to listen to some of the old service aircraft, such as the American KC135 tankers—similar aircraft to the Boeing 707s—with the early generation engines, not the new engines, taking off under full load at an Australian airport to know how far we have come at reducing the noise output from jet engines.

         The British Aerospace 146 is cleared for operation at most airports around the world not subject to a curfew because it is just so quiet. Paradoxically, under this legislation, it is more heavily penalised than aircraft like the Boeing 727. That leads me to another point. Why is the government allowing Ansett to keep operating Boeing 727s in Australia? They clearly infringe the category 3 noise standards that were agreed internationally quite a few years ago. I am not sure of the implementation date, but in the immediate future the aircraft themselves must be written down to a negligible depreciation value at Ansett. They would have had the youngest of them for at least 15 years by my reckoning. Probably 20 years would be the average fleet age.

         On the same topic, it is interesting that, because they are noisy aircraft, they never go into Sydney. The Boeing 727s that Ansett has are inflicted on the good burghers of Melbourne and Brisbane. They more or less run a direct Brisbane-Melbourne route exclusively with the 727s. Presumably that is because the Brisbane and Melbourne residents do not kick up the fuss that the Sydney people do. That aircraft should be removed from regular Australian public transport service along with the F28, because they are both old aircraft and they are incredibly noisy.

         One of the other things the government could do is control the approach paths to the airports and stop fresh building taking place under the approach paths.

The Cannon Hill saleyards—the meatworks—Borthwicks, which is on the south bank of the river, is almost directly under the approach path to the main runway at the new Brisbane airport.

The proposal that Cannon Hill should be built up as a high density residential area is quite nonsensical. Brisbane airport is not going to move as Sydney airport is.

I support the first part of his amendment which indicates that the government misled the people of Sydney about the third runway when it was opened. The people of Sydney and New South Wales were promised a third runway. They actually finished up with 1 1/2 runways. The second aspect of his amendment relates to the fact that an adequate noise study strategy was not prepared. I think that the public angst and outcry about the noise has been clearly evidenced by a lack of planning.

I think it is acknowledged that the noise abatement work should have been undertaken before the third runway came into operation.

         A pilot study has been conducted with 20 houses being insulated using a variety of materials and techniques. We have certainly heard evidence that there is a degree of concern about the way the pilot study has been implemented and the cost of the study. It has cost $1 million to insulate 20 houses. A cost of $50,000 a house is certainly a very expensive way of insulating those houses against noise. At least their problem is being partially addressed.

         There are several thousand ethnic Ukrainians in Bosnia. They are a small ethnic minority. Ethnic Ukrainians have lived in Bosnia for more than 100 years, mainly in the north-west region of the country. Their main centres of spiritual and cultural life are Bania Luka and Prnjavor. They live in the parishes of Kozarec, Devjatyna, Lyshria and Derventa, along with other communities in those areas. Up to 6,000 ethnic Ukrainians lived in those places before the war in the former Yugoslavia. As a result of the war, several entire parishes, including Kamenycia and Dubrova, have disappeared completely. People have been dispossessed and expelled from areas they have lived in for all of their lives.

         Caboolture, being only 50 kilometres from the city, has been developing as almost a residential satellite suburb of Brisbane. We now have proposals which appear to almost make the Caboolture area a gravel pit for the supply of gravel and sand for building in Brisbane. I want to put on record the reasons why these projects create great problems. Most of the issues are common to both areas, but there are a couple of additional problems which are peculiar to the Beachmere project.

         There is a very significant traditional Aboriginal camping and burial place near Beachmere. The position is evidenced by the presence of archaeological shell middens and other indications. The camping and burial places are of cultural importance to the Aboriginal community and are of such archaeological importance that they need to be preserved.

          Maldale and Beachmere are seaside residential areas and the amenities of both areas will be adversely affected by very large sandmining projects. They will be affected by noise, dust and pollution of the water. One of the concerns of the people in the Beachmere area is that Bestmann Road, which is the access road into the sandmining area, will be very adversely affected by the noise of empty trucks travelling to the subject land and by loaded trucks travelling from the project. These trucks will travel right through the middle of a residential area. These are significant issues which ought to be noted by the Senate.

         Another issue concerning both areas is the prevalence of acid sulfate soils. Test holes which have been bored indicate that the acid sulfate soils are a very serious problem. They exist right up and down the east coast of Australia. While they are left in situ these soils are no problem at all. The problem occurs when these soils are brought to the surface. The particular minerals in the acid sulfate soils become oxidised and, when mixed with water, form sulfuric acid. As a result, the marine environment is polluted and we have a dangerous situation for marine life and birds. The water becomes polluted and this affects the people in both areas who have bores.

         As a result we have a very serious threat to a number of prawn farms on Bullock Creek and Elimbah Creek, the two creeks that border the projected sandmining proposal in the Maldale area. There is a real conflict in land use. It seems to me that in Australia we are facing these kinds of conflicts all the time and they are very hard to resolve. We have conflict between mining and agricultural use from time to time. Here we have conflict between the quarrying of sand and residential use, rural use and aquaculture.

         These issues have to be resolved. Sunfish, the large corporation in Queensland which deals particularly with professional fishing, and the Department of Environment and Heritage are both very solidly opposed to these two proposals. We are concerned that such a large extractive industry would make these areas quite unlivable. They would threaten the industry currently being conducted there. The residents and the Department of Environment and Heritage believe that certain controls should be put in place. However, if they were put in place they would make the extractive industry quite unviable. It seems strange that the companies involved are pressing ahead with the proposals to quarry.

         There are a number of other problems associated with the projects. My nine acres is in an area where there are a number of families. We have many bus routes which service the large numbers of children who travel to school each day in Caboolture. We have seen a much heavier use of these roads in the last couple of months as a result of the fires which swept through the area last year and burnt out a large portion of the pine plantations. The timber in those plantations has been harvested and the trucks involved in this project have caused a lot of congestion on these roads. However, the use of the roads by those trucks will finish very shortly when all the timber has been harvested. The transportation of material from the proposed extractive industry will continue for many years.

          There is a terrible conflict here between the various current uses of the land and any possible future uses. I support the concerns of the people in the area. The only solution I can see is for the companies concerned to seek out sand and gravel in areas which are not as fragile or as sensitive as the areas in which they now have applications to open up these mining projects. It does not seem to me that it is possible to hold together the various land uses which I have described.

In the RFP process no `specification' is detailed as an essential premise is an ability to measure proposals against a requirement, then pick the one which best meets the overall needs. Performance requirements which must be met by the contractor are then written into the final contract.

        The matters raised in questions (1) to (4), (6), (7) and (10) are the responsibility of the South Australian Government. However, in relation to (2), I am advised that the standardisation works in the Adelaide Hills do not preclude passenger operations on standard gauge should these be required at some stage in the future. The changes that have been made reflect decisions by the appropriate SA authorities as to the needs of the foreseeable future. I am also advised that should standard gauge passenger facilities be required, these could be constructed by SA.

        (5) Because the two statements refer to two different sections of line they are not in conflict. Australian National's (AN) reference to National Rail (NR) being responsible reflects the fact that NR was the project manager for the section between Goodwood and Belair which is owned by the South Australian State Transport Authority. For this section NR was responsible for determining the nature and scope of the works. The reference by the Parliamentary Secretary to AN being responsible refers to the section of line at Mount Barker which was the area of concern to the correspondent. AN owns the line between Belair and the Victorian border and was the project manager for the standardisation works on this section.

        (3) Yes. Australian obligated nuclear material (AONM) supplied to France and other countries is subject to strict and effective safeguards arrangements that ensure it is only used for peaceful purposes. AONM supplied to France, including AONM transferred for conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication and reprocessing on behalf of non-French end-users, is subject to the provisions of the bilateral agreements between Australia and France and Australia and Euratom, and to the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system. These arrangements allow the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO) to confirm that the quantities of AONM present in the French civil nuclear industry are wholly accounted for and clearly carry the obligations which Australia has imposed by virtue of its nuclear safeguards agreements with both France and Euratom.

One captain is also on long service leave until the end of 1995. However, these deficiencies are manageable.
