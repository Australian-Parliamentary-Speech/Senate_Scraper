         —My question is directed to Senator Cook, the industry minister. It is sort of a dorothy dixer because I wanted to give the minister the chance to assure the Senate that his colleagues Stephen Smith and Wayne Swan are wrong and that his proposed innovation statement is not `a bronze medal strategy' and not `absolutely lacking in substance'. But, more importantly, Minister, I ask you: how can industry have confidence in you when, despite all the hype, this innovation statement is delayed month after month after month, is still regarded by your colleagues as woefully inadequate, and has in fact had to have been taken out of your hands by the Prime Minister, ultimately to be delivered by him?  Doesn't this debacle further demonstrate a government that has run out of ideas and also of steam?

         This question is about the innovation statement. If the sincerest form of flattery is imitation, then the opposition is engaging in flattery indeed when it comes to the government. I posted at last year's ANZAAS meeting in Geelong the intention of this government to bring down an innovation statement this year. Just about a month ago the opposition decided to get into the act and it announced that its next headland speech would be on innovation. It was only about nine or 10 months too late from the initiative taken by the government, but I congratulate the opposition on trying to catch up to us. It is a commendable effort by them.

Because I have not told them, they cannot form a view about it, and because they cannot form a view about it, they cannot grade it as to whether it is a bronze medal or a gold medal.

Innovation—the bringing together of Australia's long-established reputation in science and technology as a leading nation in the world in that field with our entrepreneurial skill and our commercial sector—will ensure that Australia is a winner in the international economy, that we think innovatively at all levels of management, that we use our science and technology base to create new ideas and new products from those ideas, and that Australians can look forward to better, more intelligent jobs in a more competitive industry at the leading edge in the world.

         This statement has not been put off; it has been delayed in order to make it a bigger and more effective blockbuster which will blow right over the opposition and drive us back into office for yet another term. Worry about that, Senator Hill; that is your problem, because you have been a most uninventive science shadow minister and one who is a joke around the halls of science in this country.

         —I had the honour to open yesterday's 64th ANZAAS conference, which is a pre-eminent gathering of Australian and New Zealand scientists; and the opening of this prestigious event is, in fact, the right place for the science minister to have been. I was able to point out the clear fact that the latest OECD figures now rank Australia fourth in the OECD in terms of public sector expenditure on research and development expressed as a percentage of GDP. We were ranked seventh out of 25 on that index, but last year Australia moved ahead of France, the Netherlands and Germany and is now only led by the three Scandinavian countries. That is a matter for celebration for Australia. We have a strong public sector commitment to science. We are ranked fourth in the developed world in terms of public sector expenditure.

         Unlike the opposition, we have a real and longstanding commitment to science. The real value of total spending on science since we came to office in 1983 has increased by 56 per cent—that is, in real dollars our commitment to science has gone up by 56 per cent compared with that of the opposition when they were in power.

         Last year I announced at ANZAAS a study to benchmark Australia's science and innovation system. The study, conducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics in consultation with my department, the Australian Research Council, the Industry, Research and Development Board and the science academies, compared Australia with more than 20 OECD and Asian countries in order to assess how we rate in the world. The study is close to publication, but I can reveal some of the data that has come out.

         The study paints a picture of Australia as a reasonably well balanced and, for its size, an influential science country which remains much more sophisticated than the science systems emerging within the regional economies. The study has some particularly interesting information about human resources in science. Australia now has a higher than OECD average concentration of researchers, scientists and engineers engaged in research and development. The growth rate in the numbers of students graduating in science and engineering in Australia is one of the highest in the world. The proportion of women graduating in science and engineering is now one of the highest in the world, as is the number of women moving into research in the public and private sectors. The age profile of scientists and engineers is younger in Australia than is the case in most developed countries. The concentration of research and development personnel in our total work force has increased by 25 per cent since the 1980s and is higher than the median for the OECD economies.

         One of the myths that circulate is that there is a brain drain from Australia of scientists going overseas. The facts are that every year for the past 10 years there has been an increase of scientists and engineers migrating to Australia—a net increase of some 30,000 scientists and engineers during that period. That is a brain gain, not a brain drain. There is a waiting list for scientists wanting to come here.

         I could go on, but, quite significantly, when this study is fully presented, it will show that under the administration of this government we have spent the public dollar wisely to increase our capacity as a nation in science, engineering and innovation, which are key drivers of economic growth and which create intelligent and rewarding jobs for Australians. As a consequence of our strength in this field, we are now developing a whole string of new industries which will provide intelligent and challenging jobs for the next generation of Australians and make sure the Australian economy is a strong economy in this, the highest growth area of the world.

         I am saying that a range of factors is responsible for the current downturn, and the industry has correctly made those public. The major reasons are a flat international market and reduced profit margins exacerbated by rising domestic prices and, as Senator Boswell acknowledged yesterday, influenced by the drought and high feed grain prices that are a result. They are the major reasons, including of course the appreciation of the value of the Australian dollar of around five per cent.

         What Senator Boswell is trying to perpetuate in relation to industrial relations and the workers being singly responsible for the temporary closure of these meatworks—which, I might add, has forever been a feature of the meat industry in Australia because of the seasonal nature of it—is nonsense. Senator Boswell, you should acknowledge that work is under way to address changing those work practices and AMH, at their meatworks in Rockhampton and a number of their other meatworks, are trialling now new arrangements, in cooperation with the unions—I know you do not want to hear this—and under the supervision of the Industrial Commission, to establish new enterprise agreements for those meatworks.

Why do you claim to have fixed the industrial relations system? Is it not a fact that an independent report commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations found that progress in workplace reform in the export meat processing sector has generally been limited with little to show in terms of widespread and quantifiable increase in productivity and efficiency and that enterprise bargains agreed to date in many cases have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase?

         The government introduced the home and community care program in 1984-85. That was a very important step towards dealing with the chaos left by the previous coalition government and its very ad hoc system of care, which was based on institutional care. The government has increased the funding for that program from $70 million when the program was started to over $423 million this financial year—something like a 243 per cent increase in real terms. There are something like 7,000 projects operating from 4,600 outlets, and they cover over a million people a year—220,000 people a month.

That is an assurance which is quite basic to the integrity of the process.

         Of course, with the takeover in the US Congress, there has been a different focus applied to the CPA from there. As a consequence of that, there has been an attempt there, by the introduction of legislation, to try to divert the US government's support for the CPA and its conclusion. I think that offers false hope to the people in the camps—and that is the unfortunate aspect of it. It is a bill in the US Senate which was predicated on the congressional report that you have referred to—one which, I must state, was based on political motivation rather than any sense of reality of what is happening in the camps.

         But that particular bill offered false hope; it has been shelved indefinitely. However, I also understand that, even if it had succeeded in the US Congress, there was a fair chance that the President might veto it. That particular bill, offering false hope to people who are left in the camps, people who have been screened out, people who should go back by the end of the year, means that they may be expecting to have a chance to go to the US. I do not know whether that is realistic. In the meantime in Australia we have actually introduced a special assistance category to assist some of those people.

         Western Australia in fact has sought to impose conditions on the Commonwealth regarding reservation levels of old-growth and the contribution of non-statutory reserves. This has unnecessarily slowed the whole deferred forest assessment process in the state of Western Australia. The Commonwealth, for its part, has adopted a consistent approach in negotiating deferred forest areas with the states, the basis of which is the position paper on reserve criteria. No individual state has been treated differently from any other state in these negotiations.

         Following advice from the scientific advisory group in relation to both levels of old-growth reservation and the degree to which administrative reserves should be considered, Commonwealth officials have provided as much guidance as they believe is possible without access to the necessary data. So I can say that the Commonwealth very clearly has played its part in seeking to achieve a mutually acceptable and agreeable outcome with Western Australia. The clear process is now in the public arena for interested parties and stakeholders to have an opportunity to comment on these draft deferred forest areas. That consultation process will take place over a three-week period commencing at the end of this week when these documents will be made available in the public arena.

As he has not confirmed that they will be in the form of lines on maps, I ask the minister: if they are not lines on maps, then will that not make public comment irrelevant? If we are provided with lines on maps, how can you expect CALM to supply you with objective scientific information when they have a conflict of interest over which areas are to be set aside as draft DFAs and which areas are to be logged? Minister, how can you guarantee that you will be able to stop logging even in those areas when the WA environment minister has assured us that the Commonwealth has no power to stop logging in those areas of Western Australia but simply the export woodchip licences?

What confidence can Australians have in Commonwealth educative laws, such as the Sex Discrimination Act, and what compliance can we expect with that act by the private sector when cases of rampant abuse of the act within Commonwealth departments go unchecked? If your attention has not yet been drawn to the football tipping newsletter prepared in DEET at Commonwealth expense, will you at least take this copy and undertake to deal with the perpetrators of sexual harassment in the same way that those in private enterprise would be dealt with and ensure that complainants are no longer simply told to get a sense of humour?

         Broadly, the minister's advice to me is that the Telstra news corporation cable television venture announced on 9 March is something that he welcomes. It involves an accelerated improvement in communications infrastructure and indicates Telstra's preparedness to respond to the competition being provided by Optus. He is aware, as I am now, of press speculation concerning the possibility of payments arising due to the commercial agreements that Telstra has entered into for pay television.

         But this is just part of the outlay and process involved in an investment by Telstra on which it hopes and expects and is planning to make a return. It is proceeding on the basis that this will be a profitable investment. This is part of the process of developing, as it is for the news group which has taken on the same liabilities for the same reasons. The matters are ones that are properly determined by the Telstra board and their management, who I am advised have assessed the commercial risk in these transactions as acceptable to the company. As far as I know, the subscriber guarantees are a reasonably common feature of arrangements between program suppliers and pay TV operators, particularly in the early stages of operation.

         The minister is aware—and I am now aware—of Telstra's involvement in this venture, but undertakings of this nature are matters for consideration and decision by the Telstra board. It is not for the Minister for Communications and the Arts to approve the deal. Consistent with the principles for GBE reporting established by this government and Telstra's articles of association, Telstra has kept the government informed of its intention. But, I repeat, it is not for the minister to approve a deal like this; it is a commercial venture approved by the board of Telstra.

Similarly, arrangements for sharing in the profits are governed by a contract and partnership arrangements which are negotiated by Telstra on a fully commercial basis.

         I want to emphasise that on the advice I have received the article appears to focus on only one aspect of the arrangements. I want to re-emphasise that Telstra Multi-Media Pty Ltd has entered into the overall arrangement and intends to charge for the use of the cable and expects to obtain a commercial rate of return on its investment. That is why it has entered into the arrangement. To the best of my advice, it is not an unusual or unorthodox commercial arrangement and it is one on which they expect to return a profit on the shareholders' funds, which are the Australian people's funds.

         There is no coercion of course, but there is strong encouragement for doctors to enter into contracts of that sort. At the moment, with this legislation about to be passed,  it is very disappointing that significant quarters of that same profession, the medical profession, are actively campaigning against doctors signing those contracts. As to any figures, I do not have those to give you. The start-up date of 1 October is a matter of concern.

Until the contracts with the doctors are entered into, very much the same system as is the case now will prevail.

In answering a question yesterday from Senator Woods on freedom of information applications by the families of Kellie Wilkinson and David Wilson, Senator Evans undertook to check the status of the consideration of these requests.

         Both requests captured a vast amount of material, certainly many hundreds of documents in each case which have to be carefully assessed for release, and in many instances consultations have to be undertaken with other authorities and foreign governments involved in the cases. Senators will recall that in these tragic cases the Australian government worked closely with the British and French governments, which also had citizens involved, as well as the Cambodian government.

         With respect to the Wilkinson application, which was received by the department on 27 February this year, 112 documents were released to the applicant on 25 May. A similar number of documents were identified as requiring consultations with other authorities and governments as to their suitability for release. Where material reporting on their views or actions was captured, consultation had to be undertaken with New Scotland Yard by the AFP, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the US State Department, the Cambodian government, the United Nations Secretariat and the Office of the Governor-General.

        That does misrepresent the facts of the situation. The correct circumstances were that I was invited by the organisers of this year's ANZAAS conference to open their conference and deliver the opening address. The organisers canvassed with my staff what the most appropriate time for that to occur might be. The event on the Sunday night was to be a short event, followed immediately by a civic reception by the City of Newcastle.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to interest rates.

        This relates to Senator Cook's inability to deny the point made in my question that, when the government's own rate of inflation calculation is taken into account, Australia's real interest rates, both short-term and long-term, are in fact amongst the highest in the world. In his answer, Senator Cook stuck with the assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday that Australia's short term interest rates `are the seventh lowest in the OECD area' and that this was shown by statistics in the latest edition of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         I assume that both the Prime Minister and Senator Cook are referring to real interest rates. I also assume that they are basing this assertion on a graph in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Economist
         </emphasis>
         showing nominal interest rates less the inflation rate. The only way that you can manipulate the figures to achieve the Prime Minister's result—and even if one accepts that result, it is a pretty middling result at best—is to use as the relevant inflation rate what is nowadays termed in Australia as the headline rate of inflation; that is, in effect, the ordinary consumer price index. For years now this government has been asserting that the headline rate of inflation is not the true rate of inflation.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The government has, instead, chosen to use what it calls the underlying rate of inflation. The underlying rate of inflation is the headline rate adjusted to take out movements in mortgage interest rates, taxes, charges and several other items that affect the headline rate. Using the underlying rate—this is, as I said, the government's own preferred rate—as the true inflation rate, the fact is that Australia's real interest rates are just about the highest in the Western world. As I said, real short-term rates are the third highest in the Western world, according to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Economist

         The government cannot have it both ways. It cannot on the one hand claim that our real interest rates are in the middle of the OECD field and at the same time claim that our inflation is amongst the lowest in the OECD. To claim the former is to say that the true inflation rate is the headline rate. That is the only way he can justify his former statement. That is a fact that today Senator Cook, as I understand it, actually eschewed; he backed away from that.

         If the government wants to change its view on this point to accommodate the Prime Minister's interest rate assertion, then it has the acknowledge that far from Australia having a low inflation rate it in fact has the second highest inflation rate in the whole of the OECD, second only to Italy. I repeat: the government cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim that it has low inflation and that our real interest rate regime is in the middle of the pack. The two are fundamentally inconsistent. Yet the government has tried to mislead the Australian public for a long time now that we are doing well on the interest rate front and on the inflation rate front.

         Even on the government's own manipulated figures, we are not doing that well on the interest rate front. To get that result, the government has to acknowledge that we have a serious inflation problem emerging. We have the second highest inflation rate in the industrialised world. That is an inflation rate that is higher than many of the other non-OECD countries which are among the fastest growing countries on earth and our major trading partners. That is undeniable, yet the government is very deliberately trying to mislead the Australian community on that very point.

         I am glad that the minister acknowledged that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation will attach environmental and other safeguarding conditions when it issues the insurance policies. However, the minister then said that, in general terms, it is no concern of this government what Australian companies are doing abroad; rather, it is the concern of the governments of those countries where the companies are operating. The implication was that the Australian government either has no power to intervene or no interest in intervening.

         It certainly should have an interest in intervening. Also, it has been proved that it has the power to intervene. We have had at least two examples of that in recent times. We had the War Crimes Amendment Act 1988, which provided that people who committed wartime atrocities overseas could be tried and imprisoned in Australia. That act was upheld by the High Court in Polyukhovich v the Commonwealth. More recently we have had the child sex tourism legislation, which would have a similar effect for Australians who go overseas to sexually exploit young people.

         It is certainly not beyond the wit of either our drafting counsel or this parliament to ensure that corporate citizens behave in line with standards that this parliament would like to see enforced in Australia. In the first instance, of course, it is perfectly reasonable—and I understand the government may well support this—to develop a voluntary code of conduct for Australian companies operating overseas. But let's make no mistake about it: if that voluntary code of conduct is either unsatisfactory or proves that Australian companies are prepared to ignore it, this parliament certainly has the powers to pass legislation to ensure that our corporate citizens behave overseas in a responsible manner.

Those people, I believe, were rightfully granted refugee status here in this country, and I think the vast majority of them are making very gainful contributions to Australia's life.

         I must express some disappointment about the actions that are taking place in the United States Congress at the moment, actions, as I understand it, from a small number of individual congressmen—I am repeating the minister's words—which are giving false hope to people who are currently vegetating in the camps in South-East Asia.

         `Vegetating' has been a kind word for some of the camps and, as I said, I have visited most of them. In a place like Whitehead in Hong Kong, it is much worse than vegetating. In that concrete and razor-wire establishment known as Whitehead, the individuals are subject to quite a deal of violence. We have witnessed on our television screens in recent times in this country the riots that have taken place in the camps, where the forces of law and order have had to go in under the protection of tear gas to bring back order to the place. Quite a number of the detainees have been injured, and some people have even lost their lives in those conflicts. The guards who look after the camps have also been injured.

         With the best will in the world, the congressmen who are pushing forward that bill in the United States Congress are giving those people in the camps, particularly in places like Whitehead, some false hope that they will be resettled in the United States or in some other part of the world. This is after these people have gone through independent assessment—in the case of Whitehead, by the Hong Kong authorities. It is all overseen by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, a body and establishment which I hold in the highest regard—which is not to say that we have not had some arguments during the Senate committee hearings on similar types of matters we have had to look into in this country.

         It is unfortunate that those people have been given this false hope and that some 40,000 people continue to vegetate in places like Galang Island and Sungei Besi in Whitehead when they should be back in their homeland rebuilding their lives. Whilst one congressional report has been mentioned, another United States initiative with the aid organisations who visited Vietnam and many of the camps came down with a much more positive report than the one that has been mentioned today by Senator Teague in his question to the minister.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Jacinta Collins this day, relating to aged care services and the home and community care program.

        The minister's comments were nothing more than a pea and thimble trick, which we ought to become used to from this government in a number of areas. She talked about the community aged care places for older people as if they were additional aged care places, but they are not. I do not mind her getting up and saying what the government is doing but she really should tell the whole story—not half of it. That is what happened today in the chamber.

         The government's planning ratios of 100 nursing home, hostel and community aged care package places per 1,000 people aged over 70 have not increased. They have simply been rejigged. We have seen this happen in lots of other areas as well, and here it is happening again. People listening to question time on the radio or from up in the galleries would have thought that these were new places for older people to keep them out of institutions and at home. They are not new places. They are the ratios rejigged. They are simply places that have been taken from the nursing home and hostel sectors so that in the future there will be 40 nursing beds, 50 hostel beds and 10 community aged care packages per 1,000 of the population aged over 70.

         There are enormous problems in the aged care area. Many nursing homes are in a crisis situation because of a lack of adequate funding—just look at the planning ratios I just mentioned. These ratios need to be monitored carefully to ensure they are realistic and appropriate for Australia's ageing population. They were developed in the mid-1980s, when only 11 per cent of people aged 70 or over were over 85 years. By 2021, this figure will have increased to 16 per cent. So the supply of residential aged care places relative to the over-85 population will, in effect, decrease significantly over that period. It may be that the planning ratios will need to be adjusted in future to respond to changing circumstances.

         Senator Crowley should have explained this in more detail when she answered that question. As I said, it appeared from what she said that these were new, you-beaut places. In fact, what we have is the same number of services for older people but in a different form. We are not saying that we should not have home and community care packages. There are some people who choose to be at home and who really need the level of care that you would get in residence at a nursing home, but they can stay at home with appropriate care. What we are saying, though, is that the government cannot have it both ways; it cannot pretend that this is something new.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other problem that we have seen with the rigid planning ratios is that they are based on regions and they do not allow or reflect regional differences. For example, an area which attracts a large number of retirees may well develop, over time, a disproportionate number of people over 85, and they are the group that have a greater demand on nursing home places. If there is a disproportionate number of people over 85 in an area, there will be a greater demand for aged care services in that area.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With these ratios and in the concepts behind them there is an assumption that, as a proportion of the old, old increases, the supply of carers will continue to meet the demand for care in the community. Whether one likes it or not, the home aged care package does place some demands on the carers, who are usually women.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It may not be the case that we have the same number of carers in the community that we have today. We have higher labour market participation rates of women. It is also the fact that potential carers will be older themselves. As more people live into that 85-year-old category, their daughters and sons will be older themselves and maybe not in a position to care for their ageing parents, in their 80s and 90s. We see increasing numbers of remarriages and divorces and that entails complications as to who is responsible for parents and step-parents.

         I will not go on about the shortfall in the funding required to upgrade nursing homes, which Professor Gregory outlined, or the government's failure to fund dementia-specific facilities—we have seen one close down in Melbourne just recently because the government has failed to subsidise that—or its continued failure to meet the needs of people with dementia for residential facilities. The minister's coming in here today, going on as if it was a new program, had to be shown for what it was; that is, a pea and thimble trick.

        I just wish we had a minister for science who would put his brain into gear when he opened his mouth to start speaking. What we have is just words, words, words. We have economic diatribe as a substitute for real dialogue and discussion about where science is going in this country.

         When the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) starts speaking about science, very quickly—within a sentence—he is talking about innovation, competition, economic growth, new industries and material advantage. The minister does not even understand what science is about. He is talking about technology and he is talking about technology linked with industry. There is a vast difference, which the minister simply does not understand. That came out very clearly in that diatribe with which he went on today.

         When one looks at science as the basic and strategic foundation on which that innovation, competition and industrial development is based, one finds that Australia is in a declining position, not an improving position. We need to look, for instance, at the work that has been done over some years now in the Australian National University on the science citation index. This is a direct measure of the value scientists elsewhere in the world put on Australian science; that is, the number of times other scientists find the work done by Australian scientists worthy of being quoted when they do their own research work.

         What one finds is that, particularly since 1987, there has been a very significant decline in the relative rate of science citation for Australian scientific publications. These are publications in the proper, refereed scientific journals. This is not explained by claims that what we are doing is patenting more work—that work is not appearing in the journals but that the work is nonetheless being down—because when one looks at other countries, at Japan and the US, one sees that, despite the higher rate of patenting in those countries, their relative science citation rate has either been maintained or in fact is increased.

         When one looks at this basic element of science, one finds declining standards. One finds that the money the minister talked about is a confused hotchpotch of technology-industry money mixed up with science. The minister claims that that amount has been increased, but when one looks at the money going into basic science, one finds that that is not there and that scientists all over the country, whether in the CSIRO or the universities, are finding it extremely difficult.

         —As all Australians would probably now be aware, there is a debate up and running in this country as to the consequences on our interest rates of the level of our foreign debt. Some may regard this as a theoretical debate, something to be left to university professors. Like other economic arguments, such as the appropriate level of tariffs, the current account debate and the effect on employment of higher inflation, there are clearly a number of schools of thinking.

         To the ordinary Australian in the street this debate may seem to be an inordinate waste of good time, energy and breath. Why then would the Prime Minister of this nation devote an entire three-quarters of a page in the middle of a national newspaper to argue that his critics are wrong and that he is right on this subject? Why is it that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has decided that convincing Australians that he is right on this academic argument is critical to the future well-being of Australia—more important than unemployment, our current account deficit or even the health of our nation's kids? Why does he need to go into print on this topic and no other?

         Perhaps one could cynically suggest that the Prime Minister has always been interested in this theoretical field and simply wants to demonstrate his standing. Perhaps he believes that there is merit in academic and theoretical truth, which warrants his intervention at this time. To suggest such propositions would require that one was not merely cynical but benignly stupid, given that the standing of the Prime Minister as an economic academic would be somewhere near absolute zero were it to be measured on a temperature scale.

         It is true that Prime Minister Keating has used  Australia as his economic laboratory. He has experimented on the Australian people with his theories and predilections, but on this occasion academic righteousness is not, sadly, the motivating factor urging the Prime Minister.

So he reacts. First, the attack on those who dare confront him with this truth. Challenge their credibility, their motives and their integrity—anything but their arguments. Call them sour and spiteful, ridicule and mock—play the man, but never the ball.

         What is the truth that the Prime Minister wants so desperately to avoid? It can be summarised with three facts: firstly, since the election of the Labor government in 1983 Australia's foreign debt has increased from $23 billion to a massive $180 billion; secondly, since the takeover of the prime ministership by Paul Keating in December 1991, the Commonwealth's own purpose debt has increased a staggering $70 billion to approach $100 billion; and, thirdly, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank was so delighted to concede yesterday:

        Debt has some connection with interest rates. It is, in the words of the Prime Minister's mate the Governor of the Reserve Bank, obvious. It is certainly obvious to all those paying interest on their loans. It is obvious to every business that tries to raise funds to keep their business afloat. It is obvious to every householder who borrows money to fund a home extension, a holiday or even the purchase of the bare essentials. It is obvious to everyone except a Prime Minister and a Labor Party that does not want the people of Australia to reflect on who has made possible Australia's appalling debt situation. Who is it that has created the need for Australian companies, not to mention Australian governments, to borrow overseas? It is the man who claimed he pulled the levers of the Australian economy—the man who has run this nation for 12 years. Prime Minister Keating made the claim, so he must take the blame.

         Before the Labor Party senators opposite jump to their feet to recite the other words of wisdom from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, particularly his comments that those asserting a link between foreign debt and short-term interest rates were drawing a long bow, allow me to develop the question of the link a little further. On 30 March this year, in a speech to business economists, the governor said this:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So long as we remain so dependent on foreign savings, for which we must compete in international capital markets, we remain vulnerable to adverse swings in market sentiment.

        Further he said:

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The New Price is Right
        </emphasis>
        , I will explain it in simple language. The Keating Labor government has been chalking up debts for Australia—up to $70 billion over the past three years alone. To  borrow that money it has gone into both the domestic market and, to a limited degree, the foreign market. When the federal government borrows money in Australia, it makes it harder for others to borrow in this country. As a consequence, the private sector and state governments look overseas to borrow money for investment purposes. That, in turn, pushes up our foreign debt, the amount we owe to the rest of the world. As the debt gets bigger, the greater is our risk. Companies can go broke and even states under Labor administrations can go close.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To cover the increased risk, the money lenders impose a premium on our borrowings. They do not trust us quite as much as they used to. Consequently, everyone who borrows money overseas pays a little more. Why is it that 10-year bond rates here in Australia incur a premium price, a risk premium of two per cent, or 200 basis points, over that in the USA or even a risk premium of 150 basis points, or 1.5 per cent, over our neighbouring New Zealand? In addition, just because we have to borrow overseas, we are made vulnerable to changes in market sentiment. If US interest rates go up and investors move their money out of Australia, our exchange rate is affected. This has a consequence for our inflation rate and, as the authorities take tough policy action, our interest rates are affected. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said, `everything in economics is affected by everything else'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So why is the Labor government having to borrow so much in the domestic market? Why does our federal government owe $100 billion? Because the Prime Minister would rather buy votes and curry favours than live within his means. The Labor government have stolen, mortgaged, put in hock and gambled the future of our nation for the sake of short-term political appeal. They have sucked taxes from the pockets not only of today's workers, but of the children of those workers and their children too. They have decimated household savings and they are the main culprit for the lack of public savings. Now, as we approach another federal election, they want the public of Australia to believe that everything is okay. They want you to believe that there is only one way of running the country.

         In my remarks last week I said something which I probably have to apologise for. I said initially that senators opposite either did not understand the relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates or they were deliberately trying to deceive the Australian public. I have to apologise for the latter part of my remarks. It does not seem that they are trying to deliberately deceive the public. It seems that they genuinely do not have anybody on their side who has ever had to construct a home mortgage rate or understands how it is done. I go back to the statements which I made last week, and I will repeat them for the benefit of the Senate:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para>
        Given the sort of evidence which the other side has been dependent upon, I can go to no better authority than Dr Vince FitzGerald. Having had time over the weekend to reflect upon the debate and consider his own remarks, Dr FitzGerald came out in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper and sought to clarify exactly what he had said. His article in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        said:
       </para>

       <para>
        Not only is that exactly what I said in the Senate last week but it is almost exactly the same words. Just for the sake of clarifying the situation for senators opposite, I will read what else he said in the article. He said:
       </para>

        The premium is, without doubt, substantially priced into fixed mortgage rates because the funding of these relates directly to the bond market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Well, that is true, except there are no fixed mortgage rates in this country. Senator Gibson, you cannot, as you do in the United States, get a mortgage which will be fixed for 30 years. The reason for that is that we do not have the depth in the corporate bond market in this country that they do in the United States. If you were in the United States, you could say that foreign debt was related to home mortgage rates, but you cannot say it in this country because it is simply not true. The banks borrow short and lend long. Their short-term rates are where they get their funds from, and their funds base determines the rate that they charge on the mortgage—and that changes. Because it changes, there is no need to put in a risk premium. Therefore, there is no relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates.

         I think it is important to stress this, because it is a source of concern to the average Australian. They listen to parliament and read the newspapers. Unfortunately, they read ill-informed remarks by some journalists in the

The fact of the matter is that there is no relationship and there cannot be a relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates, and everything that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) have said is absolutely true.

         I return to my original point. The fact that there is nobody on the other side who understands the relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates is indeed a source of serious concern. I do not think we can take to task Senator Short. He does his best in this place, I am sure, although I do not believe he has ever been in the financial markets. He has been a long way from economics. But you cannot criticise the apprentice; you have to criticise the sorcerer. The person who is really the source of all of these remarks—these ill-informed remarks which needlessly upset average working Australians—is Mr Costello, the shadow Treasurer.

         One of the points the Prime Minister makes is that we have been in a position of borrowing from overseas since 1788, and it is quite true. Senator Gibson might like to know the difference between debt and equity. Senator Gibson only talks about the rise in foreign debt since 1983. He does not seem to have heard of net foreign indebtedness. He does not seem to appreciate that there are two sorts of foreign finance for economic growth within this country—equity and debt.

         As the previous speaker, Senator Wheelwright, has said, Australia has been in debt to foreigners for all of its 207 years of white settlement. In fact, our foreign debt as a percentage of GDP is lower now than it was five years ago—thank goodness for that!—and the proportion of our export income needed to service the debt is lower now than it was five years ago. But we do still need to address our chronic national savings problem. We do need to address our chronic current account deficits, which are evidence of this national savings problem and which are year by year adding to our debt.

         The key variable driving our current account deficit is not so much the cyclical trade balance, but the underlying income deficit; that is, the interest we are paying on our foreign debt and the profits we have to repatriate to foreign investors.

It is not good enough to keep offering that to us as a solution.

         As a capital importing country, we need to be able to continue to attract both lenders and investors. The net foreign debt figures focused on in yesterday's debate and today's debate tell only half the story, in our view. Our foreign debt has stabilised since 1989, largely because of the dramatic increase in foreign equity liabilities. This government has promoted a massive debt for equity swap. Senator Wheelwright said that we are not selling off the farm, but over the past decade the level of foreign investment in Australia has risen from 16 per cent of GDP to over 36 per cent—that is in one decade—and it is still rising.

         Foreign equity investment is much more expensive to service than foreign debt. I have been pointing that out for about six years now, and I think some of the predictions that we have made over that time are coming to reality. According to the Bureau of Statistics, Australia's net foreign debt liabilities stand at about 16 per cent of GDP, but net foreign debt liabilities stand at about 39 per cent.

         Can we manage the cost? Everybody asks if it is manageable or not. For every $1 we pay overseas in interest on the debt, we are now paying 80c in profits to foreigners on the equity investments. It is a very small gap, as I said yesterday—$1 and 80c. That means that foreign investment is more than twice as expensive as foreign debt. That, to us, is a very key point.

         But we do not want to talk about foreign investment policy in this country because, despite the one Senate committee which has looked at general policy parameters as they apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board, over the past decade neither of the major parties has really been willing to address the little oversight that the Foreign Investment Review Board provides to key foreign investment decisions. There is now no test of whether an investment will provide a net economic benefit to Australia. There is now no opportunities test of whether a comparable Australian bidder is available. There is no transparency in decision making. There is no government response to the Senate print media inquiry report handed down nearly five months ago.

         The dispersed areas of public housing, semi-public housing and cheap housing continue to generate negative equity. The areas are expensive to live in, although they are cheaper to buy. It is mainly initial low cost and the existence of public sector loan assistance that drives the poorer people to buy in these areas. Their purchase often has more to do with waiting lists and availability of loans than the state of the market, so they can get caught out. Efforts to raise prices by freezing development simply distort prices and further reduce the market, since it becomes more difficult for people wanting to buy as residents to purchase a home. It must be seen that there are elements, as I have mentioned before, in our housing markets which impact on people's payments much more than interest rates, though interest rates are important.

         —According to the running sheet, the coalition's amendment comes next. As I understand it, it was suggested that amendments to clause 2 be left until last. But, in any event, I am not minded to press our amendment to clause 2, which was the first amendment that appeared on the request for amendments under my name, as has been circulated in the chamber.

         The one I wanted to move was the second amendment on that sheet, which would introduce a concession to the parental assets test. It is in the terms that we debated in some detail in the chamber last night—incidentally, because we were dealing with another matter. This was an alternative to that other matter, and it is to provide some respite to families where they have obtained a health care card as a result of low income. We propose that, if they obtain such a card because of low income, they should not have to also meet an assets test in order to obtain Austudy for their children.

         Basically, it is to provide some further benefit for those who have suffered as a result of the drought—which was the subject of much debate in here last night—or for other reasons; it could be in the country or in the towns. Certainly, in the case of the country, it could be not only primary producers, which the Democrats were seeking to benefit last night, but also those in towns. If they find that their income has fallen below the threshold but yet their asset base has remained reasonably high—although they are not often in a position where they can get any material benefit from that reasonably high assets base—we say that their children should not be disadvantaged in education. That is basically the argument for the amendment we put.

         I remind you, Mr Chairman, that we have moved this amendment on previous occasions—in fact, successfully—and regrettably it has not been picked up by the government. I say `regrettably' because the government had, at an earlier stage, promised that it would meet this request. We are surprised that the government cannot see this concern of families who have been suffering from the plight of low income but nevertheless failing to obtain Austudy because of a reasonably high assets base.

         —I indicate to the chamber that the Australian Democrats will be supporting this second-best amendment. I draw the chamber's attention to the debate when we had before us both this amendment and the amendment that was defeated last night by the combined vote of the government and the opposition. The Democrats indicated then that the best option would have been to have supported both amendments because they do not cover the same group of people, as the opposition has now learned. Those amendments cover two different groups of people, and we would have had the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, the opposition could not see its way clear to supporting our amendment. I am disappointed about that.

The rural community, primary industry and their families owe a great deal of thanks to you, Senator Hill, for running with this amendment. As for it being a second-best amendment, there is a lot to be said for both amendments. The amendment that we have moved does not distinguish between farm families and small business that are affected by the drought. People out there are all in the same boat, or the same town, together. If primary industry and the farmers are doing it tough, that will be reflected on the business community that are also suffering.

         I have said in this chamber on a number of occasions that every child in Australia deserves the right to participate in education. Many children in rural Australia at the moment are being tricked out of a tertiary education because the assets of their parents are worth over $750,000. Many primary industry properties—properties, farms, grazing properties—have assets worth over $750,000 but have not had an income for the last four or five years.

         That has been picked up, and I concede that has been picked up, in the drought relief package that has been released and has benefited most Queenslanders, many farmers from New South Wales, although not all, very few from Victoria but none from South Australia. There are a huge number of people there who literally cannot afford to send their children to school or to tertiary education. Either amendment—the Woodley amendment or the Hill amendment—will be able to facilitate an education for the sons and daughters of Australian farmers. So we are really splitting hairs over the issue.

They have been grateful and, in a lot of cases, they have said that it will do the job. In most cases they say, `We are very grateful that we will be able to get that.

On four occasions the minister has allowed papers and documentation—they may not have been from the minister and they may not have been in the budget papers, but DEET is a government department and the minister is responsible for his department—to go out that have built up expectations amongst country children that they could access tertiary education if their parents' income was under $20,000 only to have it cruelly snatched away two or three months later.

The majority of health care card recipients are already assets tested. The health care card is also, though, issued to some low income earners who do not need to meet an assets test. That is a relatively small group, and it is, in particular, to make sure that people who have a low income are assisted for the purposes of the benefits of the health care card. They are a much smaller group than the health care card assets tested recipients, but not so small as to mean that if this amendment passes there will not be a cost to government.

It is true that some of the people who are eligible for a health care card as low income people are those who have actually arranged their finances and so on to be asset rich and income poor. So the concern is to make sure that, while they are assisted as low income people for the benefits of a health care card, they are not also further benefited under this legislation for Austudy.

My making the comments on both schedules together will save some time. My brief comments relate to schedules 3 and 4 as they both relate to the way in which the department will treat compensation payments received by youth training allowance recipients.

         At the moment, for ease of administration the department assumes that where any loss of income component can be identified in a compensation payment, 50 per cent of that payment has been made for loss of income. The department then divides this amount by average weekly earnings to calculate the number of weeks a person is precluded from their payment. I have said before in this place that I do not fully support the use of this 50 per cent rule. The impact of this rule on a person who only receives 25 per cent of his or her compensation payment for economic loss, and the rest to cover medical expenses, must be devastating.

         While the Democrats recognise the problem of payment construction—that is, artificial construction—designed to disguise the true nature of a compensation payment, our position has always been that we could not support proposals to address this problem which would disadvantage many compensation recipients.

         We believe that the amendments before us today will adversely affect compensation recipients and, as such, we will not be supporting them. The Democrats are also opposed to the amendments which will apply the compensation provisions to payment claimants as well as recipients. For these reasons, the Democrats will be opposing schedules 3 and 4.

         —We have been asked to accept that two or more lump sum payments be treated as one sum. Welfare rights groups argue that the payments should not be looked on as economic payments but as payments to help the person involved adjust—such as in modifying their home, et cetera. The government, however, sees a percentage of the payment as income and as a possibility of saving them money on pensions.

         The government's position I do not believe is supportable for two reasons. Firstly, they have not provided us with figures to show how many cases or how much money is involved. Secondly, properly trained staff could pick out the odd questionable case where compensation is really for income and not for pain and suffering. So it seems as though we are looking for a way of further adjusting the bottom line for people who are on the lowest levels of income, and those who are requiring compensation for proper reasons will be the ones who will be affected.

         —The set of amendments moved by Senator Woodley proposes to delete various provisions that have recently been considered by the Senate. Identical provisions to these were contained in the social security legislation which was debated just a couple of weeks ago. They were amendments made to the provisions of the Social Security Act dealing with the jobsearch allowance. As the youth training allowance and the jobsearch allowance are closely aligned, it is important that any changes to jobsearch allowance be mirrored in the youth training allowance provisions of this Act.

         Some amendments to the jobsearch allowance scheme contained in the social security legislation were rejected by this chamber. In recognition of this, the government is proposing amendments to this bill removing from it those elements of the jobsearch provision not passed by the Senate. In other words, when we come to government amendments, we will be moving to make sure that the two are in sync. For the reasons put during the previous debate, the government is not supporting any of Senator Woodley's proposed amendments.

         —The Democrats will be opposing part 3 of schedule 13. This part provides that the training supplement which assists with expenses incurred in undertaking training will be paid only if the person has individual approval to undertake an approved training course. In other words, the course must be an approved one and, to be eligible for the training supplement, the person must obtain approval to undertake that course. As I said in a previous debate, around 50 per cent of successful jobsearch is undertaken independent of the CES. As such, the Democrats believe we should be rewarding people's initiative rather than enforcing dependence on the CES. For that reason, the Democrats will be opposing part 3 of schedule 13.

If DEET requires a person at a place other than DEET, DSS or CES, they can require them to go or they will get cut off. Is this also applicable to JSA or newstart clients or are you singling out young people for this particular treatment?

         It brings into issue the outcome of the barney we seem to have seen between DEET and DSS, the ministers, which resulted in DEET winning the fight to take case management off DSS. The silly thing is that DSS still has to administer case management through DEET legislation. This seems to be a total waste of resources in having to legislate twice for everything in DEET and DSS acts. It looks like you are creating an administrative nightmare and perhaps one that does not seem to look after the best interest of the welfare. One would think that is what people are looking at: the welfare of the people involved.

         —Today we are debating the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2), which proposes a range of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. These proposals are largely non-controversial. Mr Acting Deputy President Herron, it is apt that you are in the chair because the main purpose of this bill is to remove customs duty from all imports of tobacco leaf, unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco products. At present, excise is payable on locally manufactured tobacco products and it is based on the weight of the product. There is another bill coming forward which will result in excise duty being applied to manufactured tobacco products from overseas.

         The Industry Commission report No. 39, which reported into the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries, advised that the tobacco products industry existed in an artificial environment created by the protectionist measures of the tobacco industry stabilisation program and the local leaf content scheme. These economic buffer instruments have distorted the industry by insulating it from the dynamics of international tobacco trade.

         To be fair, one has to cast one's mind back 20 or 30 years when there was a very good reason for the implementation of these schemes. In those days, tobacco smoking was not on the nose—if you can excuse the pun. In fact, 20 or 30 years ago it was considered to be a very socially acceptable habit. As a result of that, there was concern among governments of the day about the increase in the volume of imports of manufactured tobacco products. The government then moved to encourage growers to develop tobacco plants in Australia so that our balance of payments would not be adversely affected with the passage of time. However, times do change.

         The Industry Commission report prompted a government response. On 13 November 1994, the government announced a tobacco industry restructuring package. The package was generally accepted by the tobacco industry. There were some complaints from pockets within the industry, but it was generally accepted—certainly in my own state of Queensland and also by the cigarette manufacturers. It constituted a deal between the industry, the state governments and the manufacturers, as I mentioned. Out of this negotiation, the cigarette manufacturers are to make a contribution of $10.8 million to the tobacco growing industry. Each of the tobacco growing states—Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales—is contributing $5.8 million, $850,000 and $3 million respectively to restructure the industry. This contribution will match the assistance of the cigarette manufacturers.

         The Australian cigarette manufacturers will establish long-term contracts commercially negotiated between themselves and the individual local growers. The Commonwealth and the three tobacco producing states will not oppose any new or additional taxes on tobacco products. The Commonwealth will introduce an ad valorem 25 per cent tariff to be phased out in accordance with the World Trade Organisation agreement on all imports of tobacco leaf to establish a suitable adjustment period for growers of tobacco to evolve into the open international market. The quid pro quo for these contributions would be the removal of the protectionist instruments mentioned earlier, thus exposing the growers to international competition.

         The second measure is a response to a recent AAT decision that determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from 81 per cent to 94 per cent were wholly of viscose. This had the effect of reducing the intended industry assistance rate from 27 per cent to nil. These amendments redefine the description of certain subheadings by replacing the word `wholly' with `of 100 per cent'.

         Industry Commission report No. 34 of 1994 provided an opportunity for the Senate to look at and speak about the elimination of subsidies and protection to the Australian tobacco industry. The Greens did not oppose the elimination of support for the tobacco industry, but we were concerned about the Industry Commission's schemes to cut duties on the import of manufactured tobacco and to change the tariff from one based on weight to one based on ad valorem. The reasons for our objection were the same as those from health groups—that it could result in real reduction in tobacco prices and create a major potential difference between expensive and cheap cigarettes, while the weight-based system tends to reduce the difference.

         This bill cuts the tariff on unmanufactured tobacco only. This is unlikely to affect the cost of tobacco products. Unmanufactured tobacco is a minor economic input to cigarettes. The excise will continue to apply and, between the excise and the other inputs to manufactured tobacco products, the price is likely to be unchanged. Even so, the elimination of the duties will have the effect of reducing government revenue by an expected $4 million.

         Although we are no friends of GATT, we do not mind seeing the demise of the Australian tobacco industry. Tobacco production is pesticide intensive, damaging the water table and river systems. There are better things for Australian farmers to produce than recreational drugs that damage people's health without even creating the illusion of well-being. I understand that there are already adjustment programs in place for producers. We believe that the whole issue of bringing into the country tobacco from other countries will have unforeseen consequences. It is for that reason that we want to express at this point our grave reservations about the tobacco industry and, even in the face of this bill going through, what impact that is likely to have.

         —in reply—Senator Chamarette provoked me in a similar way. This is part of a package of agreed measures with the industry, which has seen the phase-out of a number of mechanisms that have been traditionally attached to the industry, including the stabilisation plan and a local relief content scheme. There are a number of quid pro quos in this package. Manufacturers are providing funding of $10.8 million for industry restructuring. The Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee is being wound up and its assets are being transferred to the Tobacco Research and Development Council, which is in the process of being established. Also $1.5 million of Commonwealth money is being allocated from the Commonwealth rural adjustment scheme in order to assist regional development strategies, not only for North Queensland, as Senator O'Chee has pointed out, but also for the Victorian tobacco industry, which is a very major industry.

         Having said that, my office has indicated to the government, the Greens and the Democrats that we propose one simple amendment—although I suppose nothing is simple in relation to this bill. But what the amendment seeks to achieve is simple. We agree that lessening the load on those companies that would now be classified as small is a worthwhile experiment—perhaps it can be called an experiment. A reduction of the burden on small business must be welcomed, and an opportunity to put that to the test is being presented by this legislation. This notion underpins the government's small/large distinction, which is that large companies should have a greater burden than small companies.

         The government proposes some differentiation across those companies that would be classified as large, with one exception. That is, the government is now saying that those companies which were in existence in 1994 and which chose to have an auditor—remembering of course that those companies had a choice to either have an auditor or file key financial data—will be allowed to continue to have an auditor, provided they meet the other requirements of an exempt proprietary company, and they will not have to file financial statements. In other words, they can be quarantined with the choice that they made at the time to have an auditor. All those companies which did not make that choice and which chose only to file key financial data, as well as any subsequent companies that fall into the large basket, would have to have not only an auditor but also higher reporting requirements—that is, they would have to file financial statements.

         It is not true to say that the government's proposal completely streamlines reporting for those companies that would be classified as large. It does not. It sets aside those companies which made what the government perceives to be the appropriate choice and appointed an auditor. For a number of reasons which the government might care to elaborate on, it believes that they can stay as they are and they will not have this higher filing of financial statements. So there is that differentiation within the government's proposal to deal with large, exempt proprietary companies.

But the higher requirement should be the requirement that existed before—to either have an auditor or file key financial data. That would simplify the reporting process such that we could say that all current exempt proprietary companies and those that fell into that category would have the same reporting requirements. We would not need this quarantining and grandfathering of those companies which chose to have an auditor prior to 1994.

One could go back into the dark history of the 1980s and point to numerous occasions where auditors were in place and there was no saving against any bad faith or malfeasance on behalf of directors and there was no saving against management's stupidity vis-a-vis investments. Many auditors are now looking down the barrel of being sued because it has not turned out to be as effective as so many people hoped it would be.

On that basis we say, `Why don't we stick with the existing arrangement and allow those companies that are prudent—' in my view `—vis-a-vis their own assets to choose?' Certainly, if I had $10 million in turnover going through a company in which I had a shareholding, I would want an auditor if only to make sure that the management who come in and perhaps have no interest are not creaming off some of that money. That is the choice I would make, but other people would make a different choice. That is a matter we have left to them in the past. We do not believe the case has been made for changing it.

It would be simpler to say, `You can stay as you are. You will have, therefore, a higher reporting requirement than the small companies, because you will have to either have an auditor or file key financial data.

In other words, they do not disagree with wanting the process of simplification to continue, but they simply point out that, just because you call it a simplification law, it does not follow that everything underneath it is. You have to watch what the substance of something is, and the substance of this increases the obligation and makes it more difficult for those companies to operate.

         We believe the strengthening of the exempting discretion of the ASC, the Australian Securities Commission, does cater for situations where the criteria might operate to place an additional load on a particular company. The Australian Democrats believe that experience, particularly following the 1980s—and Senator Vanstone mentioned the experience we had, a lot of which was very unpleasant indeed—should lead us to request higher standards of accountability.

         At the additional hearings of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which the Democrats supported should take place—and which did take place—it was led in evidence that, obviously, the auditing of company accounts is also a management tool. It is not just an accountability tool and it is not just a load on the company that is carrying out the auditing; it is a management tool which is very often beneficial to the company. On the matter of cost, it was clearly stated that the figures that were led in evidence, which were quite extraordinary, are by and large overstated and that an average of $12,000 is closer to the mark.

         The Democrats believe that the strengthening of the discretion that is the Australian Securities Commission's prerogative by putting in a number of additional criteria and by virtually saying to the commission, `Please be diligent and active in using this discretion' does satisfy the concerns that have been expressed. So the Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill as it now stands and the government's amendments, but will be opposing the Liberal amendment.

In respect of the opposition's amendment, I have to say that the particular area that Senator Vanstone wants to cover is one that has been subject to extensive consultations. The consultations revealed some general acceptance of the proposition that large proprietary companies be required to lodge audited accounts.

If we have learned anything from the 1980s it is that it is important to take note of one lesson, and that is to ensure high standards of accountability in corporate Australia.

If you recall, we had some fairly substantial debates in this chamber about the levels of accountability for government business enterprises.

This is taxpayers' money that is being used in a corporation. We are the shareholders. Members of the public are the shareholders. The government has consistently used commercial-in-confidence as the reason why those audits cannot take place, unless the minister calls for them.

I think Senator Margetts wants to know—Senator Margetts, I would appreciate it if you would listen to this because the point I am trying to make is directed at you—what confidentiality do businesses have if they are required to put an audit report into the Australian Securities Commission. The answer to Senator Margetts is absolutely none.

         If this bill goes through private companies, that are owned by members of their families, will have to disclose every asset, all their auditing figures, all their payroll—everything will have to be disclosed. What you are going to be asked to do—and I appreciate the Greens' stand on small business has always been consistent—is ask small business; that is, every person who runs a small business in Western Australia that has 50 employees or $5 million in assets or $10 million in turnover, to disclose every facet of their business for audit.

         There would be significant numbers of small businesses out there. Let me tell you who they will be—just about every motor vehicle or tractor trader or machinery dealer in every town in Western Australia, and there are many small businesses in the hotel trade or the tourism trade. Roughly, off the top of my head, there would be about 4,000 or 5,000 small businesses in Western Australia. You will be asking them to put an audit down disclosing every facet of their business. That audit will go into the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Securities Commission will make that audit public and anyone can access that—their competitor, big business.

I think that is totally unfair, totally unreasonable. Everything that will be detailed will be detailed at the Australian Securities Commission.

If we go along with the government, you are going to ask them to pay an additional $25,000 to $30,000 for an audit when they are already getting their tax done.

        This is a very prompt report, and I congratulate the Australian Sports Drug Agency for the speed with which it has reported to the Senate. Also, I commend the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and his office for not holding this report up for the inordinate amount of time that so many ministers seem to hold up their reports. This report was signed on 12 September by my cousin and former colleague, Professor Peter Baume, as Chairperson of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, and here we are, still in September, actually dealing with it. I commend everyone involved. I feel I should do that in view of the times I have criticised the late presentation of these reports. We are going to be inundated with these reports as the year progresses, so it is good to see that some people are prepared to assist the Senate and present these speedily.

         The interesting thing about the Australian Sports Drug Agency is the outstanding lead it is giving in the fight against drugs in sport. In the latest financial year, the agency conducted 3,108 tests, which is up on the 2,002 in the previous year, and it covered 49 sports. There were 819 tests for professional sport leagues, particularly the New South Wales Rugby League, the Australian Football League, the National Basketball League, the National Soccer League and the Queensland Rugby League. This was a considerable increase from the 667 tests of the previous year. In other words, these major professional sports are increasingly using, mainly on a user-pays basis, the services of the Australian Sports Drug Agency.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The agency recorded 25 positive test results, which represented about 1.09 per cent of all tests. This was a lower percentage and a lower number than the previous year, even though more tests were made. In the previous year there were 33 positive tests, which represented 1.18 per cent of all tests.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Sporting organisations established that 10 of the 25 positive test results were due to the inadvertent or legitimate therapeutic use of banned substances, and the overall instance of positive drug tests for the use of prohibited substances, such as anabolic steroids and diuretics, was 0.26 per cent, compared to 0.57 per cent in the previous year. In other words, it has been halved. That is an outstandingly good result, and I commend everyone involved for the fact that there has been a halving of the overall incidence of positive drug tests for the use of prohibited substances.

         However, almost double the number of competitors refused to comply with the request to provide a sample, and that is a trend that is in the opposite direction and is most unfortunate. Nine competitors failed to do so compared to five in 1993-94, and I hope that severe action is taken against those who fail to provide such tests.

         In fact, in a very interesting table at the back of the report at page 102, there is shown to be an enormous number of situations where the penalty for failing to comply with a drug test has not yet been advised to the Australian Sports Drug Agency by the sport involved. While I commend power-lifting and weight-lifting for some severe penalties they have imposed on those people who have been found to have had adverse tests—for example, in power-lifting, I think there were six altogether—the fact is that a failure to advise what has happened is not sending the right message. The message that has to be given is that severe action is taken against those who fail to provide a sample.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I also mention that there are quite significant differences in the sorts of penalties between sports. For example, the sport that I am closest to and that I have the most knowledge of, I guess, is soccer football, and I am interested to note that a failure to comply only involved a 12-month suspension; whereas in power-lifting, a failure to comply brought about a three-year suspension. It may well have been a repeat offence, but there is clearly a need, it seems to me, for greater similarity between sports in the severity of penalties involving these offences. I hope these sports do speak to each other about this sort of thing. Also, there should be greater advice quicker. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Forty-four Sino-Vietnamese people were returned to Haikou in China by aircraft this morning out of Port Hedland, which represents the sixth movement of these people who illegally entered the country last year.

         It shows to the Senate—and, indeed, to the people of Australia—that the memorandum of understanding that was entered into between the Australian government and the government of the People's Republic of China is working. Under the terms of that memorandum of understanding, there have now been 369 people returned to their adopted homeland, because they have previously been granted refugee status in China.

         That represents a very significant saving to the Australian taxpayer. It costs some $55 per day, per person to maintain a person at the Port Hedland detention centre. Now that 369 people have been returned, that is saving the taxpayers of Australia some $20,000 per day that they were previously paying for each and every one of those 369 people who illegally came into this country and who illegally sought to abuse the compassion that Australia has for those who are in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves.

         I do not know why this article has appeared now because the decision about this appeal was announced some weeks ago.

         The Legal Aid Commission of WA is the legal body which has taken up this appeal on behalf of 118—I think it is that many; it certainly is over 100—Sino-Vietnamese people who arrived here on the albatross boat. They are expending great amounts of taxpayers' money on this through a commission which, on its own word of mouth, is strapped for cash and in the last financial year has had to reject some 5,550 applications for legal assistance. We now have an inquiry going into the Legal Aid Commission to see where the money could be better spent than it has perhaps been in the past.

         It is interesting that an appeal is going to be lodged. If one reads the decision of Mr Justice O'Loughlin, who delivered the decision on 27 July, one would find it unbelievable that an appeal could be launched against such a decision. These people asserted that, prior to the declaration by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) on 30 December last year that they were not going to apply for refugee status, they had in fact claimed refugee status. When they were questioned in court, they did not even know the Chinese words for `asylum' or `refugee'. For that and a whole number of other reasons Mr Justice O'Loughlin tossed out their application.

         In the brief time available I also want to make some reference to a couple of other groups of illegal boat people who have arrived in this country and remained in detention, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer and of course at great cost to themselves. Mr Justice Sundberg, in the Federal Court on Thursday, 31 August 1995, rejected the claims by four Cambodian boat people that the minister's delegate had made an error in law in not granting them refugee status.

         The reason I mention this case is that last week in Perth there was a demonstration outside the state office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to say that this decision is wrong and that the minister should grant those people humanitarian status in Australia. I have read Mr Justice Sundberg's statement. I again find amazing these people who, in breach of orders, claim and take advantage of us all the way through. They get fed, kept and looked after from go to woe and then go into our courts and make exaggerated claims like they could be disadvantaged, if they are returned to Cambodia, because of their religion.

         They had two claims before the Federal Court of Australia; they pulled the claims out of the Federal Court of Australia. They are still in detention in Australia. They have not sought to take advantage of the concessions that the minister arranged in 1993—that, if they were returned to their homeland of Cambodia and stayed there for a year, they could make application for permanent residency in Australia. Many Cambodians have done so. Many have taken up that option and are now settled in Australia, rearing their families and living in good health and good conditions. These particular individuals chose not to do that. Now they are about to be deported because they have exhausted all the time and opportunities for appeals against the decision.

This, the UN Decade of Indigenous Peoples has witnessed four of the six years of civil war and suffering on the North Solomon Island of Bougainville but the world has paid little attention. The situation is a complex one and is often further obscured by the dangerously simplistic nature of the debate at times, e.g. in the Australian and Papua New Guinean press and elsewhere. This is due to the communication's blockade on Bougainville which has created an information vacuum.

I express my appreciation for her dedication and diligence in trying to draw together the information that will be of value to all organisations involved in pursuing human rights. Her work seeks to begin a process which will allow further information to be gathered and to address the communication blockade referred to in the Pax Christi quote. I have asked Marilyn Havini to make a short statement as to why she came to publish this book. I seek leave to incorporate, in her own words, how she has come to do that.

        "The 1995 compilation of Human Rights Abuses in Bougainville (1989-1995) has been printed this year in response to numerous requests for copies of my initial hand typed document. I had prepared the document as initial preparation for the failed 1994 October 10th Peace Conference. Various Human Rights Organisations (including International Red Cross, Medicines Sans Frontiers, Amnesty International, International Commission of Jurists, UNPO, IWIGIA, Pax Christi and numerous Churches) have sought the material when they discovered that such a document was in existence.

        This detailed compilation of gross human rights violations has been assembled in a chronological format and contains reports of a horror that has not been seen in Bougainville, PNG since World War II.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In discussion with lawyers who were assisting the 1994 negotiated Peace Conference towards a political settlement, I expressed my concern for the necessity to address Justice and basic Human Rights issues. Having lived with the people in Bougainville for over 20 years, I knew that the politics that caused the war were born from Government (both PNG and the former Australian) refusal to address basic issues of Justice.

        In Bougainville, I lived through the 1989 invasions of both Australian trained PNG Riot Police and PNG Defence Forces on an all but defenceless civilian population. We experienced harassment and cried with others as their human rights were systematically denied in an attempt to cower them into submission. I watched helplessly as the children I taught in High School slipped away into the jungle to join a growing band of Bougainvilleans in forming a Revolutionary Army.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Now in Australia, I have been on the receiving end of information from inside Bougainville for five years. I have watched the inhumanity compounded, the suffering recounted as isolated incidents in the form of press releases that were too often ignored by the media.

        This listing of human rights abuses is as comprehensive as has been possible, although it is far from complete. It is an attempt to make a starting point for people to come to terms with what has really happened to them. Most of the material has not been available to the general public previously. I have included all violations that can be traced through date and contact source. My hope is that it will become known, not because it is sensational reading, but with the prayer that we will all work to stop the continued violations and murder.

        I plan to issue updates to this document on a regular basis so that the most accurate and detailed account of the human suffering on Bougainville is available for examination. I would be grateful for any additional information, corrections and counter claims for future publication.

         Perhaps the latest example of this is a situation involving the respected Dr Vince FitzGerald, a former high-ranking bureaucrat from Treasury and now a consultant in the private sector. All honourable senators would know that Dr FitzGerald has taken a public role in highlighting the lack of savings in Australia. This attack on Dr FitzGerald is not an isolated incident. The sort of intimidation that increasingly we are seeing on prominent Australians who take a position contrary to that of the government is indeed a worry to all those Australians who are in favour of open, frank and free speech in this country.

I think it is testimony to his character and his reputation that, despite that, Dr FitzGerald has hit back and firmly restated his position.

         The point at issue is whether the high level of Australian debt impacts on interest rates in this country. It may be true that in the 18 most recent interest rates decisions of the Reserve Bank the level of indebtedness may not have been a factor. But allow me to use an analogy. Essentially, Australia is cruising along in a car in overdrive. The problem is that as soon as we get to a hill, we may not have sufficient lower gears to get us up or over the hill. That is the issue.

         In recent years there has not been a lot of pressure from international interest rate movements because international interest rates have been relatively benign. While they are benign, it is true that monetary conditions, et cetera, perhaps and certainly do play a more significant role in determining the level of interest rates in Australia. The problem is that when the situation changes—it will never continue perhaps as it is now, because we do have our ups and downs—the risk factor is certainly increased. That is important. We are increasingly putting Australia more at risk. While it may be true that today that risk factor may not be overly significant, when things start to stall a little bit that risk factor becomes a lot higher.

         You only have to consider your own personal situation. If you overborrow and property values drop, you are going to be very vulnerable. On the other hand, those who have a lower level of gearing, less borrowings and a lower level of risk can ride out any potential storm.

         Essentially, we are in a situation where Australia has very large international indebtedness. When the Labor Party came to office, it was a mere $34 billion. It is now in excess of $150 billion. The risk factor is climbing. Should international rates change and rise, Australia is going to be in the first line of risk.

         The other issue is: why has it been necessary for Australia to have such a high level of indebtedness? This must come back to the policies pursued by Labor governments, because they have created conditions under which it was not affordable for so many Australians to borrow in Australia, so they went overseas and ran the risk of adverse exchange movements.

         For those who travel overseas the deteriorating exchange rates between Australia and other countries—for example, Singapore—are a worry. Regrettably, Australian affordability is slipping, and our relative purchasing ability is declining when compared with that of a number of years ago. The sorts of countries to which we must travel in terms of affordability for limited resources are perhaps the lesser performing countries or those which are emerging from the Eastern bloc. It is a sad scenario.

         If we examine Australia's savings level—it is around 17 per cent of gross domestic product—it is an abysmally low figure. Not so long ago it dropped to about 16 per cent. That is the lowest Australia has had since the two world wars and the Great Depression—and we certainly do not want that repeated. But if we look at comparable countries, Singapore, for example, which in 35 years has performed an economic miracle, Singapore now has a savings rate of 48 per cent to gross domestic product—a far cry from our figure.

         Madam Deputy President, the real issue I wish to emphasise and leave with you tonight is in two parts: firstly, that the risk premium on foreign debt is priced into the whole structure of interest rates, which cannot be denied; secondly, and also not to be denied, is that that risk factor is increasing. Therefore, should there be a change in the terms of trade or the value of the exchange rate et cetera, increasingly Australians will be in trouble from the perspective of uncontrolled increases in interest rates.

         What was interesting from Bernie Fraser's remarks, although not so widely reported, was `that everything is really linked up with everything else'. In that sentence there is a connection between foreign debt and interest rates. I suppose that is where the head of the Reserve Bank used his escape clause. So I leave you with the comment: it is not what Bernie Fraser said but what he did not say which is the thrust of my contribution and those omissions must be a real worry to the people of Australia.

        (i) Defence does not keep records in a form that enables the question to be answered with accuracy. This is because the data is based on the place of payment rather than the state to which the payment is being directed. The expenditure data can also be distorted as some payments are made to contractors' head office which can be located in states and territories removed from where the contract work is being performed.

        (ii) Certain other elements of Defence expenditure, including some capital equipment payments, are handled centrally. As a consequence, the expenditure profiles for some states and territories are distorted. For example, certain payments associated with the New Submarine, JORN and the Geraldton communications facility are paid in the ACT.

        (iii) Expenditure on Service salaries can also be unreliable as portion of the payments are made to banks in the state branch where the member's account is domiciled rather than the state where the member is posted. Additionally, banks do not recognise the ACT and the Northern Territory as head offices (in Defence's accounting system these payments are recorded against New South Wales and South Australia respectively).
