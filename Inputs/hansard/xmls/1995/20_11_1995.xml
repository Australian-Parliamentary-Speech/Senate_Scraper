         —I welcome back Senator Evans, visiting Australia, and ask him in his capacity as the Minister representing the Prime Minister, to the background of the industrial turmoil experienced by the Australian community of recent times under Labor's law and practice and the national coalminers strike which is continuing today: why hasn't the Prime Minister condemned this industrial thuggery of union bosses which is hurting the interests of all Australians well beyond the parties to the dispute? Does the Prime Minister have no influence with Labor's Accord partners, the ACTU leadership, or does he just prefer to abdicate his responsibility in favour of his predecessor, Mr Hawke? Doesn't real national leadership demand more than a few phone calls on the way to the airport?

         His involvement, as I understand it, began last Tuesday when he talked to the unions concerned about the basic position they had taken and his concerns about the way in which they were seeking to escalate what was an obviously legitimate ground of industrial difference into a matter of much larger national significance. As a result of that, he later talked to the chief executive officer of CRA, on Wednesday of last week, and that led to conversations for the first time for some considerable time between the ACTU secretary and Mr Davis, all of which was important in creating the circumstances for what subsequently happened.

         As a result of those discussions, negotiations were entered into between Tim Pallas, the assistant secretary of the ACTU, and the CEO of Comalco, Mr Terry Palmer. Together they drew up a basis for settlement for further negotiations between CRA, including Comalco, and the ACTU. Included in that basis for settlement, which was reached on Wednesday night following the involvement of the Prime Minister, were agreements on essential principles: agreement by the company to drop litigation against individuals on strike in Weipa; agreement by the company on the principle of not discriminating against workers who choose to bargain collectively; agreement by the company to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value; and from the CEO of Comalco, in the context of assuring the Prime Minister that `We will sort out the details tomorrow'—which was the way he put it—agreement to report to the commission by 2 o'clock the following day. Faxing this agreement to the Prime Minister on Wednesday night, the ACTU assistant secretary said that the ACTU was confident this constituted an agreement.

         That is where it was on Wednesday night following the intervention of the Prime Minister. For the Prime Minister to express on that basis the optimism that he did last week is perfectly understandable. The point is that the Prime Minister kick-started a process which has now followed through into negotiation between CRA and the ACTU and, more importantly than anything else, it has resulted in the matter now being dealt where it belongs—that is, in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

         The chief executive officer of CRA said on Thursday that he `welcomed the intervention of the Prime Minister in seeking a solution to the unnecessary widening of industrial action related to Comalco's operations'. CRA added—this is on Thursday—that it was willing to respond immediately to the PM's suggestion that it should enter into discussions with the ACTU; it was willing immediately to start proceedings in the AIRC to address the disparities which had arisen between award conditions at Weipa and those applying to people on staff contracts.

There was a compulsory conference on Saturday. It was foreshadowed that, if that compulsory conference failed to fully resolve the issues, it would be dealt with by way of arbitration commencing today, and that is the basis on which the matter has proceeded.

         Mr Hawke's involvement has been limited to being involved as an advocate for the ACTU on the particular question of equal pay for equal work—the substantive issue which is now before the commission and being addressed right now. In fact, I think Mr Hawke, in his address to the commission, started in 1891; he is probably up to about 1920 by now, and I am sure it will be a very helpful contribution. But to talk in terms of Mr Hawke or anyone else other than the Prime Minister being involved in actually bringing this matter to a resolution is to completely misunderstand and to wilfully misunderstand the course of events.

The NFF says this will be a major boost to all rural communities and will provide all states and regions across Australia with much needed additional export income. Mr McGauchie says that we must turn the Osaka agreement into tangible trade reform and ensure that all sectors, including agriculture, and all measures, including tariffs, non-tariff barriers and export subsidies, are gradually phased out.

         The agreement by leaders in Osaka over the weekend is another milestone in the development of APEC. The action agenda provides for comprehensive coverage without exceptions. The commitment to the 2010-2020 end dates has been reaffirmed, with flexibility within this process to determine the pace of liberalisation for sensitive sectors. The agenda covers all tariff and non-tariff barriers as well as export subsidies and trade facilitation measures. Countries will now prepare individual action plans for submission in 1996. This is without doubt a major outcome for Australia and, in particular, its primary producers.

The Prime Minister and Mr Brereton have both made it plain that the Industrial Relations Reform Act will not be amended as requested by the ACTU. Why, in these circumstances, is Mr Willis still suggesting that `the government will be out there changing the law' to facilitate collective contracts? Does this indicate that the government is intending to cave in to ACTU blackmail? You have just acknowledged that at all times CRA has been acting in accordance with the law, and presumably you also agree that the striking workers are doing so in defiance of the IRC. Do you now acknowledge that workers do have the right to remain in the union under the law and under the CRA staff salary arrangements? In those circumstances, how can it possibly be said, as you just said a minute ago, that CRA has acted against the spirit of the legislation? When is Mr Keating going to show some national leadership and stand up for the interests of all Australians—not just trade union bosses, but particularly those who wish to freely enter into workplace agreements which they clearly regard as being in their own best interests?

But the net result of that process will be, if it is followed through to fruition—and CRA has undoubtedly hoped this would be the case—to create a situation where union members, one by one, drop off from their union membership and the union ceases to be, for all practical purposes, an effective voice in the enterprise bargaining for that particular company.

         It is for all these reasons that we have approached the issue, and the Prime Minister has approached the issue, in the way that we have. He has not been concerned to act stridently or in any posturing fashion. He has been concerned to work away behind the scenes to identify the true matters at stake, to dissuade the parties from taking unnecessary industrial action and at the same time to persuade the company concerned about the necessity of it playing a little bit more in accordance with the spirit of the rules, not just the strict black letter. Because it is only by playing in accordance with the spirit of the rules, as everyone has been doing to the great advantage of this country for the last decade, that we can continue to get the kind of productivity gains out of the work force and we can continue to get industrial harmony and stability maintained in the way that has done so much for the good of this country. That is the basis on which we have been approaching this matter this week. To approach it in the way that you would do if you were in office, with all the attitudes that you have to these issues and your absolute contempt for the underlying interests of the work force, would be to do no more than, as everyone knows, throw a lighted match into a petrol can.

         This book is an account of cultural change within Australia and within Australian families. While it documents fascinating differences in cultural and family values, it draws on similarities and consistencies—for example, the strong attachment to family, the importance of children, the expectations of strong family support and respect for age. It highlights very beautifully and very powerfully the fact that, although we are in a period of rapid change, the importance and consistency of the family are at the core of not only Australian society but in particular our multicultural Australian society.

         It is also very appropriate that this book, started in the International Year of the Family, should be launched in the International Year for Tolerance. What it highlights too is the amazing comment from Senator Minchin, who very recently called for a cut in migration. Senator Minchin said that he would like to see a reduction in the extraordinarily large—25 per cent—increase in this year's intake. An opposition that goes around saying that it believes in the family and at the same time calls for a 25 per cent cut in migration gives a very clear message that it does not understand either ethnic communities, migration or—

         They want child care, and quality child care, but another policy from the opposition is to bag quality child care. You have no sensitivity about the importance of family reunion. You do not care about the quality of child care, which is so critical to assisting these families in getting established. If you really want to know more about Australian families, you should read this book. It is a very splendid account of why Australia's government policies are right in this area. Families of all sorts and diversity in Australia are welcomed and supported by this government. Our policies are a clear indication of that, and they are completely opposite to yours.

         Of the issues they raise that are most concerning small business, the biggest issue is unemployment. In that same survey the No. 1 issue is unemployment. Yet we have the opposition flatly refusing to indicate whether they support our training programs under Working Nation. We have on the record from the shadow Treasurer, Mr Costello, in June of this year that he would cut back the Working Nation funding for the unemployed and for training, even though the business community supports it. These are all of the issues contained in this Yellow Pages survey.

         So we have the opposition raising the issue of whether I think the survey is credible. I said, `Yes, I think it is a credible survey.' I will not back away from that. What I find interesting is that the opposition will not indicate anywhere what its policies are for small business and, in particular, whether it will support amendments to the Trade Practices Act that give the chance for small business to protect itself against the economic power of big business. In the end, I suspect you are going to tap the mat on that and hope we put it through so that you do not have to answer to your mates in big business.

         Yes, the existence in the market of mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and lenders like the superannuation members home loans scheme are bringing that much needed competition to this market.

         Falling long-term mortgage rates and the unprecedented competition in the home loan market are indeed, as I have said, pushing down mortgage interest rates now. Since December 1994 the variable home loan rate charged by banks has been constant at 10.5 per cent, but the average interest rate being charged on the stock of loans outstanding has fallen from 10.01 per cent in December 1994 to 9.67 per cent in September 1995. The fall in the average interest rate reflects the increasing pressure on major banks from mortgage originators like Aussie Home Loans and lenders like the superannuation members home loans scheme.

         Mr President, for their part, the major banks are responding by trying to compete in the new loan market through such things as honeymoon loans. While projecting their margins on the large existing stock of mortgages by maintaining standard variable rates of 10.5 per cent, so-called honeymoon loans now account for over 20 per cent of the housing stock and are freely available at rates around 2.5 percentage points below the variable rate. The rate on honeymoon loans has come down from 8.4 per cent in May of this year to 7.9 per cent in September. I might just note that the Advance Bank has just announced a honeymoon rate of 7.75 per cent.

         Fixed rate loans account for around a quarter of all outstanding mortgages. The rate on a three-year fixed mortgage fell from 10.3 per cent in December last year to 9.6 per cent in September. At present, home buyers can get a three-year fixed rate mortgage at 9.25 per cent. In those circumstances, it is clear that this market is a more competitive market. There are gains for mortgagees seeking new mortgages to make the institutions compete between themselves and that is bringing the major banks under pressure. I certainly hope that that will mean that they too will enter more full-bloodedly into this competitive market.

         In general, the United States Olympic Committee is responsible for the implementation of the competition testing program for Olympic sports in the United States of America.

But the point is, as the Prime Minister was saying yesterday and throughout, indeed, the negotiations leading up to the final passage of the Osaka action agenda, there is going to be an absolutely phenomenal increase in the demand for agricultural produce in this region as a result of the economic growth within the region, the improving standards of living flowing from that growth, and all the other consequences that we can already begin to measure.

         That is, of course, the point about these APEC meetings: the real momentum for change has to come from within the domestic economies themselves. The best way of ensuring that that momentum occurs is for there to be top down driving of the process in each country, with the mutual support and reinforcement that flows from leaders having the sense that they are engaged in a common cause. That is what Mr Keating has added to the APEC process since he initiated this new series of leaders meetings in Seattle in 1993. That really will be where the real value, I think, is perceived in the longer term.

         The short point I am making though, in answer to Senator Coulter's question, is that there is going to be a phenomenal increase in demand for agricultural products from around the region. Somebody has to supply that demand, if it is to be met. We are very confident of our capacity to do so, and we want to be very much a part of that action. What will happen as a result of the reduction of trade barriers is that the some of the constraints to the more economically sensible sources of supply will be removed. That is the basis on which the Australian farmers are so confident about these outcomes.

         To talk about the greenhouse contribution that will flow from the bulk carriage of grains halfway around the world I think is to make a fairly trivial point by comparison with the nature of the benefits that can be expected to flow from that particular process.

         The reason why this government brought down a budget which was in surplus this year was to put downward pressure on interest rates in Australia. Every person who borrows money for home loans wants to see downward pressure on interest rates. One of the ways of doing that is to lift public savings. Lifting public savings means having a budget which is in surplus. That is what we brought down in May of this year.

        I think the tragedy of it is that when we have a peripatetic foreign minister who only occasionally visits Australia, he really loses touch with what is going on out there, particularly the issues that are of concern to ordinary Australians and, indeed, ordinary workers. It must be a long time since he had to deal with the trade union movement,  particularly with Mr Kelty. If he did, he would understand what has been happening in recent days. It is perfectly clear that what is going on is a power struggle. The trade union movement is not interested in the welfare of the workers; it is interested in the welfare of the trade union bosses.

If this wandering minstrel did take a good look at what was happening in Weipa, he would know that overwhelmingly the workers there are very satisfied with the staff salary arrangements which have been negotiated and that there is only a very small number who are holding out—presumably the dyed-in-the-wool unionists who are not particularly interested in negotiating higher levels of productivity and do not know what is in their best interests. Ninety per cent of them on the ground do. They are the ones who have been getting up to a $20,000 wage differential as a result.

         I will go to the very heart of what it was that Senator Evans thought assisted his case. He said that CRA was not acting in the spirit of the legislation because, as the editorial says, it may turn out to be a mistake that many employees appear to have decided that membership of the union no longer makes sense. Then it went on to say:

         He talks about the power struggle—that all the unions are interested in is the welfare of the union bosses. They do not want to take away the food drip that comes to their bosses. They take the membership subscription, and that is all they are interested in. As you go through Senator Alston's speech, you will see that he is dumping on the union movement. We are not going to get this dispute or any other dispute settled if the leadership of the Liberal Party are going to go to the public and consistently dump on and ridicule the union movement.

         Of course the union movement can be criticised for things that it does wrong, but there should not be, as has happened here, a blanket condemnation of what it does. To say of one section of this community that because they belong to a particular group they are wrong, that they are people who have nothing but hatred in their hearts—which belies the very thing that they allege they stand for—is not going to get us anywhere. The real trouble with this present struggle is that it has brought from the opposition an expression of opinion about union matters and industrial relations which is going to be very dangerous for both employer and employee if it is allowed to come into operation.

He agreed that the striking CRA workers of Comalco at Weipa should adhere to what the industrial relations commissioner tells them to do, bearing in mind that to date they have failed to carry out what the industrial commissioner had to say.

         The point is that it is a total lie. Everyone should know by now that you only need to be on a contract at Weipa for a month.

         The cry in this strike is equal pay for equal work. No-one decries that. But with a contract system, there is another ingredient to the formula that no-one over there has mentioned: equal responsibility. It is a question of equal pay for equal work and equal responsibility.

         Government senators can look quizzical, but they have to work out what those responsibilities are. When you look at equal pay for equal work, you have to work out whether the hours are the same. In the contract, they are not. They are knocking off when they have finished the job. If a job is not finished by a certain time and the company wants it finished, under the contract system you finish it. Then there is the question of whether there is strike or no strike—whether there is a contract or no contract, with those responsibilities. Also, the contracts are enforceable at law, both on the company and on the employee. As you see, the responsibilities of those under contract are far greater than under the collective system. Mind you, as I have already said, if you are on a contract, after only 30 days you can go back to collective bargaining, but there are not too many who go back.

         Why do companies have contracts like this? It is not to squash the unions. The unions have lost the faith of workers right around Australia. I doubt whether anybody on the government side has ever been in business and have had to employ people from their own pocket instead of from the government pocket. Anyone who has been in business will understand that a company wants to know that if they sign a contract with an overseas company they are going to be able to deliver, and not wonder whether or not their work force is working. With a contract system, they know whether they are going to be available to work and fill that contract. That is the basis of this argument and this government has failed badly on all points.

         The opposition had a very poor policy during the last federal election. I would have to say it was rejected resoundingly by the Australian electorate, particularly by working Australians.

         With regard to the attack that you continually launch against the trade union movement, you say that this is all about choice, and the contract workers have made a choice. That really denies the fact that over many, many years it has been union members and their funds that have won all the basic entitlements that all working Australians enjoy today. You can run the counter argument and say that every pay increase that union members achieve when they go to the arbitration commission and to courts should only go to workers who are members of unions. I am sure you would argue vehemently that that was discrimination. You would say that unions are seeking to line the pockets of their members. But that is not so in this case—you say it is okay for some workers who do exactly the same work, on the basis that they have agreed to a certain set of company conditions, to get paid significantly more than their colleagues who have chosen to want to bargain collectively for wage increases and other conditions. You say that is fine; that is their problem.

         I put it to you that that is a fairly unAustralian way of dealing with things. It is an unfair way of dealing with things. I think it is about time that we really looked at this issue in the context in which it should be looked at. From my own experience when I was secretary of the timber workers union, I have seen the documentation that North Broken Hill Peko presented to workers, saying they would get significant pay increases if they became non-union members, if they would sign individual contracts. Of course, Senator Panizza says, `Well, okay, after one month, if you don't like it, you can go back to collective bargaining'.

If you don't want the job under that contract, there is somebody else waiting for the job who will take the contract and we will employ those people who will take the contract, not those who wish to either become union members or who are union members and want to bargain collectively.' As I said, I think this whole debate is enlightening us. It is illuminating the opposition's position.

         Let us focus on the history of Weipa for a moment. One can imagine companies seeking a different form of industrial relations and a different relationship with their employees if they are at all times involved in industrial disputation matters that are difficult for them to handle in terms of management. If you look at Weipa, over many years industrial awards were negotiated and upgraded without any confrontation and without any dispute at all. It was really a backwater and a very quiet place for industrial relations.

         But, of course, the confrontation occurred because the company decided, as it had in other places, that it wanted to move towards the elimination of trade unions at the workplace.

        One is very disturbed to find that, increasingly, this government is taking the country down a number of blind alleys. One of those blind alleys is assuming that the future lies with increased trade, particularly increased trade in bulk exports from Australia. Specifically in the area of agricultural production, the assumption that lies behind the recently signed APEC agreement is that, firstly, we can produce the food—the $2.9 billion of additional food that Senator Collins talked about today—without further environmental deterioration.

Quite clearly they have recognised that.

         By the year 2020, Asia will be in need of a great deal more food consequent upon its population increase. So the question arises: can we produce the food? Will we be able to produce the food? Certainly by the year 2020 we will already have serious climate change.

We have to change very drastically the technology we use in that transport or we will not be able to transport that food without serious and further greenhouse consequences.

         Be assured that well before the year 2010 or the year 2020 governments, unlike the governments of today, will be addressing the greenhouse problem because there will already be serious consequences evident. The world will be taking a different perspective. Yet we go down this blind alley of assuming the future will be like the past only writ larger. We will produce more; we will have more environmental impacts. Somehow we can sustain that. We will use more fossil fuel, but somehow we will address the greenhouse problem.

         There is no evidence at present that the government is taking these problems seriously. The government should be starting its economic analysis, by not looking purely at economics but looking at the real world that scientists are describing in which there is serious, continuing and accelerating environmental deterioration. This is the beginning of a sane and sensible analysis of trade policy. This the government, together with other governments, is simply not doing.

That was not a serious answer to a very serious question. It is depressing that on such a serious matter the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) chose to answer in that way.

         On that occasion the government's response was very much similar to today's. There was an assumption that there were so many benefits absolutely assured, from our jumping with two feet, and I believe quite naively, into the way we negotiated the Uruguay Round of GATT, that there was absolutely no reason to put any of this in jeopardy by checking.

         The irony is that they did not check on the Uruguay Round of GATT. What is more, they did not even check on the economic benefits, so much so that more than a year down the track since it was negotiated and signed we are over a billion dollars a month on average down the tube even in terms of our trade. The economic benefits that were so confidently predicted were $5 billion once we got past five years; $5 billion benefits.

         We have not even got that far and we are already $10 million down the tube at least. It seems to me we are doing everybody a disservice unless we look at the actual impacts. The very least the Australian government could be doing is actually arguing in Australia's best interest, instead of arguing naively that, if Australia leads the charge in free trade, bulk trade and commodity trade at all costs, then we will benefit.

        The proposed changes to the Childcare Assistance Scheme are discriminatory to the very families it was intended to assist. If one partner in a relationship becomes unemployed, the family must now suffer loss of household income and pay FULL Childcare fees. This situation will occur because with one full time income in a household, social security benefits are not applicable to the unemployed person (and therefore not fee relief either). This will greatly inhibit the finding of new employment as without childcare, interviews, retraining or acceptance of temporary positions is not possible. The changes make provision for full time workers/students but many parents are in part-time work and/or part-time study. People will have to choose between these activities and do one or the other full time. Full time work leaves little time to study and full time study reduces the household income too far. The 12 hour limit leaves single parent families and those who have disabilities with only one day per week. This is not sufficient social interaction for most children. It also ignores parents who may have other ill children (requiring their parents full time care) in the home.

The purpose of the cut-off motion is being undermined by the constant exemption of bills. This particular motion being proposed for formality provides a whole raft of bills with exemption from the cut-off, the purpose of which is to provide proper parliamentary and community scrutiny of legislation.

         The purpose of the Guidelines, which were published in 1988 by the NHMRC, is to recommend procedures for the safe packaging, labelling, storage, transport and disposal of such wastes. They are intended to assist authorities and practitioners in determining the appropriate waste management strategy. The Guidelines provide a basis for the development of any current and future strategy for the management of clinical and related wastes in Australia, particularly for hospitals and other similar health care organisations.

         The National Guidelines have been well received. Most hospitals have made use of the Guidelines in developing their own waste policy and procedures.

         The third initiative affecting the transport of hospital wastes across State and Territory borders is the `National Guidelines for the Management of Wastes: National Manifest and Classification System'. These Guidelines have been prepared by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and provide a system for tracking certain, usually hazardous, wastes across State borders. Amongst the wastes subject to this system are clinical and pharmaceutical wastes which are made up of the following categories: infectious substances, pathogenic substances, pharmaceuticals and residues, cytotoxic substances, and wastes from the production and preparation of pharmaceutical products.

The Commonwealth Government also supports the dissemination and exchange of information on waste issues and regards this as being essential to the improvement of waste management practices in Australia. A variety of initiatives have already been implemented which will increase local governments' access to information on waste issues, for example:

          I would rather not spend too much time considering the first recommendation in regard to hospital waste. However, I do note that the response stated that the interstate transport of hospital wastes, which had been undertaken in some instances to avoid local requirements, was being considered under a number of intergovernmental initiatives—not the least of which were the national guidelines for the management of clinical and related wastes as well as the Australian code for the transport of dangerous goods by road and rail.

          Rather than spend time on that recommendation, I would like to note some of the other responses to the committee's report. As a member of the committee, I was particularly keen to see that these recommendations were responded to. The second recommendation of the committee stated:
         </tab>

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Responsibility for the granting of approvals for the construction of incinerators typically lies with the State and Territory Governments rather than the Commonwealth Government. As such it would be most appropriate for State and Territory Governments to determine what conditions . . .

        <para>
         I would suggest that that is rather much a cop-out, because it would not be inappropriate for the federal government to undertake research into this sort of matter and make recommendations, and that was very much the theme of the initial report.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee saw that the Commonwealth government had a role in establishing research and models for the most appropriate way of dealing with some of the problems. To read in the government's response that, as usual, the federal government would rather not adopt that role but leave it to the states to dream up their own ways of dealing with things really shows that this is a case of the federal government not undertaking the role which we have a right to expect them to.

          That criticism does not apply to all of the government responses, just to a couple that I will deal with in making these remarks. With regard to high temperature incineration, the third recommendation of the committee was that:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . technologies designed to reuse or recycle be given priority, and environmentally friendlier alternative technologies for the destruction of scheduled waste be considered in preference to high temperature incineration . . .

         I am pleased to read that the government's response in the first instance was to say:

         This recommendation is consistent with the position taken by ANZECC and is supported.
        </para>
        <para>
         The government's response further noted:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This decision reflected a conceptual shift away from one of managing all of Australia's scheduled waste as a single waste stream and disposing of it through the establishment of a centralised disposal facility, to one of acknowledging the separate components of the scheduled waste stream and placing reliance on a range of emerging technologies for treating the different parts of the scheduled waste stream.
        </para>
        <para>
         We are very pleased to note that response, because it is very much in accord with the sort of evidence that the committee received.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I would like to remind the Senate that on page 4 of the committee's report, which we tabled in September 1994, we noted at point 1.14 Professor Worner's very interesting evidence to the committee. Professor Worner is the scientific adviser for the Illawarra Technology Corporation Ltd. He brought to the committee the concept that there is no such thing as waste; it is just a resource that wants some innovative idea on how it can be used.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          With this refreshing attitude we move away from the idea that waste is a troublesome and somewhat inconvenient substance to the concept that waste is something which is a challenge to our capacity to innovate and derive some benefit from. By doing that we move right away from the idea that waste has to be burnt in a high temperature incinerator to the concept of waste being something for which we can explore alternative uses and, therefore, alternative benefits. This concept brings us to an entirely different approach to what is appropriate to place in landfills.

          Skipping recommendations Nos 4 and 5 and the associated responses, I look at recommendation 6, which states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . that the Government investigate the potential and feasibility of using cement kilns for the disposal of particular waste streams—

         The opportunities for disposing of particular waste streams should be examined on a case-by-case basis and would be best undertaken by State and Territory Governments—
        </para>
        <para>
         Again that is somewhat of a cop-out. It is important to note that there is another reason for criticising that response, apart from the criticism that it is a cop-out. The government response continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The future use of these and other materials will be dependent on, among other things, the economics of the practice and community concerns about using cement kilns for waste disposal purposes.
        </para>
        <para>
         As far as I am concerned, here is a direct opportunity for the Commonwealth government to help the community determine whether their concerns are properly based. That is what governments are for. The federal government can and should use its resources to conduct research, to lead the debate and to make sure the community is informed about the potential advantages and disadvantages of different ways of disposing of waste.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In recommendation 7, where the committee recommended that the government investigate the avenues available to regulate the use of materials for recycling in preference to their use as a supplementary fuel, the government response was, essentially, that these opportunities should be examined on a case by case assessment and that, to a large extent, market demand will determine that. Here is a distinct role for national leadership.

          Many of the waste management options are driven by threshold quantities. We all know that newspapers, used tyres, waste oil and construction materials are good examples of this tendency. We know there are several potential uses for tyres. To abandon the question of regulation and to rely solely on the market is an abrogation of government responsibility and is a strategy which could well lead to confusion and a set of practices which are contradictory.

        <para first-indent="16">

          To be specific here, three used tyres are a nuisance. If they are in the backyard, most people would recognise them as a nuisance. Thirty used tyres are somewhat of a headache. But when you have 3,000 used tyres, they become a real problem to store, to transport, to reuse or to dispose of. But at that stage significant costs and significant potential benefits are likely. If we have three million tyres, that would be a significant resource and would enable the establishment of reprocessing facilities, infrastructure, marketing et cetera.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Legislation can and should be used to encourage the aggregation of such a resource. If it is illegal to dump tyres, if it is illegal to burn them in the backyard or if it is illegal to dispose of them in certain other ways, then it becomes more likely that a significant resource can be aggregated. My point is that legislative leadership does have a role. It is just not good enough to avoid that role and leave that matter to the market, as this response has done.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          However, in general terms, I am rather pleased that essentially the response—for example, in answer to the committee's recommendation 11 that where technology is available governments work with industry to encourage the use of recycled materials instead of raw materials—tells us that the government is doing that, as it does with recommendation 12, which is about a consultative process. In particular, we suggest in recommendation 13 some waste reduction targets, and the response tells us that:

        <para>

         The government initiated triennial funding arrangements in 1988-89 which allow the ABC to plan for the future with a high degree of certainty. The triennial funding arrangements have maintained ABC funding in real terms since the exemption of the ABC from the efficiency dividend in 1991 and also allow the ABC to retain revenue generated from its commercial activities. This funding stability provided by the government indicates the importance the government attaches to the role of the ABC.

         This letter is to inform you of the ABC's response to. the Report of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The board welcomed the major findings of the Report. The statements recognising the importance of the ABC in the lives of all Australians and the ABC's high reputation both within Australia and overseas were particularly pleasing. We agree with the Committee when it said that the basic structure of the ABC is sound and that the need for a quality independent national broadcaster is greater today than it was a decade ago.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The committee's support for an independent national broadcaster, playing an essential part in this Australian democracy, is very much appreciated. The comments in relation to adequate funding were equally welcome.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The board has carefully considered the recommendations of the majority report and the comments in the minority report. Attached is the ABC's response to each recommendation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         You will see that all recommendations relevant to ABC Editorial Policies have been referred to the Editorial Policies Working Group (with board and management representation). The Group is working to develop the next edition of the booklet. The booklet will undergo more substantial rewriting on this occasion than has been the case when a new edition is published. A discussion paper which included the relevant Committee recommendations has been distributed throughout the ABC, calling for staff input. The National Advisory Council and the Independent Complaints Review Panel were also asked to contribute. The comments and suggestions are currently being reviewed by the Working Group, after which drafting and further consultation will take place.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         At this stage, it is difficult to predict the final outcome of the drafting and consultative processes. However I can assure you that the full board (to whom the Working Group reports) is committed to developing a clear, comprehensive and consistent set of policies to guide ABC personnel in their working lives and to safeguard the independence of the Corporation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the same way that recommendations covering editorial matters have been referred to the editorial group, recommendations covering human resources have been referred to the Human Resources board of Management. These matters were the subject of initial discussions at the recent meeting of the Joint Consultative Committee (JCC). The JCC, established under section 81 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, includes representatives of the corporation and relevant unions. Discussions will continue at subsequent meetings.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The recommendation in relation to Business News Australia (BNA) has been overtaken by events. You will no doubt be aware that the ABC has decided to end the BNA service when present contractual arrangements are concluded. In other instances, you will see that the thrust of the recommendations has already been implemented.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ABC will consider further the recommendations in relation to Australia Television and will discuss them with you in due course. You are aware that the board is currently reviewing aspects of the Australia Television service in light of the fact that it has not attracted sufficient sponsorship to achieve revenue targets.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to the subscription television recommendation, the board itself will consistently assess whether any, and if so what, effects on ABC editorial and
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         program independence might arise once the two subscription channels have commenced operation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I note that the committee has treated a range of ABC activities which involve some element of marketing or revenue raising as being "commercial". This is a confusing description in that many of these activities exist in order to provide a service and any "commercial" component is incidental
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Board guidelines ensure that all revenue raising activity compiles with fair competition practices; full transparency and accountability, including a range of credible performance indicators; strict financial controls and audits; and meets the ABC's Charter objectives. The close integration of ABC activities without an over burdening bureaucratic structure has given life to the majority of ABC products and services. Introduction of an administratively more complex and costly structure would, in the ABC's view, provide little advantage or value and in reality would more likely reduce the viability, variety and range of products available, disadvantaging many Australians.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The board welcomes the recognition that decentralisation may warrant an increase in funding to meet the costs involved. Within financial constraints, the board encourages efforts to keep a sensible spread of staff and resources across Australia. The ABC is pleased that the relevant industrial unions have offered to work cooperatively and constructively with us to this end.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Corporate Plan is currently undergoing its annual review in preparation for commencement on 1 July next. It is anticipated that the new version win spell out more clearly the ABC's ongoing commitment to its staff.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The board has no comment to make in relation to the composition of and appointments to the board, except to confirm the ABC position advanced throughout the inquiry process that these are matters for the Governor General acting on the advice of government. The board does not intend to take up the recommendation to establish a separate, full-time secretariat.

         In February 1994 the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements said that there were allegations about the existence of networks of paedophiles operating in Australia and that the extent of the networks and their activities remained unknown. The report recommended that organised paedophile networks should be added to the areas of major organised crime that the National Crime Authority was expected to focus on, and the government accepted this recommendation. In December 1994 the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into the extent to which organised paedophile networks had become established in Australia, and related matters such as the adequacy of police resources and the role of the National Crime Authority in tackling this area of criminal activity. To some extent the conclusions reached on the scope of organised paedophile activity depend on the breadth or narrowness of definitions adopted for such key terms as `paedophile', `child pornography' and `organised networks'. Yet obviously those terms are used with widely varying definitions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The information presented to the committee was that most sexual offences against children are committed by their relatives and neighbours who are not paedophiles in the strict sense of the term and who do not operate in any organised or network way. To the extent that two or more paedophiles group together to commit offences, the numbers involved have almost invariably been very small and the groupings very much ad hoc and on a peer-to-peer basis. More commonly, where there are contacts between paedophile offenders, they consist of loose, informal networks of peer-to-peer contacts. The committee did not receive any evidence that organised paedophile groups and networks have ever resembled in size, aims, structures, methods or longevity the organised crime groups which provide the main focus for the National Crime Authority's work.

          Again, the committee did not receive evidence of any commercial production of illegal child pornography in Australia. Most of the current illegal material that undoubtedly is possessed by many paedophiles appears to be made by them, obtained by informal trading of homemade material among paedophiles assisted by informal networking, or obtained from overseas. There is no evidence of organised promotion or arrangement of tours by Australian paedophiles to overseas destinations known to be attractive to them. However, informal networking among paedophiles may assist some tourists going overseas to commit paedophile offences.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In light of the evidence on the nature and extent of organised paedophile activity, the committee found it necessary to make only limited recommendations for change. The committee considered it essential that any focus by law enforcement agencies on organised paedophilia is not at the expense of resources devoted to the majority of cases of child sexual abuse. While clearly paedophile networking should not be ignored, an over-emphasis on it risks distracting community attention from the majority of child sex offenders—the lone offenders who are all too frequently members of the same family or household as their victims.

          The committee noted that the National Crime Authority is to complete its own strategic intelligence assessment of organised paedophile activity early in 1996. Mr Sherman, the authority chairperson, told the committee in August that if the authority assessment matched the committee's he did not propose that the National Crime Authority stay around in that area creating a role for itself. The committee endorsed this view. The specialist units in state and territory police forces have the experience, facilities and expertise in investigating child sexual assault that the National Crime Authority does not have.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In coming to this view, the committee recognised that  there was scope for improvement in the way that the various police forces work together to detect paedophile offenders. Police told the committee that cooperation amongst their forces was generally good, but they agreed that there could be improvements.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another area where the committee considered that improvements could be made is in the detection of child pornography which has been imported electronically via computer links. At present, no particular agency appears to have responsibility for the surveillance of the computer transmission of pornographic material. The committee believes the Commonwealth government should accept responsibility for the detection of offences involving the transmission of child pornography using the telephone network. This responsibility ought to be resolved by direct arrangements between the specialist state and territory units and whichever Commonwealth agency is considered to be most suitable for the job. The committee considered, however, that the National Crime Authority was not the suitable agency in this case.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In addition, the committee believes that there are obvious benefits in Australian law enforcement agencies working cooperatively to equip themselves with the necessary computer training, expertise and access to specialised software and hardware tools needed to keep them abreast of the actual and potential use of computers for criminal paedophile purposes. We have made recommendations to this effect. The committee also recommended that the Minister for Justice explore the possibility of establishing a single, well publicised e-mail address accessible through the Internet to which computer users can report any indications they come across of computer distribution of child pornography—in effect, an e-mail hotline.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another area in which the committee recommended changes concerned the activity of Australian paedophiles in South-East Asia. The committee recommended that the government take steps to improve the arrangements between the Thai, Cambodian and other South-East Asian authorities to assist in the detection and obtaining of evidence to enable the prosecution of Australians committing child sex offences in those countries. The committee also made recommendations designed to improve the flow of information to the Australian Federal Police about the illegal activities of Australian paedophiles overseas.

          Some non-government organisations argued that improved record keeping on suspected and convicted child sex offenders was needed to assist them to vet their staff and persons working through them. It was said that police records do not always contain the names of persons notified as abusers to child welfare agencies, and better integration of agencies records was required. It seemed to the committee that what was sought ideally was a national register of known and suspected child sex offenders. The committee made no recommendation on this issue.

          </emphasis>
          . The committee found that there is very little, if any, organised paedophile criminal activity as we understand that term, not that that is any consolation. It does mean that such activity is more widely dispersed, is more prevalent than we suspected and is more difficult to investigate, identify and prosecute. It is no consolation that many Australian paedophiles travel overseas to indulge in these crimes.

          While we have relevant legislation to prosecute those people, it is proving extremely difficult to do this and does depend to a large extent on the effective cooperation of the police forces in the countries the paedophiles travel to to commit these crimes. When they return, it does mean that Australian children are more at risk. It is difficult to apprehend offenders when they are not organised and therefore not easily identifiable.

          The report found that most sexual offences against children are committed by their relatives and neighbours who are not paedophiles in the strict sense of the term and who do not operate in an organised or networked way. To cope with this particular situation the committee made a number of recommendations which, to a large extent, are related to resources and to the organisation of these resources by our law enforcement agencies. These recommendations relate to training, access to specialist expertise and, obviously, access to criminal intelligence databases such as the one operated by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence.

          The committee recommended that the Minister for Justice take steps to ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies contribute to and draw on the expertise and software tools of overseas law enforcement agencies. That brings me back to the point that I raised before that we need to step up the cooperation and arrangements that exist between Australian and overseas police forces. In that context, the Thai police force and law enforcement agencies in Cambodia were mentioned. The committee also recommended that the government take steps to ensure that all personnel working overseas in countries believed to be attractive to visiting Australian paedophiles are made aware that any information they happen to come across about the illegal activities of such paedophiles should be reported to the Australian Federal Police for further investigation and prosecution in Australia.

          While this necessarily limited inquiry found no evidence of organised paedophile activity, there is no doubt from the evidence before the committee that such activities are being pursued in Australia, very often in conjunction with child pornography. I trust and hope that the government will take seriously the committee's recommendation to make the Australian law enforcement agencies' work in this area more effective.

         This report arose essentially from several crises around the world, particularly the failure of the Barings Brothers bank out of the action by Nick Leeson in the Singapore exchange a little over a year ago. There were also other major crashes at about the same time. I guess the other most famous one was Orange County in the US, where there were losses of $US1.76 billion. They were to do with futures on interest rates. The Baring Brothers one was futures on stocks and bonds. There were quite a few others in the last few years that achieved notoriety around the world.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Our committee commenced an inquiry into this matter with relevance for Australia in November last year. We found on the evidence that what happened in Singapore was, in fact, a management problem in that the dealer was acting also as the backroom accountant and was not being supervised by management. So the fundamental lesson to be learnt from the Baring Brothers failure is that dealers dealing in derivatives need to be separate from the accountant who is doing the settlement—handling the money, in other words. They need to be separate and, beyond that, management overseeing these two groups needs to understand what is going on. That did not happen in the Leeson-Baring Brothers incident in Singapore.

          We took evidence from the Australian entities that organise transactions in derivatives, specifically the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Stock Exchange and also the Australian Securities Commission. The evidence was that the chance of this non-separation happening in Australia was, in fact, virtually impossible. There is close supervision by the exchanges of the processing of derivative products, a clear separation of dealing from accounting, and a clear recognition by management of overseeing these matters. Each of the exchanges goes to a lot of trouble to make sure that they understand the positions that have been taken by firms and by individuals, which was something that did not take place, for instance, in Singapore.

          The other important thing to note is that there is now, following that Baring Brothers failure—and part of that was due to a lack of understanding between rival exchanges as to contracts taken out in two rival exchanges—a worldwide move to try to coordinate an understanding of the positions taken by players in the derivatives market. The committee welcomes that.

          Our main conclusions are that for Australia there is no need for additional legislation over this area. We believe the market is working well, but an eye needs to be kept on it. We recommend, in fact, to the Australian Securities Commission that in the annual report they should give a synopsis of the derivatives market as it operates here in Australia.

          We do not believe there should be any restriction on raising new products. There are new products in the derivatives market being thought about and put on the market on a reasonably regular basis. We do not believe there should be any legislative controls on that process, but when they are incorporated, there needs to be the key principles of separation of dealers from the people who pay the money, the accountants, with management overseeing the lot. Our committee found that we in Australia are fortunate; we do have a good system. As I said, the only thing that is missing and which our exchanges are looking at, and are actively involved in, is the matter of international cooperation on positions taken by traders in this business.

          The final main recommendation is that there should be more effort made by the people involved in the industry to make sure people around the periphery and others, the general public, have a better understanding of what derivatives are and when they are used. They are, in fact, a risk reduction means for people in the financial markets. They are a means of reducing risk, particularly for major players in the industry, and they do add value. They are a genuine addition to the markets and a good thing for the market. I commend the report to the Senate.

          —by leave—In the time available to me to deal with this important report,
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australia's relations with Thailand
          </emphasis>
          , I would like to deal with two points before making some general comments on the Australia-Thailand relationship. The first specific point relates to an earlier report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and a recommendation in its report on human rights. The second point relates to other recent reports of the committee.

          In November 1993, we tabled a report entitled
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australia's relations with Indonesia
          </emphasis>
          . One of its recommendations dealt with the inclusion of an assessment of progress towards the establishment and protection of human rights in that country by Australia's development assistance agency. The government's response to that report seems to imply that the committee was in some way recommending a change to the policy by which the development assistance program is not linked to human rights performance. The committee was in fact aware of that policy and was not recommending a change.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The government's response to the report also made the point that virtually all development assistance, such as women in development or poverty alleviation projects, has human rights implications. The report I have just tabled on relations with Thailand includes a recommendation that the development assistance agency target projects which are directed towards improving human rights in that country. In making this recommendation, the committee is not asking the Australian government to change its policy and link development assistance with progress towards human rights.

          The paragraph immediately before the recommendation explicitly says that this is not the case. It points out that the specific human rights emphasis in the development assistance program in Thailand is not definable. This country is prepared to spend $44.9 million on development assistance in Thailand. It also emphasises the universality of human rights. It is surely not unreasonable, therefore, to expect some focus on programs which, following consultation with the Thai authorities, have an emphasis on human rights. We would hope that those who prepare the government response are aware not only of this recommendation but also of what seems to be a gap in our assistance program.

          The second point I would like to make relates to another report tabled recently by the joint standing committee. It was very noticeable, although the section of the report which dealt with prostitution was only three pages out of 110, this was the only section which received media attention. The report's title was
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma
          </emphasis>
          , and that faithfully reflects its emphasis. It would be a pity if the same thing happened to the report on relationships with Thailand. Although trafficking in women for the purposes of prostitution is an important issue, it is only a small part of our report, which deals with the bilateral relationship between Australia and Thailand.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          A look at the table of contents makes it clear that this report deals with the bilateral relationship in detail. To do this, for example, it describes the Thai economy and sets out the trading relationship between the two nations. Part 3 deals with a number of important Australian connections and opportunities, including defence, legal and educational relationships. It looks at Thailand's relations with its neighbours and piracy in the region.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Viewed as a whole, this report seeks to improve a relationship which was described as `longstanding, close and cordial'. It was also put to us that just after the Second World War this relationship was at its peak and has not achieved those heights since. While there is nothing wrong with the bilateral relationship, it lacks something. Thailand is a very important nation in South-East Asia and it would be very easy to make a selfish, national interest case in favour of a close relationship. Another reason could be that the two nations get on well at a personal level.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee has made a number of recommendations which it hopes will be effective in broadening and deepening the relationship. While many reasons could be advanced to achieve this end, this is the one which has guided the committee in its deliberations. It believes that Australia has a range of skills and expertise in a number of areas which may be of use to Thailand.

          In framing these recommendations, we were conscious that many require consultation with Thai authorities before they can be adopted and that they will make the decisions about our offers of assistance. This is how it should be. We would also hope that the Australian government will look at these recommendations positively and look for ways to incorporate ideas from this report into the existing policy framework. Parliamentary committees often feel that government responses to reports are unjustly dismissive of their efforts. I very much hope that this will not be the case with this report. I commend the report to the Senate.

         —As most people who have looked at it have seen, this is an incredibly complex legal matter. There has been debate backwards and forwards about what the implications will be. I want to ask how the grandfathering provision that exists under amendment 14 works. I want to know whether the intention is that if the current owner of the 17.2 per cent of shares makes any move to buy or sell shares in that entity, then that is the time when they need to trade down to a maximum of 15 per cent. I want to check whether this grandfathering provision is such that it means that the timing of any sale remains with the owner of the shares and whether it means that when they do move to change their shareholding in any way, they are required to trade to a maximum of 15 per cent.

Say you are at the moment on 25 per cent, hypothetically. You are grandfathered on 25 per cent as long as you do not do anything to your shareholding. If you deliberately increase your shareholding and you have the choice as to whether to do it or not and you increase it, or if you play with your shareholding above 15 per cent anyway, you have to go back to 15 per cent. If, however, your shareholdings increase, not through your own manipulation but through circumstances you cannot control, you have to go back to 25 per cent.

I thought it had already been stated that if there was any change in your holdings in terms of the licence conditions or any other changes that you might make, you forfeited the protection and you go back to 15 per cent. You are fixed at 17.2 per cent. There is a distinction between accidentally going above that and deliberately going above that.

         As I understand it, if it is accidental you do not pay any penalty—and nor should you, because they are circumstances beyond your control. But I think the real issue is whether, if you consciously increased your holding above 17.2 per cent, you then pay the penalty of going right back down to 15 per cent. I assume that is the logic of this whole exercise—that grandfathering means you sit tight but the moment you move, the moment you try to do anything to advantage yourself, you come back to the rest of the field.

         That takes me back to my original proposition—that, really, you should not try to patch up these things on the run; you should have a full and proper review of the whole concept underlying the cross-media rules to work out the most effective way of doing it. If you do it in bits, you could well end up with the ultimate unintentional outcome. Where you think you are ameliorating a situation, you might worsen it in terms of an injustice to someone with a holding in excess of 15 per cent. In other words, if we were to carry amendments 4 and 11, which I am opposed to, but we were to successfully oppose 14, a party with 17.2 per cent would immediately be in breach of the law with no protection of the grandfather arrangement.

If the government had written it in such a way that it did enable a managed sell down by anybody who is grandfathered under this provision, it probably would be supportable.

         I understand that, if the committee does not allow me to deal with it separately, I will obviously lose by the numbers. But if it does, that is the reason for it.

         —In terms of whether the committee should allow that course to be followed, I think it is important for Senator Margetts to indicate what path she intends to follow and whether she would argue that that result will follow. It seems to me that, if the end result were to be that 4 and 11 are carried and 14 is not, this will be the ultimate example of retrospective legislation. The legislation will say to someone who has within the law gone to 17.2 per cent and been cleared by the ABA that, sitting where you are now, you are in breach even though you were not when you increased to that level. In other words, you did what you were allowed to do by law, the ABA cleared you and suddenly you are being told that that is illegal.

         The whole purpose of grandfathering is to say that if you did something that was legal at the time you should not be forced to divest yourself subsequently by a change in the law. In other words, it is prospective; you allow someone to be grandfathered and they sit on the 17.2 per cent. But the minute they make any change to their arrangements they forfeit the protection of the grandfathering. Grandfathering is a deliberate mechanism that guards against someone suddenly being forced to sell down because their actions are deemed, retrospectively, to be illegal.

         This arises in a much starker fashion in relation to CanWest and their holdings in Channel 7 and Channel 10. As we know, their voting rights are 14.9 per cent. Because of the non-voting rights attaching to debentures and the loans they have made, they have a 57 per cent economic interest in the company. If the view is taken that this device should not be allowed in future, that is one thing. It is another thing altogether to say to CanWest, `We don't care that what you did was legal at the time and you have been in that situation for some years, we are suddenly going to make you sell down tomorrow from 57 per cent to 14.9 per cent.'

         —I know. That is a very good reason for opposing that provision, because it is not effective. You should still at least support the principle of grandfathering, which is that you would not suddenly turn around and say to CanWest, `Now this law has gone through, it is retrospective. You have been entitled to a holding of 57 per cent for some years, but suddenly you are illegal and you have to go down to 15 per cent overnight because there is no grandfathering.' I would have thought that was a very unfair outcome. That is why, even though it creates complications, grandfathering is put in as a matter of course to guard against retrospective application.

         If you knocked off amendment 14, there would be no grandfathering protection. The holder of a 17.2 per cent interest legally acquired would be immediately required to divest itself and go down below the 15 per cent.

         So as not to spend too long on it, I shall refer to some of the matters raised in the letter that they have sent to me, Senator McMullan, Mr Langmore, Mr Smyth, Mr Simon Crean, Mr Snowdon, Mr Free, Mr Ronaldson and Mrs Gallus. I will then seek to incorporate the letter. It is the corporation's belief that the manner of funding will disadvantage the ACT, being a smaller entity, in any event. In part, the letter says:

        As the ACT Aboriginal Education Consultative Group (AECG) representative I wish to bring to your attention how these "per capita funding" arrangements will affect the ACT. Under the new arrangements the funding arrangements to the Catholic Education Office (CEO), the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) will remain unchanged, however the funding to the ACT Department of Education and Training (DET) will face a possible cut of 20%. In effect the "per capita arrangements" are telling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that if their children are enrolled in a public school the Commonwealth Government will place a less value on the need for quality education than if they attended a non-government school.

        Whilst I understand that all States and Territories are facing similar cuts, in the case of the ACT this could mean a possible $60,000 cut out of a $320,000 budget. Due to the fact that the ACT is a small player in comparison to other States and Territories it does not have an initial budget of such a size that a 20% cut can be catered for within the overall budget for AESIP initiatives. For example, the Northern Territory will cater for this cut by cutting its funding allocation to Bachelor College and have the Commonwealth completely fund Bachelor College on its own, thus freeing NT resources for expenditure on other programs, (not necessarily Aboriginal Education, this is only presumed). The ACT does not have such bargaining chips with which to induce the Commonwealth into arrangements that allow the ACT to strike similar deals. Whereas in the ACT public sector schooling this may mean that 2.5 Aboriginal Education workers will disappear from our schools.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Northern Territory has programs such as Batchelor College because of the fact that at the time that such educational programs were set up the mentality was that people on the Eastern seaboard were not as disadvantaged as people from the "remoter areas of our continent". In the case of states such as the Western Australia and Queensland who are attempting to roll over significant amounts of funds' (I believe that in the case of Queensland that it as high as . . . . . . . . . . . . .and in Western Australia $900,000) 20% cuts of total allocated funds for 1995—not the amount spent, will mean that the 20% cut will have little real impact in terms of the systems to adequately resource the delivery of services.

        I would suggest to you that the proposed "per capita funding" will have a significant impact on the ACT's capacity to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the basic services expected under AESIP.

        If the "per capita basis "translates as "bums on seats" then we would be faced with a ridiculous situation were CEO, CIT and DET would be fighting for students (poaching students) in order to maintain funding levels. For eg, a parent convinces a year 10 student to remain at school and complete year 12, however, a tafe recruitment drive targets the student because it is in their interest to have that student in a TAFE classroom and not in the school room, the interest of the student is ignored or explored as a secondary consideration. Similarly Liaison Officers advising of transfers of students between the Catholic system and the Public system. This is not as far fetched a scenario as it may seem. It is already happening. In short a students education becomes unstable as a result of the competing pressures which are put on them by the various providers.

Mainstream funding is for basic education services, not supplementary funding under the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. The ACT has received more funding than other states have received in the past. I think that covers the points the senator raised.

         At the very least, I would like an undertaking that a discussion will take place because there is certainly unhappiness at the present time about the implications this issue will have for students in the ACT. If the Catholic Education Office and the Canberra Institute of Technology remain unchanged, the full force of the reduction will be borne by the ACT education department. That much seems very clear if the first of those two propositions were to be correct. Therefore, students under the ACT department of education will be affected adversely.

         The transitional bill sets out the legislative framework for leasing the 22 airports and the Sydney West airport, and for resolving the financial and personnel issues raised by the leasing process. The Airports Bill establishes the regulatory system that would apply to the airports once they are leased and would apply to the successful tenderers. The airports would be leased for a period of 50 years with an option of a 49-year extension.

         One of the key issues raised by the leasing process is that of the maintenance of existing service levels and a hopeful reduction in charges. It is interesting to note that only some weeks ago the minister decided to enforce upon the industry an increase in the charges that would lift the sale price of the airports. One of the reasons for leasing the airports was hopefully to organise a system whereby, with the efficiencies generated, there would be a reduction in charges which would benefit not only the consumers but also the tourism industry. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, already has the power to monitor the charges imposed by airport lessees. Part 8 of the bill would enable it to monitor the quality of the service that it provides.

         One of the most interesting aspects of this bill is the Labor Party's attitude to privatisation. The 22 airports are another of those national assets that the Labor Party promised to keep in public hands. The now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in 1985 that the privatisation of authorities like the Commonwealth Bank or TAA was:

         As recently as 1986 the then Minister for Transport, Mr Morris, said that privatising the airlines and the airports was a dangerous policy. The ALP's 1991 platform said, `Labor will ensure the Federal Airports Corporation remains in full public ownership, operates on an efficient basis and continues to develop along competitive lines and establish similar public owned undertakings where appropriate.' Yet today we are debating the privatisation of the airports. We have already seen Qantas sold, and now we have a bill which will privatise the airports—a device in the government's view to reduce temporarily the budget deficit rather than encourage competition and the development of innovative services. The light on the hill has turned out to be a neon sign saying, `Labor principles for sale at a price.' That is what it is all about. It has nothing to do with the matter of efficiency, competition or of saying that certain things should be run by the private sector. It is simply a matter of saying, `We cannot resist getting our hands on the dollars.'

         I think it is important to recognise the great work done by the Federal Airports Corporation. When the corporation came into being in about 1988, there was a little pea and thimble trick; a little creative accounting. The FAC was given some $600 million of debt on assets where there was not a debt in the past. The taxpayers of Australia paid for the construction of airports. The FAC was given a debt of $600 million and was told to do all the expansions that could be done to improve the efficiency of airports, which is what it did. It did it very effectively without coming back to the budget. Now the government is saying, `You have an asset which is worth a lot of money.' Estimates floating around the place show it to be in the order of $2 billion. I guess the scoping study would have a more accurate figure than that. The government is saying, `Here is an opportunity for us to bring back money and then artificially reduce the budget deficit.' It is the old pea and thimble trick.

         The way the government has approached the privatisation process is a case study of how this government operates. It has been characterised by ruthlessness, arrogance and a determination to crush anyone who disagrees with its views. The list of casualties in the Department of Transport alone and the statutory authorities under Mr Brereton's control is an extensive one. We have seen the resignation of the head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Doug Roser. We have seen the resignation of Vanessa Fanning, the Principal Aviation Adviser to the Department of Transport. We have seen the movement of Graham Evans, the Secretary to the Department of Transport. We have seen the resignation of Bill Swingler, the Chief Executive of the Federal Airports Corporation, who, when the government took off him the role of determining airport charges, took the view `What else have we got?' and thought it better to resign. Just recently, we have seen the resignation of Mr Sandy White, the General Manager of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek.

         Mr Brereton sacked the board of ANL and replaced them with his mates, Mr Neville Wran and Mr Malcolm Turnbull. The FAC board made the mistake of questioning a lot of the things that were being done in regard to the leasing process, so Mr Brereton got rid of them too. It is interesting that, on the very day that I attended the opening of the Brisbane international airport—which is, again, a credit to the Federal Airports Corporation—and when the speeches were given, a senior person in the FAC remarked to me, `This is the first time the minister has said a nice word about the FAC.'

         Our position is we will only support these bills on two conditions. One is that the government resolves the noise problem of Sydney airport by reopening the east-west runway and conducts a genuine EIS on Sydney West airport. We have debated this in recent days, but the reason for this particular amendment is that, until October last year, Sydney had two active runways—two runways, two active runways. In November last year the third runway was completed. Lo and behold, we have three runways, but only one and seven-eighths are active.

         We will be moving an amendment to bring forward Adelaide airport into the first tranche of airport privatisation. The reason for that is that this is what the South Australians wanted. It wasn't a knee-jerk reaction on our part. Adelaide is in the same category as Perth. The sale of the Adelaide airport is not affected one way or another by the sale of the Sydney or Badgerys Creek airports. It is a stand-alone operation with regard to the sale, the same as Perth.

Air Services argue that some 75,000 are affected by the noise, but that figure does not take into account many areas affected by aircraft in places such as Ku-Ring-Gai. They weren't included. They weren't on the contours of being affected. The methodology used by Air Services is based on a survey conducted in 1992 in areas that had been subjected to aircraft noise for years. The results were not applicable to areas where the aircraft noise level has changed dramatically.

The second amendment will simply bring forward the sale of Adelaide airport and put it in the same category as Perth. To argue, as the minister has done, that this will somehow delay the extension of Adelaide airport is as phoney as all the other things that this minister says from time to time when he gets half a chance.

         The Airports Bill puts forward a framework to allow for long-term leases of the major airports that are presently administered by the FAC. It does not necessarily change the operational limitations on airports. By retaining the legal ownership of the airports, the federal government is ensuring that the regulatory powers and planning regulations they have in relation to airports are retained. The whole effect and purpose of this bill is not to visit some sort of further affliction on the general community but to protect the community interest, the communities surrounding the airports and also those who utilise the airports.

         I would take this opportunity to look a little more closely at some of the restrictions this bill puts in place and what effect their non-compliance has. Section 14 of the bill requires that there be a single lessee; that the lessee be a qualified company, which is defined in the definitions section of the bill as being a company over which the Commonwealth has constitutional power; and that the lease provides for the use of the site as an airport, except in relation to Sydney West or airports where there is a joint user. The fact is that, if there is non-compliance with these particular terms of a lease, or if there is non-compliance in the transfer of a lease or the extension of a lease, the lease becomes void. In fact, there can be no stronger requirement than, if there is non-compliance, that the legal document which purports to be a lease has no effect whatsoever.

         The bill also sets out extensive limitations in relation to the type of company that can take up a lease on the airports. The foreign ownership of the company is limited to 49 per cent; airline ownership of any company which takes up a lease is limited to five per cent; and there is a limitation of 15 per cent on cross-ownership for companies that have the lease of Sydney and Melbourne or Sydney and Brisbane airports. This means there are safeguards in place to ensure that a monopoly is not established and that there is ongoing competition between the airports to ensure continuing efficiencies and a better service for both the airlines and the people who utilise them.

         The amendment to be put forward by Senator Parer and the coalition, which says, effectively, that there can be no leasing of Kingsford Smith, would have two major effects. If you have a look at the profitability of the various major airports covered by this bill—19 in all—the largest profit earner by some distance is Sydney airport, which last year earned $62.6 million. Even though Sydney earned that amount, the total dividend paid to the government by the FAC for all those 19 major airports was only $8 million. The reason for this is very clear: there is major cross-subsidisation between Sydney airport and other airports that are less profitable. Melbourne and Brisbane, admittedly, do make a profit but certainly not in the same range as Sydney.

It requires substantive approval by the minister to a number of matters that involve the operations of the airport and the planning provisions, particularly in regard to Sydney West. All these are retained. What is lost by the leasing out of the airport is the ongoing requirement by this government to inject capital into the airports. It has to be noted that the FAC over the last few years—since about 1988—has substantially improved the standard infrastructure of all the airports in preparation for this leasing out.

         This government and the ALP see there being many other priorities—that, if there is a capacity to have an ongoing and worthwhile infrastructure by way of the airports, where the capital input is being provided by a private source leaving public moneys available for other priorities of the government, they see it as a worthwhile thing. The other priorities of the government are Medicare, education, Working Nation and the provision of long-term jobs for those who have been out of work for a long time—all provisions on which we can spend our money that make it better for members of the community, rather than spending it on putting more capital into the airports when a private company would quite happily do that. My view is that, where there is an alternative available, as there is, and that it is possible to put into place safeguards, as they have been put forward in this bill, we should inject the government funds into our higher priority areas.

         I have a few comments to make about some of the issues raised by Senator Parer which were not strictly in relation to this bill. But these raised again, I suppose, our last debate—and they do say that generals always fight their last battles—in relation to the safety issue at Kingsford-Smith. Senator Parer clearly continues to not understand or intentionally misunderstand the position that, because it is possible to run intersecting runways reasonably safely, it is equivalent to intersecting runways being the safest option.

         The fact is that no-one has ever asserted—whether it be BASI, Airservices Australia, me or any other member of the committee—that it is unsafe or impossible to safely operate intersecting runways. What has been asserted by all those parties, and particularly by the government members of the committee, is that it is safer to have parallel runways; that it is not worth while taking the risk of having intersecting runways when the option of having parallel runways is available. As I pointed out on the occasion when last I was on my feet, it was always the policy of the coalition to support the construction of the third runway. However, now they have found there is a political issue to be made of it, they are tap dancing around, trying to say that the position is the same whilst at the same time, in fact, opposing its construction.

         The government readily recognises the difficulty of airport noise. There is certainly a large amount of sympathy from me and many other members of the government as to the effects of noise on the community surrounding the airport. Attempts have been made to reduce that by placing restrictions on the pathways that the planes are taking and by requiring noise amelioration in the homes, schools and churches that surround the airport to ensure that at least when people are inside and all the doors and windows are closed they are not as badly affected as they were. Despite all that, a proposition such as closing down the airport completely or removing all international flights out to Sydney West, if it is ever constructed, is just not a viable option.

         I have to say this bill and the scheme which it proposes clearly is not a complete disposal of the ownership of the airports. As I said earlier, this bill only envisages a lease of 50 years plus a further extension of 49 years. Upon the end of that term, I suppose it will be up to the government of the day to determine whether those airports go back into public ownership or whether the private leasing continues. But I think there is a major difference in principle and in policy between a sale of an asset owned by the government and leasing, though long term, as proposed in this bill.

It allows us to protect the community interest, to retain a long-term ownership of the airports and, at the same time, to free up resources of the government to be utilised in areas where I think there is a higher priority—that is, in health, in the support of families and in reducing the number of long-term unemployed. I commend the bill to you.

         —I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate since the government has handled things so badly that we have over 70 bills to go. I just want to make a few points about airports in general. The opposition's case has been very well put by Senator Parer in opening this debate. We are dealing with two bills—the Airports Bill 1995 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995, which transfers the ownership of some airports which essentially are owned by the Commonwealth through the Federal Airports Corporation.

         Airports are terribly important facilities for a country. They are comparable with seaports in bygone centuries. They can bring a great deal of wealth to a community if they are properly handled. When this government came to power we had the Department of Civil Aviation which owned the great majority of airfields in Australia—the majority from a use point of view. A lot of smaller strips were owned by councils and private individuals but essentially the DCA owned most airfields. Its whole approach was just to provide an airfield or an aerodrome and provide landing facilities for the aviation industry.

         When Labor came to power it decided to split the Department of Civil Aviation, under its economic rationalist theories, and create a Federal Airports Corporation to look after the airfields and a Civil Aviation Authority to look after all the rest of the aviation business. The objective in doing that was quite a laudable one. It was to create a more efficient structure and thereby lower the cost to the community, because transport is a very big factor in Australia's GDP. It takes a very large slice of what we do and the cost implications from transport flow through to everything in the Australian community. So anything that can keep the costs down is a help.

         But the Labor Party, with its usual inability to handle economic matters, did not handle the FAC very efficiently. It sold the airfields to the newly created Federal Airports Corporation at highly inflated values and then demanded a high return on those. It also did not give the Federal Airports Corporation any directive other than it had to make money out of the airfields. The government did not counsel the corporation quietly on the needs to operate airfields in an efficient way. The FAC took the view that it had a monopoly and that the consumer was going to pay.

         We did see a very sharp increase in prices when the FAC took over. To illustrate the point, if you look at the airports around Australia, you will see that Australian capital cities have a primary airport to which the passenger aircraft go and secondary airports where the charter and some of the commuters operators go and training takes place. Those secondary airports probably got by—this was the case in respect of an airfield I know quite well—with a chief groundsman and maybe two or three staff. Once the FAC was ensconced there was a staff of 10 or 12 people—all of them on very high salaries, all of them getting new cars every year, mobile phones, the whole lot, and the overhead went up.

         Some of those secondary airports, on FAC figures, make a loss.

Also, they put a very heavy figure in for depreciation each year.

         Several months ago the government tried to increase or put pressure on the FAC to increase those charges a great deal more. That would have been entirely counterproductive. Fortunately, the airlines were effective enough in protesting against it and stopped it going through. But had that gone through we would have had this high income on paper from the airfields, which would have enabled the FAC and the government to get a much higher price for those airfields when they were sold. That would have built into the cost structure of Australian aviation an artificially high capital cost to purchase the airfields, which would have to be amortised and built in in perpetuity.

         Whatever changes take place in the future, we need to get some stability and permanence into the business of the ownership and management of airports. I do not wish to rehash the argument that this chamber has spent so much time over about noise at Sydney airport, parallel runways, cross-runways, and the rest of it, but the fact of the matter is that you are always going to have a noise problem with airports.

         Aircraft are getting quieter and quieter with the advances in technology, but there will always be some noise. You cannot solve the problem by building new airports, by moving to a greenfield site 30 miles away from the present one, because as soon as you put in a big airfield, you have to have communications links and road and rail links to it. While it might be in virginal bushland when it starts, these links attract people because of cheaper housing and cheaper land. Ten or 15 years later, as is happening now at Tullamarine, you will find you have a noise problem. So we have to cope with this noise problem.

         Another advantage of having airports that are recognised is that it concentrates aircraft and maintenance at those points. If we have a plethora of small airfields the way the United States has, surveillance by the regulatory authority becomes that much more difficult. It is highly desirable that we try to maintain the system that we have developed in this country—purely, I suppose, by trial and error—over the last 40 or 60 years of having a primary airport for the capital city and a secondary airport.

The high volume traffic which will always go through the primary airports with passenger movements, with the regular public transport services, provides a big economic base and those airports can be, and should be, very profitable.

         The airport bills that are currently before the Senate are an integral part of the government's overall strategy with respect to reforming the operations, development and regulation of federal airports throughout Australia.

That leasing in Sydney will be jointly leased with the new airport at Badgerys Creek, known as Sydney West airport.

There are, of course, other particular restrictions with respect to ownership and control, namely, a 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership and a five per cent limit on airline ownership. There will be a 15 per cent limit on cross-ownership for Sydney and Sydney West-Melbourne and Sydney and Sydney West-Brisbane airports.

         During his contribution, Senator Parer referred to privatisation, and particularly to the government's decision to propose this leasing arrangement for airports. He tried to take a cheap shot at the ALP by suggesting that somehow this was a massive turnaround by the Labor Party on this issue. Of course there is no doubt that in a party like the Australian Labor Party, which represents people right across the length and breadth of the country and not just particular sectional interests, there has been a rigorous debate on the issue of privatisation of government assets. What is important is that we are prepared to change when change becomes necessary, to revisit long held policies of the Labor Party and to take the responsible decisions, sometimes at some political cost. We are prepared to take those responsible decisions when they are in the interests of the country and in the interests of the economy. There is no doubt that this decision is.

         I have detailed those comments and I do not need to go through them again other than to say that at the time the decision was made to construct the third runway they knew full well that the east-west runway would be closed once the third runway was opened. I will quote two members of the opposition whom I have not referred to in the past. It is very enlightening to read what they said. The Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said on 13 August 1991:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The federal government must make three decisions: firstly, to accept the expert advice that the third runway is environmentally more friendly than the present two runway set-up; secondly, that safety is of paramount importance; and, finally, the vital tourist industry must no longer be choked off through lack of sensible economic thinking.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth while concentrating on what the Leader of National Party, Tim Fischer, said on that occasion. He said that three decisions should be made. He said the first one was to accept the expert advice. I would suggest that such experts would be Air Services Australia, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Federal Airports Corporation and air traffic controllers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Tim Fischer also said that the third runway is environmentally more friendly than the present two runway set-up. The option to build the third runway because the present operation at Sydney—namely, the intersecting runway operation—was less environmentally friendly was clearly identified. That system distributed aircraft noise over more residents in Sydney than the parallel runway operation we have now does. Tim Fischer was correct. He recognised that at that time.

         Tim Fischer said that safety is of paramount importance. We have had lengthy debates about safety with respect to this issue. It has been said time and time again to remind the opposition that the position of the experts and the position accepted by the government is that parallel runway operations are inherently safer than intersecting operations. I will come back to that point in a moment.

         Tim Fischer said that the third decision to be made was that `the vital tourist industry must no longer be choked off through lack of sensible economic thinking'. That is precisely what the opposition's amendment will do. If you excise from the proposal the leasing of Sydney airport and delay it until such time as the east-west runway is reopened, you will strangle the process that is integral to making Sydney West airport operational. This has been made very clear. An essential part of the funding arrangements for the construction of Sydney West airport results from the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport.

         The opposition's amendment will destroy or certainly delay for a significant period of time the construction of Sydney West airport. That would have a significant impact on the tourist industry, but it would not be a beneficial impact. It could well have a disastrous impact. The minister announced in the budget that the construction of the two runways at Sydney West airport would be fast-tracked in order to make them operational in time for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The opposition is putting in jeopardy that very tight timetable. We cannot afford to have this sort of politicking, this sort of base political expediency, simply to save the member for Bennelong's neck. We cannot afford to have that sort of approach to such an important issue.

         The other effect is that the longer you delay, the longer you procrastinate, the longer you fool around with all of the issues relating to the construction of Sydney West airport, which is subject to a most rigorous EIS project, and the longer you subject the residents of Sydney to increased noise, the more pressure you will create with airlines and others seeking changes to such things as curfews at Mascot airport. We will not accept that. The history has been that, whenever the problems are exacerbated at Sydney airport, we immediately get calls for certain other changes to reduce congestion. That is why the construction of Sydney West airport is vital to this process.

         The other point that I wish to come back to is this issue of sharing the load, which seems to be at the heart of this proposal by the opposition to put a constraint upon the implementation of the leasing process by deferring the sale of Sydney airport until the east-west runway is opened. As I have said, I have heard Senator Parer and the Leader of the Opposition speak many times on this. But I actually looked at what was said by the first speaker for the opposition when this matter was debated in the other place, and that was Mrs Bishop, the member for Mackellar. On 17 October she said that privatisation, in respect of Kingsford Smith airport, should be delayed—

        I think it is incredible that the member for Mackellar would raise that issue and talk about the distribution of noise in a more equitable and fair manner across Sydney, because Mackellar has to be one of the few electorates in Sydney that has very little, if any, aircraft noise and has never had noise.

They actually have run the disgraceful line of argument that this is some political decision by the minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith, to take the noise away from his electorate. That is not actually correct. There is still noise over parts of Kingsford-Smith. In fact, the airport is in his electorate. But if you look at the electorates in Sydney that are affected—in addition to Bennelong, which is held by the Leader of the Opposition—all the other electorates are Labor electorates. Grayndler has the most intense noise and has always had it. Sydney, Lowe, and even the electorates of Blaxland—which has the Bankstown airport—and Parramatta have experienced increased noise. Of course the other area in Sydney, Kurnell, whilst in a Liberal electorate, has been a solid Labor voting area ever since I can remember.

         —The Greens are not inclined to vote in favour of these airport bills. We do not like the idea of privatising the management of airports in Australia. Australian airports, as represented by Sydney, for instance, which are managed by the Federal Airports Corporation, a public company, have been deemed to be fourth lowest in operating costs and charges in a study of 40 major international airports. The Federal Airport Corporation's productivity is higher than in Europe, and the Federal Airports Corporation is a profitable company.

         So why do we want to privatise airports? One justification is to eliminate the cross-subsidies the major airports pay to support the smaller regional and general airports. Why is that such a great goal? All that will do is make it harder to support smaller airports. It will shift the cost burden from international and major domestic route fliers to the taxpayer or to regional fliers and private planes if cost recovery avenues are pursued. Why is that such an important goal, especially since the cross-subsidies do not seem to make the major international airports excessively expensive or uncompetitive?

         Where are the guarantees that a private operator, in what will in effect become, in the case of Perth, a private monopoly, will operate in the best interests of the consumers? I do not see any indication that, in the history of market operations, private monopolies feel obliged to operate in that way; that is, to decrease charges and make sure the consumers are the beneficiaries of any lower charges. If it is a monopoly, it is certainly not in their interests to do so.

         As to the impact on consumers in major airports, what guarantee is there that elimination of cross-subsidies would make things cheaper? In other countries, including those with private airports, this does not seem to be the case. It may be a situation where the private company becomes more competitive because it is able to cream off the profits of government changing cross-subsidy policy. So they will have less costs and they will just pocket the rest.

         The benefits of privatisation are therefore dubious, except for the companies managing airports. To the government's credit, they seem to recognise that taking responsibility for airports out of the public domain means that public goals and wider considerations not having to do with bottom line figures will no longer be able to be pursued directly—I hope they were once. Accountability is no longer direct.

         The alternative is to regulate and specify what the duties, obligations and requirements are for private companies. These fall mainly in the social and environmental sphere. The fact that the government did not always consider these issues and that, if it ignored them, there were no guidelines or regulations to enforce them to act, means that having explicit guidelines may be considered to be a bonus. But it does not change the fact that the ability of the people to pursue broader agendas which include aspects of airport activities has been reduced. I will speak about it later because, if you are incorporating those rules into a lease condition, the communities are concerned that any changes to those planning arrangements that occurred at the time the lease was sold may well not be subject to any stringent guidelines if the community do not know about them.

         The cross-ownership or cross-control issues seem to have been resolved reasonably. There have also been attempts, through limits on foreign ownership, to limit the absolute foreign control implied in ownership of over 50 per cent of stock. However, I am not so certain that a simple restriction limiting foreign ownership to 49 per cent limits effective foreign control, or that effective control in this case has been considered or addressed as thoroughly as it has been for cross-control of multiple airports.

This is important since some states seem willing to override environmental regulations or requirements in the interests of commerce. The process of establishing the requirements, obligations and regulations seemed much less consultative than we would have liked.

         We do have concerns that community consultation is still seen by government as consultation with relevant state agencies and local government representatives or organisations rather than consultation with the community or community based non-government organisations. In particular, we would like a commitment from government to consult with local government NGOs on airport issues. Often these local environmental bodies are the people with the most expertise on the local environment. They include the naturalists who actually spend time learning about that environment and have some idea of what the local bush or swamp really is in terms of diversity of species, ecological interaction, seasonal significance and importance to migratory species.

         I would like to note how little is known about the Australian ecology. In Perth, at Murdoch University—and there are probably more ecologists per square inch at Murdoch University than anywhere else in Western Australia—which includes a small area of bush amidst extensive housing development, a PhD student in zoology recently discovered two new species of lizards in the course of his PhD research. The point to take away is how little we know and how significant remnant ecological islands can be.

         These remnant ecological islands are often not conservation reserves, often not intentionally biotic islands. They are often areas where the land use has meant they were difficult to develop or unable to be developed. For example, the old explosives reserve at Woodman's Point in Perth, because it was not regularly burnt over, is now the last example of the Rottnest cypress coastal environment that once was typical of the entire coastal region, the offshore islands and the Swan River foreshore. It only survived because you cannot have fires on explosives reserves. Likewise, the undiscovered lizard species at Murdoch probably only survived because the university had not had the desire or capital to develop its back acreage.

         Airports, with their buffer zones to avoid proximity to noise and potentially dangerous runways, are often similar biotic islands. Development of airports may then have great significance to species. Often, the local naturalists are the only ones who will have any real idea of this impact. The generalists of the state EPAs—that is when there are enough people to employ to be staff in EPAs—seldom have this sort of detailed knowledge. It is therefore extremely important to build in a liaison with local groups.

         It is also very important to have a direct link with the community. The voice of the community is increasingly being represented by—in terms of federal government communication—local government associations. The process is far from universal and far from reaching the stage where talking to a local council—that is if it gets to the local council—can be taken as the equivalent of talking to the local people. In Western Australia—and it might be the case in other states—the federal government only talks to the local government associations. Therefore, the communication is very indirect. So when we are told that Belmont council, Guildford council and so on have been advised, it has only been through the local government associations. That means the communication has been very indirect and not satisfactory, according to those councils.

         Even when there are circumstances where the federal government does finally talk to local councils, there are a number of councils which, I am sorry to say, are not used to making their decisions open. They are actually used to keeping decisions close to themselves. It is only when the community forces them to open up those decisions that they have some sort of process, if at all. So we have to deal with the fact that in many cases we are responding to the community, as in Sydney, but there are lots of places around Australia which may well be affected by these changes to the Federal Airports Corporation airports which do not even know what the implications are because their councils have not seen fit to talk to them. You might say that is a problem for the councils; I think it is a problem for the government. It means you are not yet aware of what a full consultation process is with those people who have a stake in the outcome.

This might seem strange, outrageous and revolutionary, but if what you are talking about is a massive change in Australia in terms of competition policy, for want of a better phrase, you have to start thinking about what the real processes are and use that community network to find out what the real impacts may be of these decisions.

         To sum up, we think the government has made an effort to set a regulatory framework for privatisation of airport management. We congratulate them for attempting the effort, while feeling that they could have done more. However, this effort is predicated on the fact that regulation is required because the airports will be leased. It sets the regulation as lease conditions but community participation requires notification and plans can change. If what is required is that those private bodies are required to present their plans to the community, there is not necessarily anything in here to the effect that if they change their plans they once again have to present that to the community for community participation.

         It sounds like it is not required, but how will the community ever challenge the level of environmental assessment if they do not know that something is happening? It might be that government, CEPA or whoever, in their wisdom or otherwise, decide that such a thing is not going to have great environmental significance. They might not be aware of the significance. It might be Aboriginal heritage, it might be environment, it might be community noise, inconvenience or safety. If the community have not had to be alerted to the nature of changes as they occur, the accountability enforcement may simply become a private matter between a private business enterprise and the Commonwealth government. Okay, you trust the government; however, there needs to be some realistic mechanism by which the community can feel confident that their level of community participation is a real one and that there is some requirement that major changes—even sometimes what might be considered by the Commonwealth to be minor changes—are advised. People must have a right to ask for an assessment and, as is often the case in environmental assessment, to challenge the level of assessment if it appears to be inappropriately low.

The fact is that leasing for a period of 99 years, as set out in the terms outlined in this bill, effectively means forever. It effectively means selling off.

         The problems that we currently have at Sydney are likely to be replicated elsewhere in Australia. That could include Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and many of the regional airports as decisions are made on the basis of short-term private interests. This has enormous implications for things such as volume of air traffic around Australia, flight paths to be used and whether a curfew is set in place. The list is endless.

         When an airport is privatised, it is inevitable that the interests of the private operator will overrule the public interest every single time. The government may well respond that there will be regulations in place to provide some form of protection but, as we all know, how much difference has the government's regulatory regime made to the communications area in this country? The reality is that just as private interests in that field reign supreme behind a veneer of government regulation, so too will private interests dominate in airport policy. Indeed, many of the problems now being experienced at Kingsford Smith airport are the result of successive governments—Labor and Liberal—allowing private interests to dominate, and hence compromise, government policy in the development of Sydney airport.

         The third runway saga, for instance, was primarily about both major parties giving into the demands of private air operators.

This point has been made before by the Democrats in debates on Sydney airport. It probably needs to be made again here. If more attention had been paid to due process and if the proper environmental safeguards had been adhered to, many of those problems which we are now experiencing at Sydney could have been foreseen and could ultimately have been prevented.

There is an expectation in Sydney that if the Sydney West airport ever comes on line, it will take over from Kingsford Smith as the main international and domestic airport for Sydney. Understandably, many residents fear that when KSA is privatised, there will be absolutely no incentive at all to have the site at Sydney West fully developed as Sydney's main point of entry for air traffic.

This is remarkable given that these days it is standard practice for organisations the size of the Federal Airports Corporation to be subject to environmental audits.

         The Democrats believe that given the size of the amount involved in the whole privatisation program, such an audit should be mandatory. In the case of Sydney airport, for instance, an environmental audit would also highlight the liabilities of Kingsford-Smith, in particular to potential litigation over airport and air traffic management, noise pollution, carcinogenic effects of aircraft activities and toxic contaminants as well as other forms of pollution in and around the vicinity of the airport. It is worth while noting that no Commonwealth legislation exists to deal with the hazardous wastes or pollution and, thus, it is likely that in this case New South Wales legislation would apply.

         Given that under the legislation an environmental master plan is required to be developed for each airport site, it would seem appropriate that prior to the sale or lease an environmental investigation should be carried out. Under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act an activity of this scale should undoubtedly require an environmental impact statement. The requirement for environmental management and environmental assessment cannot be understated. The Democrats fear that under the legislation the need for such environmental safeguards have been substantially overlooked.

         The Democrats are also concerned that these bills provide for significant controls, both environmental and corporate, to be included by way of regulation. There is considerable discretionary power vested in the minister. This makes a mockery of any public consultation process when it is possible to override or totally ignore for all practical purposes any public comment. The use of delegated legislation in this way to control environmental activities and to regulate and protect the environment runs against the trend of an open, transparent and public decision making process.

         Likewise, there is no provision in the legislation for any decision maker to determine which factors must be considered paramount. It is usual to provide a hierarchy of goals to enable decision makers to assess in an objective manner specific criteria. For example, there is no guidance as to whether commercial, environmental or social objectives take priority, but I bet I can guess which one always would. Inevitably, this will lead to confusion as to exactly how decisions are to be made under this legislation. The Democrats believe that the legislation should mandate that the minimisation of noise impacts is a primary consideration and should outweigh commercial interests. The absence of such safeguards represents a significant oversight.

         Another significant oversight in this legislation is that it does not make it clear that state laws have a role in the operation of Australia's airports. It has previously been demonstrated that while the courts believe that the Commonwealth has covered the field in environmental legislation, in practice, that is not the case. The Democrats believe that it is entirely inappropriate to legislate in a way so as to enable a commercial operator to ignore environmental considerations that are applicable to all other corporate enterprises. If competition is deemed desirable, it must be competition which is carried out on an equal basis.

         At the same time, the opposition's amendments are nothing short of remarkable, given their history of support for privatisation generally over the years. In their case they need to spell out fairly clearly what their intentions would be on privatising Australia's airports and, in particular, Kingsford-Smith, if they happen to win the next election. Given the opposition's history of support for privatisation over the years, it is perhaps not surprising that many Sydney residents concerned about the future of Kingsford-Smith are somewhat surprised by the opposition's proposed amendments. As I said during the recent debate on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, the electorate is not stupid.

         —The airports bills implement the decision of this Labor government to have a Clayton's sell-off of federal airports.

         This sell-off will be done in two stages, with the four major airports—Sydney, Melbourne Brisbane and Perth—leased in the first phase, a phase in which Sydney will be jointly leased with the new airport at Badgerys Creek, Sydney West airport. The government's intention is for the first stage to be completed by the end of 1996, with the second stage involving the remaining FAC airports taking place throughout 1997-98.

         I return to the fundamental question: why is the privatisation of airports deemed okay by this government and this opposition? Virtually all major airports overseas have traditionally been publicly owned and operated. That is a fact, and Australians should be asking why we are deviating from this. The government has tried to dress up its decision to sell airport leases as a major micro-economic reform, but we know it is not. We know what it is about. It is about raising some quick dough by a government that wants to carry on with this psychology of a surplus.

         I suspect, though, that we may end up selling our airports for a price a lot less than the net present value of retaining them—a concern echoed by public finance expert Professor Bob Walker and by FAC managing director, Bill Swingler. Last year, Mr Swingler predicted that the sale could raise as little as $1.5 billion—$1.2 billion less than that predicted at the time by Treasury. This would follow the less than expected return on the Qantas sale—a sale regarded as of almost fire sale proportions by former Qantas chief Jim Leslie.

         Let us think about the rhetoric here because the reality in the case of airports is that the scope for competition between Sydney and Melbourne airports or between Sydney and Perth airports is very remote. Not just is disaggregation against the world best practice of keeping airports together in a network; it is against the advice of the FAC. Mr Swingler scoffed at the competition argument, arguing that there is no competition between airports because people fly to destinations because of location attractions—not just the airport. That is just plain obvious, particularly in Australia.

         The FAC is a very profitable GBE. This year it recorded a record profit of $128 million, Sydney airport recording $69 million; Melbourne, $52.3 million; and Brisbane, $43.5 million. By the standards of the Stock Exchange, its earnings over assets ratio is up there among the top three or four firms, ahead of the Big Australian, BHP, and ahead of News Corporation. Its productivity, measured by the passenger per employee ratio, increased by 14 per cent in 1994-95 following the 15 per cent improvement the previous year. Its fees are the fourth lowest of a world representative listing of 40 major airports, with increases kept below the CPI over the past five years. So the FAC is doing a pretty good job. Who should benefit from that? Mr Swingler asked the question last year: if an organisation is achieving the shareholders' objectives, why sell it? Australians, as shareholders, are entitled to still ask that question.

         Why indeed sell it? Not just are airports a natural monopoly being run fairly efficiently in the public sector; airports are by their nature incredibly influential on the quality of life of nearby communities. Communities should be entitled to express their views on demand management at airports—on curfews, on usage, on tourism promotion, on the balance between general aviation and commercial aviation, and so on. The running of an airport every day requires a long string of decisions made in the public interest. It is impossible to divorce the commercial aspect of running an airport from the public policy aspect. For more than almost any other utility, the Democrats believe this is the case. In short, there is a good, long list of reasons why airports should stay in public hands and few good reasons why they should be in private sector hands.

That is not to disparage the private sector but that is to point out a few obvious things. There are no market forces to constrain the private sector on airports.

If we are talking about infrastructure development, over the years the taxpayer has contributed.

         —I rise tonight to debate this government's failure to effectively address the problem of youth suicide in this country. The Keating government is showing a callous disregard for mental health and the social crisis as a result that is facing this nation. This is the other disgrace of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence—a disgrace that relates fairly and squarely to her responsibilities as minister for health in this country.

         This minister has set back progress on addressing the problem of youth suicide by years. The allocation of $12.9 million over four years is inadequate by any measure. The sum total of this government's initiatives in the past year is absolutely pathetic. They have announced the expenditure of the money twice. They have sacked one advisory committee dealing with suicide prevention and replaced it with another. That is some record in the last year! All of this mismanagement has occurred while the nation faces economic loss and people face great personal pain because of the very high rate of suicide, particularly youth suicide, in Australia.

         The response to this crisis by Minister Lawrence and the Keating government is an absolute disgrace. The cold statistics of suicide in Australia scream out for robust action. The problem has been documented by the minister's own department of human services in a paper called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Youth suicide in Australia: a background monograph 1995
         </emphasis>
         . This paper indicates that Australia is recording one of the highest rates of suicide in the world. The youth suicide rate has doubled under this government in the last 10 years. We now rank in the three highest rates of youth suicide in the industrialised world.

         World Health Organisation figures show Australia in 1993 as having the fourth highest rate, on a list of 14 countries, for youth suicide deaths among young males between the ages of 15 and 24. Some estimates place suicides in Australia at 3,000 a year. It is a more common death for young Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 than road accidents. There is said to be, according to the minister's own department, 30 to 40 suicide attempts for every actual suicide amongst young people. That is around 100,000 attempts per annum. One hundred thousand young people in Australia try to take their lives every year. Young males living in rural and remote areas of Australia have a consistently higher rate than the rest.

         Yet what is the government's response to this? The response is $12.9 million over four years on suicide prevention. Compare this with the $800,000 bill—and still rising—for the legal fees on a private matter for the health minister, Dr Carmen Lawrence, that has absolutely no connection with her ministerial duties. I think the comparison of those two figures puts into some perspective the priorities of this Keating government. Self-interest is obviously reigning supreme in the Keating government.

         The Lawrence blueprint for kerbing this unacceptably high rate of youth suicide is full of holes. It is a deceptive and incompetent approach. Minister Crowley, representing Dr Lawrence in this chamber, outlined these inadequate policies in full detail. Let us examine what information Senator Crowley provided the Senate on 25 October this year on behalf of Minister Lawrence. We are told that the youth suicide prevention initiative was going to cost $12.9 million, the initiative commenced at the beginning of the current financial year and the money is to be spent over four years. This financial year $1.3 million will be spent. What a pathetic figure for the scale of this problem.

         If you look more closely at the detail, you can see that the Keating government and Minister Lawrence are peddling a dishonest and ineffective policy. Of the $12.9 million trumpeted by Dr Lawrence only $1.3 million will be spent initiating several projects in this 1995-96 financial year. We are told that the projects are national demonstration projects that will be thoroughly evaluated before dissemination across Australia. We should have best practice models for suicide prevention in place now ready for implementation. This government have been in power for 13 years, yet they are setting up demonstration projects in this major area of social concern in Australia. This crisis will continue on and lives will be lost while the government just tends to dally with these sorts of activities that are greatly delaying what should be an effective range of strategies.

         Let us have a look at the statement, and I refer the Senate particularly to the following aspects. The statement says that there will be support for general practitioners and community health personnel to identify, refer and treat young people at risk of suicide and that this project is currently proceeding to tender and will be advertised in November—a pilot project that still has not even got off the ground. This pattern is repeated throughout the minister's statement. Let us deal with another one. It says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It goes on to deal with intervention programs for persons with suicide tendencies and says that this project will be advertised for tender in 1996. This statement tells us that there is planning for a youth suicide strategy, but it has been greatly delayed under this minister. We have the worst suicide rate in the world, and after 13 years the government is still considering its strategy.

         The Senate should condemn this minister, Dr Lawrence, for failing to note the contents of the NHMRC expert group report drafted in October 1994. Professor Peter Baume and a panel of specialists in the field of suicide prevention drafted this report and the minister at that point just ignored its contents. Lawrence said that the NHMRC dissolved the committee, and she ignored their recommendations. Valuable and precious time was lost between that point and now, when they are calling for tenders of particular projects. How many lives have been lost during that time and how many families have been devastated by the effects of youth suicide in Australia while this government dallies?

         Now the government has formed another youth suicide prevention group. It has been formed to inquire and bring down another report. What will be its fate? Will it suffer the same fate as the Baume committee? This minister has now set up two committees and announced the same allocation of money twice. Her record on this is appalling. Her plan for the future is too little too late. Suicide is costing us, in money terms, $100 million a year, but the personal misery is incalculable. Lawrence has failed the people of Australia by her incompetent handling of this major health crisis.

         —I rise tonight to express my concern to the Senate about the increasing use by governments of gambling as a means of raising revenue—firstly, because I believe it is a most inequitable form of taxation and, secondly, because of the social costs involved. I have collected a large amount of information and I want to quote from a number of sources about this issue. The first source I want to quote from is the Uniting Church's Victorian synod statement on gambling which raises a lot of concerns particularly about the Melbourne casino. It says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australians lose around $6 billion each year on gambling and this is on the increase. There is little doubt that the development of the new casino in Melbourne will contribute to this increase. For some people the casino will mean enhanced entertainment opportunities at little financial cost, for others it may mean a new job, for others it may mean entry into organised crime. For a growing number of others it will mean poverty, loss of dignity and immeasurable hardship and suffering, not only for the gamblers themselves but also for their dependents.
       </para>
       <para>
        The church says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our response is shaped by our understanding of God's will for all humanity that people may live in dignity and wholeness, in harmonious relationship with God and reconciled to each other. Much of the Protestant churches' teaching on gambling has centred around the question of stewardship. Wesley's sermon on money in which his followers were told to "work all they can, save all they can and give all they can" gave no place for playing with money and placed individual industry and compassion firmly together. Gambling is not only wasteful of the gifts God has given but indeed it robs the poor and the needy of resources which could readily be given them to alleviate their circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The uncritical dependence of the government on gambling as a source of revenue raising with scant attention or concern for the social consequences is indicative of a value base which places economic growth above social justice. It is an ideology which permeates all facets of society and is antithetical to the gospel.

         I conclude by saying that this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet. It is an issue which governments ought to take seriously.

He has called time and again for the development of an ecologically sustainable management strategy for our forests and for the forest product industry. He has called on the government time and again to remove barriers to investing in plantations and to retain and expand the tax exempt status for recycled paper products. He has called on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories ((Senator Faulkner) to enforce the national forest policy statement's moratorium clause. Indeed, we are still waiting for that, as that clause has not been enforced.

         The Democrats have called for the urgent development of a comprehensive national reserve program. John has been at the forefront of trying to establish this and ensuring that that it is based on a scientific assessment of the range and types of areas which need to be protected. In 1993 John reaffirmed the Democrats' support for an independent role for the Australian Heritage Commission. He called on the government to redefine its forestry policy and the role of the Australian Heritage Commission. He also called on the federal government to follow its own national forest policy and act to ensure areas of high conservation value were protected from logging while the national reserve system was being established. Last year he called on the government to stop logging the Huon and Picton valleys, which was further degrading world heritage areas. Shoalwater Bay has been another area on which John has spent a lot of time and energy. The day before the final report was released by the commission, John—with Peter Garrett—presented a documentary on Shoalwater Bay to a media conference in Canberra after an extensive visit of that area.

         John called for greater scrutiny of development applications in sensitive marine and coastal environments. He highlighted the impact of fishing, tourism, coastal development, mariculture, agriculture and other activities in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and urged the federal government time and time again to maintain its responsibility to the marine and coastal environments.

        On the Daintree, John welcomed the launch of the Daintree rescue campaign and called for a well funded government package to protect the Daintree rainforest. But he also noted with concern the Queensland government's failure to provide matching funding for the Daintree rescue package in its state budget last year, and he criticised the federal government for making the rescue package contingent upon funds from the state, calling it a haphazard approach to the environment.

         Water quality and water usage issues have been high on John's agenda. He has continually criticised the federal government for its failure to honour its promises to actually do something to clean up the Murray-Darling river system. He pointed out that research demonstrated that timber harvesting in eucalypt forests can reduce water production from those forests by as much as 50 per cent. He asked whether Commonwealth government approval of export woodchip licences was in breach of section 100 of the Australian constitution, which covers actions by the Commonwealth which impact upon water production.

Again in 1993 and on through 1994, he condemned the government for letting Australia become the only country in the world to seek an exemption to the London dumping convention to allow us to continue to dump industrial waste in the ocean.

I suppose it is typical of the man and his interests that he should use his very last opportunity in question time today, in the aftermath of the triumph of APEC, to put a question without notice to me asking me whether the expected $3 billion worth of increased farm exports to Australia arising from the anticipated agreements are going to be ecologically sustainable and whether any consideration has been given to increased greenhouse gas emissions arising as a result of the increased trade in bulk goods.

But it has been typical of Senator Coulter here. We have had our differences at question time. I cannot think of anything very much on which we have agreed but, nonetheless, it has been quite enjoyable sparring over the eight years of his presence here.

So long as I am not running the risk of this being taken as a condolence motion rather than a valedictory, I would like to say a little about John Coulter's background because it is very much a part of understanding the man that he is and the senator that he has been. He was born in Perth in 1930, attending the Nedlands Primary School, Wesley College and then the University of WA and the University of Adelaide, from which he graduated in medicine. After undertaking his medical residency at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and spending a short period in private practice, he became a medical resident at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide.

         It was during his subsequent career of over 20 years as a medical researcher that Dr Coulter really did make a significant and pioneering contribution on matters which he has pursued in this place with great vigour, in particular the dangers to humans of agricultural chemicals. It is well known that his commitment to speaking out on this issue—a matter about which he did feel then and continues to do today so strongly—in effect inhibited his advancement and, maybe, even put an end to his career with that institute.

On a number of occasions, he was a councillor of the Australian Conservation Foundation.

It is fair to say that when I was first elected to the Senate you were the leader of your party. It is no wonder that I did not really have very much to do with you in the first 18 months that I was in this place. It was only after the last election that I found myself working very closely with you on the two standing committees, one which you chaired and one which I chaired, and on the select committee.

         One of the more satisfying aspects of committee work is the opportunity to get to know and understand senators from other parties involved in politics in this place. The time spent together, particularly when travelling on committee hearings, allows for the sharing of ideas, thoughts and views. Senator Coulter is a very willing sharer. Your company was very much appreciated on those trips.

         We seem to spend so much time in this chamber concentrating on our differences. Out of this place, we have a chance to share our common beliefs. It is amazing just how much we agree on when we get the chance to sit down and talk to each other on a private basis or when the pressures of this chamber are not involved in those discussions. Certainly I appreciated the opportunities I had to sit and talk with you. I know that it was very wet one night in Melbourne when I spent about an hour under a tram shelter while you had an umbrella and I did not. Apart from that, I remember those times. I certainly enjoyed your company while I was involved on that committee work with you.

         Senator Coulter is a man of integrity, passion, conscience and genuine goodwill. His academic knowledge and experience and his love of science and the environment are well known. They have been spoken about by other speakers here tonight. I reiterate all those comments because I know how much we have appreciated particularly your knowledge of science when those of us who are not so academically qualified in that field have found ourselves at public hearings and questions have been asked about which we have had no idea and answers have been given about we have had even less an idea. You have no idea how much we have appreciated your presence. I particularly remember the CSIRO inquiry and your input into that.

I know that you will be sorry not to be able to complete the inquiry into marine pollution on the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee, where you were responsible for drawing up the terms of reference. You initiated a very important inquiry that will probably go on for quite some time. I know how disappointed you must be at not being able to complete that inquiry, because it is one that you have been talking about for a long time. Only now has the committee had the chance to be able to go ahead with that inquiry. I think of how you sat through all those soccer hearings, being such an ardent soccer fan, to eventually get to an inquiry that you were interested in.

Each of the parties was unanimously concerned about the hazards those tailings dams do present to the environment, to the fauna of the areas, and about the need for them to be monitored and for the standards of best practice to be implemented by the mining industry in this regard.

I noticed a subtle tendency creeping in as well that when Senator Kemp, in his role as shadow minister for the environment, had any detailed questions he did not even do me the courtesy of mentioning my name but simply asked you, Senator Coulter. I was quite relieved because if he had not I would have stood up and asked you.

It was particularly awkward for the Labor Party that evening. All the people in the other place were waiting for all these bills to come down from the Senate so that they could go home and close up with that particular session. I stood up and gave an explanation of what I thought had occurred. I am not sure it was a very good explanation but, from memory, the Labor Party was very keen to accept that explanation. But, Senator Coulter, you tricked us all. You moved that I be suspended from the chamber. As a result, after a somewhat vigorous debate, I was then asked to leave.

After a senator is excluded from the chamber, it is very unusual for that senator to be asked back.

         In his dealings with his opponents, Senator Coulter has been honest, even if he has not agreed with them. I know Senator Coulter has had his good times and his bad times in this chamber, but I do not think anyone here would have felt that Senator Coulter was not acting in a way which was integral to his own beliefs and values. I cannot draw on a widespread sharing of committee work with Senator Coulter. In fact, I am not too sure that we have ever served on a committee together.

As Senator Chamarette reminded us, a couple of the questions went to you. I am not saying I received answers that I was completely on top of, but it did show on that particular occasion the strong commitment you have to particular issues and the science background you bought to this chamber which will certainly be missed.

He has served the Democrats not just as a senator, even though that takes a great toll, as I know, but as the deputy leader and the leader, which both, as other people in this chamber can attest, also take a great toll. Before that he was a medical practitioner, a medical researcher and a university academic. They are the things I know about. There are probably more. John was a founder of the conservation and environment movements in Australia. He is well known for his work, particularly at the ACF, where he was a councillor for many years.

There were all kinds of things.

I guess that in a way we were holding the line against most other people who seemed to be looking only at how much money Australia could make out of SADC.

         Senator Coulter will not know this, but I was aware of his impact on national affairs well before he would ever have been aware of me. It is a long and complicated story as to why that is the case, but let me shortly tell it. My father was a waterside worker from Port Adelaide and he transferred to Fremantle—I think this was in the very early 1970s—and rented a room in a house on Stirling Highway at Cottesloe, which was a house of Dr Coulter's mother, and rented the same room in which Dr Coulter as a younger man had resided.

         My father, who had a thirsty knowledge for anything of a political nature, had some discussions about Dr Coulter's career then, and his career then was of a person making an early and fundamental impact in the environmental debate in Australia, specifically in South Australia. When my parents returned to Adelaide, they followed Dr Coulter's career and kept me advised of it and, when he was elected to the Senate and I was elected to the Senate, they followed both our careers.

Therefore, I was aware of many of your early achievements as an environmental advocate in South Australia and only regretted that you chose the Australian Democrats, not the Australian Labor Party, to pursue those objectives politically.

I do not think being an elected representative means that you have a political career; it means you have a privilege to put forward the views that you hold and the views of the people who have appointed you to express them in a public domain. I think all of us have an obligation to pursue our political ideals, both inside and outside of politics.

In terms of what I have seen on the science front, there is no doubt, Senator Coulter, that you have a strong commitment to science. It is a commitment more to the understanding and creation of new knowledge about science, to pure science, than it is to any other part of it; to understand the nature of things and of the world and to pursue that in order to understand the meaning of things more profoundly, to do that with a certain joy and the happiness of discovery. I would like to think that as a science minister I might grudgingly perhaps make you proud of some of the changes we would bring to this policy for the government, but that is a matter for another time and another place. I do understand your commitment on this front. I commend you for it. I regret the reasons for your decision to retire but I wish you happiness and I wish you well in your retirement.

In the first contest I had to be elected here in 1977 I was successful by only 1,000 votes over your colleague the Hon. Ian Gilfillan. I came here; that Democrat did not. The second contest, a month later, was as to who would replace Senator Steele Hall.

         I first met Senator Coulter 23 years ago when I attended a number of meetings of the Town and Country Planning Association. Our mutual friend, Ralph Middenway, who I still see quite often, encouraged me to take an interest in the flora and fauna of the countryside in South Australia, and also our urban and regional planning. At the time I was elected urban chairman of the Liberal Party—it was the first executive office I held—in 1973. As urban chairman, my first project was to see an end to the then Dunstan Labor dream of Monarto. He was proposing a city which I thought was abysmally planned, in the wrong place and not properly worked out. Fortunately, that project of mine, joined by other allies in the Town and Country Planning Association, led to the demise of the Monarto concept and we do not see a city, not even one building, at that site which then Premier Dunstan outlined.

Certainly, the impression that I gained was that it is no good having any kind of trade—that is as I perceived it from Senator Coulter—because that will expend energy, which will lead to a greenhouse effect that is negative, and it is much better if we just live in our own little environments and not have the exchange of goods across the world.

         John and I are a fair way apart in many ways: with me being fairly casual and not too fussed about details, with a general knowledge about nothing in detail and a couple of university degrees in arts; with John being a specialist, a scientist with precise detailed knowledge—a formidable array and amazing breadth of knowledge—and a person who enjoys stretching his own frontiers of knowledge. When I say `enjoys' it, you should have seen him in Papeete with the telsat satellite telephone. I knew that you had to just wiggle it around a bit and point it up to the stars. There is John—he could have had an azimuth and a calculator, the details had to be precise—but when he turned it on, click, there we were straight through. It was fairly symptomatic of John's relationship with me. Often with information technology, computers and such like, I have had a bit of an idea about how to get the agriculture direction right. But then John comes along with the precise knowledge that has enabled me over a number of years to get the eventual picture in a much more precise and useful way.

         I had several introductions to this John Coulter. One was in 1988 when he came to Hobart as my guest. I had not really worked out much about him. I think I had seen him once or twice in South Australia. He came to Hobart at my invitation to enlighten us a little more about the emergence of this greenhouse theory. Again, I had a fairly agricultural understanding of the general implications of it. I stood up at the University of Tasmania and introduced him to an audience by saying that he was a bit older than me and that he knew a bit more about the environment and stuff like that. Then I had to sit back and get overwhelmed with this incredible detailed knowledge and a scientific expose of what it involved.

         Then, having been a little embarrassed by that introduction, some couple of years later I was with several other Democrats essentially as John's guests in a houseboat on the Murray and we were returning to port. I did not quite know where we were—I knew we were on the Murray—but it was getting very dark. There was Coulter at the wheel. Here he was demonstrating his immense breadth of knowledge and practical skills because he is a practical man. I do not know how we got through these guideposts and against the current and docked at the port, but we had John Coulter at the wheel using the stars, the currents, the satellites and some sort of mental logarithmic calculations.

I remind the Senate that I was at the university in the late 1940s with Bob Hawke and, believe it or not, we were both members of the student Christian movement at the time. Although John Woodley mentioned my lack of theistic attachment at the moment, that was not always the case. While Bob Hawke and I took somewhat different paths, we both lost our belief in God. Nonetheless, as John Woodley reminded me, I have retained a very strong ethical and moral commitment to those issues that I feel are important.

Not surprisingly, some young people are some of the most disillusioned with the political process. Disillusionment catalyses disillusionment through discouraging quality entrants into our parliament. It is a dangerous trend, and it is already well under way. I believe we must all do more to remove the impediments in the way of our gifted young entering a political carer.

         My Democrat parliamentary colleagues have been a small team throughout my time in the Senate, but I believe we have discharged our responsibility to the people of Australia with care and concern for the three broad principles that underpin all Democrat policy: ecological sustainability, social justice and equity and democratic process. We have had our differences but in the Democrats we have a conscience vote on every issue. This is one of the prime reasons I joined the Democrats and not either the Labor or coalition parties.

Many of you in the Labor and coalition parties will have been discomforted from time to time by divisions that I have called when I have known your private views.

         In summary of my eight years in the Senate, I make two points. Firstly, because of my activity through the conservation movement and in various educational capacities through several decades, those who elected me—and this I think has been borne out by the speeches tonight—knew the values I would carry to this office. I believe I have continued to espouse those values and to hold true to those values and therefore discharge my responsibility to the electors of South Australia as a representative of those values. Secondly—and several people have presaged this tonight—as regards moving the juggernaut of government closer to the adoption of those values and the implementation of them, I must confess to being an almost total failure.

         When I entered the Senate and made my first speech—they were still called maiden speeches at that stage—I outlined, and I think this was also mentioned earlier tonight, the failure of presently used economic indexes to measure the right things, the inclusion of costs as benefits in the measurement of GDP, for example—I will not go into this now, but some time I must take Senator Baden Teague aside and explain in simple terms what I mean by that—and the absence of a national capital account which gives a totally misleading impression of becoming richer by squandering natural capital and turning it into cash, cash which is then frittered away without turning it back into capital.

         I pointed to the way in which these distorted indexes were seriously misleading and to the way in which the correction of these distortions would indicate different and more reliable paths to be followed, the paths toward ecological sustainability and a more humane society. After the speech, Fred Chaney, who was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate at that time, came over to me with his congratulations, which as you all know is usual, and said, `A most unusual maiden speech. I don't think I understood it, but if I had I think I would have disagreed with it.'

         Nothing has changed. We still hear all our senior ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), daily, talk about sustainable economic growth, without realising that that term is an oxymoron to beat all oxymorons. Growth, as growth of GDP, is measured exponentially. Sustainability refers to ecological sustainability and the ecology of the planet is finite. It is quite simply proven that economic growth can only continue at the expense of either the environment or equity between people. Either way economic growth is not sustainable. But then whoever noticed economists or ministers wedded to the ideology of economic rationalism looking at the empirical evidence. To the rationalist economist the real world is a special case. Ignoring the real and empirical, we are destined to make the same mistakes over and over again.

         There's the story of the Prime Minister, the deputy and the Treasurer hiring a light plane to go kangaroo shooting one weekend. Before the plane took off the pilot explained that it was only a small plane and that they could only bring back one large kangaroo. Come Sunday afternoon each minister has shot a large kangaroo and they prevail upon the pilot to load all three. The plane limps into the air and then crashes. The Prime Minister struggles out of the wreckage saying, `Where, where are we?' The Treasurer then fights his way out of the debris and says, `About 100 metres from where we were last year!'

         Economic commentators and journalists compound the problem by lack of publicly expressed alternative analyses. By and large, they have accepted economic rationalist language and analysis without looking independently at the empirical evidence. How many television interviews have you seen in which the discussion is centred on the rate of economic growth required to reduce unemployment by a certain percentage? On this, the empirical evidence is clear. There is no relation whatsoever between the rate of economic growth and the reduction in the rate of unemployment.

         To give you a few figures: between 1970 and 1992 the US had a 76 per cent growth of GDP and a 45 per cent growth in employment. While France had a 75 per cent growth of GDP, almost identical to the United States, it had only a seven per cent growth in employment. Spain had the second highest economic growth of GDP of all European countries at 93 per cent, but employment actually fell by two per cent.

         One of the most depressing aspects of the economic debate is that most of the journalists who interview and write about these matters have become enmeshed in the same false paradigm that guides government policy. Only last week I watched in growing anger an interview by Paul Lyneham with the federal Treasurer (Mr Willis) about the percentage point differences that the economy would need to grow to achieve certain employment benefits. I wanted to scream at Paul Lyneham, `Tell the Treasurer it's all a load of cow manure. Present him with some data from the real world.'

         The economic rationalist has no clothes. Unfortunately, we are still at the stage at which very few are pointing to his nakedness. Most, with far more vivid imagination than I, still clothe the rationalist emperor in golden raiment and bow down before him. Question: how many economic rationalists does it take to change a light globe? Answer: none, if the light globe needed changing market forces would already have done it. Alternatively, question: how many economic rationalists does it take to change a light globe? Answer: none; see, it's getting brighter. It's really getting brighter, isn't it? See. Don't you believe it's getting brighter?

We are still in the process of turning market economies into market societies in which every transaction, every act of social intercourse, must take place within the nexus of cash and of self-interested individualism.

         The dominance of economic rationalism within government policy also guarantees that Australia has failed to turn towards ecological sustainability. We are still among the world's worst greenhouse gas polluters and the policies now being put in place will do nothing to alter that situation. As we heard today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), and as has been mentioned again this evening, the deliberations which concluded in the APEC agreement just signed took no account of environmental considerations. Yet by 2010 we shall certainly be in a period of climate change. Governments around the world will be taking urgent action, and the context for trade will be totally different from today.

         A solar hot water service on the roof of every house in this country would meet our 20 per cent reduction target and at the same time give us a magnificent manufacturing base to make a big difference in the countries to our north. What the government has done in this very simple example is paltry and tokenistic compared with what could and should be done. Again I disagree entirely with Senator Baden Teague. It is not a matter of going back to living in caves. There is a lot of very exciting science and technology which we are not properly developing.

         We continue to lose topsoil to erosion faster than natural processes can replace it. Salinisation continues to spread. Pollution of our water courses continues apace and rare and endangered species become rarer and more endangered. Yet government ignorance assumes that we will continue to increase agricultural production. Not only is scientific advice being ignored, but the scientific effort required to understand these threatening processes and methods for their reversal is also being steadily undermined, as is our basic science research effort.

         I would like to pick up on something that Senator Harradine said. No person, no group, no political party has any understanding of or commitment to sustainability unless it or they develop a population policy. The population size is one half of the equation describing the human impact on the environment. Only the Democrats, among the Australian political parties, has a population policy; and it is built squarely on the principle of ecological sustainability.

         I have had some minor successes, such as the $36 million for fuel ethanol which my colleague Senator Bell mentioned earlier. That is $36 million for research from the bounty in that area. This work has the potential to provide renewable fuel for transport, to give Australia a new and economically very profitable lead in this area and to save Australia an enormous import bill for petroleum, as well as very substantially reducing the pollution from oil consumption. But these successes aside, the broad picture is that Australia is still heading in the wrong direction, destroying the environment of our descendants and dissipating the natural wealth of our country in unsustainable ways.

        (1) Carbon dioxide is a product of the combustion of fossil fuels and has not been controlled as an air pollutant. The intention of Australian Design Rule 37/01 is to limit evaporative and exhaust emissions from motor vehicles in order to reduce air pollution.

        The gases targeted under ADR 37/01 are known as criteria pollutants and comprise unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. These gases, as well as the secondary pollutants they create, for example ground level ozone, are subject to ambient air quality guidelines promulgated by the National Health and Medical Research Council and by agencies such as the World Health Organisation.

A draft discussion paper has been passed to the Department of Industrial Relations, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for comment. Initial responses have been received and further development and consultation is now under way. Different models for guaranteeing a return to employment are being considered, but some form of overarching legislative provision is likely to be included.

        The Government's policy position on this issue is already clear and unequivocal. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1994 provides, in essence, that the trustees of superannuation funds are responsible for the investment of the superannuation savings they administer, having regard to the best interests of their fund members. The Government has no intention of altering its position on this issue.
