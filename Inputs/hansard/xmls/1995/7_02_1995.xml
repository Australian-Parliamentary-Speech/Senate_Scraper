         —My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer again to the electoral fraud perpetrated on the Australian people at the last election when Mr Keating promised the l-a-w tax cuts, no new taxes, the removal of all pensioners from the income tax system, and non child-care cash rebates for all. Now that the true deceit of these promises has been laid bare for all Australians to witness, will you rule out the introduction of any new taxes such as a carbon tax, a hotel tax, an airline tax and a further rise in personal tax through the introduction of compulsory superannuation payments?

         —The government has made it perfectly clear, through statements by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, that we do not rule out certain revenue options. We are not in the business of identifying with any precision at all at this stage what those particular options might be. Obviously we want to keep any taxation increases to an absolute minimum, for reasons that have been spelled out fully and thoroughly by the Prime Minister. We want to place the primary emphasis on outlays reduction and we will do so.

Total tax revenue as a proportion of GDP in 1992 was 28.5 per cent for Australia; it was 29.4 per cent for both Japan and the United States, and 35.2 for the United Kingdom. That is looking at the total tax burden.

         If one wants to talk about the tax burden, I think it is appropriate to contemplate what exactly was the record of this particular lot opposite when they last had a chance themselves to do something about the tax burden on the Australian people. If we look at government revenue now under Labor as a percentage of GDP, we see that the figure is 24 per cent. If we look at government revenue in its totality under Howard as Treasurer in the period 1982-83, we find a figure of 26.1 per cent.

         Tax revenues as a percentage of GDP under Howard in 1982-83 was 24 per cent; under Labor at the moment it is 21.8 per cent.

The company tax rate under Howard was 46 per cent; under us, 33 per cent. The taxation of dividends—double taxed under Howard; there is an imputation system under us. This is the reality of our commitment to reduce taxes. It is reduced as a proportion of total revenue. The taxation percentage itself is reduced. Every marginal rate is reduced.

You imposed a tax system which was a burden upon business. We have relieved that burden. You imposed a tax system that was a burden upon ordinary taxpaying people of this country.

The point is that there is one tax promise this government will keep, and that is the one that is now going to increase taxes. What Australians want to know for the present and the future—those in small business and those paying mortgages—is what new taxes will they have to pay and at what rate will they have to pay them.

We have maintained a scenario of high growth and low inflation, which is indeed an outstanding achievement in terms of the world investment community. We also have high growth in jobs—nearly half a million jobs. We will deliver on our election promise of creating half a million jobs one year before our term is due to expire.

         Investment itself is growing in Australia, as we know. The 14 1/2 per cent forecast in the budget is now around 25 per cent—an outstanding performance. That the tax levels in Australia are the second lowest in the whole of the OECD, certainly lower than the tax burden in the United States, is another reason why investment is flowing into this economy. These good, positive selling points for why foreign investment should come here are supported not only by the government in this investment office but also by a whole raft of Australian businesses who support us in these endeavours.

         What we have now is a situation where many of our forests have been disturbed in one way or another. Of course, many of our forests have been lost forever. That is the reality. That is the situation we face. It is not necessarily an insurmountable problem because there is no reason—none at all—why areas that have been disturbed in some way cannot be considered for inclusion in a reserve system.

         The Commonwealth is aware of a range of inclusions in the 1995 coupes. In most cases they represent a very insignificant percentage of a coupe, a very small amount of area in a coupe. For example, the one that has been used often, whether it be a powerline or a small gravel quarry or the like, is very small in terms of its area in a large coupe. Of course, that does not suggest in any way that the remainder of the coupe does not have high conservation values and is not worthy of protection.

Your answer, Minister, four minutes worth, was nothing to do with what was contained in your letter where you tried to justify the inclusion of compartment 2331 as old-growth forest because it had something to do with the protection of arboreal mammals. I would have thought you would at least be able to regurgitate that one. But I ask you: doesn't the national forestry statement define old-growth forest as forest that is ecologically mature and that has been subjected to negligible unnatural disturbance, such as logging, roading and clearing? How can that definition possibly include 69 of the 249 listed compartments in New South Wales which have been roaded and logged at least twice? Why don't you come clean and admit that in your desperation to play to the Green gallery you have simply managed to drop the ball and score one of the best own goals in recent history?

         The perception, however, still seems to exist amongst certain sections of the community that rain immediately puts an end to drought and that the federal government's drought assistance scheme finishes at the same time. In both cases, that is not correct. One of the important changes that was made in the drought package that was brought down last year is that a statutory period of six months was introduced so that the exceptional circumstances payments will continue after the exceptional circumstances declarations are lifted. Of course, farmers will have access to interest rate subsidies under the normal rural adjustment scheme beyond that.

         There are also misconceptions—and this must be said—on the farming side of the community about eligibility for exceptional circumstances.

         At the ABARE conference this morning, there was an organised protest—and fair enough—by members of the New South Wales Farmers Association; the reason I know that is that the conference labels on their coats said that. The protest was about why farmers in the Hay region—they were from Hay—were not getting this payment. I said that it was because they had not been considered eligible and I would double-check it. When I did double-check it, I found out that not only had RASAC not recommended it but the New South Wales Farmers Association itself, in all of the submissions it made to me, and the New South Wales government, in the two formal submissions it made to me, did not recommend that exceptional circumstances should be extended to Hay or to the farmers in the southern region.

Does the minister believe that Australia has ever really pursued or campaigned for a process of self-determination for the people of East Timor? Will Australia now move to repeal the 1989 Timor Gap treaty, to genuinely work towards a process of self-determination for the people of East Timor and, when that is achieved, to negotiate a Timor Gap treaty which would give a fair share of the profits back to the Timorese people?

         —There is a lot of misunderstanding about the concept of the right to self-determination, which it might be helpful for me to clarify at the outset. The right of self-determination of peoples is recognised in general terms in the UN charter in articles 1 and 55, but I think it is fair to say that it has always been a very imprecise concept. It is presently subject to quite a lot of international rethinking, particularly because of the proliferation of claims to self-determination by national entities within larger sovereign states, as distinct from the more familiar colonial context. It is worth acknowledging that at the outset.

         The question of what self-determination means in any particular case and how it might be exercised in any particular context is a matter to be pursued by the United Nations. There are a number of UN resolutions on this subject, and they make it clear that self-determination can involve a number of quite different outcomes, including of course the emergence of an independent state, but also integration, or some form of association within or with another state, or a degree of autonomy within another state. I think that is important background.

         In the case of East Timor, Australia recognises that the people of East Timor do have a right of self-determination—to choose, in effect, how they are governed. This has been Australia's position since before the events of 1975, and it has never been reversed. The UN, in relation to East Timor, has certainly recognised that there can be no solution to self-determination and related issues without the cooperation of the Indonesian government; thus the consultations with Indonesia which are now being conducted under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General and which Australia fully supports, and has done since their inception.

         As to the question about inconsistency, Portugal argues that Australia cannot both recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and, at the same time, say that the East Timorese have a right to self-determination. Senator Bourne seems to want to embrace that Portuguese claim of inconsistency. The situation is that before 1975 Australia recognised Portuguese sovereignty over East Timor while, at the same time, simultaneously recognising the right to self-determination of the Timorese people. There is no difference between the situation then and now. A claim of a right to self-determination can exist with a recognition of sovereignty. We recognised Portuguese sovereignty then—and, in fact, up until 1979 before we formalised it—and since 1979 we have recognised Indonesian sovereignty, but we have also recognised right through that period the right to  self-determination by the people of East Timor.

Australia could not do that before the treaty because there was no agreed international boundary line in that area. As Indonesia was in control of East Timor, Australia had to negotiate with Indonesia to settle the boundary issue.

The Development Bank has discovered that many possible borrowers were not aware of the bank's available facilities.

         It is interesting to note that the major increase in this lending will be to manufacturers in the small- to medium-sized area. The Commonwealth Development Bank conducted a survey in November and December of last year which showed that more than 90 per cent of the manufacturing SMEs expected to grow during 1995. The most interesting figure of all was that already 50 per cent of those manufacturing small businesses were exporting, another 10 per cent had plans to export and a further seven per cent were interested in exporting. That means that we anticipate nearly two-thirds of manufacturing SMEs will be exporting in the next year or so.

         What is interesting about this statement from the Commonwealth Development Bank and Mr Weaver, the general manager, is that the bank is looking at moving on from the traditional secure area of lending where often it would lend against only what is called bricks and mortar. The bank has indicated that it will, where appropriate, be willing to lend against the business plan and the prospects of the business itself. This is a change that the small business community and their associations have, in recent times, been calling for quite strongly on behalf of their members—a change that will enable small business to borrow against the business plan, against the prospect of the business itself.

One of the reasons why families are in a far better position at the moment than they have been over previous years, the years of the recession, is that job security and family incomes are high. In fact, for the family unit disposable income is now at a quite high level in Australia. Security of employment, given the growth in the economy, given the investment in the economy, is also quite high.

During the period in which your Mr Howard was Treasurer, mortgage interest rates in this country were higher than they are now and higher than they can foreseebly be now.

         Lastly in answer to this question, as I heard the question the senator opposite may well have misrepresented the Treasurer in saying that the Treasurer had forecast an increase in interest rates within the next three months. I am not aware that the Treasurer has said that. Indeed, the government has not said that. What the government has said is quite to the contrary: that it does not see a need in the present settings of the economy for an interest rate increase. So, if you are going to come in here and start to lard your questions with things that are not the government's position and pretend that they are the government's position, I suggest that the whole question ought to be re-examined, as indeed the questioner should be for misleading this place.

What guarantees can we now give to these two health services that they will not close? This is now a matter of weeks. We cannot wait until the budget. What processes can the government put in train to respond to the immediate needs of these two services—the long-term planning needs as well as the long-term funding needs.

The truth of the matter is exactly as I described it to Senator Kemp in the estimates committee hearings, namely the broad nature of the agreement that was canvassed during my discussions in Cuba and which I hope will be brought to consummation in a couple of months time is a result whereby the existing $17 million debt, a combination of capital and interest, would in fact be paid off—not written off but paid off, perhaps with some negotiated reduction as is common in these cases, but paid off—in order to clear the decks with EFIC. But it may well then be that a line of credit of an equivalent amount on a short term basis might then be established in order to enable the supply from Australia of other commodities much in demand in Cuba.

         My visit to Cuba of course was not simply designed to address that particular issue. It was also designed to advance Australian commercial interests because there is a very substantial mining investment of some $400 million to $500 million presently being contemplated that we hope shortly will be brought to fruition. Moreover, there are a number of multilateral issues of some consequence that needed to be addressed. I refer to the issue of Cuba's constant cold war preoccupied obstruction in international forums of arms control and disarmament negotiations, and indeed an obstructive attitude that it takes on many other matters of multilateral diplomacy. In those circumstances it is important, through dialogue of this kind, to try to encourage the country out of that time warp.

It was in that context also that this visit was made.

         A further point of the visit was to make some very direct representations to the Cubans about their human rights performance. I was prepared to acknowledge, quite frankly, that when it comes to a number of the economic and social rights, the performance over the years has been good, particularly in the context of health and education. I was also prepared to acknowledge that a number of the steps that had been recently taken towards opening up the economy, developing a marketing pricing system, opening the economy to investment and so on, are also much to be applauded in terms of economic freedoms of people within that country. But there is an obvious continuing problem so far as political and civil rights are concerned, rights to freedom of expression, rights to free association, and free elections. These are matters which continue to give concern to the international community. I took the opportunity of that visit to make some quite strong representations about those particular matters. The choice as always is whether or not to seriously address these areas of difference, of principle and practice and to seek to persuade; or whether, rather, to impotently, feebly and noisily stand off, hurling insults in the way that has become so characteristic of this opposition. I make no apologies whatever for the role that I played in relation to that particular visit, and nor will I ever.

        There are two lessons to be learnt from the Keating government's record on taxation. The first is that clearly and inarguably the Keating government is a high tax government. Labor is a high taxing government. The Australian people know it. If they had read the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        today they would have had it confirmed. Although it was dismissed by Senator Gareth Evans, in terms of income tax the survey by Ernst and Young—highly respected chartered accountants in our community—confirmed in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         The starting point in this whole tax debate is that Australians are paying a high level of income tax. The minister tried to compare the record of this government with that of the last coalition government. In fact, Australians, as far as it is particularly relevant, pay a lot more income tax now. Mr President, if you look at the marginal rate on the last dollar—which is what really counts—you will see that under Labor taxpayers pay 36.9c; under the coalition they paid 30.6c. In income tax terms, they now pay considerably higher tax on the marginal rate on the last dollar.

It is much higher under Labor than under the coalition, which is consistent with the attitude towards tax of the party. The Labor Party is a high tax party. We have seen it time and time again through history. Let us look at income tax as a proportion of total earnings. Under Labor in the last year available, 1993-94, it was 16c; under the coalition in the last year it was in government it was 14c. In effect, income tax has gone up in the areas that particularly count for the Australian taxpayer and that has been confirmed by Ernst and Young today. It is something that every Australian taxpayer has known all along.

         The second lesson, however, is that you cannot trust Labor's taxation promises. What did Labor promise at the last election? It promised that it would keep its l-a-w tax cut. In fact, it said it was more than a promise; it had been written into law, so the Australian people could totally depend on that. It could not change; it was in the statute book. Of course, Labor got into office and immediately broke that promise.

It had no concern about the promise that had been made at the previous election. That was irrelevant because all that was about was winning the election. It was not about a commitment to the Australian people, an obligation that would follow from winning. It was put to the Australian people as an inducement for their votes during that election.

         What Senator Gareth Evans said during question time is true. When John Howard, now the Leader of the Opposition, was Treasurer, in 1982-83 the revenue to GDP ratio of taxation in this country was 26.1 per cent. In the 1994-95 year, what is the relationship of revenue to GDP? It is 24 per cent. That is, a 2.1 per cent reduction in the total level of taxation has been effected under Labor from the level under the coalition when it was last in government. Therefore, when talking about high taxing parties, the searchlight of true belief should turn on the opposition because it is the high taxing party.

It fails to include additional payments normally paid separately on  individuals' incomes in overseas countries, such as social security payments and payroll taxes. Whilst the Ernst and Young study includes the Medicare levy in Australia, it ignores the similar but much higher levies in overseas countries. Once these additional payments are taken into account, a comparison of the countries in the Ernst and Young survey shows that Australia has the lowest taxes on personal income.

         Senator Cook can come in here and prattle away all he likes about what he thinks is written on those script sheets.

Then there are higher mortgage interest repayments. They have risen by 8.8 per cent during the September quarter, while the family income has increased by 0.7 per cent.

Then at the same time, as was so rightly exposed by Senator Hill in his question today, we are facing this prospect of additional taxes—taxes at all levels, whether direct or indirect. That is what is going to hurt every average Australian family to such a huge extent. That is the issue that this heartless government fails to address.

Of course, you also have the universal pension scheme, as has been floated by your spokesperson Mr Ruddock just a few weeks ago, which will cost no less than about $5 billion. If you put a very conservative estimate on all those figures, and if you do not even take into account the ones that we have not been able to cost at the moment, you are talking about outlay increases or revenue reductions of the order of $18 billion, quite apart from the problem of what you do about the carryover deficit that already exists.

         —I think we owe it to the listeners to this debate this afternoon to put it in terms of what the ordinary householder understands by high tax rates. We have heard a lot of gobbledegook that means absolutely nothing to most blue-collar workers and low income earners in Australia. What is important to these people is their take-home pay.

         If one looks at take-home pay nowadays, one takes into account the taxes and other deductions made by the employer and also a mortgage commitment. My colleague Senator Tambling indicated very graphically the impact of the Labor Party's high interest rate policies. Paying off the mortgage is an integral part of almost every family's commitment in this country.

         I think it is sad that, without the deliberate policies of your government to raise interest rates unnecessarily when you could have adjusted your previous budget so that ordinary Australians would not have had to pay the burden, you would not have had the glory of providing this so-called growth dividend and passing it out in the form of special benefits to your special interest groups. Let us look at some of the tax rates. Can you please give me the tax rate of an ordinary person earning $20,701, Senator Evans? Could you interject and give me the tax rate? What is it?

It is true that you have brought the top rate down, but the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under you. Tax is one issue that has made them a lot poorer under your government.

         I have said in this chamber before that if any Labor member is prepared to stand up and say that Mr Keating's promised l-a-w tax cuts will not occur and that fuel taxes have increased by a massive seven to nine cents a litre, I would be quite happy to get up and apologise.

         He also said—and this is important—that there would be no new taxes.

We could not even get an answer to that question. It was intriguing that Senator Evans pretended that there was no such promise. In the

When Senator Hill asked Senator Evans, `What are you going to do about new taxes?' Senator Evans refused to answer that question and, most importantly, refused to rule it out.

        New subregulations 6(8) and (9) provide for the refund or remission of export inspection and meat charges in specified circumstances at the discretion of the Secretary. The Committee wrote to the Minister on 1 December 1994 asking for advice on whether the discretions should be subject to AAT review. The Minister replied on 23 January 1995 advising that review procedures were inappropriate as the issue of refunds was discussed and agreed with representatives of relevant industry groups prior to the exercise of the discretionary power contained in s.6(8) and (9).

        Changes to Rule 51 of the Deed authorise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to approve payment of part of the employer benefit included in the preserved benefit "because of particular circumstances".

        The instrument also amends the Trust Deed by including a new Schedule 4A. This Schedule enables the calculation of the National Employer Benefit in any year by reference to CPI increases as published by the Statistician. In its 1993-94 Annual Report, the Committee expressed the view that, where regulations made under one Act defined a matter in relation to a register kept under another Act, "the incorporation would be valid only if it referred to the register as existing when the regulations were made". This was the Committee's preferred view of s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act. The Committee has also asked the Minister for advice as to the effect of s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act on the validity of the incorporation of "CPI increases published by the Statistician" in the present amendment to the Trust Deed.

         All these questions were put on notice on or before 29 November 1994. This means that Mr Lee has had over two months to answer them. On 30 January, the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee informed my office that it had been told that a significant majority of the questions had been completed and were awaiting the minister's approval. The committee set a deadline of 23 January for the receipt of these answers. Usually departments are given a month to answer questions on notice and sometimes even less for estimates questions.

How much funding is the Commonwealth providing to subsidise the cost of modifying decoders to allow people in remote areas of Queensland to continue to receive ABC and SBS broadcastS?

How will Australian media enterprises finance the development and commercialisation of multimedia and interactive media products?

          Those questions go to the heart of the process of the parliament because, unless those answers are known, then this government is able to make do with propaganda churned out by Mr Lee on a regular basis—without being held accountable in any form, without being tested as to the merits of the propositions and without any questioning of government policy. That is tantamount to saying that we ought to simply ignore the parliamentary processes and allow the executive to get on with government. I have heard Mr Keating say that on a number of occasions, and I have no doubt that that is his view. In fact, I think as recently as yesterday he said something like, `The House of Representatives ought not to worry about the budget, and when it arrives in the Senate we ought to just give it a tick.' That is typical of the attitude of arrogance that is no doubt second nature to the Prime Minister. I am surprised that his puppet adopts the same approach; I would have thought he was trying to make his own way in the world.

          Mr Lee has been notoriously slow in answering questions on notice and, in particular, correspondence. I have a number of examples of letters I have written to him over the last year which have either not been answered or which he has taken an inordinate length of time to answer. I wrote to him on 8 December 1994 making representations on behalf of the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association—no answer received to date. I wrote to him on 26 September 1994 urging him to consider including the four state opera companies in the proposed major organisations board—no answer.

          This minister has a long history of prior convictions for refusing to answer correspondence and for refusing to comply with requests from the committee. In those circumstances, we should treat the contact by his office with my office this afternoon as simply no more than an attempt to stall for no good reason.

          Most ministers in this chamber make a reasonable effort and, if they are dilatory and are asked to explain their behaviour, then they often come in here and explain it—I suppose, mea culpa—and we accept that they are acting in good faith. I have no reason at all to think that Mr Lee is doing anything other than giving effect to the views of one of his staffers whom my office contacted some months ago and asked for information, and the reply was, `Why should we help you in any shape or form; your job is to get us.' I take that as truthfully reflecting the attitude of the office and no doubt the minister.

          Not once has Mr Lee ever landed any blow of substance. It is simply an attempt somehow to flex some very small muscles. I find it not even irritating but virtually laughable. It is a concession on Mr Lee's part that he is floundering and cannot handle the heat of the political game. At the very least, when he has a massive bureaucracy behind him, I would have thought he would be capable of responding to questions on notice.

          The summary of Senate questions on notice for 1994 also makes interesting reading. It makes the point that since Mr Lee became minister at the end of 1993, he has been asked 66 questions on notice by senators relating to the communications and arts portfolio. Of these questions he has answered a mere 10 questions within the 30-day time limit set by the Senate. Answers have taken 107 days, 156 days, 186 days, 140 days, 148 days, 106 days and 130 days—the last still remaining unanswered to date.

          That is a pretty appalling track record. I would very much like to hear whether there is any explanation or justification. I have no doubt at all that Mr Lee would do a lot better if he applied his mind to these matters. Obviously he does not regard the parliamentary process as any sort of priority. I have to say that he would be one of the worst performers in that regard. The only conclusion I can come to is that he is running scared because he knows that the questions that have been put on notice will expose a number of deficiencies in his approach and will probably involve him in a lot more work as well. Well, if he wants to be paid for driving around in a big fat car, then here is his chance to earn his money.

          Let me deal with Senator Alston's speech. I did my best to listen to it and, unless I missed something, I failed to hear him mention how many questions there were. The fact is that he did not give that information because the facade of reasonableness would collapse when it became apparent that we are talking about more than a thousand questions. The answers that are being sought are not one or two or 25. There are a thousand questions.

I am trying to speak about the issues that are before the Senate. The fact is that we have a person here who studiously avoided providing the facts against the background of an outrageous proposal involving a thousand questions to be answered over December and January. That task requires a huge collective administrative effort across several bodies within the communications portfolio. The minister, as do I think all responsible ministers, does not regard himself merely as a conduit of the department but rather as the person who provides the answers. I do. When answers come from the department to me, I seek within the limits of my capacity to check the answers myself. I do not just say `Here they are' and pass them on. That is the proper process. When you have a thousand, it takes a little time. As I am advised, some of them are cross-referenced. They are overlapping questions to different agencies within the department. Obviously a minister wants to make sure that those are consistent and would want to be satisfied with those answers. That is the proper thing for a minister to do.

          Contrary to Senator Tierney's enthusiasm, my understanding is that the minister has not received all the answers as yet. He is currently examining those answers that have been forwarded. Senator Alston has acknowledged that he was advised of the minister's proposal, and his understanding is the same as mine. The minister's proposal was that, notwithstanding the mountain of material involved, some 10 per cent of the answers can be provided tomorrow—which does not sound a lot, until you realise that it is more than 100 answers—approximately 500 or more can be provided by Friday, and the remaining 500 or so can be provided by next Monday.

It is the sort of squeeze that ministers in this place get caught in from time to time. In this instance that is not the case.

But you need to appreciate that, if you ask 1,000 questions, it will take a little longer to answer than if you had asked 100 questions. If you do not have the capacity to set priorities about the matters of which you are concerned and you seek to ask every question, then it will take longer than if you were not so slothful and set priorities and asked key questions. Most senators, and particularly most shadow ministers, take the trouble to do that. If you are slothful and say, `Here are all the questions everybody ever thought of about this issue,' it will take a while to get the answers.

What this demonstrates yet again is a curtailment of the powers for scrutiny of the Senate. In the chamber yesterday, on the Procedure Committee report, Senator Hill outlined a number of ways in which Senate power and the rights of senators to cast this government under scrutiny had been curtailed. We have here today yet another example of this in the delay in providing answers to questions. The end result of what the government has done is that the minister is now giving senators—with their very limited staff, as opposed to ministerial and departmental staff—very little time to actually look at these answers and work out responses to them.

          One of the great dangers to parliamentary democracy is the fact that we have in our system a tendency towards centralisation. You have the executive arm of government having an increasing amount of power. It leaves the members of parliament fighting battles on two fronts. First of all we have to try to get the government to come clean and to give us honest answers in this chamber. But then we have to fight on a second front against public servants who will not come up with straight answers to questions in estimates committees.

          There were many examples during the time Senator Alston and I were looking at the matter of the ABC. Senior public servants would sit there, go round and round in circles and never give you a straight answer. I asked the head of a department, when we were at a dinner in Canberra, about this and why we could not get a straight answer out of the Public Service. He said, `You've got to ask the right question.' In other words, we that are generalists are not experts. They are the public servants. They know what we are getting at. They know the answer. Instead of coming clean and saying, `Look, this is the situation. We'll give you the true and full picture,' what tends to happen is that they sit back and wait. If we do not ask the precise question that gets to the exact point, they will try to skirt around it.

He did not say that up-front at first; it took about seven questions before we got to an answer.

          Senator McMullan made much of the fact that there are 1,000 questions. What Senator McMullan is forgetting is that there are about 10 different departments and agencies in this area of communications and the arts. That averages out at about 100 questions an agency. I would have thought that, with these areas of government that have massive resources, answering 100 questions was not beyond them. The sorts of questions we put on notice tend to be ones which require factual information and should be easily found in government documents and other reports.

But why has he spent quite a lot of time just sitting on those matters and not passing them through to senators' offices?

          I remind the Senate that the area under consideration is the Department of Communications and the Arts. This is one of the crucial areas in the future development of Australia. We have had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) bring out a special policy and special budgetary supplementation to really help kick us off in areas like the information superhighway. For example, in the United States seven per cent of GDP is now in the communications industry. It is a large part of the future growth of Australia and the health of our economy is going to depend largely on developments in this area; yet constantly there are problems. Last year we had the example of pay television. The responsible minister at the time, Senator Collins, absolutely messed up the pay TV arrangements because he did not read documents. We had a major inquiry and an internal inquiry into the operations of the department and found that they were grossly deficient.

That will do something to look at the financial management of the institution, but it does not look at what it is actually doing in terms of fulfilling a charter, for example. There needs to be far greater scrutiny in this area because these agencies are not just parts of the Public Service; they are statutory corporations.

Senator Alston will recall that on one day at the end of last year, 11 reports in the communications and the arts area were presented on one day. As senators are aware, the Senate has half an hour to consider these reports—five minutes for each speaker. That means that six senators can speak. Even if everyone wanted to speak on communications, we would not get through half of the report. We are competing for time with every other department's report as well.

Those opposite are not in a position to dictate to executive government when it will decide issues such as the 509 coupes. We have given a timetable of two weeks and under this other notice of motion they want to do it within five days. Well, it is physically not possible to do so—

          The second point we make relates to the number of questions put on notice. Sometimes these create problems with any bureaucracy, none of which have magical powers in getting the answers in a set time. I always ask my department to try to avoid taking questions on notice. I say, `You are there at the estimates committee. You should have some expertise. Try to answer questions for the senators. Never mislead, but only answer the question asked—that is natural. But try to put the answer down there because in the end you are giving yourself immense hard work.'

No-one in this chamber would suggest that you send the questions across to the department, bring the answers back and send them straight to the committee without looking at and checking the answers, because sometimes departments make mistakes. Sometimes you are able to pick up those mistakes and have them corrected in the answer. Sometimes a few slip through, but most people cut a bit of slack there and understand that no-one is perfect.

          I come to the point of cost. There is a view,  I think, amongst some senators that you can put hundreds of questions on notice and that there is no cost in answering them. Last year I costed the activities of one senator in relation to putting questions on notice. It went well into five figures. This year someone is going to pass that by a mile. That is a cost to departments. It is a cost of effort. It does divert officers sometimes. So a lot does go back.

Some are Senator Alston or Senator Tierney seeking information to help them in their public life—that often happens—and some are simply a trawling exercise.

          I point out that here we are dealing with additional estimates. Ministers have been very liberal in their interpretation of the questions they have been asked, but all have tried to answer them in one form or another, at the committee or elsewhere. But this is additional estimates. The questions should be to do with the additional money being spent only. Yet if you go back and have a look at the questions asked at the estimates committee and by way of notice—I am only guessing now, but I bet I cannot be proved wrong—you will see that quite a few of these 1,200 questions are not to do with additional estimates—

All those points of interference that you call scrutiny and I often call scrutiny are sometimes just plain, blatant political interference. You do not want it done to you. You want a fair run. That is one of the reasons, when you did get the majority to increase the powers of the Senate, we put it in standing orders rather than sessional orders—so that you people could not ignore it the moment you won government, because that was your intention.

There is no dispute whatsoever. For those who say that this is an absolutely simple process of putting a thousand questions in and getting a thousand answers out the other side, the deadline that you set cannot always be met, depending on the complexity of the questions and what the questions go to. We, on this side, believe we should try to get those answers in as quickly as possible because I think it suits our own self-interest to do so rather than having all the material regurgitated at the supplementary hearings. It is not always possible in every circumstance to get every question answered in a timetable that suits you. It is simply not possible.

          The fact is, Senator Ray, that if you were genuine—and you purported to be genuine—about the desirability of answering questions, if you were fair dinkum, you would demonstrate your bona fides by providing answers progressively. You have had 70 days to answer a lot of questions from 10 different senators. If you were serious, when you were written to by the committee, as you were seven or eight days ago, you would have written back and said, `Well, the fact is to date I've had a lot of questions. I've managed to get through two-thirds of them. Some of them are still requiring further information, but this is what I have got to date and you can have that.'

          Of course, I suspect the real reason why we have not got any answers at all is that Ken was overseas for the whole of January swanning around Europe. Of course, if he only got back at the beginning of last week, he did not give himself much of a chance to deal with what, no doubt, he would regard as a low order of priority. So, completely of his own making, he finds that he has all these questions piled up in his office and, because he prefers to run around Europe on vacation, he has not had time to do the work. Again, if he were genuine about all of this, he would have written back and explained where we were in the process and not come up with possible explanations transmitted through Senator McMullan.

          As Senator Ray rightly said, one cannot hold Senator McMullan personally at fault in this exercise because, quite clearly, it is not Senator McMullan's fault. Senator McMullan is here responding on behalf of Mr Lee. That is where the blame resides. It was quite open to Senator McMullan to transmit a message from Mr Lee's office that, indeed, a number of these questions were fishing, vexatious, frivolous, irrelevant. All sorts of objections involved an enormous volume of resources and covered historical matters. We could have had all of that. If you were serious and genuine, you could have come in here and given us those sorts of reasons why it had not been possible. But we did not hear one word along those lines. There has been no attempt to suggest that the government has had problems.

          As Senator Ray says, it is desirable to get answers as quickly as possible. It is not possible to get all the questions in time. We have not had any questions at all, so you have to ask yourself: what is going on here? I think one explanation is that the minister has been too busy. He put his personal preferences, going to the other end of the world, ahead of his parliamentary responsibilities.

          Then, as you would know if you have been around this place for any length of time, there is also the other very transparent and utterly predictable strategy behind all this. I just noticed it on the ABC committee, for example. We have put down questions on notice, and each and every time those answers turn up a couple of hours before we are about to start the hearing. It is the oldest bureaucratic trick in the book. Quite clearly, Minister Lee has decided that he will deliver only half the answers to these questions from a range of senators. They have to go through them immediately on Monday, irrespective of what other commitments they might have, and, by the close of business on Monday, communicate to the secretary of the committee whether they have any further questions arising. Clearly, they have to consider all of those answers and their adequacy in a matter of a couple of hours on the Monday before they can then indicate, as they are entitled and indeed required to do, whether they want to take the matters further. It is a pretty transparent ploy, I would have thought.

          You have had 70 days to provide answers. You have provided none. You did not even, in response to the minister's letter, attempt to contact my office, for example, and provide any sort of explanation or attempt any sort of negotiations. You rang up about lunchtime, knowing it was coming on after question time, and you put forward this proposition: `It is all very demanding and we can't possibly comply. Here is our offer.' It is not much more than an ambit claim. It is not much more than pretty grubby, bureaucratic politics.

          I do not blame Senator McMullan personally for this, although I would not like to say that he would be above doing that because I think it is pretty much standard practice on the other side that, wherever possible, they give the opposition as little time as possible within the general rules. That is what I think is going on here. This is a conscious and deliberate attempt to squeeze the process to the very end in order to minimise the amount of extra work. As I say, if we had received a number of these answers to date or if there had been any attempt to indicate that somehow the questions were unfair, too demanding or simply covering utterly inappropriate ground, one might have thought that we would have heard of that by now or during the course of Senator McMullan's response—but we have not.

          Therefore, I think there are only two conclusions we can come to: firstly, that the minister, by his own actions and in choosing to be out of the country for about six weeks, has put himself in a difficult position; but secondly, and most importantly, he has made no attempts since that time—and I suppose he could have had the material faxed to him on the ski slopes or wherever he was, but he has not even done that—to come up with anything except simply an eleventh hour proposition which is very much along the usual lines of trying to put maximum pressure on. In those circumstances, I hope that the Senate will carry this motion in order to demonstrate that we do expect ministers to comply.

          I would say one thing finally: what we are asking is that the minister comply with a resolution of the legislation committee of 23 January. That committee had a majority of government members on it; in other words, they all took the view that the minister had had ample time to answer the questions—and he has chosen not to. He has made no attempt, since 23 January, to come up with any of the answers. All he has done is wait until five minutes to midnight to come up with some sort of feeble tactical response. That is not good enough.

For the purpose of conducting part of the efficiency audit, the ANAO contacted the National Media Liaison Service. Without going through in great detail what happened precisely in the weeks following that contact, essentially the National Media Liaison Service did not respond to the Auditor-General's request to be allowed to conduct an audit. Ultimately, the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker, wrote that the proposed review was ultra vires.

The first point I would make is that we have a government agency—the National Media Liaison Service—which, according to the Crown Law Department, is not subject to the normal efficiency audits one would expect to be carried out on an agency disposing of such a large amount of government money.

Indeed, the Director of the National Media Liaison Service had, in the past, appeared before this committee. I have previously quoted an instance when in 1989 Mr Colin Parks was prepared to come before this committee and answer questions.

So I played by the rules of the game, Senator McMullan. I indicated that I wished to ask these questions.

Senator McMullan, `Put it on notice'; what are the objectives of the National Media Liaison Service? Senator McMullan, `Put it on notice'. So it proceeded. It was a total and absolute farce and it continued for over an hour. Senator McMullan was clearly pursuing a strategy, which had been worked out with Mr David Epstein and Mr Beazley, that no questions would be answered; these questions would be put on notice and carefully vetted before any response was given.

The purpose of that unit, as set out in the material tabled some years ago by Senator Bolkus, is that it provides accurate and timely information on government policies. That is how the government attempts to justify the employment of 23 officers of the National Media Liaison Service; their job is to provide information on government policies. In fact, there is a sensitivity that somehow this unit should not be used for party political purposes; in other words, the $1.5 million is to be provided in order to promote government policies and programs.

Then when the Senate estimates committee appropriately seeks to ask questions about the role of this unit, again we have stonewalling and Mr David Epstein gets a note from the teacher saying that he does not have to appear. The government attempts to justify the $1.5 million spent on government information programs, then it hides behind the fact that Mr Epstein and his colleagues are employed under the MOPS Act and, therefore, according to Mr Beazley, are not subject to questions by the Senate committee.

          To summarise it briefly, this unit is a political hit-squad. We understand from the media that much of its work is designed to carry out research and analysis of the political opponents of the government—the Greens, the Democrats and the coalition. That is the dilemma that the government now has. It has justified spending $1.5 million and justified employing 23 officers right around Australia on the basis that they are carrying out work to promote government programs and policies. That is why this Senate committee is perfectly entitled to ask questions about the work of this unit, and that is why this Senate committee is perfectly entitled under our standing orders to summon Mr David Epstein to appear before the committee to answer these questions.

          —Senator Kernot, I pointed out that he is a ministerial staffer under the MOPS Act, but the government justifies the expenditure on his salary by saying that he is not performing the political work of a ministerial staffer, nor is he attempting to dig up dirt on the Democrats or the opposition; he is performing work to promote or provide information on government programs. The Auditor-General has pointed out—it is not me saying this—that there is a major loophole in accountability in this program.

          In the roles and functions of the National Media Liaison Service, item (d) says that representatives of the unit `will not be involved in party programs, nor electoral campaigning'. The sort of question that the Senate committee wanted to ask Mr Epstein was whether he was involved in any way during the last election campaign. That is a fair enough question. You justified spending the money on the basis that he and his 23 officers would not be involved. We are entitled to see what sort of work Mr David Epstein and his colleagues carry out.

          The government is on the horns of a great dilemma here. It justifies spending $1.5 million on the grounds that this is a unit to promote government information and government programs. Then when we seek to inquire what Mr Epstein and his colleagues are doing in carrying out that work, the government suddenly ducks for cover and runs behind the MOPS Act. If Senator McMullan wants to be frank and say, `Mr Epstein and his colleagues are really doing party political work and the work of ministerial staff,' that is all right. You say that, but then the problem is that you have to justify why you should have additional staff for political work, and the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens are not granted a similar facility. That is your problem.

          I put it to you that there is no precedent being created by this motion. There is a major problem, which the Auditor-General has carefully identified and brought to the attention of the Senate. The estimates committees are perfectly appropriate committees to examine the work of the National Media Liaison Service. Therefore, I urge the Senate to support this very reasonable motion which will ensure proper accountability.

          —The sensitivity involved on the opposition side is clear from the number of times Senator Kemp said that there is no precedent being created here. I accept that he has no current intention of using the step which he is taking as a precedent. But I am not absolutely convinced of his capacity to resist the temptation to do so. Let us think about what a precedent is. A precedent is something done for the first time which others may subsequently use to justify similar actions in the future. That is exactly what this is, without attributing any motives to Senator Kemp other than those which he has articulated. It is a dangerous precedent.

          For anyone who is listening to this debate or who subsequently reads it, let us get one thing clear: the normal financial audits that apply to the proper expenditure of taxpayers' money to ensure that there are no misappropriations do apply, and always have applied, to the expenditure of this money. What we are talking about is whether the current law allows a performance audit of the National Media Liaison Service to be conducted.

          It is not a question of a ministerial edict saying it should not be conducted. The advice of the Attorney-General's Department is that it is ultra vires the act as it now stands. If the Senate does not like that, then it is open to it to deal with the legislation when it comes before it, as it is about to do as we all know, to ensure that that problem no longer exists. I do not want to get into the question of interpretation as to whether the bill, as it is now drafted, does do that. That is another question. If it does do that, you can keep it as it is and if you are worried it does not do that, then you can amend it. The proper processes exist for dealing with that.

          The enthusiasm of the opposition for performance audits of bodies such as this was not evident in the days of the Government Information Unit which it ran when it was in office at a much greater cost to the taxpayer, and which displayed not only blatant evidence of its partisan activities generally but also blatant evidence of its partisan and active activities within the Liberal Party. This was properly more of a problem for the then member for Kooyong than it was for us at the time.

          Why are the constraints that set down the role and function of the NMLS phrased as carefully as they are? We learnt the lesson of the abuses conducted by the Government Information Unit under the Fraser government which operated at a much greater real dollar cost to the taxpayer than the NMLS has ever cost. Is that ever acknowledged? No. Was the opposition ever enthusiastic about questions of accountability then? No. Let us not have any of that humbug. If the question of a performance audit of a body such as this is appropriate—I will come to my view about the appropriateness of at least some part of it later—then the legislative route is the way to go and we will, by 1 July this year, have in place a process to resolve that problem.

In a sense, it will probably enhance the executive vis-a-vis the parliament, but I am not sure that it will do that in the way that it should.

        —The main point of Senator Kemp's motion, having prepared the justification in part (a) points (i) to (vi), requires us in parts (b) and (c) to instruct the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee to hold supplementary estimates hearings. It identifies that the business of that hearing would be to hear evidence from Mr Epstein concerning the expenditure of the public funds provided to the National Media Liaison Service and report to the Senate on that. Part (c) directs Mr Epstein to appear.

        Throughout most of Senator Kemp's contribution, I wondered what else he wanted to ask Mr Epstein, considering that Senator Calvert had placed on notice question No. 1604, which asks about the role of the National Media Liaison Service; its charter; services; cost at the national level; cost on a state by state basis; what percentage of these costs is wages and salaries; what government resources are at the disposal of the NMLS; and what publications are produced. I also wondered what questions about expenditure he wants to ask. I heard him say towards the end of his remarks that he would like to ask whether Mr Epstein was involved in an election campaign, et cetera. I heard him say by way of interjection, which ought to be acknowledged even at this stage, that he is not intending to ask questions about the Ministerial Media Group. That is a point to note.

        On the matter of the principles that we are talking about, the first thing that was raised was whether it is appropriate for the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit. Senator Kemp might not be aware of this, but in the draft audit bill, which is coming up for debate in the next couple of days, there is a section where, after 1 July 1995, the Auditor-General will by regulation of the new act be able to do the audit that he is concerned about. As I understand it, the NMLS will be deemed to be part of a department for audit purposes. So I guess that for the future his concern is taken care of. But Senator Kemp is still seeking some information for the immediate past financial year and before that. I want to put on the record the point that we do not object to it.

        One thing I remember so clearly from that report is the questions raised about the demarcation of responsibility between ministerial staffers and public servants working in the department. It is a very grey area. It is something that this government needs to address in terms of structural reform. That may be the way out of the dilemma we have whereby the government is saying that the National Media Liaison Service provides a service to government while other members of the Senate are saying that it seems to be serving a party political purpose in that ministerial staff cannot be required to answer questions.

        I suspect that the way forward is some sort of restructuring from the government and some sort of demarcation and delineation of the purpose of both these groups.

Other senators have made a distinction between that sort of activity and party activities being funded through taxpayer money. Senator Kemp wants to ask questions about the NMLS role in the last election campaign.

        As Senator Robert Ray so eloquently put it to the Senate in the previous debate, the Senate estimates committee and the Auditor-General are two key elements of accountability by the executive to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the people of Australia. He spoke somewhat condescendingly. Nevertheless, he made the points very well.

        In relation to the history of the National Media Liaison Service, commonly referred to as aNiMaLS, we as an opposition have been trying to get information. First of all, the Auditor-General independently sought to make an investigation into efficiency. He was blocked by the minister. Whilst I accept that the legal opinion was that it was ultra vires, the simple fact is that nothing was stopping the minister from saying, `Although there is a legal technicality, we welcome the Auditor-General looking at the performance of the National Media Liaison Service as part of our overall review in the particular area of government advertising.' So the government took the particular decision not to allow the Auditor-General in.

        What was the next step? The next step was the estimates committee. Senator McMullan's performance on Friday was, with due respect, not too flash. Most of the questions were answered by `I will put it on notice' or `I have no idea'; basically we were given non-responses. That was very frustrating, especially when we heard in the previous debate a senior minister, Senator Robert Ray, indicating how he seeks to instruct his department to give open and full answers at the actual hearing. There seems to be a different standard applied by the government in relation to the Department of Defence under Senator Ray from that applied in relation to the National Media Liaison Service.

The assessment process will take place this week. Mr Keating said last week that it would take place `next week'. That must be this week, so he must have them identified already.

          I do not think I can reasonably take that matter too much further except to say that I think it is important in this whole debate that there be as much transparency as possible. The whole process has been an absolute fiasco from start to finish.

          I am concerned by the way the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and his department are handling this whole process. In an exchange that occurred relative to this same matter but on Senator Faulkner tabling documents which were demanded by the Senate in a previous return to order, Senator Faulkner clearly advised on 2 December at the time he tabled the contracts—if I could put my hand on the transcript I would quote it, but I cannot; I showed Senator Faulkner and also Senator Bell the transcript of

          Senator Faulkner then privately indicated to me that he was prepared to make that information available when he got it. He said—and he also said this on the public record—that now was not the time because the time by which that acquittal report had to be tabled had not yet arrived. Senator Faulkner wittingly or unwittingly—I give him the benefit of the doubt by saying `unwittingly'—has misled the Senate. For misleading the Senate, he should take the honourable course.

          Minister, not only did you on 2 February 1995 say that all relevant acquittal obligations set out in the contracts have been complied with; today you said the time has not arrived. Senator, if you or your advisers would care to have a look at the contracts, I will take you through them to show you that the time in fact has arrived. On that basis, that acquittal report should be here. You have misled the Senate by saying the time has not arrived. It makes one wonder what the purpose of this exercise is if the Senate instructs Senator Faulkner to table some reports and then he is not prepared to comply with that.

          Senator, so that in the cooler light of day you or your advisers can follow this through—although you have not been well treated by your advisers so far—the contract in clause 2.4(c) says:

         The relevant date for the final coordinated report is 4 November 1994. The final instalment of the payments to the contractors, to the conservation councils in this instance of $3,818, was to be paid on the completion of the contract. I would suggest that that is probably being paid on 4 November. Elsewhere in the contract it is made quite clear that the project has to be completed on delivery, and there must be written acceptance of a satisfactory report no later than seven weeks from the date of receipt of certain material from the department or no later than 4 November, whichever is the sooner. Again, this report had to be completed by 4 November.

          Clause 5.3 of the contract says that within eight weeks of the completion of the project, or some other happenings, the grantee shall repay all unexpended grant moneys and provide an acquittal report to the department. The contract makes it quite clear that the completion of the project is no later than 4 November. Eight weeks from 4 November has certainly passed by now. It coincides with the advice that Senator Faulkner was given and which he mentioned to us on 2 February when he said that the four organisations have complied with all relevant acquittal obligations set out in the contract. Now he is telling me and the Senate that those acquittal reports are not here. Either Senator Faulkner is lying or these people have not complied with the contracts. In that event, I want to know why. Over $100,000 of taxpayers' money has been paid to four conservation groups to put in these assessments. We want to see, as custodians of the taxpayers' money, what we got for that $100,000 and who was the recipient of all the money.

If it was from a database or from state conservation departments, why, Senator, didn't your department do that, at a very minimal cost, rather than pay these conservation groups $100,000-plus of taxpayers' money to do what your department could have done—simply call up the database of the state forestry and conservation departments—to get the information?

It is becoming a matter of major scandal about what happened to that $100,000; what we as taxpayers got for that money; and why you cannot produce the acquittal report, which was supposed to be in by no later than 4 January 1995 and which, in spite of an order of this Senate to table the report, you tell me today you cannot table because the time has not arrived. The time has arrived, and you should table those acquittal reports if you have them. If you have not got them, you and your department are derelict in your duty by not enforcing those contracts and making sure that those people who received over $100,000 of taxpayers' money account to us for what they did for the money that was paid to them.

We, as well as members of the cabinet, have the right to know which coupes he is talking about. It is obvious that on 2 February 1995 Mr Keating knew which coupes they were. I fail to see why anyone could object to senators being brought into the picture and being advised of which coupes they are.

Alternatively, I would hope that Senator Bell might realise that by agreeing to the motion he is not putting the government to any particularly onerous task. It is information that the Prime Minister had on 2 February and should be available to us. It takes no-one backwards a step, except perhaps the Labor Party; perhaps it would make it look even more foolish and incompetent in its handling of this matter. In the real interests of the forest industry people and environmentalists, it is important that we are all let into the secret. I urge the Democrats and the minor parties to concede the motion so that we can get that information before the Senate.

I hope to relieve some of that tension that he is suffering from. While I would not in any way seek to shelter the government from the scrutiny brought by this motion in its initial format, I share Senator Chamarette's concern that the date is a little hasty and that an amendment to seek a later date would place this motion to a closer representation of what it in fact is.

          In considering Senator Ian Macdonald's motion, we looked at whether it was an appropriate device for following matters in this chamber compared with other notices of motion. We have to be very careful in this regard. The purpose was to seek to bring the government to account. Often senators compete in the process of setting down notices of motion. Such competition is healthy but it is important that there be no unnecessary duplication. It is possible to see this motion as a subset of the information sought in Senator Gibson's notice of motion 1315 which asked for all documents relating to the granting of export woodchip licences. That motion was slightly amended before it was passed. It now seeks only to obtain those documents which were exchanged with the Prime Minister. Perhaps the coalition realised that a number of notices of motion were chasing the same rabbit.

          I agree with Senator Ian Macdonald in asking for as much transparency as possible in the process. Having taken a careful look at this matter, the Democrats argue strongly that the whole process should be examined by way of an inquiry by a senate standing committee. We envisage that inquiry should be comprehensive and fully targeted at the process which took place—a process which in turn delivered the shemozzle that took place outside this Parliament in recent days.

          As Senator Bell has said, this motion requests not only a document that exists but seeks the creation of such a document. As to the three conditions sought by Senator Macdonald, I believe that one is impossible of fulfilment until the whole assessment process is complete. To know which of the 509 coupes identified for priority attention are currently being logged in accordance with licence conditions, obviously those coupes have to be visited and listed in terms of current activities. It is a chicken and egg situation; it does not concern a list that simply exists. We can undertake the other two conditions within Senator Ian Macdonald's motion without necessarily making that assessment because those issues are simply matters of fact.

          —The government does not support the motion. I will not take up very much of the Senate's time in debating this matter. However, I wish to point out that, save for the issue of timing, Senator Ian Macdonald's motion asks for no more, in effect, than the statement that the government will be making when this week's assessment is completed. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in his statement:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Following consideration by officials from the Departments of DEST, DPIE and PM&amp;C, and consultation with the relevant State Departments, next week Cabinet will consider the status of these coupes, with a view to the statutory decision maker, the Minister for Resources, making a final decision on them.
        </para>
        <para>
         The process has been clearly outlined. I do not believe the process will be completed by 5 pm Wednesday 8 February, the time specified in Senator Ian Macdonald's motion. I assure Senator Ian Macdonald that the information will be made public as soon as the assessment process is completed.

          In regard to the other issue raised by Senator Ian Macdonald, I have made two comments in regard to acquittals. One related to a tabling statement in response to a return to order. I said that I had been advised that all four organisations had complied with all relevant acquittal obligations set out in the contracts. On 6 February I also made a comment which may have been in answer to a question without notice. I said:

        </para>
        <para>
         I have been advised by the department on this matter that it is completely the standard practice for the department to consider the project completed when the report provided complies with the standards set out in the contract. So that is not when the report is delivered. The acceptance of the report as satisfactory is signified by the department making the final payment. Therefore, the eight-week period from the completion of the project is from that date when the final payment is made. I have already indicated that I am willing to make that timetable available to Senator Ian MacDonald and I am happy to repeat that commitment on the public record.

What I am asking the minor parties is for the coupes that comply with those three preconditions the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) set down in his press release be identified to us. I am not asking for the assessments. Senator Chamarette has just spoken to me privately and said that, to find those coupes, we will need to go through the whole 509.

It does not take very long to find that out. He also said that he wants to give priority to those coupes that had licences renewed in 1994. It does not take long to find that out.

          —by leave—Information has been passed by Senator Ian Macdonald to those of us who have participated in the debate. I indicate to Senator Macdonald that it confirms the position the Democrats have taken on this. Senator Macdonald highlighted the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said, `Priority attention will be given to resolving the status of those coupes which meet all three of the following conditions'. I would have thought it was quite clear that if priority attention is being given to resolving something, then it has not been resolved and the list does not yet exist.

          A return to order is essentially a discovery of an existing document. The Prime Minister is saying that it does not exist and that priority will be given to resolving that and to arriving at an answer which declares the status of the coupes. We cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, assert that that resolution exists, that he said it exists or that we know it exists.

In fact, the newspapers have been talking about the 70 or 90—I forget, but it is some figure like that—so there is obviously within the Prime Minister's possession a list of those 70 or 90 which will be given priority because they meet those three conditions. That is what I am trying to indicate to Senator Bell.

          The other matters Senator Bell raises I cannot answer in this instance and will address when closing the debate, but I do have good answers for them, I assure him. I ask Senator Bell and Senator Chamarette to consider that we are not asking for the assessments. We are simply asking for things that the Prime Minister already has in his possession and which even Senator Faulkner says the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) is going to announce shortly. And he has to announce it shortly because the Prime Minister said they were going to be done this week.

          I can understand why she does not want it to be known until 27 February, but Senator Bell is like me. He wants as much information as possible on the public record today—not next week, not when Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall can weasel their way out of the enormous mess they have got into. We want to see it now so that we can start assessing these coupes, the same as the cabinet is going to assess them. If it is good enough for the cabinet to assess, why is it not good enough for the shadow cabinet to assess, or for the Democrats' executive to assess? If Senator Bell had the information, he could start assessing it, the same as the Prime Minister.

          Finally, Senator Bell, just to put it on the record, you did ask why we did not leave this to Senator Gibson's return to order. I just point out to you that Senator Gibson's return to order talked about documents and exchange of letters between 1 November 1994 and 27 January 1995. So this information would not have come out in Senator Gibson's return to order because this is something that apparently evolved during the late night cabinet sitting on 2 February. That is why it is given in addition to Senator Gibson's return to order.

        Mr President, this bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation, namely, the Auditor-General Act 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic Constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth; and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day-to-day financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, has an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework.

        being (until regulations under the replacement legislation come into operation) of the current safeguards, as agreed by Parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act 1901, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and the making of regulations to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, should it be needed, to demonstrate legal certainty to other parties so as to support a smooth transition to the new legislative framework—eg, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed act, such as operating bank accounts, contract audits in progress, debtors' repayments by instalments etc.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the bill's extensive impact, however, can be seen in the Schedule to the bill—in the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the more than one hundred other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act 1901. The proposed amendments will replace those acts' "Audit Act" references with provisions that appropriately link them to the framework of the new financial legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to those Commonwealth Authorities for which the Schedule specifies consequential amendments to their enabling legislation so as to link those authorities to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies act, it should be noted that the list is not exhaustive. The authorities are only those whose enabling legislation reflects Part XI of the Audit Act 1901. A further transitional bill will be necessary to create the necessary linkages to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act for the forty or so bodies whose enabling legislation does not reflect Part XI.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the introduction of a bill to replace the Audit Act 1901 should be marked as an event of particular significance in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. Apart from the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Audit Act is the oldest law passed by Parliament that is still in operation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The long title of the Audit Act 1901 describes its purpose to be "An act to make provision for the Collection and Payment of the Public Moneys and the Audit of the Public Accounts and the Protection and Recovery of Public Property. . . ". It has, for 93 years, done the job. This country has been well served by the financial principles established through its provisions, because it has, indeed, kept every Commonwealth Government since Federation financially honest in more than just a rhetorical sense. Over nine decades, there have been countless departmental officials and Auditors, and not a few Parliamentarians, who have confidently looked to the Audit Act 1901 as both the shield and the sword of Commonwealth financial integrity. Mr President, I am sure that none of them, were they here today, could have any doubt that the framework to be created by the legislation that is replacing the Audit Act 1901 will not only preserve that financial integrity, but strengthen it.

          —On 31 May 1994, the following matter was referred to the committee on the motion of Senator Crane: whether Mr Roger Boland was subject to any penalty or injury or deprived of any benefit on account of evidence given by him to a Senate committee and, if so, whether any contempt was committed.

          The question which the committee was required to consider was an allegation contained in an article in the

          that the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon.

The article claimed that this was because Mr Boland had been critical of government policies in evidence to the Employment, Education and Training Committee on 11 November 1993.

          When the matter was referred to the committee in the Senate, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, drew the Senate's attention to six matters which he indicated Mr Brereton would rely on before the committee. These are set out in full in the report. In summary, Senator Evans indicated that Mr Boland had not been penalised for his comments before the Employment, Education and Training Committee.

          The committee considered submissions from the minister, Mr Brereton; Mr Boland; and Mr Bert Evans, the Chief Executive of the MTIA. As foreshadowed by Senator Evans, the minister's submission in effect reiterated the points that he had made in the Senate. Mr Boland stressed that he did not regard himself as having been punished or prejudiced in any way by the minister or anyone else as a consequence of his giving evidence to the committee. Mr Bert Evans in his submission gave a detailed description of the dealings between the MTIA and the minister on the question of Mr Boland's appointment. For the reasons therefore set out in the report, the Privileges Committee does not find that a contempt has been committed. I commend the report to the Senate.

       The government does have reasons for the urgent passage of this legislation. As the Senate is aware, in the immediate period leading up to Christmas, some eight boats containing almost 700 unauthorised arrivals from the People's Republic of China arrived in northern Australia. On 30 December I announced that the government would move forthwith to introduce measures which would prevent any people without claims on Australia from abusing our refugee processes and tying up considerable public resources.

        An overwhelming number of the recent arrivals from the PRC are refugees from Vietnam who were granted protection in the People's Republic of China. I announced that I would be initiating steps to ensure that the safe third country legislation, which was passed by the parliament last year, could be applied to these people. Since 30 December and, in fact, before that date, we have had extensive bilateral negotiations with the PRC, together with the cooperation of the UNHCR. Those negotiations have resulted in the conclusion of a safe third country agreement covering the refugees from Vietnam who have been given protection by the PRC.

        The effect of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), however, will be to give the agreement and its operation under the safe third country provisions effect from the date of my announcement, being 30 December 1994. This of course was foreshadowed in my statement at the time. It is essential to the government's stated intention that we do this—that is, apply the safe third country provisions to all of the recent arrivals falling within the terms of the agreement. To do so, we have to pass this bill as soon as possible. Were the Senate not to deal with this bill until the next session, a number of the recent arrivals who have lodged refugee claims since my announcement of 30 December would be able to pursue those claims, notwithstanding the fact that they had already been granted protection by the People's Republic of China and had already been put on notice of the government's intention that the safe third country provisions should apply to them.

        I wish to very briefly canvass some matters which are of great concern to me in relation to Aerospace Technologies of Australia Ltd. Of recent days, we have learnt of the failure of the Blackhawk helicopters, which are produced by Sikorsky, owned and run by the Australian Army but maintained by ASTA.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have put some questions on notice about the Blackhawks. I expect and hope that I will get answers from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) very quickly. It is a serious matter when 23 out of 27 of the Blackhawks at Townsville are not operational and, apparently, a number of them have been in that state since about September.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         My concern is focused on a number of matters, but particularly on the question of maintenance by ASTA. In 1992, my colleague Senator Baden Teague asked a question in estimates about the progress being made in the commercialisation of the maintenance of Blackhawk helicopters. He was told that the army had negotiated a maintenance standing offer with ASTA Defence for the highest level of Blackhawk maintenance. That agreement allowed for an estimated 15 R3 services—that is, periodic services—every 500 flying hours to check all major items for airworthiness and associated repairs every year. The standing offer was a firm priced agreement for a period of three years with a two-year extendable option. The estimated total cost per annum was $1.05 million. As I understand it, ASTA maintained five aircraft in the first year, and it was anticipated that it would reach optimum capacity of 15 aircraft a year in early 1993.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problems being found with the Blackhawks are corrosion and cracking. We have been given various reasons for why these might have occurred. I am concerned as to why it has taken this long for us to be told about this matter and what ASTA's role was in the checking and maintenance. It was up to ASTA to look at the cracking; it was up to ASTA to advise that it was going through spares at an unacceptable rate. It is surely the responsibility of the contractor—as ASTA was—to keep these aircraft in the air. Although I recognise that the army may well have been responsible for field maintenance, these aircraft were to be kept in the air by ASTA Defence.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         My special concerns are that only recently I tabled an ombudsman's report in the Senate into the death of an RAAF pilot flying a Nomad. You may well recall that the ombudsman focused very harshly on ASTA's failure to maintain the aircraft which that young pilot was flying. Once again, we found that the board of inquiry had reported on the failure of ASTA to detect cracking by visual inspection, compared to the use of current techniques.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So we have ASTA failing to do its duty by the air force in relation to the Nomads that were on loan to it and that went back to the air force. We now have problems apparently with ASTA not doing its job. Certainly, there are big question marks over the job ASTA is doing under contract for the Department of Defence on the Blackhawks. These are questions which must be answered urgently.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Unfortunately, in relation to the Nomad pilot, ASTA has chosen, despite damning evidence at the board of inquiry which was repeated by the ombudsman, to contest the dead pilot's family in the courts as to its responsibility. We are lucky that we have not had any cases at this stage of army pilots going to their death as a result of failure of checking and maintenance. It is no good for Australia's defence capability to have these expensive aircraft sitting on the ground, although I would prefer them to be on the ground if the lives of our airmen are at stake.

        This report is to do with the National Road Transport Commission. A bill that went through this parliament four or five years ago was charged to create uniform traffic laws, uniform mass laws and uniform licensing laws for heavy vehicles right around Australia, and this document is virtually a progress report on what has been happening.

         Quite a bit has happened since that time, mainly to do with getting uniform licensing of vehicles for the different sort of work they do. The Road Transport Reform (Vehicle and Traffic) Act 1993 that went through this parliament addressed vehicle standards, driving hours, road rules, mass loadings, and oversized and over-mass vehicles and combinations. There has been progress in lots of other ways.

         Later this week, we will be debating the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill in this parliament. I think it is a very sensible move down the line. I read only today about the ridiculous situation where a Western Australian bulk goods carrier of dangerous goods had a double-B with a triple 25-metre bulk carrier built in Queensland. It was built up there because it was probably the best tender available at the time.

         What was not known at the time was that they had to get clearance from Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and, finally, Western Australia to have it examined for its dangerous goods carrying capacity, yet it had never had any dangerous goods put in it. It was simply an empty set of new containers, but it cost $10,000 in Queensland, $10,000 in New South Wales and $10,000 in South Australia just to get it home empty. The result was that they were able to avoid at least two of those inspections, in New South Wales and South Australia, by taking it on a back track—the Innaminka track—to get it back to Western Australia. This was a very ridiculous situation.

         If it had a load of dangerous goods, then I believe it would have been reasonable to have it examined. But it was completely empty. It did not have anything in it, so I thought it was a stupid situation. This is something which the dangerous goods bill and the other uniform regulations for heavy transport, contained in the NRTC bill of some years ago brought about. I presume that if the dangerous goods legislation were in place, we would not have had that silly situation.

         I believe that the NRTC has a lot more work to do. The Western Australian representative on the ministerial council for transport, which has representatives from around Australia, is the state Minister for Transport, the Hon. Eric Charlton. Even though Western Australia has a rather different agenda for the NRTC and uniform regulations for heavy transport, it mirrors the Commonwealth legislation in its own legislation without handing everything over to the Commonwealth. Western Australia wishes to have a degree of independence because a lot of things are unique to Western Australia. Senator Ellison and other Western Australian senators tell us this all the time. I believe the NRTC is progressing as it recognises Western Australia's unique situation, when necessary. I look forward to the completion of its task in years to come. The heavy transport industry will be far better for it in the final analysis. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.

         These are the components of an invincible Australia. These should perhaps be the ideal goals of this parliament and certainly this chamber. I present to the chamber the discovery of a body of science and technology that is unprecedented in the history of this country and which can achieve these goals to change life in Australia and, in fact, the planet. This science is Maharishi's Vedic science of consciousness.

         We would rightly ask: where does this science come from? Vedic science has been developed in its modern form by the enlightened Indian scholar Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Maharishi is best known for his development of the technique of transcendental meditation and, more recently, for his reconstruction of the traditional system of Vedic medicine known as Maharishi Ayur-Veda. Its importance can be demonstrated by listing four of its best documented achievements. The methods are not philosophical; they are practical. They are fully documented by many hundreds of scientific research studies. Later I will seek leave to table some of this material.

         I will give the Senate examples of its results. Firstly, research shows that Vedic health science can almost eliminate the two most devastating diseases of our time—namely, cancer and heart disease. In 1987, a study was published in the journal
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Psychosomatic Medicine
         </emphasis>
         showing that those engaged in the practice of Vedic health techniques have an 86 per cent decrease in heart disease and a 55 per cent decrease in cancer. The study showed a further 50 to 70 per cent decrease in all other illnesses and in hospital admissions and other medical needs. These findings indicate that, if the Australian population had universal access to these programs, over 1,200 lives would be saved every week. The savings in costs are estimated at 50 per cent of today's health budget.

         Secondly, Vedic education methods are the only methods that can significantly increase both intelligence and lateral or creative thinking. A large number of studies have demonstrated this in both children and adults. One of the best studies, on high school children, demonstrated not only increases in intelligence and creativity but actually showed that these children rose from average levels of performance to the top five per cent in their state in just a few years. These children are ahead in success, productivity, health, balance and happiness.

         The significance to Australia of this systematic development of mental potential, in particular creativity, cannot be overemphasised. Innovation and lateral thinking are the essence of our nation's future. In the past, these high level qualities were thought to be inborn and not capable of cultivation. Today, with Maharishi's Vedic science, it is possible for anyone to enhance creativity. The capacity for brilliant insight can be systematically cultivated to an extraordinary degree. In particular, the Vedic techniques of transcendental meditation, and its more advanced counterpart the TM-Sidhi program, are critical to this achievement. Australia's future depends on the development of creativity and innovation to provide new products and services.

         The third set of evidence is that scientific research in prisons shows that Vedic methods of rehabilitation can successfully reverse criminal behaviour. The studies show that recidivism rates reduced from as high as 80 per cent to as little as 10 per cent. This means a reduction of at least 80 per cent in the number of repeat offenders in our society. As we know, the cost is at least $40,000 per prisoner per year to maintain them in confinement, let alone the immense cost of damage, injury, detection and apprehension. This means a saving of untold millions of dollars per year in addition to the human cost to criminals, victims and their families.

         Over 40 studies in the past 20 years indicate that a very small number of people—even a few hundred or a few thousand individuals—in a group using the most advanced Vedic techniques of consciousness, in particular yogic flying, can achieve all of these results within months. Such a group is called a group for a government because it enhances government achievements in these ways. By creating coherence in collective consciousness, the group for a government program enlivens the very basis of governmental success; namely, the collective intelligence of the whole population. It is therefore a true and legitimate administrative strategy. It is one that operates on a level never before adequately addressed by any government.

         I refer to the area of crime reduction. The most dramatic demonstration of this technology took place recently in a large, formal and high quality research project conducted in Washington DC in July 1993, some 18 months ago. The Washington study was extremely rigorous. It was supervised by the District of Columbia Council, the District of Columbia Police and an independent board of scholars from local universities. The research team predicted that, with the introduction of the group practice of yogic flying by about 4,000 people, crime would be reduced by 20 per cent. In fact, crime was reduced by 18 per cent within a month. Furthermore, the research showed that, if the project had been continued for 100 days, the reduction in crime would have been at 40 per cent.

It involved a case whereby the state of Western Australia and Malcolm Douglas, the proprietor of the Broome Crocodile Farm, took action against the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner. Early last year, the minister had issued a declaration which stopped any further development of the Broome Crocodile Farm due to the development allegedly occurring in an area which was sensitive to local Aboriginal cultural and spiritual interests.

         Early last year, I raised many questions with the minister and spoke on this matter many times in this chamber. One of the matters that I raised frequently was the question of natural justice and political accountability. It seems that the Federal Court agrees with me, because today all three declarations were declared invalid. They were declared invalid because of a breach of natural justice and improper process. The court found that the minister has breached his duty under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, in that he had not pursued proper process in consultation with the state minister in Western Australia. Furthermore, during the proceedings of mediation and consultation, various submissions were made to Mr Chaney without them being revealed to Mr Douglas or the state government. When Mr Chaney's report was forwarded to the minister, there was some suggestion that he did not read all the submissions that had been made to Mr Chaney.

That is an affront to justice in this country; it is an affront to the rules of natural justice. The court found squarely against the minister in relation to all three declarations. That decision was handed down today by His Honour Justice Carr.

One can only question whether Mr Tickner adopted the same bullyboy tactics when he stopped the development of the bridge from Goolwa to Hindmarsh Island in South Australia which sent a private developer bankrupt.

The first of these is the criticisms of the high conservation value forest identification exercise that was conducted by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. The criticisms that have been made do not hold water and are largely a political exercise designed to remove what little protection the process had given to some areas of high conservation value forests.

         In my belief, the criticisms were designed, and are designed, to discredit the conservation movement, but they will fail. The reports that were put together by these conservation councils and bodies around the country were based on the work of eminent scientists and were sent to a range of federal and state departments for comment. In many instances, information on the value of areas was drawn from government agencies and industry.

         I wish to make a major point which was already made by Senator Faulkner in question time, and I am very glad of that. It seems to have been overlooked in the public debate. When there have been attempts to discredit the coupes that have been set aside for protection by making statements such as that they contain airstrips and areas that have already been logged, there is a failure to understand that the boundaries of coupes and forests blocks are set by state agencies.

        The forest industries and some politicians are at present claiming that some areas on the list of high conservation value coupes and compartments presented by the Prime Minister from Mr Faulkner's original list are not of high conservation value. Why is this misleading?
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Most claims of this sort rely on the fact that a coupe or compartment contains some form of disturbance, such as an old air strip, quarry or plantation. This ignores the very simple fact that a coupe or compartment can contain a small area of non-high conservation value and still contain large areas of high conservation value forest. In such cases, a small area of low conservation value is being used to claim that a large area of high conservation value is of low conservation value. People making claims of this sort are either simply naive or are not scientifically literate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The industry will also assert that many of these areas have been logged before, and ask you to make the assumption that this means these areas should not be on the high conservation list. What has to be realised is that within a set area, such as a coupe or compartment, it is possible to log part of the area, with the remaining forest still untouched. This is in fact common practice. It is a silly leap of logic that dictates this means that the untouched forest is also of low conservation value. The recommendations for protection were based on the value of the unlogged forest within such compartments, not the patches of regrowth. It is also possible that some coupes or compartments have been selectively harvested many decades ago. Those practices involved the removal of low numbers of carefully selected trees, and is very different to the far more destructive logging practices of today. While this past selective logging may have caused some damage to some of the area's conservation values, in many cases they still represent the last examples of those forest communities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Another interesting piece of misdirection is the insinuation that this exercise was meant to be the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories' (DEST) definitive exercise on the identification of areas of high conservation value. This claim is incorrect, but it is used in an attempt to make the exercise appear to be of a low standard by comparing it to other larger projects. In fact this exercise was never meant to be the end of the process, but simply an interim measure to prevent further loss of high conservation value forests until fully adequate surveys of all forest values could be completed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        What critics have further failed to realise is that the exercise surveyed a wide range of conservation values beyond just old growth, including wilderness, World Heritage, endangered species, water catchment values and Aboriginal values. It is essential that when assessing an area all these values are considered.
       </para>

Senator Faulkner recommended that 21 of them be protected. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) listed two. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has raised that number to 12. I might add that that fails to protect them, because access to them has not been protected by that response. Roads are being made and disturbance is continuing within those areas.

         CALM has scheduled 75 blocks for logging in the central and southern forest regions of Western Australia in 1995. Mr Keating identified only 12 for the temporary protection that may be afforded by his rapid assessment process. So we believe it is very serious that the process fails to protect even those areas that are supposedly being looked at.

         A concern in Western Australia is that the state environment minister, Mr Kevin Minson, has ordered Western Australian loggers to ignore the ban on logging in the Rosa forest block south of Nannup, which was one of the areas identified by Mr Keating. Yesterday CALM informed the conservationists from the local community of Northcliffe that they would stop work on a logging super-highway through Jane Forest near the town. Today CALM contractors were again felling trees to make way for the road with little regard for the protesters who are trying to protect that area of forest.

         My second point relates to a passing comment of Senator Abetz earlier today. Senator Abetz dismissed the phrase that forests could be lost forever. He made a joke of it and said that forests could only be lost if the areas were dynamited and destroyed totally so that nothing could grow on them. I must put on the public record and inform Senator Abetz that he is clearly displaying his ignorance as to the difference between forests and trees and the degree to which forests can be affected by logging.

         A forest is much more than an area where trees grow. I particularly want to differentiate it from regrowth, or what grows after clear-felling has taken place. Forests have biodiversity. They have different species of trees and foliage growing in them. They form a complete ecosystem and provide habitat and a range of flora and fauna that makes them irreplaceable once they are logged.

         There is a very beautiful area known as the 100-year old forest near Boranup in south-west Western Australia. Many people have been there. I have really enjoyed it myself. It took some education for me to realise that it is a karri forest that is the result of intensive logging. Instead of a real old-growth forest with diversity and a complete ecosystem being created, a monoculture has been produced. Because it is 100 years old, it is very beautiful and definitely evidence to support the argument which people often use that `forests or trees grow back'.

         Anybody who wanders through that forest will notice that in some places the very beautiful, tall karri trees are close together. On one walk, I noticed that four trees growing together in a very outstanding way were all growing out of one stump. So, in a sense, that forest is not the forest that was logged. It is a different forest that is 100 years old and which has a value of its own.

         We are trying to protect—this is what the debate is about—those old-growth areas of forest that still remain. Those high conservation value forests that still remain need to be protected in a way that that area was not. It is not a question of their not growing again. Cleared land, which produces salinity and water catchment problems, will sometimes not grow again. We are not saying that the forest industry will prevent trees growing; we are saying that the forests that we so prize in our community will be lost forever. New  growth will occur, but it will not be the same. It is an irretrievable position. That is why it is very important that the federal and state governments do not lose the political will, which they have not demonstrated so far but which the community is demanding of them, to protect those areas.

        AUSTRALIAS LEADING FOREST ECOLOGISTS CALL FOR BETTER PROTECTION OF NATIVE FORESTS
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Responding to the continuing debate over the future of the export woodchip industry, some of Australias leading forest ecologists have called upon the Commonwealth and State Governments and all parts of the Australian community to act decisively to protect the nations remaining old growth eucalypt forests and other forests vital for the long term conservation of biological diversity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The initiation of an export woodchip industry has led to the increased logging of Australias forests. This increased logging is largely due to clearfelling and is concentrated in forests which are largely undisturbed and contain large mature trees. Many plants and animals depend on large mature trees for essential resources such as food and shelter. Such species are restricted to forests that have had little or not disturbance from unnatural processes such as clearfelling. The impact on plants and animals living on the ground is also of particular concern.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Over half of our native forests have been permanently cleared since European occupation, and the present rate of forest clearance in many Australian regions well exceeds that observed in the Amazon Basin. The current conservation reserve system is inadequate and fails to protect many distinct types of old growth forest and biodiversity. Australian Governments and the community must take action if these unique ecosystems and forest biodiversity are to be conserved.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australias forests will never be managed sustainably if Governments continue with the present piecemeal approach of assessing individual compartments and coupes. Proper planning and management requires the comprehensive assessment of forests at a regional level. Australian Governments gave a commitment in the National Forest Policy Statement to undertake regional assessments so as to ensure the adequate protection of wilderness and old growth forests. This commitment must be followed through.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the absence of comprehensive regional assessments, the most prudent course of action for the Commonwealth and State Governments to take is to immediately suspend logging in the 1300 compartments nominated by the Federal Environment Minister, Senator John Faulkner. The process by which Senator Faulkners department determined the 1300 areas
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </emphasis>
        to have high conservation values was a reasonable and valid process. These 1300 areas represent only a proportion of the native forest scheduled for logging in 1995. The conservation values of these areas, and particularly the 509 compartments to be fast-tracked, must now be determined by a thorough and independent scientific review involving institutions such as CSIRO and universities. Because of the known and potential ecological significance of these forest areas, this review must draw upon the best available information and will require collaboration between governments, scientists and the community.

         The woodchipping issue and the forest issue must be redressed by looking at a transition strategy that suits the workers in the industry and the conservation movement. In this debate, there needs to be a dialogue between all the parties that are being affected. I must add that the ecotourism industry that is growing in Western Australia, which will provide a valuable avenue for the very poorly paid jobs in the woodchipping industry, is one of the parties in this dialogue. We plead to the government to not lose its responsibility for this matter and to protect the forests of Australia.

        (3) Where export licence conditions have been breached a licence can be revoked or financial penalties applied. Specifically in the case raised by the honourable senator, State Forests of New South Wales have investigated the alleged breaches and have concluded that there were three breaches of logging prescriptions. I understand that State Forests of New South Wales is taking disciplinary action in relation to these breaches. I understand that the State's Environment Protection Agency is also investigating whether the breaches contravene the pollution licence issued to State Forests of New South Wales. Appropriate follow up action consistent with the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations under the Export Control Act 1982 will be taken in all cases where breaches have been demonstrated.

        I announced in December that the 1995 export licences contained tough new conditions to protect the environment. I also announced that measures are being developed to improve monitoring of environmental conditions in woodchip export licences. I will be increasing the intensity of the Commonwealth's monitoring of compliance with licence conditions. I will require the Chief Executive Officer of each company holding a licence to provide a report to me at the end of the year of the company's compliance with the conditions of the licence.

        I am advised that all sawlogs of the minor species are sold to sawmills. State approved timber classification officers inspect logs prior to chipping to ensure sawlogs have not been incorrectly classified. Forestry Tasmania also has a system of random checks to ensure a high standard of log classification.

        As the value of sawlogs is higher than that of pulplogs there is an economic incentive for managers of wood production forests to maximise sawlog recovery rather than convert sawlogs to woodchips.
