         In taking on the position of Chairman of Committees and Deputy President of the Senate, I think all senators here would know that I leave the position of opposition whip with some reluctance. It is a job that I have enjoyed enormously over the years. I want to acknowledge those I have worked with in the position. I think we have been a fairly happy subset of the Senate and have enjoyed working together. I think of Senator Knowles and Senator Panizza, who have been deputy whips to me since I took on the position in 1987, and Senator Bourne of the Democrats. One could not really call Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts whips, but they were always there and one could not ignore their presence; at various times they became part of the group.

I think we came to understand each other and knew when which words meant what, and when silence meant something else. Gerry, I have enjoyed working with you. I shall miss the contact we have had and I have had with those who have been supporting you over the years that you have been whip. I can see Senator Faulkner over there; he has risen to great heights. There is also Senator McKiernan, who fulfilled the position for three years, I think, and more recently Senator Foreman.

         The whip's office is not one that people take much notice of, and it certainly has no profile outside the building. But for those who have been privileged to be a part of that small group, it has been a very happy relationship; so has working with the various parliamentary liaison officers, who are also an important part of the whips group. I thank the Senate for this honour, and I look forward to fulfilling the position.

         Senator Reid is in the unique position of having been chosen by the Commonwealth parliament itself in 1981, after Senator Knight's death, and she has been re-elected to the Senate on five occasions so far—a feat which not many senators are likely to emulate, let alone surpass; not that I think Senator McMullan, from the ACT as well, will be letting any grass grow under him in that respect.

         Senator Reid was elected, as she has acknowledged, deputy government whip in 1982-83 and has been opposition whip from 1983, in one capacity or another. It is a very long period of service to a party, and to the Senate more generally. We fully anticipate that Senator Reid will carry out her new functions with the same commitment and sense of responsibility that she has always displayed in her whip's duties. I can very accurately say that Senator Reid is popular on all sides of this chamber for her personal qualities of warmth, charm and humanity, and we fully expect those qualities to be even more consistently and publicly on display in her new role. We wish her all the best and we expect nothing less than that from her in that new job.

         I also take this opportunity to express appreciation for the services of the former Deputy President, Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I said at the time of Senator Crichton-Browne's appointment in August 1993 that I had always considered him to be above the political fray in this place—whatever might be the case elsewhere—and I looked forward to him exercising his responsibilities as Deputy President with not only, as I said, efficiency and dispatch, but also wisdom, judgment and even-handed good humour. I can say again quite honestly that, during his tenure in the office, Senator Crichton-Browne displayed amply all those characteristics. I think we all regret the circumstances that have led to him leaving the position and we wish him well for the future.

         Senator Reid brings many qualities to this position—not only, of course, that she was a South Australian, brought up in South Australia and educated there; not only because she is a legal practitioner, and we all recognise the benefit of that in effective legislative practice; not only because she has given a lifetime commitment to politics and to her political party—I think she was a Young Liberal president some little time ago—not only because she is a competent legislator; and not only because she has a particular interest in helping build the parliaments of the South Pacific, an interest which she will be able to pursue in her new role.

We have been involved in discussions in order to see that this place is run in an orderly way. Those discussions have been with Senator Reid and Senator Gerry Jones. Senator Reid, you might think that being whip of a party is an onerous task; but to be the whip of an individual who has to explain to all and sundry why he voted in a particular way on a particular bill does require some degree of discipline. It may not be terribly obvious to all concerned in this place, but I would like to be regarded as one of the whips. However, I do not expect the Remuneration Tribunal to pay me higher duties for that.

         It is very important to have Senator Reid, a person with experience, a pleasant character, legal training and tenacity, as chair of committees. The Committee of the Whole functions are supposed to be performed by the Friday legislative committees of the Senate. It may not be known to everybody, but some of us know that funding for these committees—and perhaps for the whole committee system—is under attack. This is not the time to debate that point but Senator Reid, with her strength of character and ability to put forward a very good argument, may be very handy. I am sure that she will be a great asset to you, Mr President, in your very fine work in that area.

We do so with mixed feelings, because I think there is great sadness that she is replacing our respected colleague Senator Olive Zakharov. But we are thrilled that she has been replaced by a woman and by someone who, I am sure, will contribute a great deal to this place.

It even legislated tax cuts to reinforce its promise. All of these promises it has broken and, worse, it seems never intended to keep. What credibility does this government claim when it puts down a budget tonight to the background of such blatant electoral abuse? Why should the people believe the word of Mr Keating, who has demonstrated on so many occasions that he will do or say anything to get elected but will then treat the voters with such scant regard?

         The figure of 500 tonnes was an estimate that came from the Australian Lot Feeders Association of the amount of grain that would be carried at normal operational rates during two eight-hour shifts. It was envisaged by AQIS that separate trials would be required for each feedlot for each kind of imported grain. That was stated from the start. At the very least, that would require trials of 3,000 tonnes. So the figure of 500 tonnes is and always has been a furphy.

         The forecast for the period 1992-93 was agreed to be appropriately set at something over four per cent, without apparently much disagreement at all as between the advisers. In the event, of course, for 1992-93, that forecast was not met because the growth outturn was only of the order of 2.5 per cent. But there were plenty of other people who got that particular year's forecast wrong around the world, including the OECD, the IMF and a number of other international forecasters who had to progressively revise down their forecast for growth. That was the case for us as well.

         What is important to appreciate is that the outyear forecasts as published in that 1992 One Nation statement—and they are all there in the document and I will remind you of them in a moment; over which forecasts there was apparently some lively discussion bordering on, one might almost say, disagreement within the JEFG—were either broadly achieved or, in fact, exceeded.

         For 1993-94, the One Nation forecast was 4.5 per cent; in fact, the achieved rate was 4.2 per cent. For 1994-95, the current year, the forecast rate was 4.25 per cent in One Nation. The outturn for this year, when announced, will be, we expect, in the range of 4 1/2 to five per cent. For next year, 1995-96, the One Nation forecast set by this particular group about whom Mr Cole is talking was 3.75 per cent, and our present forecast for 1995-96 is exactly the same figure—3.75 per cent. So anyone who suggests that those One Nation figures were in any way pumped or inflated or the product of any kind of deliberate fabrication is simply getting their facts wrong. It does not represent the circumstance; it does not represent the process that was at work.

         I think there is one final general point that also needs to be acknowledged; that is, figures of this kind are not the property of any particular officials within any particular department; they are the government's figures. The government has ownership of them. The government assumes responsibility for them. When the government gets those figures wrong, we expect to get the blame. When the government gets the figures right, we expect to—even though we never do—get the applause as a government because we accept the responsibility, we make the judgment.

         It is interesting to see how few of you have been interested in chasing down the personal officials who may have been responsible for last year's budget figures, for example, when we underestimated in our forecast growth; we underestimated employment growth; we underestimated investment growth; and we overestimated inflation. Where did we hear from you then in terms of the accuracy of that particular process and who was to be responsible for it? The point is that forecasting is an inexact science which represents a balance of inputs from a variety of sources. It is done in the best possible way that we or any other government can do, and that is what was done on this occasion.

         Senators will recall that on 30 September last year I announced a number of measures in response to this issue, including senior level discussions. Those discussions produced a memorandum of understanding on 25 January this year. The MOU covered the return of these people to China and their continued protection. On 9 February this year the parliament passed legislation which declared China a safe third country for Vietnamese refugees previously resettled in China. Both the MOU and the subsequent legislation were supported publicly by the UNHCR, which organisation has been closely involved with the Vietnamese since they were resettled in southern China in the early 1980s.

The starting points for the stockpiles of the three smaller nuclear powers is very much smaller than those of the other two. That is one of the reasons why they have been dragging their feet somewhat. Nonetheless, they are under real pressure from all of us at the nuclear non-proliferation conference to make serious commitments in that respect. I hope and believe that they will be honoured. Indeed, it is to be expected that there will emerge from the NPT conference in New York a pretty clear declaration of obligations in this respect so far as all the nuclear weapons states are concerned.

         So far as nuclear testing is concerned, we have made our position absolutely clear on the record. In my case, I did so yesterday in a statement, following discussions I had with foreign minister Juppe a couple of weeks ago in France. On all predictions, he is likely to be the prime minister of France in the new government and will have a continuing influence in this respect.

They need some kind of testing, whether by way of actual explosions or simulation, to enable that to occur.

There is some chance that it may, because the French are very conscious of the number of countries not only in this region but around the world that are urging them to play a responsible leadership role in this respect. They do not want France to just go down the path of looking inwardly and self-consciously at its own interests but rather at the larger interests of a world that wants to see genuine nuclear disarmament.

Given recent World Bank reports that even the predictions of benefits to the agricultural sector may be illusory and that the World Bank has noted that, for the EU, Japan and the US, agricultural protection may not drop as a result of the choice of base year and `dirty tariffication', how can the government justify the level of sacrifices exacted from many value added industries, including those processing primary commodities for the local market?

         You then come to a more important issue, which is the publicity concerning the World Bank report claiming that the benefits to Australian agriculture from the Uruguay Round would be less than the ABARE analysis in Australia. In many ways we welcome that World Bank report. The message it sends to the major agricultural-distorting economies—the United States, the European Union and Japan—is that the process of agricultural reform globally is far from over. What took place as a result of the Uruguay Round was merely a welcome first step, but there is still a long way to go.

         The distinction between the analysis the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has made and that made by the World Bank is that ABARE took into account additional important benefits to Australia such as market access, which was not part of the analysis made by the World Bank. It took into account the fact that, as from this year, we will be able to export rice to Japan and Korea. It took into account the fact that we will be able to export hundreds of millions of dollars worth of beef to the United States over and above that which we could previously do.

         So those are things which the World Bank assessment, because it was a global assessment, was unable to take into account, but they are of enormous benefit to Australians.

What matters is what Iran's behaviour actually is and what the Australian government can do, if anything, to influence it. There certainly has been longstanding high-level Iranian government support for organisations like Hezbollah and Hamas, intense opposition expressed to Israel and the Middle East peace process and little respect shown for the human rights of political and religious dissidents. The Australian government has found these positions deeply unpalatable and has consistently said so. We also remain concerned about Iran's intentions in relation to the acquisition of nuclear and chemical weapons capability. But our generally cordial relationship with Iran and the strong trade and commercial links between our two countries have put us in a strong position to maintain a much more direct and critical dialogue with the Iranians on these issues than would otherwise have been possible.

         As to the question of terrorism, Australia, of course, condemns terrorism wherever and whenever it occurs. We have been aware for many years of allegations of Iranian support for terrorist attacks against various targets. But available evidence of a direct Iranian role, as distinct from the role of Iran-supported organisations, and evidence of direct high level government support for such attacks, has been extremely limited. In the event that more such evidence were to be forthcoming and, in particular, any evidence suggesting any change for the worse in Iranian behaviour, we would obviously have to reconsider our position on the whole bilateral relationship.

         As to the serious point about the best way to deal with sick children in child care, which was made in the middle of all that abuse and rubbish, that has been a matter of the gravest concern for government. I think Senator Patterson knows that, because we have had a number of investigations and inquiries into it. The issues have been canvassed with parents. They say that, as the highest priority, the best way they would like to see sick children dealt with—in particular, their own sick children—is in the familiar place that those children know best, their home. Secondly, the examination of how best to deal with the matter of sick children raised very difficult issues of protocols for admission to child-care centres—protocols for what constituted disease, how best to manage it all, and so on.

In the light of all of that, I think the need for child care to be provided at home remains. The difficulty with protocols and risks of cross-infection remain. In the light of all the information, I would have to say that it is unlikely that the program will proceed. I have noticed that article, and I am certainly going to seek further information about it because it does raise very important issues. I will be seeking a full briefing on Senator Patterson's question.

         Certainly it is not government policy to suggest that in any way the attendance of British representatives would be inappropriate on that occasion.

         ABARE and the Australian government were aware during the course of the negotiations that the three economic units to which I refer—the United States, the European Union and Japan—were seeking to minimise the concessions they had to make.

         I was talking with members of the citrus industry yesterday. One of the benefits for the citrus industry that we were talking about was the agreement by Korea to allow into its market 15,000 tonnes of oranges per year—if I recall the figures correctly—and the possibility of significant new markets for the citrus industry in Thailand and Taiwan. So there are significant benefits. They are benefits which are not as significant and as substantial as they should have been but this is not something that has occurred since the Uruguay Round; it is something of which we were aware. There continue to be activities by the major economic groupings of the European Union and major nations such as the United States which may circumvent, at least temporarily, the full benefits which should flow to Australia and other fair traders in agriculture.

They were measuring the fact that, had it not been for this so-called dirty tariffication, the reduction in tariffs on agriculture in the major markets would have been of even greater benefit to Australia than it is. That is true. We would have liked to have gained more.

         —by leave—With respect to the answer to question No. 2094 given by the Minister representing the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), I note that, following my advice to the minister's office today that I was going to ask him why he had not provided an answer to my question on notice regarding Operation Wallah, what he described in writing and again a moment ago as an interim answer was provided to my office just prior to 2 o'clock this afternoon. That answer was to the effect that the Australian Federal Police assessment of alleged Commonwealth offences involving matters referred from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission's Operation Wallah was almost complete and that when that matter was finalised he would be in a better position to provide comprehensive answers to my questions.

         I make the point to the minister that there is no provision in the procedural orders for an interim answer. The procedural orders simply provide for an answer to be given or for an explanation to be given as to why an answer has not been given. I ask the minister whether what he describes as an interim answer is an explanation as to why I have not received an answer to my question on notice. If it is intended to be an explanation, I have to say that it is an entirely unsatisfactory one because in no way does the question I placed on notice go to the detail of the alleged Commonwealth offences that are supposedly being assessed by the Australian Federal Police.

         There is no necessity for that assessment to be completed before the minister can provide me with an adequate answer to the question I have put on notice. In fact, the information ought to be available to him now. He has had a month to provide the answer. He is simply abusing the procedures of the Senate by providing what he describes as an interim answer rather than a full and complete answer to my question.

         Do you want me to list the questions for you, Senator Bolkus, so that even you can see your response is not relevant to the question that was asked? The nature of the question that was asked by Senator Chapman was: what are the specific dates on which the initial briefings involving the Criminal Justice Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority took place, as identified by the minister in the reply to question on notice No. 1887? Why does that require some form of judicial inquiry before the answer can be given? These are matters within the province of the minister. He has the information at hand, and he is simply refusing to put it before the Senate. Why is he refusing to answer this question? We would not have had even this feeble attempt at an explanation if Senator Chapman had not said that he was intending to raise it today.

         It relates to all parts of the question. The second part was: who was involved in these briefings? Does that require a special inquiry? Why did the CJC advise the AFP and the NCA of its inquiries relating to Operation Wallah if the information provided did not disclose to the Commonwealth agencies the commission by any person of any Commonwealth offences? We understand the sensitivity of these matters, but that does not justify the minister in avoiding his responsibility to answer.

What were the possible Commonwealth offences that were identified? Who received this advice and where did the briefing take place? Who provided this advice to the Commonwealth authorities and how was this advice communicated? And so I could go on. Why can't the minister answer these questions and why shouldn't he be obliged to answer these questions? He is the only minister in this place who believes, in fact, that he can just draw a line through a question that has been asked and not have any responsibility to answer it.

What is the point of having a standing order that requires an answer within 60 days if the minister is simply going to be able to come into this place and say, `There is a third party inquiry taking place'—irrelevant to the question that was asked—`and until that has completed its process, I am not going to answer your questions'?

         Senator Chapman is certainly justified in bringing this matter before the Senate today, and it is our responsibility to not allow the minister to get away with his attempt to avoid his responsibility. We will continue to pursue it—we will pursue it in estimates; we will pursue it here in the chamber. We will move the appropriate resolutions, if necessary, in this place. Senator Faulkner, who is so interested in his program, ought to take note that we will pursue it during the course of this session of the parliament.

It was a domestic incident about which nobody has the awareness, the understanding, the knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it, or the manifestation of it.

         Do I in future make an issue as to whether someone in this chamber is a homosexual or not? Do I make an issue as to whether or not one of my colleagues happens to be a lesbian? Do I make an issue as to whether or not members of the press gallery are having affairs with ministers of state or with members of the frontbench of the opposition? Are they issues that go to the heart and touch upon your capacity and ability to discharge responsibilities and duties? I do not know, but it is important that we ask ourselves the question as to what is a public matter and what is a private matter. It seems to me that we are going down the road of the American system, where much of what is raised has absolutely nothing to do with one's character, ability, responsibility or capacity to discharge one's responsibilities but is simply idle, dirty gossip for the sheer fun and fascination of a public which will always find such matters inviting.

         For me, entering the Senate and entering parliament was simply an utter indulgence of my own. It gave no financial benefit to my family. I can tell you that it has cost them an absolute fortune. It has meant that I have spent much of my time away from my family, but it was something I decided to do and something they sacrificed. That is why I raise the question as to what price they have to pay for my having made the decision I did and then being prepared to carry that sacrifice.

         Can I just touch upon one other quite unrelated matter. Recently I have read in the press that Noel Ashley Crichton-Browne is in some way a liability to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I do not want to indulge myself, but I do want to put on public record for the benefit of the family that for 10 years of my life I worked full time in a voluntary capacity for the party. I drew no salary; I drew no costs; I drew no benefits; I drew no rewards. I simply did it because I had a commitment. Coming into parliament was not part of my program; it was not part of my agenda. I simply did it because I thought it was part of the contribution that our family should make. Simple arithmetic will tell you what I was capable of earning and what it cost us as a family over those 10 years.

         Today I rang Western Australia to ask what my record was. I was reminded that when I ran the campaign in 1977 Charles Court got 54 per cent of the vote—the highest vote the Liberal Party had ever recorded. You can tell me there are a thousand reasons why we did it, but there always are when you win. I started the Kalgoorlie North division of the Liberal Party and we held every single seat north of the 26th parallel. I do not know who has been north of the 26th parallel in Western Australia besides Senator Cook and Senator Chris Evans, but it is a pretty hard grind. We held all those seats in areas which might be equated to Mount Isa, Gladstone or Port Kembla because we had the infrastructure on the ground and the capacity, the facility and the ability to win.

I do not take any pride in telling the Senate that when I was asked to run the recent Helena by-election in Western Australia, it was the first time since 1951, and the only other occasion since Federation, that a government has won a seat from the opposition. At the last state election, which I had the dubious distinction of also managing, we won 55.4 per cent of the vote—the highest vote the Liberal Party has ever received in Western Australia.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Newman this day, relating to an Australian Quarantine Inspection Service report concerning the importation of salmon to Tasmania.

        I draw attention to the fact that the interim risk analysis report by AQIS recommends that wild Canadian and United States salmon be brought into Australia as the risk is negligible. I understand that there is a 60-day consultation process, as does the salmonoid industry. But I am rather concerned about some aspects of this and I think it is important that I put those concerns on the record now. I will certainly make a presentation to the minister some time down the track.

         It is important to know that Senator Sherry made a very important point on Sunday when he said that the decision on this matter would be made on scientific grounds. I have no problem with that; but I do have a problem with a draft report being released, it having been said that it is going to be made on scientific grounds, and the industry itself not being able to obtain a copy of the CSIRO report from the division of animal health. This is one of the major reports that AQIS used to bring down the interim risk analysis draft that it has to comment on. I wonder why it has been so secretive about it. The fact that salmonoid growers made an FOI application about this matter makes me wonder why it has not been released for these people to peruse so that they can come forward with better based queries on this matter.

         The ABARE report—another report that was taken into account—raised the fact that an outbreak of diseases had the potential to wipe out the Tasmanian salmon industry. The CSIRO findings also pointed out that eight major diseases will be present in the gutted, uncooked Canadian salmon that comes in. The fact that that is going to happen, if it is allowed to go ahead, raises alarm bells in this very new and very important industry to Tasmania.

         I was quite surprised at the meeting on Sunday when one of the scientific people produced another report by AQIS on its inquiry into ballast water. One of the points that was made in that report was that there were 13 diseases that could come into Australian waters, and it recommended very strict rules to stop that happening. Yet we have another AQIS report which says that it is okay to bring in Canadian uncooked salmon with eight major diseases in it. That is why these questions have to be asked and why the industry has to get all these answers.

         I asked a question of one of the other scientific people there—we talk about scientific facts, and I think that is what this decision has to be based on. I asked: how many countries in the world have a disease free status with fisheries? The answer I got was that there were two—Australia and New Zealand—and there is now only one in the whole world that has disease free status, Australia. The reason New Zealand has diseases is that it allowed the importation of fish product, obviously a decision based on a report similar to the one that has been released by AQIS.

         Why should an industry in Tasmania which has been put together by private enterprise over a long period of time with its own risk capital now be put at risk? It has had all the problems one could think of—bringing a fish from the Northern Hemisphere which it was said would not survive in the south; the fish spent three years in quarantine in New South Wales and was bred from there so that there would be no risk at all of any introduced disease in Australia. The industry is now exporting over $100 million worth of product and is providing in the south of the state something like 2,000 jobs. To place that industry at risk is unacceptable.

In other words, all households and everyone in business is paying a premium of about two per cent compared to the bond rate in New Zealand or in the USA.

Basically, international financial markets do not trust government and do not trust us for our fiscal record or our inflation rate record. What do we need to do? We need independently published figures. There has been a start made on this with the publication of the national fiscal outlook but that needs to be done on a regular basis without the government's interference.

         New Zealand, just across the Tasman, has set up a regime under its Fiscal Responsibility Act to put out estimates that are guaranteed by the government to be the best estimates by its Treasury and to be without political interference. We need a similar system here so the markets can have faith in the credibility of what comes from government. Perhaps if that were done for some time businesses and households would be paying a lower rate of interest on their loans. It could be up to two per cent lower than we have at present.

         —We have just heard a regurgitation of the assertions made by the opposition during question time. At that time they were wrapped in the form of a question; they are now wrapped in the form of a direct statement. Neither form is true; both are wrong. Nonetheless, the opposition, which obviously seeks comfort in trying to besmirch the reputation of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and paint him as something he is not, and which seeks comfort as well in any figures it can find—no matter how arcane they might be—that reflect in any way on Australia's economic performance, is taking comfort in trying to argue the case that the economy is in bad shape and, therefore, the opposition should be elected to government.

         This is a preposterous fallacy, one that anyone who knows anything about the Australian economy would see through instantly. But since the opposition does it constantly, one imagines it is for the reason that if enough mud is thrown at someone, some of it will stick and, therefore, the reputation of the Prime Minister and the efficacy of the economy will be undermined.

         The answer given by Senator Gareth Evans in question time today was accurate in every respect. There is a body within the Commonwealth government called JEFG, the Joint Economic Forecasting Group. It is a body drawn from a number of Commonwealth government agencies as well as departments, whose job it is to forecast the directions of the economy and to provide advice to the government on what those forecasts are. Traditionally and typically, it forecasts half-yearly and yearly.

         The One Nation statement was not a budget in which the forecasts would have been geared to inform the government. It was a one-off statement made, as I recall, in January or February of 1991. It was made as a countercyclical statement to put growth back into the economy. It worked. The growth figures that we are experiencing—the decrease in unemployment, the increase in profit share—show that the countercyclical measures used by the government actually worked. That is not the point of what the opposition raises here.

         In order to frame such a document, the government had to turn to estimates of future growth. What JEFG had forecast was in its typical yearly and half-yearly review periods. What the One Nation statement—falling at an odd time—required was medium-term forecasts. In order to get a medium-term forecast that JEFG was not geared to provide, on page 120 of One Nation you will find reported to the public at large the committee that assessed the measures being applied in One Nation. Since they were stimulus measures, you also find what additional benefit or growth to economy those stimulus measures would produce. Because you had a regular cycle forecast, you were operating at an odd time. You assembled a body of Treasury, PM&amp;C and ministerial officials to provide the necessary information for the forecasts. That is all reported. It is in the papers of One Nation. If you argue it, have a look at the papers. That is what happened.

         There was dispute within that committee, but every member of that committee signed off on the recommendation in the end. It is no news to this place that there are disputes in committees; it happens all the time. But the members reconciled themselves, agreed and signed off on it. So let us not have this smear that somehow the Prime Minister involved himself in baking the books. He did not. Anyone who proposes that is not telling the truth.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Forshaw this day, relating to retail chains and small business.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        This afternoon, Senator Schacht outlined some of the possible measures and some of the ways in which the Commonwealth government might be able to assist small business with its difficulties with chain stores in the Hunter Valley. We have had in this country since the 1950s a growth in chain stores. Until recently, the small businesses of this country have been able to compete successfully. Two things have changed in recent times. One is 24-hour trading, which the small businesses—often family businesses—find virtually impossible to compete with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second thing that has changed is predatory pricing. This has come in a disturbing way in many areas of the Hunter, where big chain stores have forced out of business nearby small businesses by reducing prices for a sustained period. When the other small businesses have gone broke, they have gone back to their old pricing systems. The effect of this in an area like the Hunter is quite devastating. We have at the moment one business closing a day.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a very wide range of types of businesses affected by this. Fruit shops, chemists, delicatessens, bakeries, butcheries and take-away food outlets are all being affected by these policies. Recently in the suburb of Mayfield a brand new chain store opened, and the effect on the surrounding shops has been quite devastating. The business that probably finds it most difficult of all to compete with the chains is fresh fruit. Many other businesses, such as pharmacists, can provide specialist services that the chains cannot, but it is difficult in the area of fresh food such as fruit.

         In this case I went into this man's fruit shop in Merewether. It was a very big fruit shop; it was a very professionally run business. But the fact was he was losing money in that shop. He supplied the naval ships that went into Newcastle and that was the area from which he got his profit to subsidise his shop. If this man who is such an efficient businessman cannot make a go of it, no wonder one shop a day is shutting in the Hunter.

         The business operators in the Hunter became so concerned about this that they held a meeting recently where 500 people turned up. The local Labor members were not very helpful in their response at that time and so they wrote to Minister Schacht, who is the minister for small business. And this was his reply:

        It would seem that the changing face of retailing, and the move away from specialty stores to large "one-stop" shopping centres that cater for the normal buying needs of the community, has impacted significantly on small businesses. This is regrettable. However, the changes in shopping behaviour are the result of changes in the nature of society, with greater demands for convenience and range to reflect different lifestyles. Unfortunately, it is the larger supermarkets who are best placed to meet these new demands.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a very unsympathetic response. Fortunately, since that time and since representations I have made, the minister has been prepared to meet a delegation from the small business people in the Hunter. We believe that they are being targeted as part of a lead campaign which will then spread through the rest of Australia and affect businesses in the rest of Australia.

         I want this minister to sit down with the people of the Hunter who can tell him not only how this is affecting their businesses and their lifestyle but how it is affecting the employment opportunities for young people in a region of high unemployment. I realise that some areas with which this matter is concerned, such as trading hours, are the province of state governments—and state governments urgently need to look at trading hours. This minister should convene the ministerial council to discuss how these things can be changed.

         But within the Trade Practices Commission the minister has more power than he is letting on. Let us see a real attempt to try to improve the situation for small business who do not mind competing. But they want to compete on a level playing field and they are not getting it under the present regime. Let the minister come and listen. Let the minister change the law so that these people can compete and survive.

         We cannot believe this Prime Minister. We cannot believe what he has delivered to the Australian people in the time that he has been in office. I am sure that the Australian people are in the process of waking up to the fact that a Prime Minister cannot survive on the continuation of a lie. All that has changed is that l-a-w is now l-i-e. But there is more. There was the matching of the Christmas appeal funds. On 6 December 1992 the Prime Minister said:

        Once again, a promise not delivered. It was a very simple commitment and, at the time, seemed a very humane commitment but this man has no humanity whatsoever. He promises these sorts of things to win a few votes and get a bit of kudos, then he walks right away from them.

         Of course, he is not the only Labor Minister to do this. I raise the case of the use of superannuation funds for housing and the promise made at the policy launch that Labor would permit part of the deposit on owner occupied dwellings to be funded from the home buyer's superannuation account. What did former Treasurer Dawkins have to say about that? On 16 February 1993, at a Hobart doorstop, he said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to super for housing, all they are really offering is a lending facility, allowing the super funds to lend for housing to individuals who have accounts with those super funds.

        Another promise not delivered. I have to emphasise that. As we work through these examples, and there are very many of them—my time has nearly come to an end—it is clear that the promises and commitments made by this federal Labor government through the Prime Minister are not worth the paper they are written on. We cannot believe them. This government has consistently misled the Australian public and their promises are just the big Keating lie.

       I said no such thing. This related to something some years ago concerning a state member of parliament who happened to have been an invalid pensioner. I said no such thing. Although it still does intrigue me, I must admit, to know how a man who can claim he is not fit enough to work claims he is fit enough to work as a member of parliament. Do we have lower requirements? That does still strike me as extraordinary. Anyway, I certainly said nothing of the sort. I never said that it was disgusting for a man who was an invalid pensioner to stand for parliament; that is totally false.

        Mr Hollis then accused me of arranging for the local newspaper to put out a scurrilous and false report hinting that he had misappropriated funds from his previous employment. That is totally and absolutely false. I understand that a Nowra newspaper had a story of that nature. Mr Hollis took out an injunction against the newspaper and prevented the story being published. I was fascinated by that fact and subsequently I obtained a copy of that report about which I had previously known nothing. I might mention to Mr Hollis that I then asked one of his former colleagues about this matter, only to find out that funds that Mr Hollis had given himself were retrospectively agreed to by the Workers Education Foundation.

        Mr Hollis referred to me throughout his speech without any let or hindrance by the Presiding Officers as `Buckets Baume' rather than Senator Baume. He falsely claimed that I had a Commonwealth car wait for almost two hours while I had a dental appointment. That is absolute nonsense. It continues. In deference to your suggestion that I do not go on too long about this, Mr Acting Deputy President, Mr Hollis should recognise that many matters of a personal nature could be raised about him. Senator Crichton-Browne has quite properly demonstrated how there should be a clear division between one's private life and one's public activities. I will not go across that boundary. But the last person in this parliament who should throw stones is Mr Colin Hollis. He lives in the most glassy of glass houses.

        Both sections 170MG and 170NG require the Commission to identify "relevant employees" whose interests may not have been sufficiently taken into account in the negotiations for, or the terms of, the agreement. Both sections provide examples of three categories of employees whose interests may not have been taken into account.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you are aware, subsection 15AD(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that where an Act includes an example of the operation of a provision, the example shall not be taken to be exhaustive.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was evident from the consultation process conducted with members of the Commission that information in respect of the additional categories of employees that the Rules now require was necessary for the Commission to satisfy its obligations under section 170MG in respect of certified agreements and section 170NG in respect of enterprise flexibility agreements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, the inclusion of specific categories within the Rules would largely ameliorate the very lack of certainty involved in requiring the identification of employees (other than the three examples contained in the statute) whose interests may not have been taken into account.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Nevertheless, it was recognised that the Rules could not make reference to each and every category of "relevant employee". For this reason, the Rules continue to require applicants to identify employees who might be "relevant employees" but are not included in the specified classes of employees. Taking into account the additional classes of employees now specified in the Rules, I did not consider it inappropriate that applicants continue to be required to identify other "relevant employees".

        The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 (the act) is part of a global network of legislation, with the goal of protecting biological diversity and maintaining ecological processes and systems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments will enhance the extent to which Australia discharges its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity. The amendments will provide an improved administrative framework, strengthen measures against illegal wildlife trafficking, and make the Australian Nature Conservation Agency's service to client groups more effective. They will also support a national approach to the conservation of Australia's biodiversity and improve arrangements for regulating the commercial use of wildlife.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments have been developed after extensive consultations with State and Territory governments, industry and non-government organisations and are in accord with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The changes have largely arisen from recommendations of the Ley Report which reviewed the act, having particular regard to Australia's obligations under CITES. The proposed amendments will implement Appendix III of CITES, relating to species identified by a Party as under regulation to prevent or restrict exploitation, and needing the co-operation of others in the control of trade. They will also enable a more flexible approach to controlling private non-commercial trade in species identified under Appendix II of CITES, species identified as although not endangered, requiring trade regulation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of wildlife export industries in Australia are subject to the act, which currently provides for the establishment of management and controlled specimens programs, the development of which are undertaken in close consultation with State and Territory agencies. The amendments will include the requirement that any proposals for the commercial utilisation and international trade in native wildlife are subject to appropriate legislative and regulatory regimes in the relevant State or Territory. Management programs may only be approved where the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is satisfied that to ensure protection of the species, appropriate regulatory measures, monitoring and assessment procedures are in place for the proposed harvesting activity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Management programs will be subject to time limitations, as it is vital that harvesting of wild native plants and animals are reviewed on a regular basis. Therefore, the amendments will establish a maximum period of five years between such reviews, with the flexibility to establish shorter periods, should it be considered necessary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Through the introduction of special conditions for permits for export of native animals under interzoological garden transfer, Australian zoos will be better able to manage their animal populations. The well developed Australasian Species Management Program will be assisted by these measures, which will also facilitate participation in international breeding programs involving endangered species.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The risks of detection and prosecution to those associated with wildlife smuggling will increase as a combined result of improved administrative measures and enforcement efforts. Continuation of co-operative work undertaken by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, State and Federal Police, and State wildlife agencies will ensure these changes are effective. Overall, they will improve operating efficiency without compromising the protection of wildlife and the Australian environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposals include improved enforcement powers of inspectors appointed under the act by strengthening powers of seizure, improving powers of search of premises and conveyances, providing powers to conduct frisk searches of suspect persons, enabling seizure of specimens. These provisions are consistent with the Criminal Code Bill 1994 and the recently amended Crimes Act 1914, while taking into account the rights of the individual. Penalties have also been made consistent with Commonwealth policy regarding introduction of penalty units.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to the substantial penalties currently available for illegally importing and exporting wildlife, the amendments propose a new offence. Any person illegally importing or exporting live animals may be subject to a potential two year imprisonment term, if found guilty of cruel treatment to the animal. This will ensure that the treatment of the animals involved in such crimes is subject to consideration by the courts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is also concerned that the establishment of self-sustaining populations of exotic birds in the Australian wild could have disastrous effects on native wildlife populations. Further, it may only take one bird infected with an exotic disease, and which has been smuggled into Australia, to contaminate thousands of aviary held or wild native birds. These are serious risks which require a comprehensive approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A central measure in the bill to addressing these concerns is the introduction of a national exotic bird registration scheme. The scheme was developed along with close consultation with the aviculture industry, bird keepers and the States and Territories. Registration will provide an inventory of exotic birds currently housed in Australia that have environmental or pest potential, and those that are endangered internationally.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A national inventory created under the scheme will provide an agreed list of exotic birds in Australia that will enable for the first time, the means to properly manage exotic birds. Whilst providing a national focus, the proposed amendments allow the States and Territories the flexibility to impose additional measures if they so desire. The scheme will support and assist the legal trade in exotic birds within Australia. The uncertainty and risks associated with the purchase of many birds will be substantially reduced, by eliminating doubt as to the legal origin of the bird.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An advisory committee to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories will be established to examine the ongoing effectiveness of the registration scheme and to provide advice on proposed variations to the list of birds proposed for registration. This committee will comprise of representatives of government, conservation, and private and professional aviculture.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Amendment bill also proposes tighter controls on the export of birds as household pets by providing for a limit of two birds that may be taken out of Australia by a person leaving to take up permanent residence overseas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, through arrangements being developed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, international cooperation to stem the illegal wildlife trade has become more effective. Australia has an excellent international reputation for its positive involvement in conservation issues, and will be further extending its support to other countries in this respect, with the creation of a new offence whereby it will be illegal to import wildlife specimens contrary to the conservation laws of a foreign country, where a breach of the overseas law involves trade with Australia and where the foreign country requests assistance. This will enable Australia to assist with international enforcement of wildlife laws of other countries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the environmental problems of the globe, which include a range of threats to biodiversity and the survival of many species of wildlife, will only be addressed through national and international cooperative measures. This Government is providing leadership and support in meeting the national and international challenge of protecting biological diversity and maintaining ecological processes and systems. The Wildlife Protection Amendment Bill is a step forward in meeting that challenge and a further example of the Government's commitment to ensuring an ecologically sustainable future.

         —The amendment deals with a charter which would be developed in consultation with the hospitals, the insurers and doctors. I believe that this is a very important amendment for consumers and hope that the coalition will be supporting it. It also provides that no legal action, civil or criminal, can be brought against persons who disclose information under an agreement. It accords with the provisions of the legislation. Therefore, hospitals will actually be able to establish the insurance status of patients. It is something that is automatically done now, I understand, but hospitals really are doing it without formal authority and legal protection. Therefore, this is an amendment simply to protect the hospitals.

        Does that indicate a comparison between funds? Does it take into account the fact that somebody who takes out private insurance actually has to pay five times? People have to pay through their Medicare tax, through their general taxation, through state tax, through their private health insurance fund, and then they have to pay out of pocket expenses. Is that the import of this statement? Does it take into account, for example, the purported increase in the Medicare levy in the budget tonight? On every occasion that the Medicare levy has increased, there has been a drop-out in the number of people holding private insurance. Just what is meant by that paragraph?

But within that context, it is important for the patient to know the coverage of the charter. The whole illogical nature of this legislation is that Medibank Private, the government's own instrumentality, has published facts showing that it has achieved 100 per cent coverage in private hospitals; so half the legislation has already been overcome by what Medibank Private, MBF and other health insurance organisations have done.

         We are going through this facade of legislation at the moment when half of it has already been achieved by the industry. Ten days ago, Medibank Private put up its premiums and changed the names of some of its tables. The implication was that there had been a reduction in premiums.

With respect, Madam Chair, Mr Schneider ought to hang his head in shame at that statement because 10 days ago the premiums were put up—albeit by a government instrumentality, not by a member of his association. The charter that is relevant to this is supported by the opposition. It advises people what this cover by the government's instrumentality, Medibank Private, is costing them. Perhaps my question was rhetorical.

They are doing that. They have been doing so for some time in Victoria and also in my home state of South Australia, and the world has not come to an end. Some nonsense is being spread by doctors that this is draconian legislation because we are going to have contracts.

         I suggest to Senator Herron that he is undoing his own argument in a way. He is quite openly saying that the contracts are now going ahead successfully with the hospitals and that the private patients charter will give patients full information of a variety of different options to them, such as what they can expect, what their rights are as persons being treated by those working in the private sector. I cannot see what his problem is with the charter and the terms of the information that it will be providing to patients. Not all patients, as Senator Herron acknowledges, will be involved in contracts. They will choose to remain with existing tables and will therefore need additional information. Hopefully, all doctors in their rooms will also tell patients what the gap will be for those who do not elect to insure under the fully contracted tables.

         —There is a lot of ignorance in this debate, and we have had another example of it by Senator Lees. Contracts have existed between full-time specialists and the public hospitals for as long as I can remember. I was one who negotiated them. This will not make any difference whatsoever in relation to private patients in public hospitals. I can understood where it will make a difference, but that is another debate. The debate is in relation to this charter, because it specifically advises people of matters to consider in making decisions about becoming contributors to such funds.

         The question is: what advice will be given in that charter? For example, will it tell them the various competitive arrangements between differing funds? Does it tell individuals specifically what their likely expenses will be in relation to the nature of the condition for which they are being treated in the private hospital? It seems to be a blanket statement, and I am asking for specifics.

         We would have preferred, if we had been able to under this legislation, to introduce full aggregate billing. However, we have accepted arguments put forward by the AMA, the hospitals and others that it was not practical at this point in time. Significant changes are already being made within this legislation and people are asking for time. The people with whom we then negotiated and held discussions agreed that setting up this committee to look at the issue takes us another step forward by establishing a process where the parties have to sit down and work together towards a deadline. Some work is already being done in this area.

Looking at the geographic spread, we believed that the funds would be quite interested to ensure that, with the quite high percentage of rural people who have health insurance compared with those in some city locations, the funds would be doing themselves a disservice if they decided they were not going to work in some rural areas. We felt that there could be more of a problem in some city areas where there is a number of hospitals in one location. We see this legislation as working quite well for rural hospitals because, on the information given to us, the funds would be quite keen to make sure they covered a very good geographic spread.

         —Does it mean—and my understanding is that it does—that the present item 53 of schedule 1 makes it a condition of a fund's registration under schedule 1 of the National Health Act that, if a practitioner does not have an agreement with the fund, the level of benefit payable in respect of the services is severely limited in reference to the schedule fee for those services? Clearly, if that is so, it is a form of financial coercion on practitioners which could destroy the assumed voluntary nature of the purchaser-provider agreements. Does it restrict it, or does it have a coercive effect in relation to the level of benefit payable to the schedule fee or not?

         —I accept that the change in the words allows for the level of benefit paid to be equal to the medical expenses incurred in respect of the service. I am looking at item 3 where it mentions 25 per cent of the schedule fee. In other words, the amendment relates to the refund that a patient can expect for the medical services when a contract exists. Is there a requirement to charge the schedule fee for that refund? As the minister would appreciate, at the moment the patient gets a refund of 75 per cent of the schedule fee. Does this legislation mean that if the schedule fee is not charged the patient will get 25 per cent of that schedule fee were it to have been charged?

Our advice is that if item 53 is deleted it would mean that funds would only provide benefits where an agreement was in place. I suspect Senator Herron is doing exactly what he does not want to do. It would mean that patients would face greatly increased out-of-pocket costs if they used a non-contracted doctor. That is something that we certainly cannot support.

         —This again shows total ignorance of what occurs in real life. The reason for people dropping out of private health insurance is that they cannot afford the premiums. It is as simple as that. If the Medicare levy goes up tonight there will be another drop off. What is happening now? Only 36 per cent of people are privately insured at the moment. Are there screams from the public galleries about the enormous costs? Senator Lees was present at the hearings of the Community Affairs Committee when I asked what were the average out-of-pocket expenses in relation to medical fees taken overall with medical charges in Australia. The answer was $22. The average cost for hospital out-of-pocket expenses was $79. Senator Lees comes up with this fatuous statement that it opens the floodgates for this enormous cost.

         We are moving into the American style of purchase provider agreement with this legislation. We know from the American experience what has occurred in America. It is the very thing that Senator Lees is referring to, yet she is an advocate of this legislation. The argument against my amendment is based on a false premise. The government's figures for out-of-pocket expenses were given in the discussion on the community affairs legislation. We have come up with this argument that, by not accepting this amendment, we are allowing the doctors to run berserk and saying that the marketplace will not work. The marketplace is working now. I thought that this was the argument for the legislation.

        This amendment overcomes the impediment in current subsection 14(1) regarding the need to ensure that Medicare benefits do not exceed the medical expenses incurred. This amendment is necessary to cover a situation where a payment to a medical practitioner under a medical purchaser-provider agreement is not determined on a fee-for-service basis. A medical practitioner may be paid by a retainer or a salary which will not enable the practitioner to provide details of the medical expenses incurred for each service, as is required where payment is made on a fee-for-service basis.

We do not want Australian government tax dollars, hard won by the people of this country, paying an excessive return over what was charged.

         —Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is delivering in another place his budget speech for 1995-96.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this budget has one principal objective: to provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will enable the continuation of substantial employment growth, falling unemployment and rising living standards, while reducing pressure on interest rates, inflation and the current account.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will do so by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long term decline of our national savings. A higher level of national savings will allow higher levels of investment and economic growth without the costs and constraints associated with undue reliance on the savings of foreigners.
       </para>
       <para>
        This budget provides a two-part plan to improve Australia's saving performance, immediately and over the longer term.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, it increases public saving.
       </para>
       <para>
        The budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718m. This is a massive turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion or 2.8 per cent of GDP. It is the largest ever turnaround in the budget outcome. It brings the budget into surplus three years earlier than previously forecast.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue and asset sales, including part of the proceeds from the sale of the government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank.
       </para>
       <para>
        Importantly, the budget for 1996-97 will be in surplus excluding asset sales and special debt and capital repayments.
       </para>
       <para>
        And the budget surplus by 1998-99 will be $7.4 billion or 1.2 per cent of GDP.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the budget will introduce a major increase in private saving in the medium to longer term by the progressive introduction of employee superannuation contributions, with the second round of the One Nation tax cuts paid on a matching dollar for dollar basis into employee superannuation accounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together with the superannuation guarantee and existing award superannuation this initiative will, within a generation, boost Australia's annual saving performance by 4 per cent of GDP.
       </para>
       <para>
        The return to budget surplus will reduce Commonwealth government debt, which is already well below the average for OECD countries, by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP over the next four years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight's budget also addresses immediate high priority needs with new measures for families, health care, the environment and justice.

       <para>
        <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         FISCAL TIGHTENING
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the return of the budget outcome to surplus in 1995-96, and to substantial surplus in 1996-97 and beyond, fulfils the Government's promise to significantly tighten fiscal policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening, excluding the effects of asset sales and early debt redemptions, of $3 billion in 1995-96 and $4 1/2 billion in 1996-97.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the outlays side this tightening has been accomplished by a rigorous examination of all areas of government expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decisions the Treasurer is announcing produce a net reduction in outlays of $700 million in 1995-96 excluding asset sales and early debt redemptions. Overall, a real reduction in outlays of 2.5 per cent has been achieved, the first real reduction since 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        Outlays are projected to fall from 26.7 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 24 per cent of GDP in 1998-99, demonstrating the Government's determination to reduce its call on national saving.
       </para>
       <para>
        Total taxation revenue collected by the Government as a share of GDP declined in each of the 6 years between 1987-88 and 1993-94.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenue measures that the Treasurer is announcing tonight strengthen the Commonwealth's tax base and provide a significant contribution to improving the budget outcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all they add $2.4 billion to revenue in 1995-96 and $3.6 billion in 1996-97.
       </para>
       <para>
        But even after allowing for these measures, budget balance will be restored with revenue much lower, in relation to GDP, than in the past. When we last moved into surplus in 1987-88 revenue represented 27.2 per cent of GDP compared to an estimated 25.3 per cent in 1995-96.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our fiscal policy compares more than favourably with that of most other industrialised countries and, amongst such countries, we will continue to be one of the lowest taxed.
       </para>
       <para>
        <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         SUPERANNUATION
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, one of the principal objectives of this Budget is to meet the medium term imperative of improving national saving to maintain investment and employment through the 1990s and beyond.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight the Treasurer is announcing, on behalf of the Government, a radical and innovative program to meet that challenge and further decrease Australia's reliance on foreign borrowings. This initiative complements the addition to Australia's savings arising from the budget surplus. It meets a goal and establishes a commitment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The goal is better retirement incomes for Australians. The commitment, simultaneously established, is to substantially increase the nation's savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measure will build on one of the most far-reaching steps taken during the Government's years of office—the development of Australia's superannuation and retirement incomes policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight's announcement will dramatically strengthen and extend that policy. It will not only sharply increase the incomes of Australians in retirement, but will also build a large pool of savings to finance the nation's continuing prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        This initiative has two elements, an employee superannuation contribution and a matching government contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, in One Nation we said, and I quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        "The Government will be giving consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts to increase the total level of superannuation support by a further 3 per cent of earnings."
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that this is the time to do so—in fact, we believe there is now a need to go beyond the objectives we set then.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, under tonight's initiative, the Government will support the inclusion in all awards of provisions for employee superannuation contributions beginning at 1 per cent of earnings in July 1997 and rising to 3 per cent of earnings by July 1999.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will be timed to coincide with wage increases through enterprise agreements or awards, so that workers will not experience a reduction in disposable income.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second element, Mr President, is that the Government will match dollar for dollar the contributions paid by most employees into their superannuation accounts—a government contribution, when fully phased in, of $4 billion a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        By paying the One Nation tax cuts into employees' superannuation accounts we are delivering them in a way that significantly improves national saving.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together, additional contributions will add 6 per cent of wages to the superannuation of people earning around average incomes. By 2002 this will build on the 9 per cent contribution from employers under the Superannuation Guarantee arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        This new initiative will, therefore, lift the superannuation savings for a person on around average earnings to a minimum of 15 per cent of their wages.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make it abundantly clear, however, that the Government continues to see the age pension as the foundation stone of our retirement incomes policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight's arrangements build on the existing pension system.
       </para>
       <para>
        For a couple on average earnings, now in their mid 30s, the Government's initiatives deliver retirement incomes 75 per cent higher than the age pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        For their children joining the workforce in the next decade, retirement incomes will be more than double the age pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the new policy has been designed to benefit low and middle income earners.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, employees currently contributing to superannuation will not need to make additional contributions to be eligible for the matching government payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The government contribution will be means tested. The Government will match contributions up to a limit of around $1 000 per annum for all workers earning less than around $46 000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will enable the self-employed to claim the matching government contribution on a proportion of their superannuation savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, for equity reasons, the existing means-tested rebate for member contributions will be retained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the policy announced tonight will change forever the expectations of workers as they move towards retirement age.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will give Australia a comprehensive long-term private savings plan—one that could not have been contemplated without the ground breaking work on superannuation done by this Labor Government since 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind honourable members that in 1983, after decades of neglect by the Liberal and National parties, less than 40 per cent of all employees had superannuation coverage. Today, as a result of our reforms, that total is nearly 90 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        For women, the increased coverage from the previous initiatives of this Government has been even more spectacular, rising from 24 per cent in 1983 to 85 per cent today. Thus women now have a major stake in superannuation—and it will be a bigger stake after the Budget's measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today superannuation savings have already reached $186 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, Mr President, under the policy announced tonight that figure will increase tenfold by the year 2020.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together with our earlier reforms, tonight's initiatives are estimated to further increase national saving progressively by around 2 per cent of GDP per year by the end of the decade. When fully implemented, they will add 4 per cent of GDP per year to national saving. In today's values that means an increase in saving in the order of $18 billion per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        These new superannuation measures will be extremely good for Australian workers and their families, and just as good for the nation.
       </para>

         ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT      GROWTH
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, Australia's economy has been growing for 3 1/2 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        During this time, Australia has had one of the best performing economies among industrialised countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1994, Australia was among the fastest growing industrialised countries, but with inflation below the average of these countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding the severe drought which has affected much of eastern Australia, GDP growth is expected to be 4 3/4 per cent in 1994-95.
       </para>
       <para>
        And this growth has been broadly based.
       </para>
       <para>
        Business investment, which has been growing since late 1992, is expected to grow by 18 per cent this fiscal year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Employment has grown by 4.2 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        By delivering around 550 000 new jobs since April 1993, the Government has already surpassed its election commitment to create half a million jobs in this term of office.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen to 8.7 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The number of long term unemployed people has fallen by 25 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995 as the Government's Working Nation program continues to assist them into jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Critical to maintaining this strong growth in activity and employment has been the maintenance of low inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's inflation rate has been below that of our major trading partners over recent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Low inflation is the result of reforms to the structure of our economy over the past decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        A key factor has been the success of the Government's wages policy and industrial relations reforms through the Accord, which is unique to this Labor Government and rejected by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Business is facing an increasingly competitive environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        With protection reduced and markets opened to competition, businesses are increasingly required to adopt international standards of best practice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Widespread microeconomic reforms have also resulted in a more competitive economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recent historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to implement the national competition policy reforms will, in conjunction with related reforms in industries such as energy and transport, further raise the level of competition in the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these developments are keeping production costs and therefore inflationary pressures down.
       </para>
       <para>
        An added benefit of this restraint in prices and wages is that it puts less pressure on monetary policy, and reduces the need for increases in interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of these improvements in labour and product markets, Australia's international competitiveness is now 18 per cent higher than in the September quarter 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, rapid growth in domestic demand, particularly for investment goods, has led to a sharp rise in imports. In addition, adverse effects on our exports from drought and the hesitant recovery in Japan have increased our current account deficit to an estimated 6 per cent of GDP this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tackling this problem is largely what this Budget is about.

       <para>
        Wage growth is expected to be higher in 1995-96 but, in the context of enterprise bargaining and continued improvements in productivity, it should remain compatible with maintaining an underlying inflation rate around 2 to 3 per cent on average over the course of the economic cycle.
       </para>
       <para>
        This favourable outlook is strongly supported by the union movement's commitment to responsible wage outcomes under the Accord.
       </para>
       <para>
        And achievement of this goal will be further aided by the spread of enterprise bargaining throughout the workforce.
       </para>
       <para>
        Employers and employees are taking advantage of the new system by making work practices more flexible, thus improving our productivity performance and providing a firm basis for wage rises for Australian workers.

        A new means tested maternity allowance of $816 will be introduced from 1 February 1996. It will provide a vital boost to family income when it is most needed: on the birth of a baby.
       </para>

        About 85 per cent of women will be eligible for the payment which will be available to women both at home and in paid employment.

        The level of Guardians Allowance paid to sole parent pensioners will be increased by $4 a fortnight from September 1996. Rent assistance will also be increased by $5 a fortnight from March 1996 for families with children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both these measures build on significant real improvements in family payments made to low income families over the life of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        From July 1995 the new Parenting Allowance which was announced as part of Working Nation will provide about 115 000 low income working families with an average gain of $59 a week.

        Mr President, tonight's Budget also focuses on the health needs of families through preventative health care measures for children and young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        To raise the immunisation rates among our children and so reduce the incidence of preventable diseases, a National Childhood Immunisation Program costing $11m in 1995-96 will be introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        A new `Health Australia' program provides $18m over 3 years for measures to strengthen health promotion and reduce the consumption of tobacco, particularly among young people.

        Mr President, the Government will continue to help families meet the challenges faced by competing work and family responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will deliver on its 1993 promise to meet the projected demand for work related care by 2000-01.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this Budget we have taken steps to ensure that the focus is on meeting the needs of working parents, while providing equitable access to subsidised child care for parents who stay at home with their children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will also provide additional financial support to carers of older people and disabled people, and will promote the role of carers in the community.

        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, to reduce spending, the Government looked first at the cost of delivering its own programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indexation arrangements for both Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays and Specific Purpose Payments to the States with substantial wage costs are to be rationalised from 1 July 1995 producing savings of almost $2 billion over the next 4 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes will not apply to personal benefit payments—that is, there will be no change to indexation arrangements for pensions, allowances and other income support payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reductions in administrative costs of departments and agencies will produce savings of around $640m over the next 4 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together with a range of efficiency and other measures already adopted by the Government over recent years, this will lead to a reduction in administrative costs of 15 per cent in real terms over the next 4 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also been able to reduce spending on labour market programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        These savings will not jeopardise achievement of the Government's Working Nation targets. They result largely from more efficient delivery of programs and a stronger labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget also includes measures to simplify the income test applying to pensions through the introduction of a deeming system on financial investments only. It will replace the current system of assessment of unrealised capital growth on shares and managed investments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will take steps to reduce the rapid escalation of some health program costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        New arrangements for delivering pathology services and an increase in the safety net threshold for general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $407 to $600 from 1 January 1996 will provide substantial savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government reaffirms its election commitment to support health research by increasing funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council by $58m over 4 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, for the higher education sector there is a budget-neutral package which will provide 5850 new higher education places over the next 3 years and increased funding for research infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        An additional $217m over 4 years will be provided for initiatives to protect our natural environment, with particular emphasis on our coastline and our native forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will accelerate implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement through a $53m package over 4 years to undertake comprehensive regional forest assessments in five high priority areas and conclude associated regional forest agreements with the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also remains determined to improve the urban environment with a further $254m over 4 years for the Better Cities Program.

        Mr President, the revenue side of the Budget will also play its part in fiscal tightening.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the strong economic recovery, the corporate profit share has returned to the record levels of the mid 1980s.
       </para>
       <para>
        Companies in Australia have also benefited from a number of tax concessions in recent years to stimulate business activity. They include investment allowances, accelerated depreciation, the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession and a large reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures will be providing a benefit of more than $3 billion to businesses in 1995-96.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make a contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the rate of company income tax will be increased from 33 to 36 per cent for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years.
       </para>
       <para>
        This measure will add $320m to revenue in 1995-96 and $1 570m in 1996-97.
       </para>
       <para>
        The One Nation statement reduced the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles by 5 per cent to stimulate demand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now that passenger motor vehicle sales are at a high level, it is appropriate to restore the sales tax rate to the general rate of 21 per cent from tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also decided that, from 1 July 1995, sales tax at the concessional 12 per cent rate will apply to currently exempt builders' hardware and certain building materials used mainly in the completion of buildings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bulk of building materials used in construction, such as bricks, timber, cement and roofing tiles, will remain exempt.

       <para>
        Mr President, Medicare levy receipts as a proportion of Medicare outlays have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight the Treasurer is announcing an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent which will partially reverse this decline.
       </para>
       <para>
        The excise rate on tobacco will rise by 10 per cent from tonight. This will replace the 5 per cent increase originally scheduled for August 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent years evidence has emerged of an erosion of the PAYE tax base, where individuals have attempted to move out of traditional employer/employee relationships in order to avoid tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Government will be amending the income tax law to ensure the intended coverage of the PAYE provisions can be enforced. The Treasurer will also be releasing soon a discussion paper dealing with the use of other schemes to avoid tax on personal services income.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to reduce deferral of tax payments under the PAYE system, the threshold at which bi-monthly remittance is required will be reduced to $1m per year. Generally, this measure will affect companies with around 120 employees or more.
       </para>
       <para>
        To protect the revenue base, the Treasurer is also announcing tonight measures to correct a number of deficiencies in the tax laws.

        Eligibility for the research and development tax concession for syndicates investing in private tax exempt bodies will be limited to exclude investors who are not fully at risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        This measure will prevent inappropriate access to tax benefits, and parallels a 1992 measure applying to public sector tax exempt research bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be clarification of certain wholesale sales tax rate classifications including removal of the tax exemption for non-permanent microchips used in certain goods. The current exemption has proved virtually impossible to administer, introduced significant distortions and inefficiencies in the market, and caused considerable loss of revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        'Light' fuel oils, which are in effect industrial diesel fuels, will be made subject to excise in the same way as diesel fuels. This is designed to address the tax-driven substitution of `light' fuel oil for diesel which is taking place at some cost to economic efficiency and the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1 July 1995, the interest rate which the Reserve Bank of Australia pays banks on their non-callable deposits will be set at 5 percentage points below market rates. This measure recognises the benefits which accrue to banks from being authorised by the Government and subject to RBA prudential supervision.

        (2) (a) occasional care centres are funded through the Family Support Funding Program each year. The Family Support Funding Program aims to enhance the lives of Defence families and improve the sense of community by providing grants for community projects developed by Defence families, encouraging Defence families and groups to determine needs in a local area, and increasing opportunities for Defence families to undertake self-help projects. Funding is based on submissions from the families themselves and may include centres, baby-sitting groups and playgroups depending on how families perceive their needs. The essential criteria of the program is that projects developed under the scheme must benefit a significant number of Defence families. The Government considers that the element of choice in the Family Support Funding Program is central to the success of the program, and the breakdown of activities on which monies are spent reflects the needs and priorities of local Defence families.

Other products incorporating renewable energy technology—such as wind power and wave power—would often be exempt from sales tax under the business input exemption provisions of the sales tax legislation.

Contractually, the Australian Taxation Office is required to keep the account in credit at all times.

The credit balance in the account receives interest monthly at the weighted average yield of 13 week Treasury Notes—the combination of these two factors ensures that the "value for money" considerations laid out in Finance Direction 25C are achieved.

        (b) RAAF Curtin was designed as a `bare base', to be activated in a reasonable time-frame if our strategic environment deteriorates, or we otherwise foresee an impending operational requirement. As such, the base is not intended to maintain a high degree of operational readiness. However, should a situation arise where illegal immigrants were accommodated at RAAF Curtin coincident with a requirement to fully activate the base, the detainees would have to be relocated. The operational readiness of the base would not be affected unless the detainees were not relocated before the base was activated. This situation is assessed as highly unlikely.

We expect our intelligence and surveillance resources to provide adequate warning of any emerging threat to Australia, and we do not perceive any such threats in the short to medium term. Thus, a requirement to activate RAAF Curtin at short notice is highly unlikely. In these circumstances, the use of RAAF Curtin for temporary accommodation of immigration detainees will in no way adversely affect Australia's security.

        The Australian Omega station in Gippsland is run by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Upon its establishment in 1982 the costs of the station's operation were met by the commercial shipping industry. This was in accordance with the anticipated use by commercial shipping in the Australian region of the Omega system for navigation. By 1993, however, it was clear that the Omega system served no useful purpose for marine navigation in the Australian region. The industry was thus no longer willing to continue funding the station's operation.

        In the absence of alternative funding arrangements an interim decision was made by the Government that the station would close. In accordance with the original bilateral agreement between Australia and the United States under which the station operated within the world-wide Omega system, the Australian Government gave the US Government 180 days notice of the intended closure. This was reflected in the joint statement made on 7 September 1993 by Senator Collins, as Minister for Transport and Communications, and myself. That statement did, however, also make clear that the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would, prior to the Government's final decision on the station's future, seek submissions from affected users to assist the Government in making that decision.

        In the course of this consultative process, there arose a number of appeals for the station's continued operation, including from other countries and from the World Meteorological Organisation. It became clear that the Omega system was still used for sea and air navigation in a number of other countries, as well as for the gathering of essential meteorological information by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and by other meteorological bodies throughout the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the South Pacific, and in southern Africa. As a result, the Government decided to itself provide funding for the continued operation of the station, until 30 September 1997; that funding being provided through the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A media release on this matter was issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on 1 June 1994.

        (5), (6) and (7) The UN is responsible for arranging and funding transport resources to move participating contingents to UN areas of operation. In the case of the deployment of the first ADF contingent to Rwanda in August last year, the UN arranged for the uplift of an advance party comprising 73 personnel, plus additional equipment and stores, using one US Air Force (USAF) C5 Galaxy aircraft. The main body, comprising 220 personnel, equipment and stores was uplifted by nine USAF C5 Galaxy and one C141 Starlifter aircraft and three commercially chartered B747 freighters. The UN Letter of Assist issued to the US to cover the cost of the ADF deployment to Rwanda was valued at US$8.6 million at no cost to Australia. A similar airlift by the RAAF would have involved in excess of 80 C130 aircraft flights. The RAAF simply did not possess the capacity to undertake such a significant task in the necessary timeframe.

        (1) Woodchips exported from native forests will be reduced by 20 per cent each year over the next five years except for areas where there has been significant progress towards, or the completion of, a regional forest agreement (RFA) that provides for the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, as required under the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS). This phase-out will not apply to plantations. This means that for 1996, the maximum permissable level for export will be 4.8 million tonnes, for 1997 it will be 3.6 million tonnes, 1998 2.4 million tonnes, 1999 1.2 million tonnes to nil in 2000.

        The Government's strategy is not inconsistent with the approach outlined by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in 1991. Mr Hawke stated that the Government's objective would be to phase out woodchip exports from native forests in favour of an increase in downstream processing by the year 2000. However, Mr Hawke also stated that woodchips exports would be considered on a case-by-case basis, after the year 2000, with full regard being paid to the objective that the fullest possible return be achieved from Australia's forest resources. The Prime Minister has simply placed Mr Hawke's statement into the context of the NFPS, which has been signed since the former Prime Minister's 1991 statement.

        (2) Three export woodchip licence holders have been given in-principle approval to export woodchips beyond the year 2000. In each of these cases the approval has been expressed to be subject to the issue of annual export licences. The intention of the Commonwealth in granting in-principle approval is to provide woodchip export companies with some degree of assurance and to justify commitments of capital. It is also intended to address the importance of security of supply for purchasers and requirements of charter arrangements for shipping.

        The Government believes that RFAs are the key to meeting conservation objectives and giving security to woodchip export licence holders. These agreements will identify areas available for logging and those requiring protection through a comprehensive, adequate and representative CAR reserve system. Once RFAs are in place, it is intended that companies will be issued with licences for periods substantially longer than the current one year period.

        The ABC broadcasts these daily reports because saleyard auction markets still account for a significant number of sheep, cattle and lamb sales. Daily markets are the most immediate indicator of livestock prices, with reports usually reaching "Country Hour" live from the saleyards as the sale is still under way. Livestock markets are reported because they are considered the only true and open indicator of when livestock values change on a daily basis. Most other indicators such as Computer Aided Livestock Markets (CALM) base their prices on daily livestock prices.

        (2) Under existing arrangements, Air Force has determined that it requires a certain number of uniformed personnel to meet contingency requirements. For this reason, at Edinburgh and other operational bases, catering and most other non-core activities have been, for the time being, quarantined from testing. The decision as to whether catering at Edinburgh will be tested will be dependent on the final determination of uniformed personnel numbers which in turn is dependent on several studies underway in Defence, particularly that related to employment of civilians in an Area of Operations.

        2(a-g) As publicly announced at the time, Indonesian forces participated with the Australian Army in Exercise Swift Canopy on 6-13 March 1995. This was a conventional warfare exercise involving Army parachute and ground operations at Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, which served as a lead-up training exercise for Indonesian participation in Exercise Kangaroo 95. Forty-six Indonesian personnel, consisting of a platoon of airborne troops from the Strategic Reserve Command (KOSTRAD) and military observers, and an Indonesian Air Force C-130 aircraft and crew participated in the exercise. The exercise allowed the forces from both countries the opportunity to practice military skills and to foster an understanding of each other's military practices and procedures.

        (b-g) Contrary to the erroneous press report cited in the question, Exercise Kangaroo 95 does not envisage the establishment of any regional military alliance. Regional involvement in Kangaroo 95 has been designed instead to provide neighbouring countries' forces with bilateral exercise opportunities with the Australian Defence Force. Regional participation in exercises in Australia is an important dimension of our increasing engagement with countries of Asia and the Pacific. At the same time, our highest defence priority is to maintain forces which are capable of defending Australia without combat support from other countries.

        (1) The first National Childcare Accreditation Council (NCAC) was established in July 1993 using the legal structure created under the NSW Associations Incorporation Act in 1992 for the Interim National Accreditation Council (INAC). This enabled the first NCAC to be established quickly and immediately proceed with implementation of the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System. The announced intention was to establish the second NCAC as a company limited by guarantee from June 1994. The tenure of the first Council was extended to allow adequate time for the establishment of the second Council and the smooth transition from the work of the first Council.
