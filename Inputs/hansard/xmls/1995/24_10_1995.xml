        —by leave—Mr President, my very brief statement is about procedures relating to question time. In accordance with the normal courteous and fair manner in which you have conducted the office of President, today you would normally call me to ask a question. I understand that that will not be the case because you are going to implement a recommendation of the Procedure Committee relating to the apportionment of questions.

        As I see it, the purpose of question time is to make government accountable. Even taking into account the number of members of the government party and deducting the number of ministers and yourself—that is to say, all those eligible—the government party is very much overrepresented in the number of questions allocated to it. I do not want to debate the matter, nor would I be permitted to do so.

         What you need in the political process is full visibility and accountability of donations to political parties. That is the way to ensure probity. But when that legislation came before this chamber, all those opposite voted against disclosure. Every single one of them voted against disclosure of political donations. This is the same opposition that had one of its frontbenchers have FAI sponsor one of its staff members. Its leader had to step in and eliminate that.

It may well be that no-one took up the offer of a one-on-one with him, but certainly the party publications advertise it and the agents of the party publish it—they head their brochure, `Federal cabinet sponsorship'. When in the history of this country has the government put out a brochure seeking payment on the basis of federal cabinet sponsorship? Never! Only one government! And with federal government sponsorship, your agents, behind whom you seek to duck, claim you get additionally, `one-on-one access to the Prime Minister to be sought' and, `one-on-one access to the ministers of choice to be negotiated'. In other words, you call on the public to pay you for what you are paid by the public to do. You sell your access to the public for fees of up to $20,000.

         The government has done a number of things in order to encourage superannuation funds to have a wider view of the world. One of those things—we announced it just the other week—is that we will be asking the funds, and amending the legislation in order to do this, to report not just as they have to now on an annual basis in terms of their outcomes, but on a five-year rolling basis. So they will have to look five years ahead at least. That is one possible regulatory way of overcoming the short termism that seems to pervade this part of the market.

         —No. I have never said that. The obligation on trustees is to get a maximum return. If the return by the experts is described as mediocre, then the funds can certainly do better. When other funds in other countries do better and they get a better return, isn't that an object lesson to Australian fund managers? Of course the obligation is to get maximum return; but a portfolio would be properly balanced if part of it had a focus on high risk, high return and if a small proportion of the funds were invested in high risk, high return investments. It would also unblock an area in the national economy, which would cause the economy to grow and create more jobs. I think that is axiomatic. It is a pity the Liberal Party does not understand commerce, business, superannuation or investment. That is a comment on the modern day Liberal Party which is totally out of touch with the real world.

         AQIS has, in fact, been active in enhancing quarantine in the Torres Strait and northern Queensland for some years, including the introduction of survey and monitoring programs in the region and the top watch program, which has raised community awareness of quarantine issues, including fruit fly, to very high levels in the Torres Strait and northern peninsula communities. AQIS assisted inspectors on the larger islands at Bamaga on Cape York to inspect for movements of fruit fly product. AQIS has established an FM radio network across Cape York which broadcasts quarantine awareness messages as well as a weekly radio broadcast in the Torres Strait and a range of other public awareness initiatives.

         One reason for that is that this pest is endemic in Papua New Guinea. The reason that no eradication techniques were introduced onto the three northernmost islands on the Torres Strait is that it was considered useless. The fly can be carried there environmentally and naturally across those waters. That is probably the reason. The important thing to remember is that Malaysia has this fly and Malaysia exports successfully into countries like Japan because the right treatment is applied to the fruit. That is what we will do now.

The references to French nuclear testing were included in the version of the speech which was issued formally in New York. It is a convention of the United Nations that the official version of the speech for the historical record is the full version of the text by the originating mission and the one that is distributed to other governments. So the full text is the official speech. There is a time limit of five minutes on all speeches for the special session—I would love to watch Gareth make a speech there. The Governor-General's speech in delivery was running over time. All the warning lights had begun towards the end of the speech.

All you have to do is sit up here in the galleries when we are in general session and listen to how well they time their speeches and how often they run out—even today. At every question time one of their questioners runs out of time to complete a question. This deletion would be unfortunate but for the fact that historically the written and issued text is regarded as the authoritative source. So there was no intervention by anyone.

         with President Chirac. Senator McMullan did make the point that that is not the perception; it does not fit the pattern of our opposition to these tests. Mr Hayden, as I understand, in the substantive part of his speech wanted to pay tribute to former foreign minister Evatt, which did take longer than he expected. It was also important to put the role of Australia and Dr Evatt in the formation of the United Nations 50 years ago. As I say, the authoritative text for this is the written speech; it is the historical version of it. That has been given adequate publicity. Your raising it today has reinforced it.

         —My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer. During the last election, your government deliberately and deceptively hid its true taxation policies from Australians by consistently promising not to raise taxes. After the election, however, you introduced new taxes on building materials, you raised the Medicare levy, you raised the HECS contribution, you dismantled the l-a-w tax cuts and you increased sales taxes by as much as 46 per cent—for example, on cars. You are now obsessed with what coalition policies will be. But yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, when asked to give a commitment not to raise taxes or introduce new taxes if re-elected, said, `Why on earth would we do that?' What is your government's tax policy? Given that you will not commit to not raising taxes or introducing new ones, which taxes will you increase and what new taxes do you intend to introduce?

Out of your own mouths are you exposed! That agenda is to introduce income taxes for the states. Obviously, there is a great deal of embarrassment about this article in opposition ranks. Mr Costello trotted out a denial of what he was quoted as saying almost immediately the newspaper hit the newsstands.

         —It was the affection of the Australian people for us. What we promised to do at the last election was not to increase the overall burden of taxation and, as Senator Gareth Evans and I have said in this chamber many, many times—I do not have the figures to hand at the moment—nor have we. So that is a promise we have kept.

         As far as the l-a-w one is concerned, that has been kept, and it was kept in this last budget as well by bringing forward the first taxation cut and making that earlier for all taxpayers in Australia than promised at the election and by, of course, providing in the last budget a payment to superannuation to compensate for the second income tax instalment. So we can go through all of the erroneous elements that set the platform for this question.

         But let me go back to what is seen to be the issue here. Our tax policy is out in the open and clear. It is laid down in the last budget and the budget before that. We are on the record about it. What is the outcome of our tax policies? If you can compare the level of taxation in Australia under us to the level of taxation when you had the Treasury bench and Mr Howard, your now leader, was Treasurer and responsible for taxation policy, the tax burden on Australians now is less by a large margin than what it was when you were in power.

         So the high taxing party of Australian politics is you, not us. We are the ones that have lowered the level of taxation in Australia. We have provided—I do not have the figure to hand—at least six cuts to income tax over the life of our period in government. So, on the record, who is the high taxing party? You, not us. The level of taxation was higher under you; it is lower under us. They are the clear messages.

         The second point I make is that if you look at how Australia rates in the world, you would have reference to the OECD table of developed countries. That is our peer group of economies, all the developed countries in the world. We are the second lowest taxed economy in the OECD. We have only been displaced as the lowest by Turkey because Turkey re-evaluated its GDP upwards and thus lowered the percentage of the tax take from the overall economy.

Our rainfall patterns are the most variable, and the amount of rainfall available for human activities and the environment is extremely small in comparison with other countries. For these reasons it is critically important that we significantly improve the management of Australia's water resources.

         To improve the management of our water resources, we must increase our knowledge of our extremely complex river and riverine ecosystems. We must enhance the quality of our monitoring programs, and improve the management of our river systems and their catchments. Through the Prime Minister's 1992 environment statement, the Commonwealth government initiated a number of important programs to improve the management of Australia's water resources.

          Water quality monitoring in Australia

         which was funded under the environment statement. The report by Aquatek Australia Pty Ltd compiled information on water quality monitoring in inland, estuarine, and coastal waters, and ground water in all states and territories. The report found that there are about 1,800 water quality monitoring programs in Australia and that $100 million is spent each year on these programs.

         One of the important recommendations of the report was the need to interpret the wealth of data that has already been collected by environment protection agencies. On Sunday, I announced that the Commonwealth government would provide funding to assist with the evaluation of the water quality data that has already been collected and ensure the development of a national water quality monitoring system. The sum of $250,000 has been provided to ensure the interpretation of the long-term trend data on water quality. The analysis of this data from the Commonwealth and state EPAs will provide a baseline for measuring future performance, and will also feed into state-of-the-environment reporting.

         Other Commonwealth initiatives to improve the management of our water resources include the national river health program which has been allocated $10 million to coordinate biomonitoring programs nationally and to study the environmental flow requirements of our rivers. The Coalition of Australian Governments 1994 report on water resources policy promotes more efficient use of water through pricing allocation and trading reforms. All these measures will have significant benefits for water quality in this country.

         In this context, vertical fiscal imbalance refers to the states that spend more money than they recover through their own taxes and therefore have to be topped up by the Commonwealth. There are two ways of addressing vertical fiscal imbalance. One is to cut state government expenditure. If you did that to keep the states' income revenue raising in balance you would cut state government expenditure in this country by $25 billion a year. It seems unlikely that that would be an option that the states would willingly embrace. The other option for ending vertical fiscal imbalance would be to impose or give the states—

What has been your response to the concerns expressed to you by Cut Price Deli franchisees about the action of your predecessor, Minister Beddall, and the comprehensive details provided to you about the difficulties of franchisees with Mr Rechichi and other directors of the Cut Price Deli franchise?

If there has been unconscionable conduct, economic duress or other unsavoury activities by anybody in the business community, small business people including franchisees will be able to take appropriate action with the assistance of a new unit being established in the Trade Practices Commission.

         —Thank you, Mr President. I make this point: there have been numerous occasions when mainly opposition senators, but also some government and minor party or Independent senators, have sought leave to make a personal explanation. It has always been the government's view in that circumstance that leave be granted; but we are not going to be in the business of making any special consideration for Senator Crichton-Browne or any other senator. However, because there is no matter before the chair, because this is not an unusual procedure, it would be the government's intention on this occasion to give leave if the matter is proceeded with by Senator Crichton-Browne. If not, we will be equally happy to give leave after the taking note of questions without notice.

Therefore, I would respectfully suggest to both Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Chamarette that the business they want to call on ought to be called on after the half an hour of taking note, and if I am asked for leave at that time, I will give it.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Chapman this day, relating to the Cut Price Deli franchise.

       <para>
        This has to be one of the more significant examples of Senator Schacht's incompetence as a minister, of which we have seen many over the last few years, whether it is in regard to space, Customs or whatever. Of course, the first issue perhaps precedes Minister Schacht, but certainly he now has to take responsibility for that decision. That was the appointment of Mr Rechichi to the federal government's franchising task force—a person convicted and sentenced to five years for armed robbery; a person appointed by Minister Beddall to that task force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Schacht's response to this has been that he did not make the appointment and that the appointment was made on the basis of recommendations by the Franchisors Association of Australia and New Zealand. One might ask the minister whether, in his view, it is appropriate that such a person, whom I understand is about to declare bankruptcy, should ever have been in the position of advising the government on issues involving the commitment of franchisees' funds, irrespective of the source of the recommendation of his appointment. Surely these people are vetted and their bona fides properly established before any recommendation for appointment is accepted.

         In a letter dated 8 March 1995, following a meeting between Senator Schacht's adviser and three of the Cut Price Deli's franchisees, Senator Schacht advised that the material provided to his office had been forwarded to the Trade Practices Commission for assessment of alleged breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Yet on an SBS program

         On 13 April 1995, Senator Schacht again wrote to the same franchisee shrugging off any responsibility—this time to the Trade Practices Commission under Mr Robert Gardini, the person appointed responsible for undertaking a review of the franchising code of practice. Perhaps the minister will realise now that the game is almost up in terms of his being able to claim that he did not know the details of this matter when he spoke to the SBS interviewer.

        He made some reference to those legal matters again in his answer this afternoon. But that does not negate or obviate the fact that the minister said that he was not aware of the details, when clearly the letters that he has written to the franchisees show that he was very much aware of those details. It is a matter of public record. On 7 September 1995, the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        published an article by Anne Lampe, in which it is stated that following the appointment of the voluntary administrator to the Cut Price Deli group which `left more than 100 franchisees in limbo', the Australian Franchisees Association wrote to Senator Schacht seeking government action for its members.

         That article was published, despite an attempt to prevent its publication and threatened defamation action lodged by Mr Rechichi on 23 June in the Supreme Court. Six weeks earlier, one of the franchisees won damages and costs of $260,000 against the Cut Price Deli group but, of this, the franchisee will receive only five to 10 cents in the dollar due to the fact that an administrator had been appointed prior to his receiving damages. I understand the ASC is now considering an investigation of the affairs of Cut Price Deli and of the voluntary administrator, Mr John Starr.

         The minister should have demonstrated more concern on this issue but he has washed his hands of the issue of how a franchisee's letter marked commercial-in-confidence to Minister Beddall could have mysteriously turned up in Mr Rechichi's hands. He has also washed his hands of Mr Rechichi's appointment despite conviction. He has clearly washed his hands of all of the concerns of these franchisees and the way in which they have been treated by Mr Rechichi and the other directors of the Cut Price Deli group by simply fobbing these matters off to the Trade Practices Commission, when it seems very clear that any actions of the Trade Practices Commission would be quite inadequate.

         —The issue that Senator Chapman is getting himself into a lather over has been around for quite a considerable time. There is nothing inconsistent with what I said on SBS about the details of Cut Price Deli. If I recollect the interview correctly, I was asked about the details. I knew that this was a long running case already before the courts involving many franchisees and a very detailed range of issues. When I said, `I am not aware of the details,' that is what I was meaning.

         What I did say, and quite openly admit—and it is true—was that I had referred information they had sent to me to the Trade Practices Commission because, under the existing law of Australia, that was the only place I could refer the issue to see whether there had been any breach of the Trade Practices Act. That is matter for the Trade Practices Commission as a statutory authority to make a judgment about.

         However, I have to say, Senator Chapman, that that issue and many others I had been observing in the franchising industry led me to bring forward to early in 1994 the promised review, chaired by Bob Gardini, to deal with a number of these issues that people such as the Cut Price Deli franchisees were raising, issues about the transparency of the commercial arrangements they entered into when they signed a contract to be a franchisee. I had said almost from that time, `I want a system voluntarily entered into from both sides where there is full disclosure of all the arrangements and people don't change the rules afterwards.'

We have responded in policy terms not just to consider Cut Price Deli franchisees, but to consider the whole franchising industry. We have responded by announcing our intention to amend the Trade Practices Act to make it stronger so that any franchisee or small business has a better chance of getting legal redress under the Trade Practices Act. I find it extraordinary, Senator Chapman, that since I announced that a month ago, there has not been one statement from the Liberal Party despite all the professed views that they are going to make small business the big issue at this coming federal election.

They are dead silent about it. They do not want to make a decision. The first thing you can do, Senator Chapman, is to get your party to make a public statement of support to amend the Trade Practices Act in support of the government's policy initiative to help small business, including helping franchisees. But, no, there is a deafening silence. Why? I suspect it is because the Liberal Party under the guidance of Mr Costello and the business establishment in Melbourne want to ensure they line up with big business. They forget about small business. When it counts to amend the law to make big business give small business a better opportunity, you mob opposite are always found wanting. You will not vote for it.

If you look at the latest gold float, which oversubscribed about 10 or 20 times, lack of capital in Australia is not a prime reason for non-success in business. There are other things, like a lack of a business ability, which accounts for 20 per cent, and economic conditions, which are brought upon by the government and which account for 30 per cent of these things failing. I have the figures; they are OECD figures, which you have been quoting, Senator Cook, when it suits you. There you are. That is the situation. I believe this minister and his Prime Minister would have us `forcify' super funds into high risk, low return, very risky return situations, where the superannuants of Australia will not have security in their old age.

         What is true is that, by and large, superannuation funds do not invest in the areas of venture capital and developmental capital. Where start-up firms need some finance to get going, superannuation funds have a higher level of risk aversion. Where small companies that have just got started have a good product in the marketplace and they want to grow and need some capital to develop their enterprise, superannuation funds are not investors to any great extent in that area of the market either. They are not just my views; these are views put to me by people in small- to medium-sized businesses all around Australia.

         My first point is that we are not going to direct it. But there is a need in this area. The report that I drew the Senate's attention to in question time was a report commissioned by the National Investment Council, which is an advisory body to the federal government on investment. It sought to find out what operates in this area of the market. It commissioned a consultancy to go away and make the report. The words in the report are the words of the consultancy; they are not the words of the government. We have not written them; the consultants, after surveying the field, wrote them. What did the consultants say? I do not have the document in front of me, but I do recall the quote quite well.

         They said that superannuation funds—and they named the funds—demonstrate elements of risk aversion when it comes to investment in small- to medium-sized companies. They said that, on the performance of those funds, they are 35 per cent more risk averse than similar funds in the United States and the United Kingdom—two economies with which we compare ourselves to see how well we are performing. There may be a series of behavioural reasons as to why that is the case; I can think of some that fall into that category. We have heard nothing from the opposition about trying to analyse the policy implications of this.

         Given the explosion in the volume and number of funds, there are a number of people, new to the task and lacking in experience, managing investment decisions in those funds. We have done a number of things to help them gain experience. But the funds still seem to be impervious to what assessment of risk is in small- to medium-sized businesses and to balancing their portfolio of investment to develop some funds in this area. The Prime Minister is concerned to point that out. It means that companies like Pacific Dunlop are bought by foreigners, not Australians, when they are put on the Stock Exchange for sale. They are bought by foreigners because they better understand the risk of these sorts of investments. Australians with the money to invest in keeping those companies under Australian ownership have been negligent in not devoting themselves to understanding that risk. That is the point of the issue.

         —Thank you for reaffirming that you stand by it and putting it on the public record. I want to make a very brief point about that. Until this government was elected in 1983, less than 40 per cent of working people in this country had superannuation. The vast majority of people had to depend on the traditional age pension—at the present time about $8,300 a year. People who took out superannuation were, as Senator Cook has described, people who were in the Public Service, where there was and still is a very generous scheme, with very significant contributions from government.

         There was also personal private superannuation that was offered. But the difficulty was, Senator, it was prefaced—it has changed now significantly—on a scheme of tax deductibility and tax concessions. If you look at the way in which those tax concessions operate, it is generally only higher income earners who can take advantage of some of those tax concessions. In fact, what we had was a situation where, with a significant subsidy from the government—I am not saying that necessarily was wrong—only people generally on a higher income could take advantage of it. You may well have been one of those, Senator Panizza.

         Until 1983, hundreds of thousands of people—probably at least a million people—who had their own personal superannuation had taken it out as a result of the tax concessions. They tended to be male. They tended to be higher income earners, they were in a public service fund or they were senior management in corporations. The poor worker, who would be earning less than $35,000 a year—in many cases much less than that—did not have access because employers often did not offer their superannuation funds to their employees. So they had to go and take personal superannuation out, if they had the disposable consumer income available to go and buy that superannuation product. Higher income earners generally have that and not lower income earners. That is the point I want to make, Senator Panizza. It is not a point I am going to repeat in my next contribution.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Vanstone this day, relating to taxation.

        Senator Cook claimed to the Senate and to the Australian community this afternoon that this government is a low taxing government. He made comparisons with the OECD and left the clear impression that the government is a low taxing government and that we should judge what it is going to do in the future by what it has done in the past. Those policies are set out in the budget papers.

         Let me set the facts of the last few years before the Senate and the Australian community. Since Paul Keating has been Prime Minister, in the first full year of his reign as Prime Minister, 1992-93, the total taxes and charges by this government from the community totalled $95 billion. This year, 1995-96, the total of taxes and charges is $125 billion—a 31 per cent increase over a three-year period. Big spending, big taxing government!

         In addition to this big, huge increase in taxes and charges over a three-year period, at the start of that period, the 1992-93 financial year, the debt by the Commonwealth was $30 billion. Today it is over $90 billion and, at the end of this financial year, the budget papers and government announcements indicate it will be very close to $100 billion. Not only have they taken in this huge increase in taxes and charges, but they have also borrowed another $70 billion and spent that too.

         But it is worse than that. They have sold off some of the silver—Qantas, half of the Commonwealth Bank, CSL, et cetera. If we go back to the same starting point, 1992-93, at least $5 billion of the silver owned by the community has been sold off, and they have spent that too. And worse than that again, going back to the same starting point, back at the start of the 1992-93 financial year, the Commonwealth spent about 4.7 per cent of its outlays on infrastructure—that is, investments in the community. Back in Mr Hawke's day it was nearly eight per cent but, since Mr Keating has been Prime Minister, it has gone to less than five per cent. What is it this current financial year that we are over a quarter of the way through? I dare you to guess. It is minus 2.3 per cent.

         So we have this big-spending, big-taxing government claiming we should look to their policies for the future by looking at what they have done in the past. I say to the Australian community, just look at what they have done in the past three years. We cannot afford to go on like this. Anyone who runs a household understands that not only can you not increase charges in the manner they have, but to borrow and spend that and to then sell off part of the farm and spend that too, and then to stop investing in infrastructure, is an absolute disgrace.

They are not willing to comment on why their shadow ministers are running around this country promising a whole raft of increased expenditures over a whole range of programs. I am not saying that this is a concerted effort by shadow cabinet to say that they will have this amount of expenditure but, every time a problem comes up—it might be Senator Campbell today on youth suicide or Mr Tim Fischer about more money for black spot programs—right across the board this opposition says they should spend more money.

       The basic issue the President was asked to comment on today by Senator Harradine was a decision that was presumably supported by the Procedure Committee regarding question allocation being reduced for the WA Greens, the Independents and the Australian Democrats. In the case of Independent senators, it is to be reduced from one question every three days to one question every four days.

        It is the prerogative of the President to set the allocation of questions. The current system has operated during the term of this parliament and for as long as I have been in this chamber.

        We agree that there is a need for a constructive approach which affirms the role of question time and also accommodates the opposition's concerns. However, what has happened is that it has degenerated into a private deal between the parties, using the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure for cover. The Greens and the Independents are not represented on this committee. We would like to have some representation. I understand that the government and the opposition are willing to allow us on to the committee, but that does not deal with the issue before us now.

        The fact is that the Procedure Committee met last week and supported the decision that has been made and that was going to be enforced by the President from today. An attempt has been made to establish a principle of proportionality for question allocation. As Senator Harradine has said, no such principle has existed previously. We are also supported by the Clerk of the Senate in that assertion.

        What is the purpose of question time? It is a forum for the accountability of the executive. The allocation of questions should be fair, but with regard to the purpose. The purpose is ministerial accountability. Therefore ministers and the President should be excluded from any proportional formula that might be used to ensure fairness. Just work out what will happen if, with the change being brought about for the last 16 days of this sitting, there is a change of government. The government, in the form of the coalition, will have enormous advantages in relation to dorothy dixers. The whole principle of proportionality will, instead of ensuring fairness, overrule what I believe is a higher principle of accountability of ministers. It is the opportunity that ministers have to give an account of themselves to the people via the parliament and via the questions put forward by opposition parties.

        If the coalition were in government it would be favoured because of its proportional representation and that would violate the principle of accountability of the executive—to the detriment of both the government and the opposition.

        The Greens are willing to come to an alternative arrangement which accommodates the opposition's desire for a greater number of questions, but not at the expense of existing allocations to individual senators. We should work forwards and not backwards. No-one should be disadvantaged. We should work for a win-win situation. Along these lines, we suggested to the President that there should be a set allocation of 18 questions per day, removing the overall time limit, and reducing the answer time limit from four minutes to three minutes. This allocation of questions would be based on the current system and be expanded along proportional lines.

      <para font-size="-=2">
       In your letter you state that:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
       "In principle the distribution of the call during question time should be in proportion to the numbers in the Senate of the various parties, groups and independent Senators."
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Greens (WA) believe that no such principle exists in the Senate for the allocation of questions. Odgers' Senate Practice makes no mention of such a principle and the Clerk of the Senate confirms our view.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       It is widely acknowledged that question time is a forum for Parliament to scrutinise the actions of the executive government. This scrutiny has become even more important as the range and significance of decisions made by the executive has increased and many avenues of Parliamentary scrutiny have closed or diminished.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We believe the ability of all non-government Senators to scrutinise Ministerial actions must not be diluted.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We understand that this issue has arisen because of Opposition concern about their allocation in proportion to the minor parties and independents.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Greens (WA) are willing to consider an alternative arrangement for the allocation of
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       questions. In doing so we recognise that a precedent, while not existing previously, will be established. As such, we are willing to consider any proposal which uses the current system as the minimum bench mark for the allocation of questions and expands from that point, not contracts.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       If we are to use a system based on representation then its logical conclusion is to exclude Government Ministers and yourself from any calculation and, arguably, all Government  Senators.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       An initial suggestion would be to establish a question time of a set allocation per day, removing the overall time limit. The following allocation is suggested: Government 5; Coalition 10; Democrats 2; Greens (WA) and Independent Senators each guaranteed one question every three days. This would roughly mean 18 questions per day, depending on the call of Greens and independent Senators to ensure their allocation. Any change to question time should be for a trial period.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       These figures are based on the current representation of the Senate, excluding Ministers and the President (see the attached table). The removal of the time limit is an incentive for the Government to answer questions as efficiently as possible to ensure the containment of question time in the daily program, while allowing for longer answers where necessary. This allocation better reflects question time as a forum for scrutiny of the executive. The ability of Government backbenchers to contribute to such scrutiny is preserved.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Greens (WA) look forward to further debate on this issue. We believe that it is possible to arrive at a constructive solution, which will not disadvantage minor parties and independents, address the concerns of the Opposition and preserve question time as an effective vehicle for scrutiny of the executive.

       ALLOCATION OF QUESTIONS
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The purpose of this letter is to invite senators to express views on the allocation between the parties and independent senators of questions at question time.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In principle the distribution of the call during question time should be in proportion to the numbers in the Senate of the various parties, groups and independent senators.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I have continued the practice of my predecessor of giving the Australian Democrats two questions per day and sharing one question per day between the Greens (WA) and the independent senators as a practical means of applying that principle. However, a fixed number of questions for these groups, combined with a fluctuating total number of questions, particularly with the increasing use of supplementary questions over which I have no control, is producing a less proportional result, which has tended to favour the minor parties and independents. The attached figures show that the Democrats' and Independents' share of questions has increased.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I have accepted that some variation from precise proportionality is unavoidable but have also accepted that if that variation becomes excessive then some action would have to be taken to bring the distribution of questions back towards proportionality.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I suggested the following solution. The Greens (WA) share of questions would be reduced to two questions every four days and the Democrats would receive one question per day plus a second question after thirteen questions had been asked on any one day. Where this total was not reached on four consecutive days the Democrats would receive a second question on the fourth day. Using the figures for the call for the first half of 1995, these proposals would still have produced an outcome slightly favourable to the Democrats and the Greens.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       At a meeting of all party whips and representatives of the Greens on Thursday 24 August 1995 it was clear that the underlying assumption—that questions should be distributed approximately in proportion to membership of the Senate—was not universally accepted. Various proposals to change question time were canvassed, for example, a fixed number of questions, for time to be added to question time to compensate for points of order or other interruptions and exclusion of ministers from the calculation of the government party's share of membership of the Senate. These matters were clearly beyond the competence of the meeting to resolve.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I had hoped that my proposal to adjust the share of questions would be accepted and that proposals for fundamental change to question time would be referred to the Procedure Committee. However I, understand that this is not generally acceptable. I have therefore returned to the established practice.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       These matters will be further considered by the Procedure Committee. I invite senators to put any views in writing addressed to me.

       DISTRIBUTION OF QUESTIONS
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Since becoming President I have sought to apply the principle that the distribution of the `call' during Question Time should approximate the proportion of membership of the Senate of the various parties, groups and independent Senators. I have continued the practice of my predecessor of giving the Australian Democrats two questions and sharing one question per day between the Greens (WA) and the independent senators as a practical means of applying that principle. However a fixed number of questions for these two parties combined with a fluctuating total number of questions, particularly with the increasing use of supplementary questions over which I have no control, is producing increasingly skewed outcomes. This has tended to favour the minor parties and independents.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I have accepted that some variation from precise proportionality is unavoidable but have also accepted that if that variation became excessive then some action would have to be taken to bring the distribution of questions back towards approximate equity.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The figures for the first half of this year which I obtained from the Table Office during the recess showed that the Democrats and Independents share of questions had increased compared with 1994. Thus my office approached the Australian Democrats and Greens in the last week of the recess with proposals to reduce their shares of the `call'.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The proposals were an arithmetic solution to an arithmetic problem. The Greens(WA) share of questions would be reduced to two questions every four days and the Democrats would receive one question per day plus a second question after thirteen questions had been asked on any one day. Where this total was not reached on four consecutive days the Democrats would receive a second question on the fourth day. Using the figures for the `call' for the first half of 1995 these proposals would still have produced an outcome slightly favourable to the Democrats and the Greens.

       issue on Thursday 24 August 1995. It was clear at that meeting that the underlying assumption—that questions should be distributed approximately according to the proportions of membership of the Senate—was not universally accepted. Various proposals to change Question Time were canvassed, for example, a fixed number of questions, for time to be added to Questions Time to compensate points of order or other interruptions and exclusion of Ministers from the calculation of the government party's share of membership of the Senate. These matters were clearly beyond the competence of the meeting to resolve.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I had hoped that my proposal to adjust the share of questions would be accepted and that proposals for fundamental change to Question Time would be referred to the Senate's Procedure Committee. However I understand that this is not acceptable to the Greens (WA).

       The distribution of questions in the Senate does not fully reflect the party affiliations of members At a meeting on 29 March 1995 various matters in relation to the distribution of the `call' during Question Time were considered by the party whips and a representative of independent senators.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       It was clear at that meeting that there was no general agreement on the basis on which questions should be distributed. Some of those present felt that the government party did not need access to a share of questions proportional to its membership of the Senate because it had so many other opportunities to get its views on the record. It was also stated that, as the Democrats and minor parties did not get involved in the disruptive behaviour which occasionally reduces the number of questions asked, they should not suffer by having fewer opportunities to ask questions.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       A second issue—the weight to be given to supplementary questions in determining the share of questions—also needs to be resolved. At present a supplementary question is counted as equal to an initial question. It was suggested that, because the time available for a supplementary is half that for a full question they should be valued accordingly. In practice this makes very little difference to the overall imbalance. The proportions vary slightly but the same balance is maintained. It increases the overall share of those who ask fewer supplementaries—the government and the Democrats—and reduces the rest.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I propose to invite the whips of the parties and representatives of the independent Senators to a further meeting before the commencement of the next session to seek to resolve three issues:

       I will ask the table office to provide me with a breakdown of questions asked in the first half of this year and circulate alternative proposals for the allocation of questions based on various assumptions; for example using questions only; using both questions and supplementaries and using both but valuing supplementaries at half the value of an initial question.

        I do not accept a number of the comments that Senator Chamarette made. I suppose we could say that any of the Senate's committees operate behind closed doors.

        Senator Chamarette has certainly raised on a number of occasions the issue that the Western Australian Greens are not represented on the Procedure Committee and hence she is unable to put a point of view to the Procedure Committee members at those meetings. There is obviously some truth in that. It is true that neither Senator Chamarette nor Senator Margetts are members of the Procedure Committee, but I can assure them that the committee has looked at this issue in some detail at a number of meetings.

        I think there is an argument for a further discussion to be held, perhaps outside the forum of the Procedure Committee, given the matter raised by Senator Harradine in question time today relating to his concerns about the President's calling of senators during question time, given some of the matters that have been raised by Senator Chamarette and also given that the Australian Democrats, the opposition and the government hold some strong views in relation to this matter. It seems to me that before we progress this matter in the chamber it would be appropriate to have another discussion. As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I am willing to convene an informal meeting to see whether we can work through some of these issues before we deal with the Procedure Committee report in a more formal way and before this matter is finalised.

        We do have a representative on the Procedure Committee. Her report to the party room suggested to us that there was not much interest in pursuing our concerns about the fundamental assumptions that we wanted to question. I put those fundamental assumptions again because this new procedure, as I understand it, overturns about 17 years of convention. We should ask the question: why is that happening now? It is happening because the opposition made a complaint to the President. Obviously it is his responsibility to respond to that complaint. Why is this happening now?

We should continue to question one of the assumptions that underpins this new procedure: the assumption that the allocation of questions is made on a collective basis. Where is the starting point for the fact that somehow questions have to be allocated to parties on a collective basis and then the others get a look in after that?

        Secondly, I think it is silly to count ministers, who can ask questions—and maybe they would like to start asking each other questions—in the total of those who are able to ask questions, unless they want to do it.

       ay at the time that we complained, `We will formalise this take note procedure and we will allow the take note procedure so the minor parties and the coalition can have their right to have their say, after the radio and the TV go off.' At least you had a chance to counter the government's five minutes of political rhetoric during question time on radio and TV. That is how it worked initially.

        The Labor Party are in trouble in the election campaign. They have suddenly worked out that the take note procedure is a forum which the coalition and the minor parties had to make points. Some of the points were being reported. They have woken up to it. What they have been doing in the last couple of weeks? You have all seen it. I do not know whether you have raised the question, as I have.

        What happened yesterday? Senator Hill moved a motion to take note of an answer. Two ministers then spoke, plus another person from the Labor Party. They had three, including two ministers who had had the whole of question time as well. Another coalition person moved to take note of an answer. So we had two speakers. Another minister and another Labor Party senator spoke. I might have those numbers wrong. I think I have one too many. There were two coalition speakers and four Labor Party speakers.

Senator Chamarette's motion today inadvertently has given rise to a reinforcement of that, because we are involved in a big time wasting exercise at the moment. I think Senator Faulkner was genuine when he said, `Why don't we sit down and try to sort this out?'

        But I do remind you that the question of proportionality did come up a year ago about the committees. You were all in favour of proportionality then. It was a terrific idea to take the chairmanships off government members as opposed to 70 years of tradition in the Senate. It all went. Proportionality was a terrific idea. But all of a sudden it is not. It is not because you want this Senate to follow some of the sorts of traditions and institutions that have been embedded in this institution. That, basically, is not a bad idea. You don't have to be a revolutionary about every part of Senate procedure—sometimes you are; sometimes you're not. But I do say that it did actually give proportionality a big kick along when all of you conspired to put proportionality into the committee system.

        Could I say just one or two other things. I think questions in question time should be allocated according to need. People have sort of hinted that there is not as much need for questions on our side because they are quite fully supportive of what the government is doing and do not have to hold it as accountable as the rest. I understand that. I often think that some of the individually inspired questions that come from our side just lack a touch in subtlety. Especially, sitting out front, I have actually noticed that. Therefore, I do not think it is the end of the world to us even if we do not consider proportionality, but have what we might call a fair mix of questions that actually meets the requirement of the Senate to bring the executive to be accountable to the chamber.

        I would hope that in the meantime the recommendation of the Procedure Committee is not implemented. That is a decision that the President will need to make. In the flow of the discussions and in the spirit of this sort of agreement all round the chamber, I hope that he may take that matter up and not implement the Procedure Committee's recommendation until such time as we get some agreement around the chamber.

        But I cannot really let what Senator Ian Macdonald has said pass entirely, if he does not mind. In regard to the statement that he made about the number of questions, taking today as an example there were 11 primary questions and the opposition had six out of those 11. Counting supplementaries, there were 18 questions and the opposition had 12 out of the 18 questions. I do not think there should be any complaints in respect thereof.

        I still believe that question time can work more reasonably. I would like to put on the record now, too, a conversation that I had with one of the President's staff who is dealing with this—and I hope this is what the President intends to do. I was told that, to ensure absolute correct proportionality, the President would work to his ruling that he set down in his letter for what I believe is a two-week period, one sitting period, and then he would work out how fair the proportionality had been out of that.

        For instance, with 9.6 per cent of senators, if the Democrats only got seven per cent of questions, for instance, we would get an extra 2.6 per cent of questions, or an attempt to do that, over the next sitting fortnight. So over a session, or even over two sitting fortnights, it would even out to as close as the President could get to exact proportionality. I hope that will still happen.

I cannot see why ministers need to ask questions of other ministers. I have not noticed them doing it. I know they have a right to, but I have not noticed them doing it. I do not expect them to start tomorrow; I do not expect them to start at all. So I still do not believe that, on a basis of need, ministers need to ask questions of other ministers.

        I do not believe taking note, which Senator Ian Macdonald brought into this, has been a part of negotiations. While it is an interesting point which we perhaps should be looking at, it is certainly not one that we have looked at in the past and it is not one that has taken up an awful lot of time. I well remember the first time that I think Senator O'Chee got up and sought leave to take note of a minister's answer and everybody sat around looking like stuffed chickens and wondering what on earth was going on. It was an extremely clever move of Senator O'Chee's which has since then well and truly taken off. It is a very, I think, reasonable and valuable thing to do. Certainly that is a part where the Democrats believe we should have well and truly our amount of taking note. We are a bit under, but we get around about our fair share of that.

        Most importantly, while proportionality is reasonable, need is also something that should be taken into account. As Senator Ray said, people who need to ask questions should be able to ask questions. I still do not see why ministers need to ask questions.

        What is being proposed at the moment, I believe, does not reveal a correct assessment of what a question is, what a supplementary is and the amount of time taken. For example, to count a supplementary as a question is clearly flawed. It takes two-sevenths of the total question time. A primary question takes five-sevenths of that time. To base any statistics on the assumption that a supplementary is equal to a question will give you a pretty stupid assessment of proportionality.

        I have noted the Committee's views in relation to a numbering system for future instruments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As regards the issue of the impact of the date the Guidelines were expressed to take effect (7 June 1995) being different from the date of notification in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Gazette
        </emphasis>
        (21 June 1995), I wish to point out that the new Guidelines were formulated to take account of concerns from employers and uniform suppliers that some aspects of the original Guidelines were difficult to comply with.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new Guidelines contain a number of revisions that will in fact make it easier for genuine corporate uniforms or wardrobes to be admitted to the Register of Approved Occupational Clothing (`the Register') and hence gain tax deductibility. For instance, the maximum number of colours or shades that can be used in a design has been increased from four to eight; the minimum size of corporate identifiers on accessories has been reduced; and there is greater flexibility for differing uniforms where the employer maintains separate public identities for different parts of its organisation or where uniforms differ between employees for safety reasons.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I also note that while the new Guidelines state (at Clause 23) that single items of occupational clothing, other than full body garments, will not be admitted to the Register, this simply serves to clarify the effect of Clause 10 of the original Guidelines, which stated that occupational clothing `. . . must, when considered as a set, distinctively identify the wearer as a person associated, directly or indirectly, with their employer. . . '.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Single items of occupational clothing, being worn in conjunction with conventional clothing, have never been considered to pass this test and were therefore not approved under the original Guidelines. On this basis, I have been advised that the inclusion of Clause 23 in the new Guidelines will have no effect on the eligibility or otherwise of applications for admission to the Register.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is, however, one very minor area where the new Guidelines could be seen as being stricter than the original ones. This is in relation to the definition of `stand alone' corporate identifiers. The new Guidelines state that a stand alone identifier must be permanently affixed by being, inter alia, `sewn down on all sides', while the original Guidelines stated that such identifiers must be permanently affixed by being `sewn on'.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, I have been advised that this difference has not, in practice, adversely affected the rights of any applicant seeking admission to the Register. This is because the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA)—which administers the Guidelines—did not reject any applications dated between 7 June and 21 June 1995 which would have satisfied the original Guidelines but not the new ones.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, I have been advised by the Attorney-General's Department that, as a matter of legal interpretation, the Guidelines actually commenced on the day they were published in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Gazette
        </emphasis>
        . This is because the paragraph in the published text of the Guidelines (paragraph 3) which states that they commence on 7 June 1995, is expressed to be explanatory only, and thus is not part of the Guidelines proper.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thus, it appears that the original Guidelines effectively continued to operate until 21 June, both from a technical legal perspective and in practice. For any applications dated and approved by the TCFDA between 7 June and 21 June on the basis of the new Guidelines but which would have failed the original Guidelines, tax deductibility has been (and will continue to be) available from the dates the applications were approved and the clothing designs entered on the Register.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the basis of the above information, I have been advised that the difference between the date the new Guidelines were expressed to take effect and the date of notification in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Gazette
        </emphasis>
        has had no prejudicial impact upon the rights of, or imposed any liabilities on, any person.

If at 8.30 in the morning when it starts we find that there is any technical hold-up we wish to make sure that that person who has driven such a long way is in no way disadvantaged should we get to half past 9 and that person either has not completed his evidence or has not had a chance to give evidence.

         —This is a very important motion, and I hope that the Senate will treat it with the importance it deserves. It is quite extraordinary to try to understand what has motivated people like Bill Kelty to intervene in the current Coles-Myer debate. I would have thought that it is apparent to all outsiders that the institutions are responding to widespread concerns in the community, particularly in relation to related party transactions and the combination of the role of chairman and executive officer. In those circumstances, it seems to me that it is perfectly proper for the institutions to seek to bring about higher standards of corporate governance. There have been various investment management groups who have been arguing vehemently that there needs to be a change in those arrangements, so why did Mr Kelty intervene?

         He did not take issue on the merits. He did not, for example, argue that related party transactions should be of no concern to shareholders, nor did he argue that the arrangements currently in place are adequate, nor did he seek to justify the concept of an executive chairman. He simply weighed in with a series of questions clearly designed to intimidate the AMP, to make it at least think twice and, preferably, to back off.

         It has to be asked: whose interest was he serving? Was he hoping to set up a golden parachute for himself as his use-by date rapidly approaches, or was he hoping to again persuade some of the major corporate operators and close friends of his to kick the ALP tin in a big way with the approach of the election? He was clearly pleading the case for the incumbents on the Coles-Myer board. He was not interested in quality of management issues. He was simply protecting his mates.

         Therefore, I think it is very understandable that there are many within the union movement who would view this development with great concern. Again, one asks: why is it that Bill Kelty has strayed so far from his roots? Perhaps it is because he looks at someone like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and he sees a bloke who has never had a real job in his life; who has been in parliament since he was 25 years of age; who in that time has had a wife and four kids to support; who has been able to not only buy a half-million dollar home in Elizabeth Bay but has had it unoccupied for some years—in other words, forgoing very substantial rental income; and who has then been able to come up with $400,000 to put on the table—

         —No, it is a very interesting proposition. Mr Kelty realises that he is in a mug's game, and he does not want to be on welfare street when the music stops. It is precisely why people like Michael Easson and Peter Sams have been so concerned for many years—because they do not believe the ACTU truly represents workers. They are in it for themselves. You only have to look at Jennie George's performances around the country in recent times. She is not out there acting in the interests of workers; she is acting for the union oligarchy and to support the ALP's return to government by hook or by crook.

         That, I would have thought, is a devastating indictment. What it means is that someone like Mr Kelty is prepared to put at risk—and, indeed, to sabotage if necessary—corporate reforms which are seen to be important by institutional investors, by the financial institutions themselves, by fund managers, by those in the financial press who take an interest in these matters and, I suspect, by the community in general.

         But no, what you have is someone like Bill Kelty weighing into the debate and asking a whole series of tendentious questions: `Does the AMP have a policy on corporate governance?' It is quite clear that the ACTU does not have, so why is he asking the AMP? He asks, `Who in the organisation made the decision to intervene?' Did the rank and file get asked whether Mr Kelty should be weighing in on behalf of his mega-rich mates? Of course they did not. He is doing it off his own bat. He asked, `Has the AMP consulted with its policy holders or trustees?' Again, AMP is charged with the responsibility as a shareholder for making decisions which they regard as being in their own best interests. They are a trustee for very many small investors, and they have a responsibility to ensure that the highest standards of corporate governance prevail. So why is Mr Kelty so utterly disinterested in all these propositions?

         I suppose question No. 4 is the one that really gives you an indication, because he suggests that AMP should have regard to the implications for corporate blackmail. That can only be designed to intimidate the AMP, and that is precisely why the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Herald-Sun
         </emphasis>
         this morning gave it front-page prominence. Then Mr Kelty asked, `Has any AMP employee or representative spoken to other investors and expressed views which may have a bearing on the market price?'

Again, quite clearly, he is simply arguing the case of those with whom he dines in Toorak mansions and those with whom he is closely associated. He is not interested for one moment in the welfare of superannuation funds, in the welfare of financial institutions, in making sure that they measure up to the standards that people like Senator Sherry have spelt out so carefully—and I think Senator Ferguson also—in the Senate committee hearings, in relation to the proper standards that ought to be in place.

        It is all very well for Mr Keating to urge funds to take decisions that are of much higher risk with the prospect of a higher return. But you only get one chance if you are close to retirement. If you get it wrong, it is all very well to take the long-term perspective, but you do not get the benefit of it.

         That is why Terry McCrann said today that he is not fit to govern. He says that he is not even fit to be a minister, let alone a Prime Minister. His judgment is badly flawed and he lacks self-control. He recites several examples of where the Prime Minister has waded into debates quite improperly in the past in this very sensitive area, where it is important to maintain public confidence. The Prime Minister's contribution is leading to precisely the opposite. It is outrageous.

He does not in any shape or form want to protect the investment of smaller investors. Coles Myer is a classic case of probably very many thousands of small investors going to get a store discount and finding themselves being pushed around by the Prime Minister. I hope that the Senate will condemn the behaviour of both Mr Kelty and Mr Keating as utterly un-Australian. It is quite antipathetic to the interests of small investors. It is only designed to feather their own nests and push their own mateship arrangements.

         By way of background to this government's superannuation policy, when we came into office in 1983 we set a strategy where workers would have the equivalent of 15 per cent of their salary paid into super by the year 2002. We set that at nine per cent 2 1/2 years ago with the SGC. We have since announced a further six per cent: three per cent direct from the employee and three per cent from the government vis-a-vis tax collections.

         Where the money is coming from, in addition to the quantity of money, is an important issue when dealing with the issue of where the money is invested, how it has been invested and what the record has been. I will come to that a little later. We are creating an enormous pool of savings. It will be some $2,000 billion by the year 2020. One important aspect of this is that it will increase national saving because it will increase the real levels of saving in this country. It will create a major pool of investment and additional investment that will make inroads into our national debt.

It is a very important contribution. Where did we hear policy contribution from Senator Alston about those sorts of issues? We did not hear it. Another issue in relation to superannuation is that we are implementing this 15 per cent a little late, I have to say, in the sense of the international community. Comparable Western economies have implemented their compulsory national superannuation contributions.

         Another part about our superannuation policy is that this money is primarily invested by the private sector through a system of trustee law. I would have to say as an aside that trustee law was never designed to handle superannuation contributions; it has been more through the evolution of superannuation funds in this country—long before we came into office—that superannuation trustees have ended up managing this money. I hope that Senator Kernot heard the contribution of Senator Alston, because in terms of policy debate it was certainly lacking.

I think it is to the credit of Bill Kelty and the general trade union movement that we have moved away from the system we had in 1983. I have outlined the changes that have evolved in our policy development. Prior to 1983, less than 40 per cent of the work force received superannuation. It was generally confined to people in the public sector, management and middle management, the highly paid and, generally, not women workers.

The debate about where the money is to go and how it is to be invested is a very important part of the development of superannuation in this country. There have been criticisms—I think in some areas, legitimate criticisms—of the poor performance of funds over the last year or two; fund members have complained about that. But I think the other side of the coin is that the benefits of superannuation are long term in a diversified portfolio. It is the average return that it is important to be highlighting to members, rather than the short-term return. I can recall back in the 80s when funds were returning 15, 20, 25 per cent. We have acted and we have required funds to report their average return for the past five years, so that you get a truer picture of what is going on. It is up to the funds to invest responsibly and to deliver strong fund performance over time.

         —Whatever was the spark for the recent interest in superannuation investment strategy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which in my view he couched in very intemperate language, I guess on the positive side I agree with Senator Sherry that we have opened up a long overdue debate about current investment practices because the Australian Democrats believe that they are not and have not been in the long-term interests of Australia.

         I stress `Australia' as distinct from `the members of the funds', because I have little doubt that the overwhelming majority of fund managers and trustees have been acting as prudently as they can to further the interests of the members of their funds as they see them. I think there is a very strong awareness out there of the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act on their actions and, if anything, there is probably an excessive conservatism about meeting the requirements of that act.

         I do believe that the fund managers are not necessarily acting in the long-term interests of Australia because I am not persuaded, frankly, that placing 40 per cent of funds in blue-chip company stock, 40 per cent in property and bonds and 20 per cent overseas does a great deal of good for our small business sector, for our infrastructure development, for housing customers, for farmers, for venture and development capital, for research and for export industries. No, we should not be in the business of using funds to prop up government failings, to adequately fund infrastructure or research and development, and I think the government stands condemned for starving these sectors of proper levels of government funding for many years now.

         But, when the superannuation industry is propped up by $5 billion a year of tax concessions, when it has received a huge free kick with compulsory superannuation and when this government is now offering it a further $10 billion a year by way of employee co-contributions, this is our major pool of capital in this country and we are legitimately entitled to ask whether the Australian people as a whole are getting value for money on that investment.

         In 1992, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I submitted a minority report. I dissented from the findings of the committee that there should be no directions on where super funds invest their money. I pointed out in that report that the short-term view of funds in maximising members' returns `ignores the possibility of greater returns from investments in Australian firms because of the higher levels of general economic activity which arise from increased local investment.'

        The problem is that in Australia we have a very under-developed capital market by comparison with the rest of the world. I have had to plead for money in all of the markets. This market is probably at the cowboy end of the spectrum and because of that there is a great need for it to be nurtured and developed. People talk about the market as if it were a real market. It is not. It is controlled by a whole series of interests that I do not think are present in some of the larger and more liquid markets available overseas. We should not compare ourselves with New York. We certainly should not compare ourselves with London. And probably, thank God, we are not the same as Tokyo.

         Our super funds have not proven to be particularly patriotic. Five years ago, our funds invested 11 per cent of their assets overseas. In 1995 it was 16 per cent. While investments in Australia have grown by 50 per cent in that period, investments offshore have grown by a whopping 137 per cent.

         Now it is the turn of the investment funds. The Prime Minister feels the heat when things do not go his way, and all of a sudden fund managers are donkeys and lemmings. Do not let us forget that, while he has the language and the style of a schoolyard bully, he is still the Prime Minister. Therefore, it is not hard to see how ordinary Australians—struggling to pay off the mortgage, feed the kids and put a little bit into their nest egg for the years ahead—must be confused and almost certainly concerned by the Prime Minister's comments.

Now, when the heat generated by his ill-advised foray into the Coles Myer issue gets too much, the superannuation funds have become donkeys—the very same donkeys and lemmings who only a few months ago benefited from a $12 million so-called education campaign which sought to win support for the government's strategy on superannuation. That campaign used the proverbial money tree in a pot being nurtured by the watering can of compulsory superannuation contributions.

        Mr Keating has long had this wish to exercise control over superannuation. When he was Treasurer in 1989 he told the ACTU congress that union control of superannuation savings was to be used as institutional muscle in any future hostile political environment. We have had a number of senior government ministers putting up their ideas for pumping superannuation savings into a variety of politically correct activities. The latest has been the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) who thought that the government's privatisation of ANL and the airports should be achieved by using the savings of workers.

I would like to remind senators of the sole purpose of superannuation. There is only one purpose for superannuation and superannuation contributions: to provide an income in retirement to the members of the fund.

         Superannuation is not the best savings vehicle. Managed funds tend to give the lowest returns to investors, according to a recent report by the Australian Consumers Association. They have significant problems in terms of making capital inaccessible or imposing large costs on those who try to extract funds early. They are not really substitutes for pensions since fund members can often get lump sum payouts. Funds tend to invest conservatively and so are of little value in providing capital for new ventures or small business or the development of industries. In other words, they are a poor investment vehicle as well as a poor savings vehicle.

If the government was honest it would either leave things to the market or create a government retirement fund or superannuation fund and require everyone to contribute to that. It would directly and openly control investment by this organisation in areas argued politically to be socially desirable.

It is my suspicion that what will happen as a result, especially if there is a change of government, is that this will signal the end of pensions as a right in Australia.

        Last week in this parliament the coalition parties brought home in a very stark fashion through raw statistics just how this government has created a wide gap between the rich and poor. One statistic was that in the mid-1970s some 65 per cent of all households in Australia had incomes between $22,000 and $72,000. Some 16 years later in the mid-1990s we now find that that figure has fallen from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. They were the raw figures we produced last week.

         If ever there needs to be evidence that this government through its attitudes and actions has been the creator of a growing gap between rich and poor and has ultimately alienated itself from the workers in this country, then Bill Kelty's attempted intimidation of AMP and the Prime Minister's attack on the fund managers is proof positive. The very sight of the union lord using workers' savings as a tool to defend a cause of a corporate friend or mate that is utterly unrelated to the lives and wellbeing of the workers really must anger those employees forced to take up union superannuation funds and those employees that Mr Bill Kelty is supposed to represent.

         It now brings into question the very fear that many have of the responsibilities the unions have in managing superannuation funds—that is, workers really have no choice, there is no portability. There is a fear that the unions may politically use those funds and, even worse, that the trustees may well be feathering their own nests. The fact that those workers are in the hands of the existing ACTU leadership is a real fear. Clearly, other union heads have been startled by Mr Kelty's intervention to attempt to blackmail the AMP and know the very risk that Mr Kelty has put them in. An article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . many union officials had contacted him "to indicate that, like me, they feel that it is a little unusual for Bill Kelty to be taking sides in a fight between corporate moguls".

       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly the point, so aptly put by Mr Peter Sams. It is little wonder that the workers do feel alienated from their unions and that the unions are suffering a severe slump in membership. The recklessness and damage done by Mr Kelty does not really measure up against the Prime Minister's own damage and recklessness when he made his comments last week. For the very same reasons that Mr Bill Kelty interfered in the Coles-Myer boardroom fight, the Prime Minister also interfered. Something that was lost on Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts was that these comments in relation to superannuation were motivated by a direct interference in the Coles-Myer boardroom dispute.

         With no concern for the integrity of the worker superannuation contributions, the Prime Minister launched a public attack against the AMP and the fund managers and simultaneously brought the cornerstone of the government's national savings policy into disarray. He has further shaken what little confidence the workers had in the employee-employer superannuation system. It really is laughable that within a week of the government's launching its Shaping the Nation booklet, holding up the compulsory superannuation guarantee as a achievement of this government and spending $12 million pushing that achievement, one comment by the Prime Minister has it in tatters.

         If you are honest, you have to admit that the major threat to superannuation and public confidence in superannuation in this country is the lack of Liberal Party policy, the lack of any coalition policy on the issue. People investing and people planning for their retirement do not know what might occur if there was a change of government. They do not know whether whatever policies they are pursuing are in their best interests because they have no idea what the Liberal Party might do.

By the year 2002, 15 per cent will be paid into superannuation funds on behalf of all employees: nine per cent by the employer, three per cent by the worker and three per cent by the federal government. The last thing we heard from the Liberal Party was that they were going to cap SGC contributions at six per cent and five per cent for small employers. They have not caught up with the debate.

Without the surety of some sort of bipartisan policy position, without knowing what the coalition would do if it ever was elected to government, people are uncertain, they are concerned. The Liberal Party really does owe it to Australia to come clean on its policies for superannuation and hopefully endorse the government's proposals as the Australian community, business, unions and workers have done. I know it will look like you are coming second again but it will at least provide some surety and some confidence in the system.

         In the last few days, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has contributed to commencing a very necessary and long overdue public debate. Superannuation in this country is provided by the private sector. The government is committed to ensuring the private sector provides that superannuation vehicle. It currently has in the order of $200 billion invested in that market, and it is predicted to increase tenfold in the next 25 years. So we are talking about an enormous amount of capital in Australian society being involved in this superannuation industry.

There are very good reasons why we ought to be focusing public debate on management and investment policies of superannuation funds. There are big public policy issues at stake.

They are big issues that the Senate select committee has recognised need to be addressed as public policy questions. We will be looking at them under a term of reference next year. The Prime Minister is recognising and is starting the debate that a lot of other people have begun to concentrate on.

         There are major issues, particularly in relation to short termism in the attitudes of investment managers. In submissions to the Senate select committee, managers have recognised that it is a problem for them that people tend to focus on the short-term rather than the long-term needs for an investment strategy. The focus has tended to be on traditional investments and short-term returns rather than looking at innovative investments and the longer term benefits that might flow.

We do encourage the long-term view by fund managers. We encourage public education on these issues. We expect that the vast amount of capital invested in superannuation in this country will also do something to benefit the other public policy goals of developing jobs and of developing the economy in Australia. It is important that all senators give some attention to this issue in the next couple of years, because it is one of the big policy questions facing us.

         The crazy situation is that outside this building people have incredible access to the Internet and have the capacity to receive information through Internet E-mail. In spite of having hundreds of computers installed in this building in members' and senators' offices, we do not have the capacity from our own offices to access the Internet; nor do we have the capacity to receive Internet E-mail. If we are fortunate to be on POITAG and to be part of the trial, we still have to go around to the Senate resources offices to get access to this.

         It is very much the work of the Department of the Senate which has driven some of the changes in computer communications rather than the work of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. I think that is a shame. Hopefully that is something that will be rectified in the forthcoming year, because the national parliament ought to be at the forefront of communications if we are going to stay relevant. That is what all my comments are aimed at—making sure that the parliament stays relevant to the people and stays accessible.

         If we were to say, `We're going to stick our heads in the sand,' that would be unacceptable, in the same way as it would have been unacceptable hundreds of years ago to say we would not allow Mr Hansard to make his verbatim reports of parliament. I think if Mr Hansard were here today in the Australian parliament, he would be all for multimedia presentations of parliamentary debates, because he would see it as the most effective way of letting people know what happens in their parliament and what happens in the decision making process of their country.

         I would like to conclude by making some comments about Hansard itself. I note that in the report it said that Hansard wishes to discuss with senators and members the question of accuracy. Generally speaking,

          Hansard

         —Very briefly on behalf of the government, in reading the annual report of the Department of Parliamentary Reporting Staff, I would like to indicate my congratulations to the very effective service that is provided through the department. Looking at the workload indicators from 1990-91 to 1994-95 on pages 12 and 13, there has been a very significant increase in the workload—the number of chamber sitting days and the number of committee hearings covered. We can certainly vouch for that in the Senate, particularly given the number of select committees we have had in the last couple of years.

         Even though new technology and improvements in staffing levels can ease that workload to some extent, there is still enormous pressure on all staff in parliament, but particularly on the reporting staff. It is a very difficult job. I certainly did not understand the skill involved in being a Hansard reporter. It is a very important skill. I understand there are not many people with such skills in Australia, and particularly around the world.

I happen to think that the delivery of a speech is as important as the content. I am one who personally thinks that, whilst reading speeches at times is unavoidable, it is also very important if you are speaking from notes or reading the occasional comment to as much as possible develop your skills as a communicator by resisting the temptation to read speeches.

         The first report I have tabled recommends the construction of a modern purpose-built field hospital for the Australian Army at Holsworthy to replace the existing inadequate medical facilities of 1 Field Hospital at Ingleburn in Sydney's west. The proposed hospital is required to support Australian Defence Force operations during a contingency, in accordance with the defence policy of self-reliance, as outlined in the 1994 Defence White Paper.

         The proposed facility will provide health care for regular Defence personnel located in the area known as the Liverpool Military Area, as well as Army Reserve personnel and visiting overseas military forces. The hospital will consist of a field component, and an Australian Support Area component which will continue to service those personnel who do not deploy when the field hospital deploys on operations. The facility is based on a 25 bed ward and a 16 bed self-care rehabilitation unit.

         In common with the defence forces of other developed nations, the Australian Defence Force provides medical and dental treatment to serving members; this is to maintain the highest standards of medical, dental and physical fitness. Such treatment is provided both in the field and in the barracks environment and ensures that members remain fit and available for operations. Field treatment for the Australian Army is provided by field hospitals such as 1 Field Hospital in Sydney and 2 Field Hospital in Brisbane.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         During the public hearing a proposal was put by the Southwestern Sydney Area Health Service that Defence should make use of facilities at the Liverpool Hospital.. However, while the Committee recognises the need for certain medical procedures to be performed at civilian hospitals the Committee agrees with the Department of Defence that operational requirements necessitate 1 Field Hospital possessing a wide range of medical capabilities. These include operating theatres, intensive care, pathology and radiology services.

         During its inquiry, earlier this year, into a replacement medical centre at RAAF Richmond the Committee expressed concern at the high incidence of sporting injuries requiring treatment. While the Committee recognised the need for Service personnel to become and remain physically fit, it questioned whether this fitness was being achieved in the most efficient manner. At the Holsworthy hearing the Sectional Committee was informed by Defence that injuries resulting from either training or sporting activities were of concern to Defence and were currently being investigated.

         In May 1991 the Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon. Robert Ray, announced the Ready Reserve Program.

         The success of the Ready Reserve implementation relies on the ability of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment to be an operationally effective unit. 49 Royal Queensland Regiment occupies facilities dispersed over nine separate locations. The separate locations, lack of functionality and in some cases inadequate size, detract from unit effectiveness and the effective utilisation of accommodation in Gallipoli Barracks. This also impacts on the morale of unit members as they can see that other battalions are better accommodated than 49 RQR. The unit layout as it now exists leads to inefficiencies in control, administration and training.

         Construction of the proposed facilities will redress significant shortfalls existing in accommodation of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment at Enoggera.

         The Committee has always been concerned with energy conservation measures.

        AIRPORTS BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Airports Bill provides for major reforms to the operation, development and regulation of Federal airports. It's a bill founded upon the significant investment made in Australia's airports in recent years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Indeed, since 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has greatly enhanced most of the airports it presently operates. In this period, the most notable changes have been capacity increases at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport, international terminal improvements at Sydney and Melbourne, new terminals for Alice Springs and Darwin, supporting work for domestic terminal improvements around Australia, and most recently, a grand new international terminal at Brisbane Airport. The FAC has completed all these works on a commercial basis, without any recourse to Budget funding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result of their completion, FAC airports are better placed to meet both current demand and forecast increases in this demand. They are well set for the next phase of their operation under private leasing arrangements.

        Future Operational Responsibility for Airports
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With much of the infrastructure enhanced, the Government announced in `Working Nation' last year that we would develop a new regulatory regime for airports and conduct a scoping study into the possible sale of the Corporation's airports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following endorsement of those plans at last year's ALP National Conference, the Government decided to proceed with sales by way of 50 year leases, with options for a further 49 years. The bill requires Government approval for the issuing of these options. It also dictates that each lessee be a company set up to operate the airport, and that there be only one company assuming each lease. Where a group owns more than one airport the separate airport companies may have a common holding company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The decision to lease the airports underlines the strategic importance of the airports managed by the FAC, and the public interest considerations associated with them. The use of long term leases means that the Commonwealth will maintain ownership of the airports and that leased airports remain Commonwealth Places. It also supports continuation of Commonwealth regulatory control of the airports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Budget this year the Government announced its leasing strategy. That strategy opted for the leasing of FAC airports in two stages, with the four major airports (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth) leased in the first phase, a phase in which Sydney will be jointly leased with the new airport at Badgerys Creek, Sydney West Airport. The latter decision reflected the outcome of market testing and overseas experience which suggested that multi-airport systems were far more successful when developed on a complementary rather than competitive basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's intention is for the first stage to be completed by the end of 1996, with the second stage involving the remaining FAC airports taking place throughout 1997-98.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This timetable is now jeopardised by Coalition threats to excise Sydney from the first phase of the leasing process. Such threats amount to economic blackmail, pure and simple. Worse still, they are nothing short of economic lunacy on the part of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The leasing strategy was designed to ensure maximum bidding and price tension, and therefore return to the taxpayer, by putting all the most attractive assets on the block first. If the most attractive asset, Sydney, was withheld, cross ownership restrictions would ensure that bids would either not occur, or would be far below the real value of Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane airports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For that reason if the present leasing strategy, a strategy recommended to the Government by the best expertise of outside consultants, recommended on the basis of feedback from potential bidders, is blocked by the Parliament, the entire leasing process will of necessity be put on hold. As a result the aspirations of Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide for new airport operators will be frustrated by the economic irresponsibility of the Federal Coalition. In addition, work on the upgrading of Adelaide Airport's main runway will also be delayed as funds for this project are predicated on the leasing of Sydney.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the same time the value of Sydney Airport itself is depreciated by the Coalition proposal to make its leasing conditional on an intersecting runway configuration, a configuration involving dependent cross runway jet operations. According to Air Services Australia this would cut Sydney's capacity by up to 35% while guaranteeing the airport is operated in a manner that does not maximise safety. Again, in the interests of protecting the taxpayer and flying public, the Government cannot accept such a naked attempt to vandalise the process. Any Government who did would be grossly negligent.

        Sydney West
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the Coalition persists with its attempt to stymie the leasing process, it will have to bear responsibility for the resulting impact in delaying the development of Sydney's second airport, Sydney West.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Government's leasing timetable the target date for completion of the first stage of Sydney West is the end of 1999. To meet this target the Government has approved planned expenditure of nearly $1 billion on the airport and associated transport links.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first stage of development, built to a standard to accommodate major domestic and international jet traffic, will include a 2900 metre runway, a 10 000 square metre passenger terminal, parking spaces for up to four B747s and four B737s, and international standard air traffic control, rescue and fire fighting facilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Government's leasing strategy the FAC will retain contractual responsibility for the development of Sydney West Airport until it is leased jointly with Sydney Airport. The lessee will then be required, as a condition of the lease, to complete the first stage of Sydney West to the Government's specifications and timetable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The leasing process provides the revenue to construct Sydney West via a special levy at Kingsford Smith Airport. Therefore any delay in the leasing of Sydney sabotages what is a critical and tight timetable for the new airport. It would certainly guarantee that Sydney West is not available in time for the Year 2000 Olympic Games. If the Opposition persists with their threat to block the legislation, then responsibility for delays and traffic chaos at the time of the 2000 Olympics will rest squarely upon John Howard and his colleagues.

        In seeking to give effect to these objectives, the Commonwealth has undertaken extensive consultation with a range of interested parties (including the States and Territories, local government, the airlines, the aviation industry, other airport users and potential investors). This consultation process included a market testing program in February this year and the circulation in August of a package that included drafts of the two airports bills. These processes worked well and the comments received have helped shape the final regulatory arrangements.

        The companion bill, the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995, being presented on behalf of my colleague the Hon Kim Beazley, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, provides the legislative basis to facilitate the leasing of the major Federal airports. It provides for the granting of leases, the transfer of assets and FAC staff to the airport companies, and related sales matters.

        The Airports Bill sets out the details of the post leasing regulatory arrangements to apply to the airports.

        The legislative provisions require airport operators to advise on all consultations undertaken with key stakeholders such as the States and Territories, local government bodies, airlines, and other interested parties, both during the process of developing draft master and major development plans and environment plans, and prior to such plans being released for public comment. The public comment provisions then require airport operators to advise the Minister on the public comments received, and to have due regard for these comments.

        Restrictions on ownership and control of airport-operator companies

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill requires airport-operator companies to be majority Australian owned, limiting the maximum level of foreign ownership to 49%.

        The detailed arrangements will be set out in regulations to be developed in consultation with the industry and other interested parties.

        There is, in particular, substantial scope to protect areas surrounding the major airports from residential and other development incompatible with the long term use of the airport. Whilst constitutionally this is a State responsibility, the Commonwealth is committed to working closely with the States, and in turn expects the States' cooperation on land use planning in the vicinity of airports.

        The decision to sell long term airport leases is a major policy initiative which the Government believes will further enhance the development of this vital part of Australia's transport infrastructure. The decision is founded on sound economic principles and a sales strategy designed to maximise taxpayer returns. By contrast, the Opposition's proposed amendments would be operationally and economically disastrous. They are nothing short of economic voodooism and cannot be taken seriously.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Overseas experience has demonstrated that, despite the high level of public interest in airport operations, with appropriate regulatory oversight the Government no longer needs to manage the commercial operation of airports. By ensuring continuing Government control over key functions, as this bill has, no area of public interest that can be compromised by commercial considerations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Post leasing, the Commonwealth's former role will certainly be transformed. The new focus will be on regulatory requirements, including pricing oversight and quality of service monitoring. This is consistent with the thrust of so many micro-economic reforms the Government has undertaken.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The regulatory arrangements which I have outlined will provide a full range of public interest protections. They will maintain all existing arrangements vital to protecting the public. They represent a significant step forward, breaking new ground in ensuring the orderly development of airports.

        Overseas Governments have and will continue to look closely at Australia's leasing and regulatory experience. Until recently, it has been an excellent process. Regrettably the Opposition is now seeking to delay its implementation for cynical political considerations. In the process, they are greatly inconveniencing a number of large foreign and domestic investors, many of whom have spent millions preparing their bids. We would urge the Opposition to desist and abandon their economically nonsensical approach to this leasing debate.

        AIRPORTS (TRANSITIONAL) BILL 1995
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill gives effect to the government's decision to sell the long-term leases over the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation under a two-phase sales process. A separate company will be formed for the purpose of holding a lease over each airport and relevant FAC staff will be transferred to the new company. In the case of Sydney and Sydney West, the airport companies will have to be purchased by the same holding company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will provide a sound legislative basis to facilitate the leasehold sale of the major federal airports. The bill provides for: the transfer of airport land and associated assets from the FAC to the Commonwealth; the granting of leases over the airports and transfer of associated assets to individual airport companies; and the orderly treatment of the FAC's debts during the sales process. It also provides for airport staff currently employed by the FAC to transfer to the airport companies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The companion bill, the Airports Bill 1995, establishes the regulatory framework to apply to the airports following their leasing. The regulatory provisions contained in the Airports Bill are necessary to ensure that airport users and the general community receive the maximum benefit from the improvements in the delivery of airport services under the leasing process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provision of airport infrastructure requires a large amount of capital and, for this reason, airports have traditionally been considered the responsibility of government. However, Australian capital markets are now sufficiently sophisticated to support the development of infrastructure such as airports. Given that public interest considerations can be protected through the regulatory framework of the Airports Bill, the need for continued Commonwealth investment in airports is no longer compelling.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, through the involvement of superannuation and investment managers, the airports' leasing will provide an excellent opportunity for the funds of Australian men and women to be productively employed in the provision of national infrastructure. This is to the benefit of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The decision to lease the airports rather than sell them under freehold title was motivated by the Government's desire to retain some control over the land on which the airports are located. The length of time for which these leases will be granted will ensure that sales proceeds are roughly equivalent to a sale under freehold title.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The lease of the airports is expected to produce a significant net offset to outlays, with the majority of proceeds expected to be received in the 1996-97 financial year. The bill provides for a number of financial transactions necessary to facilitate and account for the leasing process and to allow for the orderly disposal of the FAC's assets. It is expected that these transactions will be Budget neutral. As has previously been the practice, the government is not able to reveal details of estimated proceeds from leasing the airports as this would in all likelihood influence the outcome of the process and would probably see a reduction in proceeds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill now before the House contains a number of measures designed to facilitate the leasing of the federal airports. Under the bill, the land and associated assets currently held by the FAC will be transferred to the Commonwealth. Once the airport land and associated assets have been revested in the Commonwealth, the bill provides for the Commonwealth to grant a lease over the land at a particular airport to a company referred to as an airport lessee company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the proposed airport regulatory regime, these companies must have the status of constitutional corporations incorporated under Corporations Law. The bill enables the government to adopt a flexible leasing process involving either selling airport companies which already hold leases over the airports or granting airport leases to the airport companies following their sale. In either case, upon the granting of an airport lease, the FAC's contractual rights and obligations at each airport, as well as its liabilities, will be transferred to the relevant airport lessee company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is extremely important to the government that the jobs and entitlements of FAC staff are protected under the airport leasing process. The airports are therefore to be leased either with staff in place or with staff transferring to the relevant airport company immediately after leasing. Existing awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment will transmit to the airport lessee companies, which will ensure that airport staff retain key terms and conditions of employment as well as entitlements to accrued benefits post transfer. Following the transfer of staff, the terms and conditions of their employment, as contained in awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment, will be varied only according to the terms of those agreements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The FAC Head Office will continue to oversee the management of the remaining federal airports prior to their leasing. Consideration will also be given to developing opportunities for head office involvement in airport activities, including the possible operation of airports to be leased in the second phase of the leasing process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In accordance with the government's stance regarding payment of stamp duty in asset sales, the sale of shares in airport lessee companies or the sale of leases over the airports are to be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties. This will ensure that state and territory governments receive duties to which they are entitled on sales transactions which take place in their state or territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill does, however, contain some exemptions from state and territory taxes and stamp duties. These exemptions apply only to the those transactions required to structure an airport company for sale with an airport lease and associated assets in place. In this instance, the full value of the airport company will still be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties through the sale of shares in the company by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From a tax perspective, the government is concerned to ensure that purchasers of airport leases and existing lessees under the FAC are not disadvantaged because of the government's choice of sales mechanism. Put another way, in terms of tax, the government is seeking, where appropriate, to treat the sale as if it was a sale by the FAC in the private market place. I refer the honourable members to the explanatory memorandum for details.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill now before the House contains provisions to permit the FAC to discharge its Commonwealth debt and to allow for the corporation's non-Commonwealth debts to be dealt with in an orderly manner during the leasing process. The provisions contained within the bill, coupled with the existing provisions in the FAC's statute, give the Government the flexibility to deal, in due course, with the corporation's debts in the most appropriate manner. The government can assure the honourable members that the interests of holders of the FAC's bonds will be taken into account in dealing with the FAC's debts during the sales process. The bill also facilitates the transactions necessary to ensure that the approach adopted for dealing with those debts is properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The airports to be disposed of in the second phase of the leasing process present specific regional and administrative issues which will need to be addressed prior to their lease. For example, the airports of Canberra, Darwin and Townsville are jointly operated by the FAC and the Department of Defence. As such, new operating arrangements will need to be developed with Defence before the civil facilities at these airports can be leased.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although a number of the airports to be leased in the second phase have been unprofitable in the past, many of them are expected to become commercially viable under private ownership through cost reductions and improved revenues. For the remaining few that may prove to be commercially non-viable, the government will examine options for securing their future, taking into account the specific financial characteristics of each airport, as well as regional interests and sensitivities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill seeks to provide a sound legislative basis for the leasehold sale of the federal airports and, in conjunction with the companion Airports Bill, is a key element in assisting the government to achieve its leasing objectives. The leasing of these airports represents another step forward in the government's continuing micro-economic reform agenda. The leasing framework will promote improved efficiency in the provision of airport services through the introduction of private sector disciplines, as well as ensuring that the government receives a fair return from divesting itself of a function in which its involvement is no longer essential. I commend this bill to the Senate.

         —I am pleased to have the opportunity to proceed with my remarks on the Family Law Reform Bill 1992 (No. 2) and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. I spoke last evening for a short time. I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so, Mr Acting Deputy President, while you are occupying the chair—having been the distinguished chairman of the committee which reported to the parliament in November 1992, which is the report being responded to by the government with these bills.

         I spoke last evening of my support and pleasure that the government had moved to remove the word custody from the bill in dealing with children. Also I did not mention last night, I do not think, but I equally approve of the change to the use of the word access. It is a word many of us became familiar with over a long period of time. It describes the right to enter and pass over a piece of land without hindrance. It also means access to one's children, as we have used it. The changes proposed will, over a period of time, bring more meaning to the act on what we are really intending.

         Last evening I referred to the Child Support Agency and the formula which still needs to be addressed—and my disappointment that the government has shelved that—and the question of custody and access. I wanted to refer to the other issue that is very strong in the community and that relates to the position of grandparents to children who are the subject of a marriage which has failed.

         For the most part grandparents are included in the ongoing arrangements, and it works to the benefit of the children. But in far too many cases we found in evidence before the committee—evidence that I think all of us receive in our electorate offices—that grandparents too frequently are cut off from the grandchildren that they have known in a way that indicates that it is being done for some reason other than in the best interests of the children.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Any children who have grandparents living would benefit from a good relationship with those grandparents. I could speak for the rest of the time available to me about why that is a benefit—the relationship that can develop between children and grandparents and the heritage of the family that can be passed on. In so many ways the relationship can help cover and deal with the trauma of the parents having divorced.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is my view and, I think, the view of the committee that, in fact, the act provided for the role of grandparents to be recognised. But one cannot deny that all too frequently grandparents were excluded. One reason for this is the cost involved in bringing a matter before the court. Many grandparents would not have had the resources to enable them to do so. The way legal aid operates, it is most unlikely that grandparents would have qualified for legal aid.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One solution to that problem is that judges ask the question: what about grandparents? In granting the divorce, if there are children of the marriage, a judge is always doing so being satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the children of the marriage. It seems open to a judge to say to the parties before him, `Are there any grandparents still living?' If there are, he is entitled to say, `What arrangements do you have to make sure that these children still have an ongoing relationship with their grandparents?' Perhaps in time when that happens, it will be much easier for grandparents to be included. Without spending more time on that issue, I welcome the addition of grandparents in the amendments that the government puts forward in this act, because if it helps to make it work better, then that is very worthwhile.

         But at the end of the relevant section, which I think is 67P(1), I find, and the legal and constitutional affairs committee found, a penalty of imprisonment for two years for a register found to have intentionally or recklessly disclosed certain information. If it was done intentionally, he should be fired on the spot. So that would not be a real problem as far as I am concerned. But the concept of imprisonment in these circumstances does not seem to have been explained adequately in the act itself.

         I also share the concerns of the legal and constitutional affairs committee on the question of it being 21 days under a magistrate's suspension of a contact order for appeal. That is outrageous. I can imagine the way that would be used by a number of people who manipulate and interfere with contact with children. Three days, as the committee suggests, is plenty for that. I urge the government most strongly to reconsider its proposition of 21 days. I can see an order taken out every 21 days in some cases—and you have to remember that that sort of thing does occur.

         It would be an understatement to say though that the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 (No. 2) and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995 have been a long time in the making. The cruelty of the delay is that many thousands of people have set such store in the passage of these bills that every week the bills have been dropped down the Senate agenda, those people have become further disillusioned with the parliamentary process and even more disenchanted with the politicians.

When I first started my quest for a family law committee to review the Family Law Act, I could have been forgiven for thinking I was achieving something worthwhile.

         Of course, in reality the hundreds of hours and the millions of words that have been written about this legislation and these changes are simply not reflected in what amounts to some paltry changes to the family law. As a non-lawyer, it seemed ludicrous to me that one parent could deny the other access to their children—that one parent could so tie up the other in legal wrangles that they sent them broke or crippled them emotionally. As a farmer, it seemed absurd that a property in one family for generations could be rendered worthless and unworkable because a family law judge insisted that it be sold or split to satisfy the legal requirements of a property settlement to someone who might only have had a very brief involvement with the farm.

         The family law act committee, as it is now known, was established with the highest of ideals and the noblest of intentions. The committee worked hard, processed mountains of evidence and digested, contemplated and determined a list of 120 recommendations, of which the overwhelming majority had the support of every political party. We could have been forgiven for thinking that that was the end of the matter, that the government would report, that the bills would be drawn up and the debate would soon follow.

         While I always cautioned people that the process would take a couple of years, I was certainly not prepared for the three years it would take from the time the report was tabled until it was debated in this chamber. It has taken a most circuitous route—from the Family Law Council so they could wash out a few recommendations; then to the government draftsman to fiddle with it; then with a few false starts and a few more sanitised washings from one legal body or another until the legislation we have before us today. While all this sanitising and study has gone on, the divorce rate in Australia has continued to climb; families have remained under increasing emotional trauma; and many separated couples have felt compelled to take their own lives and sometimes that of their spouses and children.

Fifty-nine per cent of all divorces involve children and, last year alone, there were over 16,000 orders sought for custody or guardianship. While we can encourage mediation in preference to litigation, the reality is that if one does not wish to negotiate and mediate then there is no legal requirement to do so.

         The government has provided additional funding for mediation services. In 1994 the Family Court Counselling Service saw over 77,000 people and 1,500 interview interventions involving family violence. The annual report of the Family Court advises that the demand for counselling is steadily increasing, and that is good. But the fact remains that divorce is now more common than it was in 1975 when the Family Law Act first came into being. It is debatable that the system is any less traumatic. We still have as many angry, disenchanted people in the community, wanting and expecting us as politicians to do something. The longer the process of reform drags on, the increasingly lower credibility we all engender in the community.

         I might add to the list that the least respected people in the community are the family law judges themselves. The Family Court was set up to be a user friendly court, a legal process whereby people could come and understand and be understood. So the remarks made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court a few weeks ago on 20 September 1995 do no service to the court, to the judges or to the chief justice himself. In speaking at the second annual conference of the Family Court of Australia, Chief Justice Nicholson said:

        There is a constant and persistent view pursued by people who are often discontented litigants, sometimes obviously dysfunctional, that the Court is in some sense designed by anti-family groups to destroy the institution of the family in society.

       <para>
        That is as offensive as it is judgmental. I might also add that he describes these groups as `anti-family'. Might I suggest that his remarks in support of same sex couples being recognised as a family and his claim that opposition to this view is `hysterical' and `suggestive of an increasingly authoritarian and repressive society' are as anti-family as one might possibly be. I believe the Family Court was set up to take the mumbo jumbo out of the law and make it understandable and fair to all. He went on to say in his speech this delightful quote:

         I would only add that this same man wrote to me when I was attempting to establish a parliamentary inquiry into family law suggesting that it was not the place of politicians and the parliament to delve into such complex issues as family law—his implicit suggestion being that we were not competent to do so. I do not think that is quite right either, because we had some very good people on our secretariat whom I think had a good, qualified chance of making this act better.

         In this same speech, Chief Justice Nicholson suggests that anyone espousing fathers' rights are irrational and not worth trying to talk to. I have had considerable dealings with fathers trying to get access orders to see their children upheld and I am constantly frustrated by the inexplicable lack of enforcement of orders. It was something that the family law committee heard time and time again. It was also referred to in several places in the committee's report. To now have the head of the Family Court dismiss these claims, suggesting they provide `little opportunity for rational discourse', indicates to me that the anger and discontent amongst lone parent groups about Justice Nicholson are well placed.

         The parliamentary committee on family law is about to bring down its report on the administration of the Family Court, so I believe it is inappropriate for me to make any further comment about the actual operation of the court. However, very relevant to this bill before us now is the attitude of the judiciary. Justice Nicholson's remarks at the family law conference reflect the difficulties inherent in the system as the family law committee saw them when contemplating the act itself, so are pertinent to the bill we are debating here today.

         In summary then, might I recap on the work of the family law committee and say that we deliberated long and hard on the Family Law Act and produced a document with 120 recommendations. The Family Law Council saw fit to accept only 79, or 66 per cent, of these recommendations. They disagreed with 17, qualified a further 16 and provided alternatives to another six. I reluctantly have to accept that the Family Law Council is probably more qualified than any group of parliamentarians. However, as elected representatives of the people, I believe we must listen to and reflect the views and opinions of those who seek our advice and intervention.

         I believe the family law committee report—as, indeed, its subsequent report on child support—reflected community views and generally attempted to make better a system that is flawed, involving an issue that cannot be dealt with dispassionately. I am not persuaded of this current government's commitment to family law reform. I am in no doubt that the recent weekend comments by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) of a new commitment to a change in family law procedures will not hold much water with the many thousands of people who have dealings with the court; nor will they hold water with the literally dozens of people who write to me complaining of lack of access to the Attorney-General and lack of any appeals procedure to air their grievances.

         If you ask any member of parliament what is the major issue for people who come through the doors of their offices in the electorates, I think they would say it is family law and the problems that people have with access, custody, parenting or visiting rights—or whatever you like to call them—in the new suggested bill. I believe this government has shown a consistent pattern of resistance to change in family law. This legislation is not much better than tinkering at the edges.

         The government's similar lack of response to changes in child support shows me and those involved in family law a government too intent on keeping the status quo. The current system has failed and this bill will not do nearly as much as is required to make the Family Law Act better able to act on behalf of the people in the community who have the sadness and worry of marriages breaking up. It does not happen always of their own volition, but because two people cannot get on.

         —The Senate this afternoon is discussing a couple of pieces of very important legislation that impact on the lives of many Australians. I am talking about the Family Law Act and the amendments proposed in both the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 and the Family Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1994. I have had some involvement with the legislation that is in front of the chamber tonight. It started in March 1991 when the parliament established the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. I was elected to chair that committee of inquiry.

         As previous speakers have said, we deliberated for some 18 or 20 months, taking evidence right around Australia. In November 1992 we presented a report to the parliament, a report that encompassed 120 recommendations for change and amendment. The majority of those recommendations were accepted by government after review by other bodies such as the Family Law Council of Australia. Since then, my involvement with the legislation has continued by virtue of my membership of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee has presented to the chamber two reports on that legislation. I have had involvement with that.

         By way of interjection to Senator Brownhill, the previous speaker, I also said that I now have further involvement by virtue of the fact that my son and his wife had a baby girl some 23 months ago—her second birthday is coming up. So I have a real interest in another important amendment which the government intends to move to this bill. I might deal with that amendment first. I am particularly pleased that the government is willing to listen to the people. I stand here very publicly and claim credit for bringing that amendment about.

         I was approached in Western Australia earlier in the year by a group then known as the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia. They wrote to me in my role as a member of parliament for the state of Western Australia, asking that we bring about amendments to the Family Law Act to recognise the role that grandparents play following the break-up of the marriage and the relationship. I met with the people and took their concerns to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee here in Canberra, suggesting to the committee that not only should we read the words of the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia, but we should also invite representatives of the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia to appear before the committee. Mr John Payne, the vice-president of the group and Mr Brian Lane, a member of the group, appeared before the committee here in Canberra on 6 June 1995.

I am very pleased with that. I note in passing that the Grandparent Action Group have now changed their name to the Grandparent Support Group of Western Australia, I think a more appropriate name, and have continued to do good work in this area on behalf of their constituent groups.

         </emphasis>
         on 1 October, a major spread entitled `Self service or blind justice?' It is three full pages together with another article in between. That is one of many articles—many of them misguided—that appear about the Family Court and the Family Law Act and how, as is said in one of the articles in the paper I have just mentioned, the Family Court fails to live up to the dream. Perhaps it was an impossible dream, because when any relationship breaks down, irrespective of how mature the people are who are involved in that breakdown, there will be some hurt, there probably will be some bitterness, and there sometimes is some anger and indeed some violence. Some of those matters have been addressed in the legislation that is before the chamber tonight.

         I want to spend just a moment in addressing articles such as the one on divorce that I have mentioned. The third page of the article has a photograph of the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Mr Alastair Nicholson. It talks about the Chief Justice having a high public profile and not being a person who shirks from controversy or from asking for more money to build up the empire that perhaps is now the Family Court of Australia. It certainly is growing, and it continues to grow. Indeed, the more it grows, it seems, the more demands are placed on it.

         Sooner or later, that growth is going to have to stop. The money has to come from somewhere, and it has to be raised in taxes. It is we, the politicians, who have got to go out there to the public and encourage them to give up their incomes in taxation, not the judges of the courts—not judges like Alastair Nicholson, who are high profile or non-high profile. If we, when we go out into the public arena, make public comment about matters of politics or policy, we are the ones who through the ballot box have to answer for our concerns—not lifetime judicial appointees.

         The Chief Justice went on in his speech and talked about the hysterical reaction to his remarks. I would reject that in terms of my remarks, perhaps because I made them off the cuff in direct response to his; I had no pre-warning that they were coming. I do not accept that my remarks were hysterical. I have seen the minister's remarks, and I do not accept that they were hysterical either. I would suggest that perhaps the remarks contained in his speech, which were premeditated and prepared, verge on being hysterical. They serve no credit whatsoever to the Chief Justice, to the office that he holds or to the institution that he rules over in his position of Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia.

         The bipartisan committee—the deputy chair of which, Mr Andrew Peacock, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, is no longer in the parliament, and members of the opposition parties, including Senator Spindler—combined together and worked long and hard over many hours, labouring to bring forward a report to parliament that, we thought, reflected the views of the community, of those people who went to the trouble of making a submission and appearing before the committee in the various hearings that we held not only in the major metropolitan cities of Australia but in some rural sectors as well.

         Indeed, after the government had responded to the report some 12 months after its presentation, the legislation was then introduced.

I participated in one in Melbourne and another one here in Canberra. As I said earlier when I talked about the grandparents—I am now a grandparent and I understand how people feel—I welcome the government's attempts to facilitate the views that have been put forward, not only by the people from Western Australia but also from others who have since jumped on the bandwagon of looking after grandparents and giving a better recognition to their rights within the family law area.

         This is indeed a welcome piece of legislation. I have some concerns about opposition comments on some aspects of the bill. The report that was put in and the recommendations that went with it, apart from two areas where Senator Spindler, on behalf of the Democrats, dissented, were unanimous. It is unfortunate to say that perhaps now there is a move away from some of those recommendations by sections of the opposition. I hope that that is not the case. I hope that the unanimity that was built through the development of the report is maintained in this legislation so that it can pass and be enacted.

         One of the key points I would like to make in this regard is that in a number of cases there is a large timelag between the receipt of the documents and their tabling. As all senators are aware, there are just two days during a sitting week when documents are tabled; that is, Tuesday and Wednesday. In the last three sitting weeks, there has been a fluctuating number of documents tabled. There does not appear to be a valid reason for this.

         But it needs to be pointed out that the government's privatisation agenda is creating a larger number of government agencies which are unfortunately not subject to scrutiny in the estimates committees. As a consequence, the only opportunity for senators to comment on these documents is when they are tabled in the Senate. I therefore urge the government to examine the procedures for tabling documents in order that the Senate maintain its proper right to scrutinise and comment on the activities of these departments and agencies.

I acknowledge and underline the point that Senator Margetts made, however, that the great bulk of these are annual reports, which can be dealt with in Senate estimates committees. I hope that that will be done.

         Nonetheless, it raises questions about whether it is  appropriate to limit the tabling of documents to two days during the week and whether there should not be a change in the arrangements so that these documents can be dealt with in a better way. I acknowledge that on Thursdays much more time is put aside for dealing with accumulated documents. But it is unfortunate that the parliament, as a result of this procedure, comes a bad second to the media in terms of the capacity to discuss the content of these annual reports. The media, for example, tomorrow will have the opportunity of dealing with 64 reports, if it gets the time. We have no chance of commenting on 64 reports. When there are definite tabling requirement times for annual reports of departments and agencies, clearly there is pressure on the Senate to deal with them. We have to make some other suitable arrangements to cope with this peak reporting time.

         Senator Margetts raised another matter. There is a requirement for an explanation about the delays in getting to the chamber reports that have been ready for more than a month. For example, 6 September is listed as the date on which document No. 5, the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation annual report, was submitted to the minister. It is now 24 October. Why on earth has it taken the minister that amount of time to table in this chamber this report, particularly when, as Senator Margetts has pointed out, there have been some days when there have been very few reports? Why was that one not presented to this chamber? I believe that the minister has an obligation to let us know. If he does not respond to this request, I will certainly—I am sure that Senator Margetts will join me—require a suitable explanation.

       <para first-indent="16">

         There are others with some delays. For example, I am intrigued to know why the Royal Australian Mint annual report for 1994-95, which was presented to the minister on 19 September, is only just now being tabled. I do not know why the Qantas 1994 equal opportunity annual report should be coming forward now. That was presented to the minister on 6 September. It is now 24 October.

         Another gap intrigues me. The Australian National University annual report was presented to the minister on 28 September. But it was apparently only received by the minister on 16 October. I do not know why that kind of delay would have taken place. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act annual report for 1994-95 was presented to the minister on 19 September. It is only just being tabled now. The Australian Institute of Family Studies is listed as being presented on 4 October. Why would it take 20 days for that to come before us?

         These matters are of some substance. There are others, such as the National Sound and Film Archive report, where this kind of requirement about the date for submission has not been met. There are several of them where there is simply no indication of when they were submitted. There is the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee annual report and the Clean Food Marketing Australia Ltd annual report. Several others in this list do not have this required information provided about when they were submitted to the minister.

        This is a quite critical report. I rise to speak on it, particularly because last Friday Senator Meg Lees and I, along with our Senate lead candidate in Victoria, Lyn Allison, launched what the Australian Democrats are calling a river rescue. This was launched at a research centre on the Murray River near Albury, where we were the guests of the various scientists involved. We learnt a lot about the problems facing Australia in terms of its rivers and especially the Murray-Darling Basin.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It was that visit that highlighted for me the importance of this report but, far beyond the report, the critical importance of taking action to rescue our rivers. If we do not, then we will be faced with an environmental disaster of—major proportions is not a sufficient description of the crisis we face, but it is the best I can think of at the moment.

         In launching this national environment initiative, the Democrats sought to highlight the threats to the country's vital river systems and to try to begin a process of detailing the solutions that would make a difference. We intend to do this over the next six months and to visit key places around Australia where there are problems with our river systems. In fact, almost all of our river systems have problems, but we intend to visit particularly the key centres and sites.

         The program that the Democrats are prepared to undertake is intended to help turn the tide against degradation of our waterways. We do not pretend that we can do that, but we do believe that, along with many other people of goodwill, political parties and other political figures, as well as scientists, who certainly are very concerned, together it is possible still to rescue our river systems. My colleague Senator Lees made this statement on Friday:

        We aim to identify both the positives and the negatives, to show where the gaps are and set out a plan of action that will make an immediate difference.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the positives, let me underline the positive contribution that scientists such as those that we met and talked to for some hours on Friday are making. I think what is lacking is not evidence, is not scientific research, is not the information to enable us to turn this problem around. What is really lacking is the political will. We intend to continue to press the government and the various agencies on this issue, particularly in respect of the Murray-Darling Basin. That is where the most obvious crises exist.

         Let me, however, underline some of the problems. Every day this nation produces 50,000 tonnes of sewage and it takes five billion litres of fresh drinkable water per day to dispose of it. That is one of the problems facing the Murray-Darling Basin—not the whole 50,000 tonnes of sewage, of course, but a proportion of it. Every Australian uses 2,000 litres of water a day at home and at work. A high percentage of this use is for irrigation, which again has been highlighted as one of the issues that has to be addressed, particularly terms of the Murray-Darling.

         I understand that land damage in the Murray-Darling Basin costs Australia $260 million a year in lost rural production. About 1.5 million hectares in the southern part of the basin are at risk from dry land salinity.

         Briefly, I want to say that there is a high level of cooperation between the states which are involved in this, and that that cooperation is essential for the future of this vital section of waterway. The problems that have emerged following the completion of the water audit as to what uses are to be made of the water according to the state governments involved, indicate that there is a huge demand for this water. As a result of that, the council, as the annual report says, has implemented an interim cap on further diversions of water while details of the permanent cap are to be resolved. Decisions on the permanent cap on water usage will be taken during the current financial year.

         The annual report also reveals that irrigation management strategy programs have commenced in Sunraysia and Shepparton, and work is proceeding to develop projects in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. As the report says, a vital and responsive irrigation industry will be fundamental to the basin's future. Other matters being examined include a wetlands strategy, vegetation management, a community advisory committee and, of course, communication and education. In fact, the report notes that 30,000 primary school children participated in the commission's writing project, jointly sponsored by the Primary English Teaching Association, in the commission's program of continuing to support school education with a focus on providing up-to-date natural resource information.

I should explain what I mean by that. The environment that we have on the Great Barrier Reef is unique in its scope. It is by far the largest living organism—I think that is one of the phrases that is used—in the world. But it is also a wonderful place in which to replicate a situation which is found in similar environments in the near Pacific. I refer to Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific.

         AIMS is a world-class research facility that has the potential to export knowledge. As the near Pacific becomes more and more developed and the pressures on the environment increase in neighbouring countries, it will become necessary for those people to come to us and say, `You have the expertise. Tell us how we can protect our environment.' That is important for these nations in protecting fishing resources, coral reefs and marine ecosystems as a whole. All of that work will be valuable to them one day.

         It will either be work for which they will be happy to pay or it will be expertise which we may choose to provide to them on an aid basis. That can only strengthen our position within the region. The work of AIMS should be considered in the broader context. I have always believed that there is enormous potential in North Queensland for regional development based on the export of services and expertise.

         To be honest, in certain parts of North Queensland we are never going to have large amounts of industry because of the geographical limitations that cities such as Cairns face. But North Queensland has certain advantages which cannot be replicated elsewhere in Australia. That is why the work of AIMS is important and why I believe that the government needs to have a long-term strategy to maximise the benefits of that research.

         The aid budget for this current year runs at something in the vicinity of $459 million to the near Pacific. When one considers that a large chunk of aid is over training, or is assistance in terms of managing the environment or particular problems that those countries have, AIMS could be a major source of assistance to that region. Instead of sending cash, we would have the opportunity to send expertise. I think honourable senators would well know this phrase: if you give somebody a fish you feed them for a day, but if you teach to fish you feed for life.

I pass by its door almost every day when I am working in the north because it is situated midway between where I live and my principal office in North Queensland. It is an organisation that is very well-regarded world wide, and it is something of which North Queenslanders are very proud. They have adopted it as their own.

         Apart from congratulating the institute on another good year, I want to mention a couple of other matters. I refer to the links that the institute has with industry and how it strives to ensure that its work is relevant to industry. There is a motive in that because the institute is at all times seeking additional funds. It does a tremendous job. It is very good to see that the institute and James Cook University in North Queensland work very closely together. They collaborate in a lot of their work and maximise the resources of both organisations.

         I want to mention the work that the institute is doing in the Fly River estuary as part of a major research project into mining activity in New Guinea. There has been a lot of concern about sediment in the estuary and the spread of river plumes and sediment into the Torres Strait and Australian waters. The data that the institute has used has been quite significant. The institute has received further recognition in the way of cohesive sediment dynamics. This sediment can be a major environmental problem for the Torres Strait area. I very much support the work that AIMS is doing to try and lessen the environmental problems that could be coming from the Ok Tedi mine. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

There has been a lack of critical examination of the first wave of changes in Western Australia.

         I will attempt to try to rectify that in coming weeks by providing some detailed experience of Western Australian workers under that legislation. I think it is important for this parliament to examine that experience because of the endorsement by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, of the first wave of IR legislation in Western Australia, his acceptance of the principles enunciated in that legislation and his comments that his federal legislation would be likely to pursue those same principles. When you compare the rhetoric with the reality of what is happening to Western Australian workers it is very informative.

         I want to refer to a workplace agreement that is in force between Linfoot Cleaning Services and a number of its cleaners who work at TAFE colleges in Western Australia. Those workers were previously under the Contract Cleaners (Ministry of Education) Award 1990, but as part of the government's drive for privatisation the contract was let to Linfoot Cleaning Services. As I understand it, they now employ some 60 to 80 cleaners under individual contracts, which I will be referring to tonight. The number of jobs have been severely reduced as a result of privatisation.

         I want to turn to the detail of the working conditions that now apply to those workers. The central issue I want to refer to is that the contracts classify all employees as casual even if they work up to 38 hours per week 52 weeks of the year. The Minimum Conditions of Employment Act provides that the only conditions that are applicable to casual workers employed under workplace agreements and defined as casual are the minimum wage rates and two days unpaid bereavement leave. They are not entitled to any other conditions laid down in the much vaunted Minimum Conditions of Employment Act.

         Employees who previously were employed full- or part-time are now defined as casual and have lost all the standard employment conditions such as paid sick leave, annual leave, compassionate leave and access to unpaid maternity leave. By merely classifying them as casuals, the major conditions that the Court government has held out as being protected by the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act do not apply. What we are seeing in Western Australia is a whole range of full-time and part-time permanent employees being classified as casuals to ensure that they do not gain the protections of the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act.

         This particular agreement provides for an ordinary hourly rate of $11.10 per hour. That compares with the old award rate for a casual of $12.42 and for a full-time cleaner of $10.35 per hour. While at first glance this differential may seem inconsequential, their take-home pays are significantly affected under the workplace agreement by provisions which restrict or eliminate other award payments. These provisions reduce the actual additional payment and the circumstances in which it will be paid.

It is interesting that Linfoot has been able to roster its work force to avoid any penalty payments at all under this particular workplace agreement. Penalty rates are significantly reduced under the workplace agreement—and I will refer to that shortly. For low income earners such as cleaners, penalty rates have traditionally made up a significant part of their incomes and take-home pay. Under the award, the hourly rate on a Saturday for an adult was $15.53 and for a casual it was $18.63. For a person employed under the workplace agreement at Linfoot the rate is $13.90.

If one is going to talk about people quaffing red wine, I note that that was a practice indulged in by members of the government about half an hour ago in their party room. I do not know if that qualifies them as donkeys, but certainly I do not think the Prime Minister is entitled to launch into the sort of attack he made on superannuation fund managers such as those at AMP without being subject to a bit of scrutiny as to why he made those comments.

         It is worthy of note that the event which precipitated Mr Keating's thoroughly irrational claims was the fact that the fund managers had finally had enough of the `leadership' that was being received by Coles Myer under the regime of Mr Solomon Lew. It is no secret that Mr Lew, Mr Kelty, who was not on the board, and Mr Fox, who is on the board, are all friends of Mr Keating. There is no reason to explain this intemperate attack other than the fact that the Prime Minister did not like the fact that the superannuation fund managers required a bit of financial and business propriety from the people who were running Coles Myer.

In Coles Myer there could be no doubt that there were real concerns about the standard of corporate governance in that company.

If my wife and I choose to do that—we certainly wouldn't do it, although Jackie might encourage me—it is nobody else's business.

          I have to declare an interest in this. I have enjoyed the hospitality of the Governor-General at Government House. There is genuinely a much more egalitarian approach adopted by Mr Hayden and Dallas Hayden at Government House than there may have been in the past. There is still a requirement for a level of dignity to be maintained. I have no problem whatsoever with the manner in which he has undertaken his duties. I commend him for it. I regret that there was this kind of publicity towards the end of what has been a very successful term as Governor-General in difficult circumstances.

         The reason that is of some concern to me is that I understand the company is the Indonesia-Australia Scientific Consortium and that it is effectively owned by a Mr Laurens Fluitman. The reason that causes me concern is that I raised in, I think, August of last year—well over a year ago—the extraordinary contract that Mr Fluitman had with the Department of Defence, which has now been referred to the Australian Federal Police, as the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) indicated in estimates hearings earlier this year.

          There are several things that concern me about this. Firstly, I can find no evidence of any contract or any arrangements with the Indonesia-Australia Scientific Consortium in the latest report of AusAID,

           Business participation in AusAID's aid programs 1994-95

          I also am concerned that Mr Fluitman had also, I understood, put in an application relating to the Development Import Finance Facility-Export Finance and Insurance Corporation mixed credit scheme. I do not know to what extent this application has been rejected or what state it is in.

          My concern stems from the fact that the matters I raised about Mr Fluitman were on the public record as of August last year. I am just wondering whether there is any effective mechanism by which one Australian agency which is concerned about various matters fully advises other Australian agencies of that concern. For example, I am aware of the fact, because I read it in the newspaper, that the Department of Defence ignored warnings by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service not to pay Mr Fluitman's company the money involved in its contract to obtain sensitive information about Indonesia's defence industry. Once again it is the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

I do hope that more notice is taken by government agencies of things like ASIS reports saying, `Don't do it'.

        (6) Nine of the Royal Australian Air Force establishments listed in question on notice No.2211 were above their required peacetime establishments because of transient surplus workforce pools that have resulted from a number of Government and Australian Defence Force initiatives. At the forefront of these initiatives have been the Force Structure Review, which included multi-skilling and civilianisation programs, and the ongoing Commercial Support Program.

Both initiatives have inherent time delays in achieving a fully proficient restructured workforce. As the surplus workforce can be gain

        The surplus workforce pools are expected to be brought into balance within the next twelve months via natural attrition. As such, a forced separation program to deal with the surplus workforce pool is not justified.

There is no longer a requirement to record travel expenditure by mode of transport and, accordingly, Defence restructured its Chart of Accounts in 1994-95 to better reflect current resource management requirements and reporting.
